0,1771642483,http://goodreads.com/user/show/632247-chrissie,2,"I do recommend reading this book, even though I have given it only two stars! Remember two stars is a book that is OK! Read it for the new and interesting information it contains. The book reports up-to-date information about the complex, symbiotic networks underlying communication between trees. It stresses that trees should be seen not as separate entities but rather as parts of a community where individuals are aware of their neighbors, relate to them, communicate with them and help each other survive. Absorbing information about particular tree species, plants, fungi, insects and birds is provided. Anyone who appreciates nature, anyone who quite simply enjoys a walk in the woods, will find tidbits of interest. So what was wrong?The writing all too often lacks clarity. Ecological and natural processes were not clearly explained. I would follow an argument and not understand why a particular conclusion was drawn. I would see other alternative explanations. One example is the discussion of the respective amounts of CO² stored by young respective old trees. We are told that plants of the same species living in the same soil and under the same conditions do not act in the same manner. An example is given of three oaks that dropped their leaves at different times. What we are told is that this was an “individual choice, a question of character.” Ah huh……..no more explanation than that?! Later in the book it is said that plants of the same species often have widely different genetic composition. (It is interesting to note that the variation is much more limited in animals.) Anyhow, this must be the explanation but this is just my guess. It should have been explained more clearly. Conclusions drawn should more often have been backed up with reference to particular scientific studies.The writing reeks of anthropomorphic expressions. This became extremely annoying. It made the entire content of the book feel childish. Yet this is not a book for children; previous knowledge of plant processes is a prerequisite. I will give some examples. Beech trees are referred to as Beech & Co., Spruce as Spruce & Co. Perhaps this is amusing once, but not ten times. “Ouch” is interspersed frequently - when discussing a lesion in bark, the loss of a tree limb, a hit by lightning or any damage done to a tree. The upper branches of trees are called “the executive offices”. “Foolish trees” are said to have not obeyed the “tree etiquette manual”. A volcanic eruption is “the shuffling of cards in the game of life.” We read sentences such as, “If we think back to tree kindergarten……” Maybe it is me, but this type of writing switches the book from being a scientific book of merit to a book of farce. This is a shame. Let me repeat, the book has valuable content. The content is poorly organized. Similar information is repeated in different chapters. The chapters are exceedingly short with ambiguous titles. Here are examples of titles: Let There Be Light, Street Kids, Burnout andDestination North. On completing a chapter you are left wondering what exactly had been the point of the chapter! What was its message? While there is definitely interesting information it is hard to absorb due to it being poorly organized.Beside the main themes, what miscellaneous information caught my attention? How woodpeckers make their homes in trees, working on several at the same time and in conjunction with fungi. The parasitic plant mistletoe can kill a tree, but moss and algae aren’t usually dangerous. It is normal that you don’t hear lots of birdsong in forests. The value of and conditions found in “old growth forests” were interesting, as well as how long it takes to establish such forests and how they differ from commercial forests. Leaving fallen trees is important - they make it harder for herbivore to consume undergrowth and they are home to a multitude of beneficial insects. This is just a smattering of assorted information. Each person reading the book will find different points of interest. I don’t regret reading the book, but its organization, and the author’s way of expressing himself could certainly have been improved.  The audiobook narration by Mike Grady was clear and easy to follow. The German words are accurately pronounced. The author is a German forestry manager, writing on ecological themes. The book closes with a note by Susanne Simard. She is a forest ecologist. She has worked more than thirty years in the field and is currently doing scientific studies such as those discussed in the book. She is at the University of British Colombia in Canada. Her research confirms most of Wohlleben's observations about the communication among trees."

The first time I fell hard for a tree was in the Sequoia National Forest standing at the base of General Sherman. I was always a treehugger in my head but at that moment I was literally a treehugger. If you’ve never gazed up at one of the giants you are missing out on one of the earth’s wonders. [I don’t know these people but it was wiser to post their picture than mine because it’s not legal to step over that barrier and get so up close and personal—though after reading this book I’m wondering how the General felt about it. We’re talking a Jack and the Beanstalk moment here.]Back in the hippie days I knew people who talked to their plants, played classical music for them, and claimed there was a silent scream while trimming them back. Apparently these same compassionate people suffered no remorse when they smoked them, nor did I, but I digress so let’s move on.So I couldn’t resist reading this after watching a fascinating PBS program called What Plants Talk About. Who knew there really is a “wood wide web” in which trees, shrubs, and grasses exchange information. My hippie friends apparently did—it wasn’t the THC after all!I’m wondering if I should re-shelve Shel Silverstein’s book to the non-fiction section. I know, I’ve told you nothing about the book because of these flashbacks but isn’t it wonderful when books mess with your head? If you love the natural world there really is some compelling information within and it was easy to digest a few chapters at a time. The sometimes anthropomorphic language may bother the non-treehuggers but it’s understandable that the author did his best to make it accessible for those who might be botany-challenged. The writing style is sometimes repetitive and simplistic and much of this is pure ecology. He champions old growth forests (dear to my heart) and throws in interesting tidbits like scientific discovery of the improvement in women’s blood pressure, lung capacity, and arterial elasticity while walking in the forest versus excursions into town. His book claimed I would never see trees the same again and that is truth. But even before I read this I've always talked to mine when they blossom and later caress the globes of fruit ripening in the sun. I tell them how beautiful they are and darned if they don’t give me peaches, nectarines, and plums to die for every year. I also voted to legalize marijuana which no longer interests me because of W.I.N.E. Those grapes are a gift and harvesting doesn’t hurt the vines, i.e., no silent screams—win(e) win(e)."

3,1771642483,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9889835-matthias,5,"As humans, daft creatures that we are, we are predisposed to look at where the action is. Swift movements, loud noises and bright colours capture our attention. Maybe this stems from our primitive instinct for survival, allowing us to spot the dangers darting in our general direction. Or it could be the result of our desire to procreate that can't make us look past flaunted flesh and luscious lips. Whatever the reasons, at some point we have begun to think in terms of foreground and background. The former is where the action is, the latter a necessary formality because the void would be too depressing an environment.During short lapses of my otherwise well-founded modesty I like to think of myself as something other than an utter idiot. In doing so I tend to refer to my habits of reading, writing, cogitating and looking at backgrounds. It's one of the ways to make scrolling through tedious travel pictures slightly more interesting. If a movie's dialogue doesn't ignite my interest, I find enjoyment in looking at the B-actors located in the background of the scene, pretending to go about their daily business, assuming they will remain unseen unless for when they'll point themselves out to friends and family. My smartphone camera comes with a focus that easily jumps in between the different layers of the hubbub I point it towards, making the scenery rich with potential for anecdote and diminishing the borders between foreground and background to a triviality. As someone who appreciates all that I allowed myself to think I was more than just a casual observer.A dreamy bubble that is now duly burst. One of the many things that Peter Wohlleben's book has taught me is that a lot of phenomena escape my flittering attention as I skip and skedaddle through life. The trees are such a phenomenon. A majestic backdrop to many of my sweetest memories, yet never given the notice they were due.Our world is full of magical places. These can be found on the ocean's vigorous waves, on a tranquil mountain top or in a lover's embrace. One other such place is under the canopy of trees. In their mystic shade of earthy green some people reach enlightenment, others find fundamental scientific truths and many discover peace. Troubled heads are cleared as they rest on ancient trunks and laden hearts are lightened by the sound of rustling leaves. Why are we not in constant awe for these beings of wonder that should be worthy of worship? People now will often mock that notion, hacking and slashing their way to prosperity with no regard for the beings that have been here millions of years. Or to recall the way Treebeard put it very emphatically when talking about Orks:""They come with fire. They come with axes. Gnawing, biting, breaking hacking burning. Destroyers and usurpers, curse them!""Wohlleben's book The Hidden Life of Trees worked the same way for me as the focus changer does for my camera. This book inaugurated a new sensibility that feels purposeful and asks to be deeply understood. The way I looked at the world and the way I looked at my memories had been tainted by a particular and exclusive interest for human affairs. Wohlleben put the splendour of trees in a sharp and welcome focus, opening my eyes as they welled up with remorseful tears. My perspective changed, and now an everyday city scenery has become a concrete concentration camp for trees forced to live in isolation, cut off from their potential and cut down to serve cityscaping needs. One redeeming factor is of course the knowledge that trees don't feel. How sweetly we sleep in the comfort of that intuition. Unfortunately, Wohlleben puts some question marks next to that soothing notion. This author's narration couldn't have been more convincing and captivating and the fact that I automatically read it with David Attenborough's voice in mind can serve to stress that point. The trees become both actors and center stage in this epic tale of survival against all odds. Their struggle for an inner balance as they grow, mend their wounds, spread their roots and branches, drop their leaves, drink the water and capture the sunlight makes for a truly engaging read. The race between a fungus eating its way to the heartwood and a tree growing healthy bark and moist material to stop the enemy in its tracks is more thrilling than a car chase, despite the impression that the timescale on which trees live make such matters less pressing. Yet they are pressing, and a matter of life and death. A tree can spend hundreds of years on its death bed but still serve a purpose, procreate and provide energy for its siblings and offspring. And when reading about this struggle for survival and growth, I could not help but discern a will for life that stirred within these entities. It's not just the trees that are the protagonists of this book, but also the tiny creatures that live on and around them. I've mentioned the fungi with which they have a love-hate relationship. Trees are also in what one might call a complicated relationship with small rodents, birds and insects, who sometimes help them in the dissemination of their seeds but can also wound them fatally. When caterpillars attack, reinforcements are called in with aromatic signals to deal with them. Ants are running their own brand of livestock farms as they herd aphids for the sugarry residues they leave behind when they feed off the leaves. The book is chock-full of such anecdotes that show us how trees are in fact megacities teeming with life.The biggest reveal came quite early in this book: trees communicate. As an introvert I didn't find that piece of information especially salient, but it does show that more goes on in the deep forests than a mere survival of the fittest. Trees often work together as a community, protecting and supporting each other, sending each other signals and goods. They use a ""wood wide web"" of roots and fungal chords that allow the transportation of nutrients from one tree to the other. They produce scents that get picked up by their cousins urging them to put up protective barriers before the enemy arrives. At the start of this book I had some severe difficulties accepting that the author would bestow certain qualities on trees that they couldn't possibly have, such as the capacity to feel, know, remember and be happy. Even after reading the book I have to admit this sometimes feels like a stretch, but that's really not the message one should remember from this review. The fact of the matter is that we don't know how far the sentience of these beings reaches. The latest scientific observations at least hint at the possibility that this author, which some might consider little more than a romantic treehugger, could be on to something. Even if trees don't feel like how we do, the realisation that trees are the hands that have been feeding us for many years should at least be a lesson in humility and inspire us to stop gnawing at them. Trees don't only provide us with the oxygen we breathe but serve many other vital purposes enumerated in this book, ranging from biodiversity to inland water supply. It's not just a matter of cutting down old trees and planting new ones, either. Balance is key, and such a balance can only occur on a timescale we can hardly grasp. The trees that provided the pages for this book are the prophets of their kind, emissaries of a lifeform we've been neglecting. So don't feel guilty about getting a hard copy. Pick one up, go sit under a tree if you can still find one, read it and look up to a new world."

He captures the imagination and translates his vision well. Like many science books for the masses he takes a good deal of information and distills it well for the amateur forester and part-time tree-hugger. The only reason I give this book four stars and not five is because his biggest strength is also, perhaps, his biggest (or most important) weakness. I worry about the anthropomorphizing of animals, fungus, or plant. It is a strength because it creates empathy. It works. I read that a tree might feel pain, communicates, nutures its young, takes care of the sick, works together, counts, etc., and I am (hopefully, if I have any empathy in me) feel a bit more hesitant to abuse or misuse trees. BUT, my concern with this type of treatment is two fold: 1) trees aren't human. By focusing on the parts of trees (or forests) that appear to have human traits, we are putting ourselves at the center. We are creating (or strengthening the notion rather) that WE are the freaking center of the living universe. Those trees they are important because they LOOK/ACT like us. It is a slippery slope. Do the benefits outweigh the costs in the short or long term? I don't know. I just know there is a danger here. 2) perhaps, by giving these behaviors (communication, counting, etc) words that have a very significant meaning for man, we are actually NOT communicating what they are doing that is unique. Maybe communication or counting or nurturing ISN'T what they are doing and these human behavior metaphors are not allowing these amazing trees to be viewed as amazing AND alien enough. This isn't the same, but it for me is similar to comparing fungi to plants. Yes, there might be similarities, but these are two completely separate kingdoms. Sometimes, we can mix them together (in a salad perhaps), but some metaphors don't do justice to just how funky and beautiful and DIFFERENT these kingdoms really are. Perhaps, by making trees seem more human we are doing a long-term disservice by NOT making them seem alien enough.And, perhap, I'm just wrong. I'm willing to accept that too. Oh, and this is just Part I of Wohlleben's 'The Mysteries of Nature trilogy'. The follow-up books are:2.

5,1771642483,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2986010-francisco,5,"You can read this for the science or, like me, for how it helped me see. We are always in need of books that part the curtains of the familiar, the stuff we walk around and take for granted. In this case trees, all around us, the beings who help us breathe. It turns out they compete and cooperate and communicate, they form alliances and have processes that we are hard call to name so we must resort to words like grief and love. If you are non-scientific like me, or even if you are, you will be thankful for the seeing. You will see better. It will start with trees - you'll notice the wrinkles in their bark, the wounds made by woodpeckers who cleansed them of insects but not without pain. You will notice how a pear tree curved sideways to give more light to the cherry tree, which a clumsy gardener planted too close together. What you will see is life, all around you. You will be startled with how much life there is and maybe even be amazed at your own spark, a tiny but real part of the whole. I also liked entering into a different time consciousness- the time that trees inhabit. If you were an oak and not in danger of being cut down you'd be looking forward to finally being a toddler a hundred years from now, a teenager without parental restraints in a mere two hundred. Each year a miniature life with deaths and births. It is okay to go slow. This year I'll grow a half an inch. But oh, how good it is to feel being alive and to make little more life for others."
6,1771642483,http://goodreads.com/user/show/155663-david,5,"Peter Wohlleben has written a wonderful little book about trees. He is a forester; he manages a forest in Germany. He must do a wonderful job, as he has amazing insights into the life of trees and tree society.Did I say society? Yes, trees communicate with each other, nurture their young, and aid the ill when disease or distress strikes. Does this sound unlikely? Well, it sounded a bit over-the-top to me, until I started reading this book. Forests are superorganisms that exchange nutrients through inter-connected root systems. They are a bit analogous to ant colonies. Wohlleben cites evidence of a 400 year-old beech tree that was actually being kept alive by neighboring beech trees!Acacia trees warn other nearby trees of giraffes who are feeding on them. As a result, the pre-warned trees pump toxic substances into their leaves within a period of a few minutes, causing the giraffes to leave the area. The giraffes walked 100 yards away, bypassing nearby trees before continuing to feed. They chewed on trees that were either oblivious to the warnings, or they walked upwind. These warnings are sent using electrical impulses that travel 1/3rd of an inch per second. These impulses are propagated along filaments of fungi.When trees sense insects eating their leaves, the trees can classify their saliva. Then they release pheromones that summon specific insect predators. So, it seems that trees actually have a sense of taste.I learned how older, mature trees nurture their young. Their enormous canopies shut out most of the light from the shorter trees, preventing the young ones from growing too fast. This enables the young trees to grow strong, dense wood that will eventually, in a hundred or two hundred years, to grow big and strong themselves. However, in forests that are overly managed, some of the bigger trees are culled, allowing the smaller trees to grow too fast. Then they never reach their potential height as they age.I learned why conifer trees grow needles and are ""evergreen"", while deciduous trees shed their leaves each fall. It would almost seem like conifers are ""smart"", as they do not waste energy growing new leaves each spring. But there is a reason for all this. Evergreens grow needles that are shed only once every few years. Each fall the needles develop a waxy covering that impedes evaporation over the winter. The needles have very little surface area for catching the wind and snow. Deciduous leaves, however, do catch the wind, and are a handicap during storms and snowfalls. They are dropped in the fall to prevent the trees from bending and breaking in a big wind-storm or under a heavy layer of snow.This book was originally written in German and translated into English; the translation is excellent. The book is not only informative, but is fun to read. Wohlleben makes analogies between trees and animals, and these analogies help shed insight into the slow, ancient life of trees. The book is not written in a humorous tone; it is written in a wonderful down-to-earth style. Although Wohlleben is not a scientist, he discusses the latest research and it is a joy to learn about his points of view."

They have incredible social networks, share food, rear children, and care for the ill. Yes, there's some anthropomorphization here, but still...When evolution has figured out how to tell time and talk to one another, you wish the trees could also talk to us and tell their stories.

8,1771642483,http://goodreads.com/user/show/33771-tony,4,"My father’s father was a legendary grafter of trees. So I was told. He died a few years before I sprouted so I never knew him. But my father, who had a sense of wonder at the way things worked, learned the art; and so, I was able to see a peach tree that had one branch full of plums; and he grafted a white dogwood to a pink one. No reason. Just to show he could. This technique, like many mechanical things, was not passed on to the next generation.----- ----- ----- ----- ----- -----Dr. Suzanne Simard, who helped discover the maternal instincts in trees, describes mother trees as dominant trees widely linked to other trees in the forest through their fungal-root connections. These trees pass their legacy on to the next generation and exert their influence in the upbringing of the youngsters. “My” small beech trees, which have by now been waiting for at least eighty years, are standing under the mother trees that are about two hundred years old – the equivalent of forty-year-olds in human terms. The stunted trees can probably expect another two hundred years of twiddling their thumbs before it is finally their turn. The wait time is, however, made bearable. Their mothers are in contact with them through their root systems, and they pass along sugar and other nutrients. You might even say they are nursing their babies.----- ----- ----- ----- ----- -----My father, the occasional grafter, decided to get a mimosa tree. This was odd because I grew up in a place not known for its ornamentals. The houses were just a few feet apart and backyards tended to be repositories for rusting junk, chained dogs and old tires. It was not a sweet-smelling place. But our backyard had a mimosa tree as a centerpiece. Which was pretty cool for a pre-adolescent boy, because you could do this:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zDzNe...Eventually, the mimosa got sick and died. A life lesson. It was removed. It was then my father decided he would like to grow figs.----- ----- ----- ----- ----- ----Mimosas are tropical creeping herbs. They make particularly good research subjects, because it is easy to get them a bit riled up and they are easier to study in the laboratory than trees are. When they are touched, they close their feathery little leaves to protect themselves. Gagliano designed an experiment where individual drops of water fell on the plants’ foliage at regular intervals. At first, the anxious leaves closed immediately, but after a while, the little plants learned there was no danger of damage from the water droplets. After that, the leaves remained open despite the drops. Even more surprising for Gagliano was the fact that the mimosas could remember and apply their lesson weeks later, even without further tests.----- ----- ----- ----- ----- -----I love trees, but I can not cut a 7-iron: ----- ----- ----- ----- ----- -----A marine chemist at the Hokkaido University discovered that leaves falling into streams and rivers leach acids into the ocean that stimulate the growth of plankton, the first and most important building block in the food chain. More fish because of the forest? The researcher encouraged the planting of more trees in coastal areas, which did, in fact, lead to higher yields for fisheries and oyster growers.----- ----- ----- ----- ----- -----Once upon a time, when I still worked, some no-goodnik lumber company decided to play fast and loose with the language in some ancient deeds and snuck onto a portion of the Allegheny National Forest – or as much as you can sneak while operating very large excavating machinery – and helped themselves to a heaping harvest of very tall, very old timber. It became my responsibility to see what could be done about that. This was very different from my usual assignments, and I’ve always liked different. The deeds went back to William Penn and were a twisted tale of courses and metes and bounds. As part of the investigation, I was invited into the forest. It was early May. The guy from the Department of Natural Resources said it was an active time for timber rattlesnakes so be sure to wear high boots. You know, having fun with city slickers. But, oh, my boots are well-traveled and the investigator who came with me was a seasoned hunter. There was one more person to complete our foursome: a forester. It is the forester that I want to talk about.The forester looked very much like the character actor, Richard Farnsworth:Only with a beaten-up old ball cap from some feed company on his head. Kindly, yet not smiling, his face was worn and his eyes – HIS EYES – were sad, yet hopeful. Which is hard to do. He would not know how to lie.We trudged through the woods to where the loss and damage was. For you can’t remove large trees from the forest with heavy equipment without nicking other trees. The forester showed us the slashes to the trunks and then, explaining how the injury would eventually kill the tree, he circled the circumference with his arms. He was a different kind of tree hugger.The tour done, we repaired to a truck stop for lunch. Big-boy, buffet style. We piled our plates except for the forester, who took only a vegetable or two, citing a troublesome stomach, something chronic. The other two fellows were talkers, and they were trying to top each other with one wild anecdote after the other. The forester said nothing, but was looking at me, I guess trying to get my measure.The other two guys went back to the buffet, I thought maybe to set some kind of record. The forester and I continued to sit across the table from one another. He kept looking at me even though we didn’t speak. It dawned on me that he was from the forest and I was not. But surely there is a common ground. And after many minutes, his eyes never leaving mine, he swallowed, and said, “You full-leaf down there yet?” And I looked him square and replied, “Everything but the oaks.” And he paused, ever so slightly, and then gave me just the slightest hint of a nod. And it was as if I had passed some test, some test that meant more than all the tests academia and suits and skirts could ever devise. And I will remember that conversation until the day I die."
9,1771642483,http://goodreads.com/user/show/106692-cheri,4,"“We read in fairy tales of trees with human faces, trees that can talk, and sometimes walk. This enchanted forest is the kind of place, I feel sure, that Peter Wohlleben inhabits. His deep understanding of the lives of trees, reached through decades of careful observation and study, reveals a world so astonishing that if you read his book, I believe that forests will become magical places for you, too.”
”The electrical impulses that pass through the roots of trees, for example, move at the slow rate of one third of an inch per second.” 
Translated from the German version, which was published in 2015, Wohlleben shares with the reader the “secrets” that foresters have known for a while. Trees live in, have, a relationship with the trees around them beyond the fact that they are trees in the same location. They retain memories that help them through the seasons (not to catalog the wrongs done to them), they have a sense of taste, smell, ‘hearing’ … just not exactly like we do.Many years ago, the first time I went to Maui, when I was in Lahaina I was fascinated with the Banyan trees, their interconnected root system, and their unique appearance. When I first heard about this book, I thought of those trees and I knew I wanted to read it. This isn’t overly heavy in the scientific aspect of trees, some sections flow with a lightness and ease that most people can easily relate to, and other sections get into a deeper peek, but overall this is a relatively undemanding read. If anything, it does require that you set aside everything you’ve ever believed about trees. The truth lies somewhere between chopping down a forest and believing that doesn’t hurt anything and that an aggravated apple tree can throw apples at you if you pick apples without politely asking, first. 
”When you know that trees experience pain and have memories and that tree parents live together with their children, then you can no longer just chop them down and disrupt their lives with large machines.”
One would hope that would be true.Trees have memories, they have a sense of taste, and smell, they can feel, and through means other than eyes and ears, they can see and hear. 
”The saliva of each species is different, and trees can math the saliva to the insect. Indeed, the match can be so precise that trees can release pheromones that summon specific beneficial predators.”

”For if they can identify saliva, they must also have a sense of taste.”
There is a bit of humour in this, and knowledge to be gained - this is research-based information, but it’s also not a book about the science of the study of trees, it’s more along the lines of someone who is so enthusiastic about what he’s telling you that sometimes, every once in a while, he might digress a bit, and lose some readers for a few minutes. Overall, I found this to be fascinating, if not exactly everyone’s cup of tea. I kinda loved this. I learned a lot that is easily retainable, and know where to look for the answers. I loved the author’s gushingly boyish tree-crush-ing, but really, who can blame him for his enthusiasm? This was a charmingly enchanting read which benefitted by Wohlleben’s charisma and enthusiasm for the topic. ""We lived on a street where the tall elm shadeWas as green as the grass and as cool as a bladeThat you held in your teeth as we lay on our backsStaring up at the blue and the blue stared back""	-- Only a Dream / lyrics & song Mary Chapin CarpenterThe house I grew up in had woods to one side as far as you could see, and woods behind as far as you could see. A few houses on our street, more streets in our neighborhood, with one lake and trees that surrounded the neighborhood. When I’ve been back there, it all pretty much looks the same. The tree that I climbed so high that I couldn’t get down by myself still stands there, the initials of almost every boy or girl carved into it with a + and another set of initials is now so high up on the tree I can’t see it.

10,1771642483,http://goodreads.com/user/show/22699228-matthew-quann,2,"If you've ever pondered the thought experiment in which a tree falls in an empty forest and the sound of its fall is in limbo, Peter Wohlleben's nonfiction might be for you. Quite simply, the sound would be heard, according to Wohlleben, because trees are able to interpret sound and communicate with one another. Not only that, Wohlleben attributes memory and thought to the stationary beings which most of us have long considered non-sentient. This is a book full of revelations about trees and asks the reader (or in my case, listener) to reevaluate their understanding of the woody sentinels. The Hidden Life of Trees is a scientific book that attempts to broaden long held perception and enrich our interactions with forest. It is also a book that manages to talk about trees for much longer than you would have ever thought possible.Despite my score, this is a good book. It seems well researched, Wohlleben is obviously interested and excited about his field, and it brought to me knowledge I didn't have prior to listening to it. But...trees just aren't my thing. This brought me back to first year biology classes where a month or more was spent elucidating the inner workings of plants. It was one of those fields, of which there were many more to follow, that was nice to know about, but never piqued my interest like the fields of human physiology, biochemistry, and microbiology. So, even though I was pleased with some of the knowledge I took from this book, I can't say that I was really gripped by it. As I took another long commute, I found myself easily losing the thread of the narration when Wohlleben waxed lyrical about a particular species of tree. In short, I spent a lot of time bored with this book. When a novel fact was introduced to me, I thought, Hey, that's kind of neat, and then drifted back into relative boredom. But, there's a pretty good chance that another reader would really be into this one! I mean, just because I don't love learning about trees doesn't mean that you won't find a lot to like here. Certainly, when I take a walk in the woods later today I'll be thinking about how trees have a lot more going on than I would have thought a week ago. With that said, Wohlleben posits morale considerations for trees that I wasn't entirely able to buy by the end of the book. So: if you are really interested in learning more about trees, I'd say go for it! If you're more like me, then I'd probably pass on this one.Thanks to Anne Collini for this recommendation which I appreciate in spite of having not loved the book!"
11,1771642483,http://goodreads.com/user/show/53209373-simon-clark,2,"I really, really wanted to like this book. Ever since I can remember I've felt at home in the woods, with trees exuding a reassuring aura of safety. Woods are calm, quiet, clement places for me. Yet despite this affiliation I know next to nothing about trees, so it was a delight to have this book recommended to me.Unfortunately that's roughly when the delight stopped. Perhaps I am the wrong person to review this book, as I've been used to scientific literature in entirely different - and more continuous - forms, but I found this book immensely frustrating to read. Wohlleben acts as an impish, endlessly curious guide to his forests (being a forester rather than an academic), and his genuine glee in discussing his charges is infectious. You get the sense that he attributes very real personalities to the species in his forests, and considers his interactions with the trees almost like interactions with colleagues or even friends. This much I very enjoyed a great deal.What was so frustrating that I abandoned the book before the end was the form his enthusiasm was communicated in. Wohlleben is like an old man in the pub, very eager to tell you about his particular area of interest, but does so in short anecdotes - little factoids that he thinks are cool. And they are! But they always leave you wanting more. Each chapter is frustratingly short, just developing a subject enough in a hand-wavy way before moving on to another. The book gives you intellectual whiplash with constant stops and starts.This is a fascinating, paradigm-shifting subject. But oh boy is this not the way it should be communicated."
12,1771642483,http://goodreads.com/user/show/50966750-da-al,5,"Fascinating info on how trees are a billion times more amazing than I imagined, swoon-worthy prose, fantastic audiobook performer!"

But, it makes me happy. I enjoy the thought of my tree roots connecting with other roots. And so it goes! I touch my tree's when I'm tired and lonesome. I feel they give me strength! Again. Do they? Doubtful, but damn...doesn't it make me feel better!😍💗🐾"
14,1771642483,http://goodreads.com/user/show/68030-jenny-reading-envy,4,"I was inspired to read this book after reading The Overstory by Richard Powers, to learn more about the science of trees. Included are how trees communicate, migration patterns, how and why trees hibernate, their place in ecosystems and more. Wohlleben manages a forest in Germany and directly addresses some of the misinformation he learned in forestry classes.The tone of the book and its translation is very popular in tone, which made me question the science, but he does seem to cite a lot of literature. Wohlleben summarizes a lot of the research since the 1997 article in Nature about mycorrhizal fungal networks by Suzanne Simard and others. (She writes the afterword in this book,which I interpret as scientific endorsement.) So most of it isn't his work, but has informed his work. "
15,1771642483,http://goodreads.com/user/show/48483884-michael-finocchiaro,5,"Peter Wohlleben loves trees and wants us to love them too. I read this book because I wanted, in my quest of reading Pulitzer's, to more fully appreciate The Overstory and I knew this was a good way to get immersed. The Hidden Life of Trees: What They Feel, How They Communicate – Discoveries from a Secret World is a beautiful book about how trees communicate, what makes them unique in nature, and how man has impacted their development, their lifestyles and their evolution. Now, the idea of trees ""talking"" will perhaps have some skeptics rolling their eyes, but the author makes a good case for how this is done via electrical impulses, chemical emissions from leaves, transmission of messages via fungi, etc. His passion for the subject is palpable: ""Personally, I think the swirling cocktail of tree talk is the reason we enjoy being out in the forest so much. At least when we are out in undisturbed forests. Walkers who visit one of the ancient deciduous preserves in the forest I manage (in Germany) always report that their heart feels lighter and they feel right at home."" (p. 223). He demonstrates that, in fact, there are no forests in Europe which are older than the 1600s due to the massive deforestation during the Middle Ages and to the end of the Renaissance when the population exploded and forests were converted into farmland to support the increasing demand for food and building materials.What makes his study so fascinating is in how trees are so closely interlocked with other seemingly unrelated pieces of ecology: ""Katsuhido Matsunaga, a marine chemist at the Hokkaido University, discovered that leaves falling into streams and rivers leak acids into the ocean that stimulate the growth of plankton, the first and most important building blocks in the food chain. More fish because of the forest? The researched encouraged the planting of more trees in coastal areas, which did, in fact, lead to higher yields for fisheries and oyster growers."" (p. 245)Wohelleben's greatest argument is for preserving forests for many reasons. One of which is soil preservation. In areas where trees have been planted over previously cultivated land (even if the farming was centuries before), a square mile of forest can lose 290 tons of soil due to rainstorms as opposed to only 1 to 14 tons in an undisturbed forest. (p. 87) And less soil, means less nutrition and fewer trees. And in the lost soil, ""There are more life forms in a handful of forest soil than there are people on the planet."" (p. 86). These include micro-organisms, fungi, and bacteria - an immense diversity. And speaking of diversity, he also mentions a study from 2009, when a researcher Dr Martin Gossner sprayed a 600 year-0ld, 51m tall tree with an insecticide and found ""2041 animals belonging to 257 different species"" (p. 132). I have an aunt in Kentucky who made me aware of the horrible emerald ash borer and how all the ashes on her ranch (and indeed all the ashes in the eastern US) are being destroyed - this crisis having started in 2002 following the unintended introduction of the insect on wooden pallets from a Chinese importer (see the beautifully illustrated article here. Wohlleben mentions a similar crisis, but due to a fungal virus, that destroyed Britain's ash trees. I wonder why nature suddenly decided it was time to try to eliminate the beautiful ash trees...I truly loved reading this book and hope to share more time in the forest with my kids so that they can appreciate how important it is to preserve this critical piece of our ecological heritage. And, maybe I will convince my daughter of how sad it is for the conifer forest to have an amputated tree in our living room every Christmas when, in fact, this tree (now dying alone) would want to be back home with its familiars. I learned an enormous amount of things about tree habitats and characteristics and feel that I need to reread this book regularly to keep all the facts straight. And I need to finish the amazing The Overstory!"
16,1771642483,http://goodreads.com/user/show/78485297-mario-the-lone-bookwolf,4,"Maybe the tree huggers are right.Please note that I put the original German text at the end of this review. Just if you might be interested.The communication network of plants and especially trees is highly sophisticated. Solitary or only annual growing plants do not approach the complexity of the papermaking base stock. Due to their root system and their size, trees are predestined for a key position. They communicate with each other via fragrances and warn each other of pests. This causes the warned to produce chemical substances for defense. If a human deforestation team is approaching, that is lost love effort.The interaction with the fungi, microorganisms, insects, and birds is a balanced system. Always a little bit in the balance between symbiosis, parasitism and the struggle for life and death. The shedding of the foliage or the constant needling promotes the formation of a favorite microflora in the soil for each plant. The wood wide web helps with communication. Forests are like multi-layered cities, in which, as in human metropolises above and below the earth, complex interwoven processes take place. Superorganisms in which the engine of evolution runs at full speed.Not everything is just sunshine for photosynthesis. It is also about disputing your competitors' living space. However, under the same species, there is the formation of communities of interest that balance the ecosystem. The monocultures of spruces, oil palms, tropical fruits, etc., have none of the positive characteristics such as biodiversity and suitable communication networks. There are more uniform deserts where only a few insects and animals can live. An ever-smaller gene pool of a few genetically engineered plants carries the risk of food crises when new pests emerge.Plants that fuse with state-building insects are taking a more extreme route of specialization. They make the ants dependent on their nectar and mix in a secret ingredient. This will make the ants biochemically unable to digest other similar foods. They become dependent on the tree and threaten to starve without him. In gratitude for this dubious symbiosis, the ants living in the tree defend it against any competitor as soon as they feel a shock or detect it other otherwise.There are still many variants of these symbioses and cooperations. However, you know. Rainforest deforestation. Both insect researchers and plant researchers have had bad luck and unfortunately are too late.Selfishness is no unknown factor in the tree kingdom. If eucalyptus or other trees require fires for reproduction, they promote them. They shed leaves all year round, leaving plenty of scales and allowing flammable gases to escape. Of course, it will also be beneficial to keep the annoying competition in this way in check as a side effect. Many trees with such a temperament are fireproofed as adults. They have to make their infants fire under the butts so they can get in the way.Suppose that it turns out in the future that all plants have feelings. A little pain reception. Alternatively, even emotions. They fear the chainsaw, the salad fork or the weedkiller. Fruits and vegetables would, therefore, be babies. Green and too soon picked fetuses. Then primarily the parent model of the plants is to be criticized. To pack your children in a tasty garnish, so that they are eaten, is pedagogically borderline. For the ethics of humans, it would raise the same dilemma as with meat consumption, vegetarianism, and veganism. In a way, it would be even worse, because the crops will continue to suffer, become weaker, and eventually be tortured to death with knives. Every time the vegetable compartment opens or someone goes to the fruit bowl, everyone screams in panic. When they start frowning and rotting, it is like slow starvation and gangrene for humans. What should people eat then? The last thing that would be missing then would be that all microorganisms turned out to be sentient. Then the last alternative for the production of food by biofermenter would also be ethically biased. People are unable to understand the language of the flora. They can not automatically conclude, they would not speak and feel too.Vielleicht haben die Baumumarmer doch recht.Das Kommunikationsnetzwerk von Pflanzen und insbesondere Bäumen ist hochkomplex. Solitäre oder nur jährlich wachsende Pflanzen kommen an die Diffizilität des Grundstoffs für die Papierherstellung nicht heran. Durch ihr Wurzelwerk und ihre Größe sind Bäume für eine Schlüsselstellung prädestiniert. Sie kommunizieren mittels Duftstoffen miteinander und warnen einander vor Schädlingen. Das veranlasst die Gewarnten, chemische Stoffe zur Abwehr zu produzieren. Wenn ein menschliches Rodungstrupp naht, ist das aber verlorene Liebesmüh.Die Interaktion mit den Pilzen, Mikroorganismen, Insekten und Vögeln ist ein ausbalanciertes System. Immer ein wenig in der Waagschale zwischen Symbiose, Parasitentum und Kampf auf Leben und Tod. Das Abwerfen des Blattwerks oder das stetige Nadeln fördern die Ausbildung einer für die jeweilige Pflanze günstigen Mikroflora im Boden. Das wood wide web hilft bei der Kommunikation. Wälder sind wie vielschichtige Städte, in denen wie in menschlichen Metropolen über und unter der Erde komplex miteinander verwobene Prozesse ablaufen. Superorganismen, in denen der Motor der Evolution auf Hochtouren läuft. Nicht alles ist eitel Sonnenschein für die Fotosynthese. Es geht auch darum, den Konkurrenten Lebensraum streitig zu machen. Aber unter derselben Art kommt es zur Bildung von Interessensgemeinschaft, die für eine Balance des Ökosystems sorgen. Die Monokulturen aus Fichten, Ölpalmen, Südfruchten, usw haben keine der positiven Eigenschaften wie Biodiversität und gute Kommunikationsnetzwerke mehr. Es sind mehr uniforme Wüsten, in denen nur wenige Insekten und Tiere leben können. Ein immer kleinerer Genpool mit wenigen, gentechnisch veränderten Pflanzen trägt das Risiko von Nahrungsmittelkrisen in sich, wenn neue Schädlinge auftauchen. Pflanzen, die mit Staaten bildenden Insekten fusionieren, gehen einen extremeren Weg der Spezialisierung. Sie machen die Ameisen von ihrem Nektar abhängig und mischen eine geheime Zutat hinein. Dadurch werden die Ameisen biochemisch unfähig gemacht, andere ähnliche Nahrung zu verdauen. Sie werden von dem Baum abhängig und drohen ohne ihn zu verhungern. Als Dank für diese zweifelhafte Symbiose verteidigen die im Baum lebenden Ameisen diesen gegen jeden Konkurrenten, sobald sie eine Erschütterung spüren.Es dürfte noch etliche Varianten dieser Symbiosen und Kooperationen geben. Aber sie wissen ja. Regenwaldabholzung. Da haben sowohl Insektenforscher als auch Pflanzenforscher Pech gehabt und sind leider zu spät dran. Egoismus ist auch im Baumreich kein unbekannter Faktor. Wenn für Eukalyptus oder andere Bäume Brände für die Fortpflanzung wichtig sind, fördern sie diese. Sie werfen das ganze Jahr Laub ab, damit viel Zunder vorhanden ist und lassen brennbare Gase entweichen. Sicher wird es auch günstig sein, auf diese Art zusätzlich als Nebeneffekt die lästige Konkurrenz im Zaum zu halten. Viele Bäume mit solch hitzigen Temperament sind selbst als Erwachsene feuerfest. Und den Babies muss man Feuer unter dem Hintern machen, damit sie in die Gänge kommen.Angenommen, es stellt sich in Zukunft heraus, dass alle Pflanzen Gefühle haben. Ein wenig Schmerzrezeption. Oder sogar Emotionen. Sie fürchten die Motorsäge, die Salatgabel oder das Unkrautvernichtungsmittel. Obst und Gemüse wären demnach Babies. Grün und zu früh gepflücktes fast noch Föten. Dann ist primär das Elternmodell der Pflanzen zu kritisieren. Die eigenen Kinder in eine wohlschmeckende Garnierung zu verpacken, damit sie gefressen werden, ist pädagogisch grenzwertig.Für die Ethik der Menschen würde es das gleiche Dilemma wie bei Fleischkonsum, Vegetarismus und Veganismus aufwerfen. Es wäre in gewisser Hinsicht noch schlimmer, weil die Pflanzen geerntet noch lange leiden, schwächer werden und schließlich mit Messern zu Tode gefoltert werden. Jedes Mal, wenn sich das Gemüsefach öffnet oder jemand zur Obstschale geht, schreien alle in Panik. Wenn sie verrunzeln und zu faulen beginnen, ist es wie langsames Verhungern und Wundbrand für Menschen.Was sollten die Menschen dann noch essen? Fehlte nur noch, dass sich auch alle Mikroorganismen als empfindungsfähig herausstellen würden. Dann wäre die letzte Alternative zur Herstellung von Nahrung mittels Biofermenter auch ethisch vorbelastet.Menschen sind unfähig, die Sprache der Flora zu verstehen. Daraus kann nicht automatisch der Umkehrschluss gezogen werden, sie würden nicht sprechen und fühlen."
17,1771642483,http://goodreads.com/user/show/49521790-ayse,3,"I am confused about this one. It started quite interestingly but gradually lost its joyous nature. After the 4th chapter it turned into a heavy, didactic plant biology/botany book. I felt like a freshman without enthusiasm, and decided to use the book as a reference. In the first three sections one can feel the writer`s enthusiasm for the trees. I liked the part `Final Road to Modernity` where he shares his view on the order in nature and the phylogenetic tree. He emphasizes how related we all are, coming from the same ancestor.If you have a special interest in learning the lineages, evolution and biology of trees you may enjoy this more."
18,1771642483,http://goodreads.com/user/show/13510236-richard-reese,5,"As a young lad in Germany, Peter Wohlleben loved nature. He went to forestry school, and became a wood ranger. At this job, he was expected to produce as many high quality saw logs as possible, with maximum efficiency, by any means necessary. His tool kit included heavy machinery and pesticides. This was forest mining, an enterprise that ravaged the forest ecosystem and had no long-term future. He oversaw a plantation of trees lined up in straight rows, evenly spaced. It was a concentration camp for tree people.Wohlleben is a smart and sensitive man, and over the course of decades he got to know the tree people very well. Eventually, his job became unbearable. Luckily, he made friends in the community of Hümmel, and was given permission to manage their forest in a less destructive manner. There is no more clear-cutting, and logs are removed by horse teams, not machines. In one portion of the forest, old trees are leased as living gravestones, where families can bury the ashes of kin. In this way, the forest generates income without murdering trees.Wohlleben wrote The Hidden Life of Trees, a smash hit in Germany. It will be translated into 19 languages. The book is built on a foundation of reputable science, but it reads like grandpa chatting at fireside. He’s a gentle old storyteller explaining the wondrous magic of beautiful forests to befuddled space aliens from a crazy planet named Consume. He teaches readers about the family of life, a subject typically neglected in schools.Evergreen trees have been around for 170 million years, and trees with leaves are 100 million years old. Until recently, trees lived very well without the assistance of a single professional forest manager. I’m serious! Forests are communities of tree people. Their root systems intermingle, allowing them to send nutrients to their hungry children, and to ailing neighbors. When a Douglas fir is struck by lightning, several of its close neighbors might also die, because of their underground connections. A tribe of tree people can create a beneficial local climate for the community.Also underground are mycelium, the largest organisms yet discovered. One in Oregon weighs 660 tons, covers 2,000 acres (800 ha), and is 2,400 years old. They are fungi that send threads throughout the forest soil. The threads penetrate and wrap around tree roots. They provide trees with water, nitrogen, and phosphorus, in exchange for sugar and other carbohydrates. They discourage attacks from harmful fungi and bacteria, and they filter out heavy metals.When a limb breaks off, unwelcome fungal spores arrive minutes later. If the tree can close off the open wound in less than five years, the fungi won’t survive. If the wound is too large, the fungi can cause destructive rot, possibly killing the tree. When a gang of badass beetles invades, the tree secretes toxic compounds, and sends warnings to other trees via scent messages, and underground electrical signals. Woodpeckers and friendly beetles attack the troublemakers.Forests exist in a state of continuous change, but this is hard for us to see, because trees live much slower than we do. They almost appear to be frozen in time. Humans zoom through life like hamsters frantically galloping on treadmill, and we blink out in just a few decades. In Sweden, scientists studied a spruce that appeared to be about 500 years old. They were surprised to learn that it was growing from a root system that was 9,550 years old.In Switzerland, construction workers uncovered stumps of trees that didn’t look very old. Scientists examined them and discovered that they belonged to pines that lived 14,000 years ago. Analyzing the rings of their trunks, they learned that the pines that survived a climate that warmed 42°F, and then cooled about the same amount — in a period of just 30 years! This is the equivalent of our worst-case projections today.Dinosaurs still exist in the form of birds, winged creatures that can quickly escape from hostile conditions. Trees can’t fly, but they can migrate, slowly. When the climate cools, they move south. When it warms, they go north, like they are today — because of global warming, and because they continue to adapt to the end of the last ice age. A strong wind can carry winged seeds a mile. Birds can carry seeds several miles. A beech tree tribe can advance about a quarter mile per year (0.4 km).Compared to trees, the human genome has little variation. We are like seven-point-something billion Barbie and Ken dolls. Tree genomes are extremely diverse, and this is key for their survival. Some trees are more drought tolerant, others are better with cold or moisture. So change that kills some is less likely to kill all. Wohlleben suspects that his beech forest will survive, as long as forest miners don’t wreck its soil or microclimate. (Far more questionable is the future of corn, wheat, and rice, whose genetic diversity has been sharply reduced by the seed sellers of industrial agriculture.)Trees have amazing adaptations to avoid inbreeding. Winds and bees deliver pollen from distant trees. The ovaries of bird cherry trees reject pollen from male blossoms on the same tree. Willows have separate male trees and female trees. Spruces have male and female blossoms, but they open several days apart.Boars and deer love to devour acorns and beechnuts. Feasting on nuts allows them to put on fat for the winter. To avoid turning these animals into habitual parasites, nuts are not produced every year. This limits the population of chubby nutters, and ensures that some seeds will survive and germinate. If a beech lives 400 years, it will drop 1.8 million nuts.On deciduous trees, leaves are solar panels. They unfold in the spring, capture sunlight, and for several months manufacture sugar, cellulose, and other carbohydrates. When the tree can store no more sugar, or when the first hard frost arrives, the solar panels are no longer needed. Their chlorophyll is drained, and will be recycled next spring. Leaves fall to the ground and return to humus. The tree goes into hibernation, spending the winter surviving on stored sugar. Now, with bare branches, the tree is far less vulnerable to damage from strong winds, heavy wet snows, and ice storms.In addition to rotting leaves, a wild forest also transforms fallen branches and trunks into carbon rich humus. Year after year, the topsoil becomes deeper, healthier, and more fertile. Tree plantations, on the other hand, send the trunks to saw mills. So, every year, tons of precious biomass are shipped away, to planet Consume. This depletes soil fertility, and encourages erosion. Plantation trees are more vulnerable to insects and diseases. Because their root systems never develop normally, the trees are more likely to blow down.From cover to cover, the book presents fascinating observations. By the end, readers are likely to imagine that undisturbed forests are vastly more intelligent than severely disturbed communities of radicalized consumers. More and more, scientists are muttering and snarling, as the imaginary gulf between the plant and animal worlds fades away. Wohlleben is not a vegetarian, because experience has taught him that plants are no less alive, intelligent, and sacred than animals. It’s a wonderful book. I’m serious!"
19,1771642483,http://goodreads.com/user/show/44824883-paul-e-morph,4,"This is an absolutely fascinating book. It shows a side to trees that will blow your mind (unless you're a smartypants and know it all already... but I'm pretty sure those people are in the minority).The only criticism I have of the book is that the author does go off on the pure speculation bus every now and then, leaving the hard science at the station. It wasn't a problem for me as I'm used to reading scientific works and am pretty good at separating the facts from the flights of fancy. Folks who don't read much popular science might assume that everything the author says is fact and end up being slightly misled.(There's also a note by a 'forest scientist' at the end of the book that I think would have worked much better at the beginning... but that's nitpicking and I'm not docking any stars for that.)My wife started this one before I did and when I asked her how she was finding it she replied 'I will never look at a tree the same way again'. I laughed at the time but, having now read the book myself, I totally know what she means..."
20,1771642483,http://goodreads.com/user/show/21865425-eleanor,2,"I was disappointed by this book, perhaps unfairly. My main problem was with the language, and specifically the frequent use of slang, which detracted from what was supposed to be a readable but serious look at how trees in forests interact. I assume that this is down to the translator rather than the author, but would need to have that confirmed by someone who has read the German original. Words like ""critters"", ""buddies"" (referring to trees growing near one another) and ""little guys"" were intensely irritating. The worst of the lot came on page 216, where he was writing about ash dieback fungus, which had entered Europe from Asia and is destroying the ash trees in Europe. ""Its fruiting bodies look harmless, even rather cute. They are just teeny-weeny mushrooms that grow on the stalks of fallen leaves."" I wondered if each teeny-weeny mushroom had an itsy-bitsy elf sitting on it.My other disappointment was that this book was not generally about trees, but about trees in forests in Europe, and to a lesser extent, in North America. This is understandable because Peter Wohlleben manages a forest in Germany, but the title of the book suggests that he was writing about all trees. I am none the wiser about how, say, Australian trees, or African trees, might work together. I hope someone may do some work on this and write a readable but unslangy book about it."
21,1771642483,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4870237-margie,4,"4.5 starsHave you ever praised or hugged or talked to a tree? If you have, you are communicating with it more than you know. In his short poem, ""Trees,"" for which he became well known, Joyce Kilmer expressed his wonder and love for these magnificent beings:I think that I shall never seeA poem lovely as a tree.A tree whose hungry mouth is prestAgainst the earth's sweet flowing breast;A tree that looks at God all day,And lifts her leafy arms to pray;A tree that may in Summer wearA nest of robins in her hair;Upon whose bosom snow has lain;Who intimately lives with rain.Poems are made by fools like me,But only God can make a tree.The Hidden Life of Trees: What They Feel, How They Communicate . . . expresses Peter Wohlleben's own wonder and love for trees in well-researched, scientific and straightforward prose. Wohlleben is a German forester who set about to educate people about trees - what they mean in our lives, how they affect us, how we affect them, and how they affect each other as families and communities of trees.Wohlleben's book is packed scientific research and his own observations of the forests that he manages. He reveals, for instance, that until the 1990s no one had ever researched or known that trees actually communicate with one another. The phenomenon became known as the ""Wood"" Wide Web when it was discovered that trees in forests were connected by their roots and fungi systems through which they could communicate and feed one another. Through this underground connection trees look after each other and even care for and ""feed"" sick trees in their forest communities. Acacia trees in Africa were observed to use another method of communication to warn other acacias in the area of impending danger. When giraffes started munching on their foliage, the trees first pumped a bitter tasting substance into their own leaves and then released a scent or gas to warn other acacias of the approaching trouble.In old growth forests, trees' lives are measured, not in decades, but in centuries. A beech tree can live to be 400 years old. However, that single beech tree which produces ""a total of about 1.8 million beechnuts"" (p.29) in its lifetime will produce only one offspring that will become a full-grown tree - a one in an almost two million tree, a precious gem.This review could go on and on because Wohlleben's book is packed with fascinating information. I read it slowly and when I read it at night, I often fell asleep, even though I hate to admit it! I am a plot-driven, fiction reader, but I highly recommend this book to everyone, especially those who feel a strong connection with nature. It will open your eyes about these magnificent creatures and how they live, communicate with each other and enrich our lives. I am grateful to Peter Wohlleben for sharing his passion, knowledge, research and life's work. And yes, I do tell my trees that I love them, especially my beautiful sycamore."
22,1771642483,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2970379-manybooks,2,"REVIEW OF THE ORIGINAL GERMAN TEXT So I do readily admit that the factual information presented in Peter Wohlleben's Das geheime Leben der Bäume: Was sie fühlen, wie sie kommunizieren - die Entdeckung einer verborgenen Welt has indeed been of very much personal (as well as of course academic) interest. However and that being said, while I do in fact agree with MOST of the author's assertions, Peter Wohlleben’s writing style and the manner in which he has chosen to organise both his thoughts and his chapters are in my humble opinion rather woefully unscientific, unclear, even potentially confusing at times (not to mention that the emotional and anthropomorphic way in which Wohlleben depicts and describes his trees absolutely rubs me the wrong proverbial way, making Das geheime Leben der Bäume: Was sie fühlen, wie sie kommunizieren - die Entdeckung einer verborgenen Welt read more like fantasy literature, like a fairytale, like I am reading about J. R. R. Tolkien's Treebeard and the Ents instead of a supposedly scientific, non fiction analysis of trees and how they communicate with one another, something that I have found both annoyingly frustrating and also really quite insulting to trees). Because let’s face it, trees are not humans and humans are not trees and in a book of for the most part scientific facts on trees, the latter should in no way be depicted and described with and by human attributes and qualities, as this diminishes trees in my opinion and makes Peter Wohlleben's discoveries, although I do happen to agree with what he claims and says, potentially questionable and above all imbued with an unscientific hippie tree hugger mentality (which in a non fiction tome of science really should be avoided). And therefore, while I do still recommend Das geheime Leben der Bäume: Was sie fühlen, wie sie kommunizieren - die Entdeckung einer verborgenen Welt (either in the German original or in its many translations), I can and will only grant a two star ranking maximum, and leave the necessary caveat that lack of organisation, lack of scientific rigour and the annoying tendency of the author, of Peter Wohlleben to write about trees as though they are humans or at least graced with human thoughts, human feelings etc., this does for me leave quite a bit to be desired (and equally a strange, rather bitter aftertaste in my mouth)."
23,1771642483,http://goodreads.com/user/show/58398280-laure,5,"A must read! An absolute gem of a book. I might be biaised as I am what people would call a 'tree hugger'. I am sorry I did not come across this book earlier in my life. As someone who last studied ecosystems in the 80's as part of the 'normal' school curriculum, this was truly enlightening.I would recommend buying this book for all budding teenage scientists/biologists out there (and older ones of course). It is a very easy read and packed with invaluable information about our forests."

Peter Wohlleben is a German conservationist and forester who manages a forest in the Eifel Mountains and has observed the slow-lane growth habits of his beloved trees, the secret underground social network that they share, the diseases and other dangers that threaten their survival--and most importantly, how crucial it is for the survival of all of us to allow forests to reach old-growth status again. I read this book as a complement to Annie Proulx's new book Barkskins which is a work of historical fiction about the decimation of the beautiful old-growth forests in the New World.#2016-aty-reading challenge-week-50: a book originally written in a language other than English.

About 30 pages in, I realized that the book is poorly written, poorly edited, poorly translated, and then poorly edited again. Chapters are anywhere from 3 to 8 pages, with most falling into the 3-5 range. Grand chapter titles with little information. Very confusing science writing style. I am science literate, and I was confused with both the science he was trying to explain, and what he was actually trying to say. His attempts at citing research are few and far between. I didn't trust that what he was saying or how he was saying it was accurate. I am disappointed that this book was published as is."

They come given with incredible attributes that appear to make them almost human. The only thing they cannot do is walk.To enter into this world of trees is something else. When you consider the flora and fauna and then one becomes so aware of other ecosystems that are burning and burning, such as the Amazon rain forests. So really we must not forget all of these aspects of nature that can give so much pleasure.Definitely a book worth reading."

Although one is forced to ask what separates science from spiritualism - it is not a debate for today. The hidden life of Trees is a book of hard science written evocatively by Peter Wohlleben. He paints a beautiful and mesmerizing picture of how life works in the ""slow"" lane as he likes to call it. Unbelievably profound, Wohlleben's findings are the result of patient observation of the forests that he managed for over twenty years in Germany. He explains the inner workings of the complex society of flora, fauna and fungi through the means of vivid story-telling. He is a man of science and facts but he has not relinquished his child-like wonder and fascination with the forest. It was a beautiful experience to see the forest through his eyes.  Trees are magnificently intelligent and tough. In the wake of the current state of the environment, I believe that trees are the last beings anyone needs to worry about. Its true that humans have caused the extinction of quite a few individual species and destroyed many-a-good ecosystems but when all is said and done - meaning when humanity will wreak the last of the havoc it can manage and annihilate itself and many others - tress will somehow still spring back to correct every crime we committed against this planet. Trees will survive everything and once again begin the creation of the next prosperous era of life.Its easy for humans to kill trees - yes I use the word ""kill"" because that is what it really is - because we believe that trees are somehow less than us. That they feel less. This book drives the fact home that despite our differences trees are exactly as smart as us if not smarter. They have children. They have families. Friends, enemies, rivalry, a personality and a desire to live.Read this books if you are a forester. Or if you are not. Read it if you are interested in the natural world. Or if you are not. Read it if you wish to understand better. Or if you just need to see better."
29,1771642483,http://goodreads.com/user/show/27250071-vimal-thiagarajan,5,"Just a few pages into the Hidden Life of Trees by forester Peter Wohlleben, the first thing that strikes anyone who picked the book up believing it would be an antidote to that 'Human---All-too-human' feeling that one gets with having too many human motives and fantasies underpinning the stories one reads, is that it just ISN'T. Why? Apparently, there are arboreal denizens who talk to each other - both small talk and essential talk, make plans together - plans of procreation and family-building included, strategize together against pests - ranging from minor warding-off strategies to full-fledged chemical warfare and intricately planned assassinations, offer favorable turf to members of the same tribe and hostile ones to those of another, nurse their babies and sick, steal and flaunt their wealth and what not. Anthropomorphizing nature thus, usually aggravates me by distorting and disfiguring the sights and smells along my usual escape-routes, and so I had a hard time reading some of the chapters, but have to say the book left a favorable impression on me nonetheless. After all, Peter Wohlleben uses this strategy with his story-telling chiefly to blur the boundary between humans and plants, which is key to some much needed empathy and an enhanced sense of understanding towards the arboreal world, which in turn keeps conservation well-informed and in the right direction. Without this picture, its hard to realize how exactly the commodification of trees and the seemingly benign alterations to old-growth forests cripples and wrecks trees, disrupts vital ecosystems, and makes our world sicker and poorer. Wohlleben brilliantly fuses his imagination, years of direct observation, deduction, and all the latest scientific findings about the inner workings of trees to give us a fresh, crisp narrative that is both spell-binding and paradigm-shifting, and which no doubt radically alters some long-held beliefs and throws in fresh moral conundrums.SOME walk in the woods that!"

Wohlleben manages to talk about trees with such grace, respect and passion that it moves even the harshest mind or heart and becomes a very meditative read. Author manages to put facts, common misunderstandings, new information, and his own point of view, and this all give a new face to ""popular science"". It's neither too fact heavy, or too loose - the harmony and balance is perfect. I hope this book will help us all to be more aware of trees and forests. They deserve that."
31,1771642483,http://goodreads.com/user/show/440651-dov-zeller,4,"Do you want to learn about individualistic trees and community-minded trees? How different trees have evolved to communicate with each other and their environment and team up with their ecosystem to create a sustainable environment and protect themselves and others? Parental trees and teenager trees who, if their caretakers aren't around to facilitate their growth and educate them, grow too much too fast and, because they don't learn how to take care of themselves and live in moderation, die, in tree years, quite young.Wohlleben clearly has a great admiration and respect for trees and lovingly schools us about the dangers of cutting down the older trees in forests and clearcutting old growth forests with the mistaken notion that replanting a community of all young trees is good and fine and that these young trees are healthier than a multigenerational community of trees anyway. People in certain places seem to have similarly mistaken notions about human communities. I could offer a few other human analogies, but I'll leave it to your imagination.Wohlleben goes to great lengths to show his readers how similar trees and humans are and for this some people criticize him. Here is rough and minimalistic recapitulation: Trees are social; they have parent-child relationships; they need sleep (and suffer when artificial lights mess up their circadian rhythms); they warn each other when danger is near and protect themselves and each other when attacked; they communicate in collaboration with fungus in a way that can be compared to a ""world wide web"" though more of a forest-wide web, and, well, in collaboration with fungus; their sap is similar to blood; they don't like getting bitten by beetles or infested by lice...Here is a great Ted Talk by one of the early researchers of tree community behavior https://www.ted.com/talks/suzanne_sim...And here is an article about Wohlleben with a video interview:https://www.theguardian.com/environme...The book is equal parts optimistic and disheartening. It is especially hard to read in the new batman villain Trump era where a few wealthy people are gleefully preparing to devastate any community they can get their sick and sinister paws on for the sake of accruing even more money and power (in a surprisingly deep and compassionate and thankfully funny conversation between Sarah Silverman and Bernie Sanders, they described this behavior as addictive. A sickness in which destructive people will stop at nothing to accrue more wealth like they think the world is a big casino and they're winning the jackpot. Only what they are actually doing is profound and catastrophic harm.)One of my favorite segments of the book talks about ideal environmental conditions for different trees and ways various species have adapted to thrive in different weather conditions and how they can work to create microclimates that enhance their living conditions and quality of life. And also how there is a lot of genetic diversity within one species of tree depending on where it is growing (depending on the climate and community, etc.)I listened to this book on audio and the narration was quite good. It was available through my library as a digital audio book.I'm trying to get in the habit of taking better notes when I'm reading, and especially while listening, I'm trying to start a tradition of drawing little comics as a way of taking notes and keep track of interesting moments and overarching themes. So, here are a few sketches doodled/notes taken while I listened to ""The Hidden Life..."" The third one is a direct quote from the text. The fourth one I don't quite remember what it was I was getting at. Though according to this article maybe it's just because they play starring roles in the book: ""The narrative has a tiny cast of species — beech, oak, spruce, and fir. Elm, pine, willow, yew, and alders play minor supporting roles."""

I listened to this as an audiobook, and it felt a bit like a BBC documentary. It wasn't too technical and was enjoyable for a person who's definitely not of the field; however I was expecting a little bit more insight/depth. Some of the things that are presented in this book (the way trees communicate, the way they care for the younger ones etc.), which I though were the centre of the book, were just told with little to no scientific insight on whether or not they are actually true; so I really didn't get the point of presenting these revolutionary ideas if they could just be mere conjectures.

33,1771642483,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3409532-april-does-feral-sometimes,4,"'The Hidden Life of Trees' is a bit like Dr. Spock's Baby and Child Care, only more Big Picture. The author presents a science of forestry for the general reader in an entirely new paradigm for understanding forests - anthropomorphically. Trees are people, only a lot less mobile and with the outlook of beings who can live up to 500 years old. Peter Wohlleben writes in a lively entertaining manner (as far as I know as my edition is translated from the original German to English). The author avoids scientific words but not the science of trees. He is not a scientist, actually, but in having studied forestry, he has been professionally responsible for managing forests for decades and he works with the intention of maintaining the health, and happiness, of his trees. Using his own observations and experiments, and in applying the recent discoveries of scientists, he thinks trees feel and act with more intention than we recognize. Given the evidence he presents in this book, Wohlleben convinced me trees act to improve their survival more than we know. Just like us, they are social beings, trusting most in their 'children', grown from their own seeds, and in nearby related tree members of their 'tribe'. Recently, evidence has been mounting trees also communicate with their 'family' primarily through symbiotic relationships with fungi parasites living on their roots, although different varieties of trees utilize other methods, too. Trees will support offspring or 'friends' - trees 'who' are sick or injured - with gifts of sugar and water, for example, through underground networks.There is a lot more information about the nature of trees, both as communities and as individuals, as well as how different animals and insects aid or distress them. The author also describes the effects of weather and water and time on the different tree varieties. Tree fill environment niches and compete with each other for sun and space, too. However, as usual, humans have dramatically interfered with their tree 'lives' both for better and worse - mostly worse, even when we are trying to be good stewards.The author uses a cute sentimental anthropomorphical vocabulary which might annoy some readers. I was startled by it, frankly, but it grew on me. The author feels affection for trees, but he does not think trees will hug him back. I think.For example, quoting from the book: ""That means it is okay to use wood as long as trees are allowed to live in a way that is appropriate to their species. And that means that they should be allowed to fulfill their social needs, to grow in a true forest environment on undisturbed ground, and to pass their knowledge on to the next generation. And at least some of them should be allowed to grow old with dignity and finally die a natural death."" This statement isn't as crazy as it seems; the author explains by examples and appropriate science how trees are healthier and live longer under conditions which appear to be physical analogs to arrangements which create human feelings of happiness. Wohlleben isn't claiming trees 'feel' happy, just that they appear stronger and healthier if they can 'arrange' their immediate environment without being touched or manipulated by humans. A forest can be built up naturally as a good place of strong and healthy tree, plant, insect and animal varieties - given 500 years or so of isolation. However, this is a timeline with which humans obviously have issues; we feel we need to clear the land for planting crops or human habitations or uses, or we try to save dying trees, or we accidentally or purposefully create a flora monoculture - because we don't understand that early tree pioneers and flora/fauna settlers of a new forest may need to later have a die-off. Other flora and fauna varieties establish themselves on top of the remains of the previous century's forest. This is normal. Forests undergo a process of maturing over time that results in an overall stronger forest which supports healthier flora and fauna. We mess up this process a lot, both through our destruction of old legacy forests and our lack of knowledge in caring for trees. Wohlleben's book hopes to reduce some of our ignorance by teaching us to be better step-grandmothers and step-granddads to our adopted but over-managed woody children."

Electrical impulses pass through the roots of trees at the rate of one third of an inch per second. This is one of their many means of communication. They also use their sense of smell and taste. I didn't even know they had those senses. If a giraffe starts eating an African acacia, the tree releases a chemical into the air that signals that a threat is at hand. Other trees ""smell"" it and produce toxic chemicals. Insect pests are dealt with differently. Trees can send out a signal to attract predators of that insect pest. Most astonishing of all: trees are social. They care for each other. Trees can care for the stump of a felled tree for centuries by feeding it sugars and other nutrients to keep it alive. Who knew? Trees connect with each other through a wide network of soil fungi. Trees need each other. And, by the way, we need them. He calls the plants we ""enslave"" in our agriculture system ""the saddest plants of all."" They seem to have lost the ability to communicate. They are rendered ""deaf and dumb."" They need ""more wildness"" so that ""they'll be more talkative in the future."" There is some incest in tree breeding. But wind and bees can refresh the local gene pool. When a tree species becomes rare, the few remaining trees can lose their genetic diversity. They then weaken and, after a few centuries, disappear altogether. In Alaska and Siberia, climate change is causing the permafrost to thaw. Trees are losing their footing and tipping in different directions. Scientists call these forests ""drunken forests."" And yes, Republican Party, climate change is real and an existential threat to our planet. Fungi are the largest known organisms in the world.

The forests of Europe and the UK have inspired writers, built towns and fleets and provide food warmth and shelter for millennia. But all is not as it seems in this wooded world, as Wohlleben details in his book with the latest research and understanding of just how a tree is created, grows and dies. The science behind these ground-breaking new discoveries is revealing a secret world of communication, nurture and microclimates. The environment that they create from the roots to the tips of the crown is carefully controlled, they shelter young trees from fierce summer sun, pass nutrients through the fungal webs in the ground and protect each other from the battering in winter storms. There is details on how they manage to pump gallons of water high into the air; something that is not fully understood yet and how they react to when you hack a branch off. No wonder they can live five times longer than us.He is deeply passionate about woods and forests, something that is evident from the very first chapter. The science that he reveals is almost unbelievable really, but it is backed up with solid evidence and examples; but there is still so much that we do not know or understand. As he has come to understand the deep complexity of these individual trees, and the forest as a whole, he has changed from being a logger to a forest ambassador and arguing that maintaining and enjoying the forests in a sustainable way is the best for us and the forests. Forests add so much to our health and our lives, and more importantly the well-being of our planet and this philosophy is as beneficial to us as it is to the management of the forests. This is a well written call to learn to love our wooded areas once again."

Twenty years later, he wrote this fantastic The Hidden Life of Trees. It is an eye-opening book. I have read some of the topics elsewhere, but this up-to-date book still blows my mind away. Like Tolkien, “I am at home among trees.” It turns out Tolkien got two things right: 1. Trees live on the slow lane2. Trees do communicate with each other (although they certainly can't walk like Treebeard)Trees live in a different time scale than us. An 80 years tree is still a toddler, and it takes decades for a tree to heal a wound (or die). This is a hard fact to grasp, harder to apply it properly even for conservationists.Trees communicate by scent-mails, by electronic current from the branches to roots, by wood-wide-web (underground network of fungi and root system). There are tree families and supportive communities, and there are tree loners and ""street kids"". The book also discussed the perils trees face in their lifetime: wind, snow, flood, drought, pests, and human interventions of course.The author writes about trees with genuine love. He makes me see the woods in my neighborhood differently and I want to visit the forest he manages in Germany.Some quotes:“If a tree falls in the forest there are other trees listening.” “If we want to use forests as a weapon in the fight against climate change, then we must allow them to grow old, which is exactly what large conservation groups are asking us to do.” "

I didn't understand the trees mental states.....I 'sorta' grasp the idea of the way trees share food with each other...

I've donated money to have trees planted in Israel... I VALUE TREES.... I just wasn't crazy about this book. It was fun and playful in the beginning learning about trees in community and the ways they communicate to each other. .......but I was struggling much to much to stay interested. After awhile --everything became tedious. Repetitive and....""boring""! I DO enjoy the GORGEOUS PHOTOS - that several reviewers have posted in their reviews. They're BEAUTIFUL PHOTOS of TREES!!!!! In fact, I've enjoyed reading many of the positive wonderful reviews here on Goodreads---more than I enjoyed my own experience. Oh well, .....TREES still ROCK our WORLD!

After reading Wohleben, I will never look at trees or the world the same again. Wohleben was a forester who spent the first part of his career killing the trees he would later come to understand in a way that is mind altering. In this book, he has attempted to answer such questions as:Can trees hear? (spoiler: yes they can and it's incredible)Can they smell, taste, and see?Should trees be thinned out? (The answer to this was unexpected and nothing short of entrancing)Do trees have family members and companions?Do they have immune systems and what might agriculture have done to their immune systems?Why do we need to use so many pesticides when growing our crops.? (The answer to this is related to thinning out trees and plants-- perhaps the best part of the whole book)I reread most chapters more than once. This book was such a treat. I cannot recommend it highly enough. "

41,1771642483,http://goodreads.com/user/show/90786-lee-klein,3,"We moved from South Philadelphia about 15 miles west to an area with a lot of old trees. They're everywhere and I don't know their names or much about them. Maples, oaks, sycamores, cedars, spruces, tulip trees, dogwood, Japanese maple, elms. I can identify a handful of common trees but that's it. I cut down a lot of invasive bamboo in our backyard and essentially excavated a tree but couldn't figure out what it was, not even with apps and looking online (I put a pic on FB and it's a granny smith apple tree, apparently). So I ordered this book with a tree identifier handbook and really looked forward to it. I wasn't disappointed at all early on as he talked about how trees communicate and respond to attacks from insects etc. I excitedly told my wife a lot of this stuff like about how fungi act as communication nodes like those wifi helpers we have all around the house. And she said oh yeah we (she and our daughter) learned all about that on the Magic School Bus. Everything I brought up they knew from the show and so I watched it too and you can too here: https://youtu.be/sBrSVudY3Fg?t=252After the initial interest of the first fifty pages or so, I found the text not so engaging, the translation wobbly and sometimes unclear, and the insights less common. I felt like I could have learned a lot of this most likely from a few online sources without purchasing a book. Really just found it difficult to concentrate on after a while. But I'm glad I got it and it's definitely opened my eyes some more to the giant presences I have pretty much always taken for granted all around. Also in this age of instantaneous reaction and charged political divisiveness (in part about climate change), learning about trees and appreciating them feels right and natural. A lot of the trees around where I live were probably saplings during World War I and have been around slowing responding to their surroundings, doing their thing, through times of war and peace and everything in between."

This book might guide you there. Nature is our teacher in all things ...observe her. Go sit under a tree or better yet stand beside one and hold your palms to the bark. If it is spring where you live, look up to the great green canopy and listen. Do you hear all those birds singing? Sing along with them and maybe dance around in the breathtaking beauty of the trees. As a bonus, you’ll learn why woodpeckers don’t get headaches. Time for me to go outside and plant another tree."
43,1771642483,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2876105-marc,2,"The least you can say is that this ""Secret Life of Trees"" is a very sympathetic and interesting book. Peter Wohlleben clearly writes with lots of love about trees, especially about the beech, his favorite tree. In about 30 chapters he treats many aspects of life and death of trees and forests, based on his own experience as a forester and also referring to scientific research. And the image he sketches of this natural life is absolutely fascinating: I learned a lot of new things about forests, trees, fungi, beetles and so forth; Wohlleben illustrates again and again that trees are much more complex organisms that we usually suspect.But yet I have my doubts. Wohlleben constantly mixes his own observations with findings from scientific research, but also with very surprising statements of which it is not clear where they come from: from scientific studies or out of his own hat. Wohlleben's very dry, sumptuous narrative style gives the misleading impression that it's all just the same, and based on verified facts. But what to think of, for example, the following passage about friendship between trees: ""Two real friends take care that the branches that are facing toward the other are not too thick. Those who want to avoid each other, therefore, only form strong crowns to the outside, in the direction of trees they are not friends with. Such couples are so closely linked through their roots that they often die together.” Especially in the beginning of the book Wohlleben writes about trees as if they were people. The least you can say is that such anthropomorphic language is strange. Now I'm not such a narrow minded person - I guess - that I think there is no salvation outside of science. I am absolutely convinced that there is a lot to reality of which we can say nothing by using the scientific method; or that there are also non-scientific ways to look at reality that are very valuable (I’ll just name holism, for example, to stay out of the religious domain); and I also want to assume that trees and plants (and animals and stones for that matter) are much more complex organisms than we assume so far. I think I’m really open to these other approaches, but ... I'd rather like an author indicating where he leaves the scientific, verified domain and pursues in the field of plausible, but self-founded theories, or simply uses a different language register to express something about reality that does not work in other (scientific) registers.And that's my problem with Wohlleben, he mixes them all! I'd like to give him the benefit of the doubt, and by writing so lovingly about trees as if it were people he really got my sympathy (because I love trees and forests too), but he must grant me the liberty to remain on my guard and look at his book in a bit of a skeptical mood."

46,1771642483,http://goodreads.com/user/show/34401683-bob-brinkmeyer,5,"In Richard Powers’s recent monumental novel, THE OVERSTORY, a scientist named Patricia Westerford writes a book aimed at popular audiences about the intricate world of trees—how they adapt, communicate, and anchor a complex ecosystem above and below ground. I’m not sure if Powers knew about Peter Wohlleben’s THE HIDDEN LIFE OF TREES (it came out originally in Germany in 2015, in the US in 2016), but Westerford’s book in Powers’ novel sounds a lot like Wohlleben’s. In the novel, one of Westerford’s readers writes a fan letter telling her, “You’ve made me think about life in a different way.” I feel the same way about Wohlleben’s book (as well about Powers’s novel, but enough about that work for now).A forest manager in Germany, Wohlleben with joy and passion leads us on an astonishing journey into the social world of trees, a world in which trees establish relationships with each other and with other denizens of their world—fungi, birds, bacteria, insects, etc. As quickly becomes clear, Wohlleben sees forests as immensely intricate ecosystems which deserve our respect and even our awe. While a good chunk of the book works through the basic science of trees—how trees use sunlight to create food and energy, how they breathe oxygen into the air, how they store and transport resources, etc.—which by itself is fascinating, the real wonder of the book is Wohlleben’s discussions of how trees create interactive and supportive communities, not merely with other trees but with the worlds in which they live. In these forest communities, trees nurture their young, make friends, forge alliances, and fend off enemies; trees are, as Wohlleben underscores time and again, social beings.Wohlleben goes so far to assert, and with a good deal of support, that trees think, learn, see, and remember, even locating what he says is “the equivalent of a brain” in trees’ root networks. These networks control a tree's chemical activity, analyzing data and directing responses to external stimuli. The implications of Wohlleben’s analysis, which are nodded to throughout the book but which are discussed more forthrightly in the final chapter, are far-reaching. After saying he welcomes the “breaking down [of] the moral barriers between animals and plants,” Wohlleben suggests that if trees (as well as other plants) are indeed sentient, thinking beings, then we need rethink how we treat them, not merely because of the benefits they offer to the world’s ecosystems but because morality demands it. Powers in THE OVERSTORY also explores this issue and goes much further than Wohlleben, but the basic thinking is similar: should trees have fundamental civil rights protected under law, rights to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness? Merely raising this question, as I suggested earlier in noting the disruptive force of Wohlleben’s vision, forces us to rethink not only how we view the world but, more importantly, how we should re-orient ourselves and our societies to become better citizens with our non-human—animal and vegetative—compatriots."

This is the advice Peter Wohlleben gives to foresters like himself who he explains can best manage their forests largely by resisting the urge to tinker and simply leave the trees alone. His tone is marked by a kindly wisdom not inconsistent with his patient subjects, the trees of the world.  ""Why do we find it so much more difficult to understand plants than animals? It's because of the history of evolution, which split us off from vegetation very early on. All our senses developed differently, and so we have to use our imaginations to get even the slightest idea of what is going on inside trees.""Wohlleben has the imagination and empathy to accomplish this, taking his reader through the mechanics of trees anatomy but continuing on in an educated effort to understand how trees experience life on Earth. With a pitch perfect translation from the German by Jane Billinghurst, he explores ideas that are all too often pushed aside by brash corporate memes, through labels of ""tree-hugger"" and so forth. He gets through that and examines the science (how refreshing that is!) which is incredibly exciting in that evidence is emerging that allows us to better understand their secret lives, for example, ""It appears that nutrient exchange and helping neighbors in times of need is the rule, and this leads to the conclusion that forests are super organisms with interconnections much like ant colonies."" Here's another: ""Trees, it turns out, have a completely different way of communicating, they use scent."" ""They Alison warn each other using chemical signals sent through the fungal network around their root tips, which operate no matter the weather."" The book is a bit scattershot but it is like taking a walk through the forest with an elder who knows the forest and reveals fascinating information, the reader emerges with a whole new connection and appreciation. He feels Man has a place in the forest, that we are intimately connected and can use science and intuition to enhance this natural relationship. We can allow old growth forests to re-emerge and can stop planting monoculture stands and avoid using heavy equipment that compacts the soil to an extent that trees can't take root. One thing I got from this quiet book is that it's time for us all to grow up and take on our responsibility for our part in the ecosystem for the good of the planet and the future. I feel the difference this book has made on me every time I take a hike. "

Trees are able to decide, have memories and even different characters. There are perhaps nicer guys and bad guys.” Wohlleben, a German forester, approachs his subject a little different than other biologists and naturalists I've read. He speaks of the economy of the forest, the web and networking, the wood that is produced, etc. This book could have been called Hidden Life of the Forest just as easy, because he approaches this community of trees more often than individual species, etc. He refers many times to 'the forest he manages' in Germany, and other European, and some North American (specifically Pacific Northwest) forests. The scope is primarily limited to these regions.It is an international bestseller for a reason - it allows you to peer through a different lens and see things anew. I liked the communication aspects, of roots as brain and nervous system, the sometimes parasitic, sometimes symbiotic relationship with fungi.This is a great starting place for nature writing - but he sure to follow up with some David George Haskell. His work on forests and trees is exemplary; The Forest Unseen and The Song of Trees are my favorite tree/forests books and are highly recommended for delving deeper."
49,1771642483,http://goodreads.com/user/show/70628718-barbara-lemere,4,"This was fascinating. I have lived almost 65 years and I had no idea that trees actually worked in a very similar way to the Ents in Lord of The Rings. The Ents do things very slowly just like trees. They communicate with each other.  Peter Wohlleben worked in the forestry service for many years and what reveals in this little book is amazing. If a Tree's leaves are being eaten by a giraffe for example the tree feels pain. it may take an hour for the tree to know that but when it does, it sends a signal to the leaves that creates a chemical process that makes the leaves taste bitter to make the giraffe look elsewhere for it's snacks.If the tree isn't getting enough water, the surrounding fungi will communicate to use their roots to nourish the tree.I think everybody should read this book. It's a quick read and it will change the way you see the world we live in. So many of us don't even look up from our phones and tablets and computers to even realize we still have trees. Two big thumbs up from me. I started reading this just before Earth day. It took me while to post the review though. my bad."
50,1771642483,http://goodreads.com/user/show/223837-nicky,3,"This is pretty light reading, with a lot of interesting facts and observations about trees — but sometimes I really had to go and look up the sources, because it didn’t sound quite right, or it just sounded like an oversimplification. If you’re a fan of well-sourced facts, this might not be quite what you’re looking for, because there’s something more conversational and anecdotal about it in many ways. It’s still some fascinating stuff, though, and it’s not the kind of dense non-fiction that takes a lot of time investment.Not surprisingly, the author’s premise is that there’s a lot about trees we don’t know and a lot that we overlook, and that’s definitely not wrong.Reviewed for The Bibliophibian."

52,1771642483,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10407443-ross-blocher,4,"Perhaps the most popular koan, eclipsing even ""What is the sound of one hand clapping?"", is ""If a tree falls in the forest, and no one is around to hear it, does it make a sound?"" After listening to Peter Wohlleben's The Hidden Life of Trees, I can't help but see that philosophical conundrum differently. Data can offer solutions to some of these questions: the egg by definition came before the chicken, and a falling tree does make a sound, which the forest itself most certainly hears.Wohlleben expands our conception of the ""no one"" in the forest to paint a fascinating picture of just how vibrant, interconnected and even intelligent plant, animal and fungal life is. ""Intelligence"" is an odd attribute to attach to plants, but we are challenged to consider whether the boot fits. Trees comprehend and respond to outside stimuli. The presence of a pest can trigger chemical communication to alert other trees, or even attract that pest's predators. A starving tree's roots will generate sounds (inaudible to us) that other plants are aware of and respond to. A tree has some ability to avoid stimuli that have damaged it in the past, which raises the question of whether that counts as memory, and where such memory might be stored. If an organism can see, smell, taste, hear, and even remember... what do we call that?Translated from the original German (Wohlleben works for the government managing a beech forest in Hümmel), the real benefit of The Hidden Life of Trees is that it offers nuance about how plants grow, breathe, transport water, heal, compete for light, jockey for positions, take care of their young, extend their lives, respond to changes in climate, hibernate for winter, and cooperate with other organisms. It dispels the simplistic notion that forestry is just a matter of planting whichever tree you want wherever you want it. There's a rich cascade of interconnected factors that make for a successful forest: age, density, a fungal support network as complex and rich and important as our gut biome, the amount of humus built up and nutrients in the soil, the diversity of plant types and wildlife, and many other factors. Some trees just aren't cut out for certain climates, or need a specific amount of sun (or lack thereof), or protection from wind. Many modern forestry practices ignore these factors, and we set trees up for failure with our manipulation of tree placement, felling of old growth, dead tree clearing, and even fire prevention. Wohlleben shares lessons he's learned and mistakes he's made in his decades of forest management.While Wohlleben shares a lot of really cool statistics (electrical impulses travel through trees at a third of an inch per second!) and refers to much scientific knowledge (a beech tree can process 130 gallons of water in a day!), this isn't the type of book to offer up papers and debate its points. If you want to delve into the research, you'll have to take that up on your own. You'll also have to make your own determination about just how much you want to anthropomorphize. Either way, you'll come away with a refreshed sense of just how important trees are. The audio version I listened to was delightfully narrated, though I found it required intense concentration: I was constantly rewinding to reabsorb passages that had escaped me the first time. As the book itself points out, the audio version also saves the felling of additional spruce and birch trees... which only seems appropriate."
53,1771642483,http://goodreads.com/user/show/28623020-bruce-beckham,2,"Knowing the acclaim this book has received I do feel a bit like the boy in the tale of the emperor’s clothes – he who cried, “The King is in the Altogether!”Don’t get me wrong – I read Botany at university – I’m a lifelong amateur naturalist... I love trees! I sit beneath one for an hour most days. I own lots of books about trees. But my guess is that this is a book that many start and few finish.I heard an interview on the radio – I think with the author – and I was fascinated by the idea of families of trees that feed their weak and injured relatives; trees that release scents to warn their neighbours of imminent chomping giraffes... that sort of thing – but I reckon I got the gist of it in about 10 minutes.When it came to the book, the alarm bells started ringing for me after what seemed to be the third rather fanciful introduction. Come on – let the story begin!The ‘story’ seems to be a collection of (interesting) findings, grouped into various chapter themes, strung out lyrically to fill the space between the covers. I couldn’t detect an evolving treatise to keep me turning the pages in order to reach a profound conclusion – like, say, The Selfish Gene.It’s a kind of textbook written in the style of an anthropomorphic biography – it is a book, but a New Scientist article would probably suffice."
54,1771642483,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10640307-dar,1,"The author believes that trees feel, think, learn, remember and communicate. For example, trees lose their leaves every year and grow new ones, so they ""remember"" how and when to do it. (Compare: if a cat chases a mouse, and the next year chases another mouse, does it ""remember"" how to do mousing? It doesn't matter - it is instinctual.) Many trees in a forest share beneficial fungi in their root systems. This is not described as symbiosis, but as trees caring for each other because they are social. Every chapter has instances of human or animal qualities being applied to trees. Sometimes Wohlleben hedges his bets by saying, ""Don't you think?"" or ""You never know"" to summarize his arguments. There is a lot of information about trees, but I ended up distrusting half of it because of Wohlleben's fanciful speculation.I read another book that does this: The Thing with Feathers by Noah Stryker (in which the author dwells more on the mystical qualities he believes birds have than on what is known about them)."
55,1771642483,http://goodreads.com/user/show/24011982-cynda,5,"4.75 Rounded UpEver wonder what makes a tree a tree? In understandable language? In a way that lets you feel as though you really did pay attention in either your high school biology class, or better yet in your basic biology class in college/university? Then this book is for you.Wohlleben explains things in an anthropomorphic way. He reminds us that trees live, that they experience sensation, that they have feelings, and that feelings are universal. I understand feelings, so I felt another step closer to understanding Wohlleben's (rhetorical) argument. So why 4.75 instead of 5 full stars? Because the book is written for those with a basic biology education, and some of the information W presents is outside that scope. I know that most of us have easy access to the the internet. But I had to refer to the internet numerous times. Some images would have helped.Great Read for honoring Earth Day"

I chose my house because of the enormous trees on the property.But I’ve never known much about trees until I read this book. Peter Wohlleben drawn up on research and his years of personal experience with trees and forests to tell the truths about trees. He tells a story of trees as social beings, trees that care for their children, that care for each other. He shares the secret powers of trees, the ways trees are able to warn other trees of danger, how trees can send predators scurrying off by deploying scents. He tells of ways trees can communicate with each other, ways that are almost unnoticed by man.An altogether fascinating read."

A veritable neural network under the ground the author calls it the Woodwide Web. Trees speak, think and also have emotions. Except in time lapse mode. I was often wondering how some of these insights were arrived at given the nature of research around this. Highly recommended."
58,1771642483,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5261455-caroline,4,"I enjoyed this book about the ecology of forests. The main lesson is to be very careful in shaping policy, because we don’t know what we don’t know. It turns out that recent research shows that many truisms of forestry turn out to damage forests, rather than help them. The complexity of organisms of the soil and the interaction of forest denizens are outlined in a deft way. Not too simplistic for intelligent lay readers, not too complex. The other benefit of this book is that it reminds us that nature takes the long view. As in centuries and millennia. Just slow down, take care of small details like protecting young trees so they don’t grow too fast, and in a hundred or so years it will pay off. I found my blood pressure slowly decreasing as I spent time in the forest with Peter Wohleben.I grew quite fond of the author and his gentle appreciation of nature. I also recommend the audio version, narrated in a nice, uncle-like voice by Mike Grady."

What I love about this book is that it packs a ton of fascinating facts into its 250 pages that I never knew. And it lays out its case that trees are in need of our help - by leaving them alone. This book is not a screaming environmentalist preaching to the choir. It's a knowledgable person speaking to the masses, letting us know that trees need us as much as we need them, and that there's still so much we don't understand about their benefits.Here's my video review -- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZ63g..."
