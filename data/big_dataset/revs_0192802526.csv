0,0192802526,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4331887-steve,2,"Polkinghorne, a student of the great Paul Dirac, may have achieved an undeniable eminence in his field, but I'm afraid I was left mostly unimpressed by this attempt to communicate his ideas. Not only one of the weaker books on quantum theory, but also one of the weaker entries in the Very Short Introduction series as a whole (well, of the few dozen I've read).Two main problems I had with it: 1) Mathematical: It assumes too much of the reader in the way of complex numbers, probability amplitudes, etc. Of course some assumptions of knowledge have to be made, even in something calling itself an introduction - but the author could have done more to elaborate on some of the more vital mathematical content, even without resorting to formulae. 2) Another problem - a surprising one - is its philosophical flakiness. Polkinghorne seems to make some astonishingly flimsy arguments, particularly in the section on positivism. For someone so intellectually gifted, his sloppy reasoning here disappointed me. And to be frank, the explanations are really not the best. I don't doubt Polkinghorne is (was) a great scientist. Just a shame that, on the basis of this book, he seems to have fallen short as a scientific communicator. If you want to get up to speed on the fundamentals of this subject, there are more informative and inspirational books out there:- Quantum: A Guide for the Perplexed - twice the price, but will probably leave you ten times more informed. - Six Easy Pieces - Feynman's compendium has a good section of quantum theory. - Fabric of the Cosmos - Brian Greene's magnificent tome also offers a solid foundation."

To my slight frustration many readers seem to think that this particular subject can just be explained with no mathematical detail; it is quite the contrary. Polkinghorne has done a fine job articulating the basic concepts of quantum mechanics while keeping in the minimal amount of maths needed to retain this fundamental understanding. Anyone who claims there are 'better' books on the subject with less maths, unfortunately, have been deluded by their ideas on understanding the topic. My single gripe with the book is centered around the layout, I prefer the hard bits to be integrated with the main text rather than in an appendix at the end. Although you can reference to it immediately, my brain is wired so it doesn't process as nicely if the information isn't on the same page. "

This book gives a lucid, exciting, and accessible account of the surprising and counterintuitive ideas that shape our understanding of the sub-atomic world. It does not disguise the problems of interpretation that still remain unsettled 75 years after the initial discoveries. The main text makes no use of equations, but there is a Mathematical Appendix for those desiring stronger fare. Uncertainty, probabilistic physics, complementarity, the problematic character of measurement, and decoherence are among the many topics discussed. This volume offers the reader access to one of the greatest discoveries in the history of physics and one of the outstanding intellectual achievements of the twentieth century. "

The author tried to explain some mathematics related to quantum theory very briefly which wasn't actually needed in a book meant for general public. For people who don't have major in Quantum theory will surely feel uneasy in the second half.Verdict : it's worth reading, leave it when mathematics hits you !"

He packs so much of interest into this book that it is a miracle how it can be so short. It is also quite complex I would say (a complex subject though!) that I wonder if it should be called ""introduction"". That is not a comment against the clarity of view, but a comment on the depth that I think he manages to reach."
7,0192802526,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7226831-josh-friedlander,4,"There's a perception of Quantum Mechanics as something mysterious and difficult, but it is actually a well-accepted part of the basic physics any undergraduate would study, and its philosophical mystery is encapsulated in one basic puzzle. Through several decades of what Dirac called ""lots of first rate work done by second-rate minds"", the concept has been experimentally confirmed in incredibly accurate ways. This Very Short Intro is pretty good, considering the philosophical approaches and containing very little (but not zero) maths. Below are my (lightly edited) notes.The story begins with the ""ultraviolet crisis"" in statistical mechanics. Light was well understood by Maxwell's equation as an electromagnetic wave propagated in the luminiferous (ie ""light-bearing"" aether), solved with Partial Differential Equations. Except then you have black body radiation, which the theory predicted to be infinite(!!) at higher frequencies! Bohr realised that it made sense if you saw light as being emitted in quanta - really like a particle. But then is it a wave or a particle? Hold that thought.Then with electrons you also have issues. Thompson imagined that you had a big positive charge studded with electrons, the plum-pudding model. But then they bombarded an atom with alpha-waves which bounced back! That made sense if you imagine that actually all the mass is concentrated in the centre, like a solar system. But then wait: why don't all the electrons crash into the centre? The answer is Pauli's exclusion principle, the electrons don't like to be in the same state or place (this is because they are fermions, unlike light particles (photons) which are bosons, which do like to cluster in one place, which is why we have lasers and also explains some of the conducting effects of crystals). In some sense not only is light (waves) actually a particle, but electrons (definitely a particle, right?) are in fact also waves!Here you have the double-slit experiment: as Feynman said if you meditate on this you have the whole puzzle of QM. Fire a light beam at two slits and you have an interference pattern, because they are waves interfering with each other and on average hitting the centre between the two slits. But fire just one electron and it hits dead opposite the slit, so why do a cluster of them land in the middle? Well this is the wave-particle duality which we still don't have a good answer for, there is Copenhagen idea of complementarity (it is both, very Zen), the theory that electrons are particles that also have shadow waves of potential, Everitt's Multiple Worlds, a similar theory of multiple minds, plus various other theories. Talks a bit about the philosophical implications. Wheeler had this ""delayed choice"" Gedankenexperiment where you measure it after it's fired, so it changes path in mid-flight - trippy! Is it human minds measuring that affects things? What about cats or earthworms, what about computers?There is a bit of the mathematics - Heisenberg used matrix algebra to solve QM, whereas Schrödinger used more conventional PDE but it comes out the same. Dirac theorised positrons, electrons are gaps that pop into existence in a sea of positive charge. Decoherence - the way it becomes macroscopic.EPR asked what if two particles become quantum entangled, generated in such a way that examining the one will affect the other - can this information travel faster than the speed of light? Answer is yes! This is the concept of ""action at a distance"", accepted by Newton, made unnecessary by Maxwell and Einstein, but now revived. "

9,0192802526,http://goodreads.com/user/show/27131192-arko,5,Very crisp and clear content. A must read for science lovers.
10,0192802526,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2105523-bob-nichols,4,"Polkinghorne’s preface opens with this statement: “The discovery of modern quantum theory in the mid-1920s brought about the greatest revision in our thinking about the nature of the physical world since the days of Isaac Newton. What had been considered to be the arena of clear and determinate process was found to be, at its subatomic roots, cloudy and fitful in its behavior. Compared with this revolutionary change, the great discoveries of special and general relativity seem not much more than interesting variations on classical themes.” For Polkinghorne, the quantum world is more than just small (where at the Planck scale “a row of dots looks like a solid line”). At the nucleus level, subatomic particles behave differently than in the deterministic universe of Newton and Einstein, where linear cause and effect relationships are clear. Rather, in the quantum world, there’s Heisenberg’s uncertainty and its “epistemological principle of ignorance” regarding position and momentum that lies at the core of reality. Polkinghorne writes of quantum logic that, as opposed to an Aristotelian true/false dynamic, includes a “maybe,” where what can be said about electrons can only be stated in probabilistic terms. In quantum mechanics, a particle can jump through barriers “provided it reaches the other side quickly enough to pay back energy within the necessary time limit. It is as if the particle had tunneled through the hill.” Per Feynman, we have virtual particles without physical mass that exist as intermediate particles, different than what exists initially or at the end of a process. Polkinghorne states that even Newtonian mechanisms exhibit quantum properties – when very small disturbances make “their future behavior beyond our power to predict accurately. These chaotic systems (as they are called) soon come to be sensitive to detail at the level of Heisenberg uncertainty or below.” Polkinghorne writes that within a vacuum, the lowest energy state, there is still “an infinite collection of harmonious oscillation” with specific frequencies. Even in empty space, particles move (there’s “zero point motion”). A vacuum “is a humming hive of activity,” he says. “Fluctuations continually take place, in the course of which transient ‘particles’ appear and disappear. A quantum vacuum is more like a plenum than like empty space.” Finally, at the heart of the quantum world, Polkinghorne writes that there is a “deep-seated relationality” or correlation between two events where “entities that have interacted with each other remain mutually entangled, however far they may eventually separate spatially.” This, for Polkinghorne, means that at the smallest levels of matter and energy there’s more than pure atomism that is involved.Polkinghorne closes with a chapter on “lessons and meanings.” His quantum world counters positivism with its self-imposed limitation on using only observational data. For him, the quantum world of electrons and photons, quarks and gluons are real, operating at very small scales. They don’t overturn classical theory but they make “intelligible great swathes of physical experience that otherwise would be opaque to us.” The quantum world is a relational reality that transcends atomism. And, he advises, the quantum world is anything but arbitrary. In fact, he argues that it accounts for the fundamental stability of atoms. While probabilistic and not deterministic, and while it operates in a “wraithlike” fashion, the quantum world has order and stability. And “random subatomic uncertainty is very different, indeed, from the exercise of the free will of an agent,” he says for those who attempt to use the meanings of quantum physics this way.Polkinghorne draws heavily on the work of Dirac. He makes several references to “wave-like” and “particle-like,” but the reader is left with the impression of a third subatomic property that is neither a wave nor particle. Here and there, the author leaves his lay readers behind who, lacking in the requisite background, bump into some fairly thick stuff. Yet, this book, while short, is a lucid description of a complex subject."
11,0192802526,http://goodreads.com/user/show/193515-christopher,3,"The insights of quantum physics are key to many technologies we use today, and yet most people are unaware of the key discoveries made already a century ago now, being familiar only with the ""classical physics"" of their basic high school or university science classes. Though I had an inkling of what I was missing out on from being a great reader of hard science-fiction, I needed to familiarize myself with the basics of field, and John Polkinghorne's slim volume in the Oxford ""A Very Short Introduction"" series seemed convenient. Indeed, at little over 100 small-format pages, Polkinghorne does present enough of the field to make you feel like you know the ramifications, even if the real theory is forever beyond you. Polkinghorne only brings in one advanced mathematical concept in the body of the text, eigenvectors, and even that single recourse to maths will probably be too daunting for most readers. Furthermore, even without mathematics, Polkinghorne's writing can often become very egg-headed and opaque, and I was very surprised that his editor at Oxford University Press let all this stand. Clearly no one was able to put themselves in the shoes of a layman reader.Still, readers will enjoy Polkinghorne's historical tales on how famous physicists of the early 20th-century were forced to drastically revise their views when simple experiments did not turn out the way they expected. I am familiar with this book and Cox and Forshaw's The Quantum Universe, and this book is better because it will leave you just as (badly) informed, but it is much shorter than Cox & Forshaw and lacks an annoying rhetorical device in their book.After a productive academic career, Polkinghorne left physics in the late 1970s and became an Anglican priest. His Christian beliefs make absolutely no appearance in the book, and while he dedicates some space to opposing philosophical views on quantum reality, he points to other scientists, never himself. At the end of the book, Polkinghorne tries to deflate ""quantum hype"", the use of new physics to pitch flim-flam. However, what he has in mind among some New Agers is that quantum theory supports ESP. In the years since its 2002 publication date, quantum theory has often been misused by self-help businessmen who claim quantum theory proves that one's thoughts influence the universe, so think positive for riches, but Polkinghorne didn't debunk this form of hype."
12,0192802526,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3398662-remedy-loame,3,"Very accessible, took a little chewing sometimes (probably because my physics background is minimal) but there are some nice slices of science history to be had. I'm sure there are plenty of more substantial books on quantum theory out there, but this was a nice sampling of concepts.Nitpick: Used the words ""fitful"" and ""cloudy"" too much."
13,0192802526,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1339246-gendou,4,"A short overview which wastes time in the mire of philosophy and metaphysics.Sadly avoids mathematics, which is typical for a popular science book.Still, quite informative for the newcomer and good review for those already familiar with the topics."

15,0192802526,http://goodreads.com/user/show/70440331-margarita,3,I think that things Quantum might just be out of my conceptual reach. This book left me with some vocabulary but no depth of comprehension. But it may be that it just is not possible to write a simple book about Quantum Theory?
16,0192802526,http://goodreads.com/user/show/27751101-jose-brox,4,"3.5 stars.I'm not really sure if this book does a good work introducing quantum theory or not. Apart from my previous knowledge on the subject, which makes the decision a bit difficult, it happens that Polkinghorne tends to compound more-than-advisable convoluted sentences, what can obscure their meaning (I just tried to mimick him as an example). On the other hand, he includes some powerful analogies that may help the understanding. There are (almost) no mathematical concepts in the middle of the text, but there are in an appendix (simplified and compressed), in behalf of the mathematically inclined reader. Truth be told, I think that it is impossible at all to get acquainted with quantum theory without an understanding of complex numbers, vector spaces, hermitian matrices and diagonalization. Without knowing this, you will just feel thrown in a mess in which absurd ideas are being taken seriously without a solid background to support them (that you may understand, that's it).The first chapter, on the collapse of classical mechanics, I have found great. Chapter 3 includes a very interesting discussion on the different points of view proposed to fix the measurement problem. The final chapter is the weakest, for it contains a sustained claim in favor of realism that I found illogical: the author seems to momentarily forget that mathematical models can be equivalent and hence physically indistinguishable (fact that he discusses readily after, to argue against Bohmian mechanics in favor of Bohr's in terms of Ockham's razor!) and perhaps to be unaware of the universality of sufficiently complex mathematical models. Moreover, he contradicts himself in the end, for he states that ""it is intelligibility (rather than objectivity) that is the clue to reality"", so he is accepting that the map is not the territory. This is rather funny, considering that he arrives from accusing Einstein of making a similar philosophical mistake."
17,0192802526,http://goodreads.com/user/show/69235751-terry-anderson,4,"The book is just as the title says: A Very Short Introduction to Quantum Theory. Why in heaven's name did I choose to read such a thing? One, I love the word quantum. Two, I'm a biologist and tried to avoid physics and math most of my life (despite having taught physics and math while I was a teacher for 2 years in the Peace Corps), so I figured it was time I tried wrapping my head around something as complex as this. Three, it was on one of those shelves on which the librarians place books they think passing perusers might find interesting. In my case, their advertisement worked.This is a tight little book. Along the way you'll be reunited with familiar people such as Isaac Newton, Albert Einstein, George Thompson, Werner Heisenberg, Max Planck, David Bohm, Niels Bohr, Erwin Schrödinger, and Paul Dirac. And you'll meet terms you may or may not have had reason to use in normal, pleasant, everyday conversation such as quarks, gluons, fractals, decoherence, eigenvectors and eigenvalues, vector spaces, matrix mechanics, and wave mechanics. You'll have no choice but to learn about the GRW Theory, positivism and realism, γ-rays, the uncertainty principle, and the superposition principle.This is an engaging, well-written, interesting little book.

18,0192802526,http://goodreads.com/user/show/63804580-arno-mosikyan,5,"To be frank, we do not have as tight an intellectual grasp of quantum theory as we would like to have. We can do the sums and, in that sense, explain the phenomena, but we do not really understand what is going on. For Bohr, quantum mechanics is indeterminate; for Bohm, quantum mechanics is determinate. For Bohr, Heisenberg’s uncertainty principle is an ontological principle of indeterminacy; for Bohm, Heisenberg’s uncertainty principle is an epistemological principle of ignorance.Positivists see the role of science as being the reconciliation of observational data. If one can make predictions that accurately and harmoniously account for the behaviour of the measuring apparatus, the task is done. Ontological questions (What is really there?) are an irrelevant luxury and best discarded. The world of the positivist is populated by counter readings and marks on photographic plates.Nevertheless, Niels Bohr often seemed to speak of quantum theory in a positivistic kind of way. He once wrote to a friend that There is no quantum world. There is only abstract quantum physical description. It is wrong to think that the task of physics is to find out how nature is. Physics is concerned with what we can say about nature.A slogan for the quantum physicist might well be ‘No undue tyranny of commonsense’."

David mentions the Very Short Introductions book series which gives a (very short) introduction on a wide range of topics, such as business management or Islam, and that for physics, you can get the books in the series that are on physics itself, nuclear physics, particle physics, quantum mechanics and cosmology. He claims that there are over 400 of these books, and they are very small, you can read them in a few hours and pick them up for about $13.

I like the fact that there was considerable discussion of the vital philosophical implications of quantum physics. No clear preference for a philosophical explication of quantum theory was offered, but I do understand Polkinghorne to be a theist (a Christian, as a matter of fact), and I'm sure his understanding of physics does not, by his view, clash with his Christian theology. I wish to read more books on quantum theory, but I have to acknowledge that my powers of comprehension in regard to highly complex physics are quite limited. I love intellectual challenges, though, and physics is sufficient to greatly challenge me.

43,0192802526,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1861537-jim-pearce,4,"Jim PearceThis book explains the history and physics of quantum mechanics in a manner that is concise (90 pages), clear, and void of complex mathematic formulas; they are included, but in the appendix. For most of us, the formulas do not help to explain the text, but they do provide an appreciation of the complexity of the topic. Additionally, these formulas bring to fore realization that physics is a world where observation and mathematics meet; observations must be defined mathematically and mathematical formulas must have their foundations rested in observation, if not now, in the future.One reason this book is so engaging is that the author is not just explaining quantum theory, he is telling a story within a historic context. This is a story of an experiment with light, an observation, that could not be explained, at least not in our commonly shared reality governed by Newtonian physics. The historical perspective of this story is as fascinating as the uniqueness of the theory of quantum physics. This timeline helps us understand the development of the ideas, but also the conflicts and disagreements among these well known theorists. An example is Einstein, he did not believe in quantum theory in part because his own theories were based upon Newtonian physics, and in part because he was on a quest to develop a ""Unified Field Theory"" that would be able to mathematically describe all forces in nature, sometimes referred to ""The Theory of Everything"". As the author explains, even some of the first scientists who began to develop quantum mathematics later began to question the theory itself, because it is a world radically different than ours. Quantum theory explains the physical behavior of atomic and subatomic particles. The difference between Newtonian physics and quantum physics was first demonstrated by the inexplicable wave particle duality of light. In Newtonian physics, light was measured in wavelengths and not considered to have mass. However the author explains how, in part due to Einstein's theories of gravity and how mass relates to energy, and the work of Max Planck, niels Bohr, and others, it was concluded that light acted as both a wave and as a particle, depending how you looked at, or measured it.Quantum Theory really start to gain acceptance when this wave particle duality was explained mathematically, and extended electron behavior as well. Both electrons and photons (light) can behave as particles or waves, depending on the measurements being taken; if you are measuring electrons or light as waves, they behave as waves. If you measure them as distinct particles, they behave as particles. The dualistic nature of small particles lead to the attempt to define the principles mathematically, in a Newtonian context; where is it and how fast is it moving. The ability to measure one or the other, but not both resulted in the second equally important idea of quantum theory, the Heiseberg Uncertainty Principle. Simply stated, you cannot tell the velocity and the placement of an electron. If you successfully identify where the election is, you have lost the ability to measure it's velocity. If you can measure the velocity, you cannot determine the location of the electron, you can only determine the probability of where an electron might be. Later is would be determined that the electron, although within it's orbital shell, is essentially in all possible places about to embark on all possible paths, defined only by probabilities.This reduction of physics to probabilities alienated Einstein and lead to the famous quote, ""God does not roll dice with the universe."" At the time, Einstein was struggling with his Unified Field Theory"" which ran counter to the probabilistic nature of Quantum TheoryInexplicably, the development of the Periodic Table is never really discussed. Quantum Theory and the behavior of electrons provides the theoretical basis of the explanations for each element's placement on the Periodic Table, but is never explored in this book. If the number of protons determine the atomic number of an atom, and the number of neurons determines the isotopes, the electrons are the ones determining the behavior of each element in nature, it's stability, and how the element interacts, or doesn't interact, with other elements.Besides the conspicuous absence of the link between quantum theory and how it confirmed the theory behind the periodic table. I was also looking for a transitional link to nano technology. Finally, the last chapter deals with the defense of quantum theory and how it differs from metaphysics. This, I felt, weakened the whole book, because it answered a question that needn't have been asked. The next book on my shelve is the ""Mystery of the Disappearing Spoon"" which tells the same story, but within the context of the history of the periodic table."

45,0192802526,http://goodreads.com/user/show/19123495-jeff,5,"As a non-scientist, and after reading many books on quantum mechanics over a period of years, I appreciated this book for its concise explanation of the different elements of Quantum theory and how they arose. Because the author did not go into much detail about the Physicists themselves or their lives, but instead stuck to explaining the discoveries and how they fit together in simple ways, I found myself able to grasp and retain much of the larger picture, and understand some of the ideas that had puzzled me, such as quantum decoherence. Likewise, the presentation of quantum superposition was presented in such a way that gave me more insight into its possibilities.Also, I never realized the role that Paul Dirac played in the birth of quantum field theory, and I have decided to read some of Dirac's writings. I listened to this book on audio format at 1.5 times normal speed, which did not seem too fast to grasp the contents. At 1.5x, it took about 2 hours to get through the book. I plan to listen to it again immediately, before going back to other books for review and deeper understanding. Then I will look for more books on this topic to continue to increase my understanding. This book is not the most comprehensive book on the topic by any means, but after having read it I feel better prepared to continue on with my understanding of quantum theories.While quantum theory fascinates me, I also like to write Science Fiction, and I look for ways to employ quantum concepts in my writing in a way that is sub-textual rather than expository. (i.e.: Follow the show-don't-tell rule.) I feel that it is worth understanding how the fabric of reality works and integrating it in hopefully subtle ways with human story lines, and not burden readers with concepts and facts.That is another reason I appreciate the simplicity and straightforwardness of this book."
46,0192802526,http://goodreads.com/user/show/310403-kyle,4,"It is what should have happened a few centuries after Newton's theory of everything became the dominant scientific framework for how things work that classical physicists start dreaming up improbable situations based more on pre-Socratic philosophy than evidence-based research. This is not a slam against the many men (are their any women quantum theorists? - not in this book) who developed a way to explain the very fast and the incredibly small. In explaining the history of quantum theory, Polkinghorne does not let the numbers get in the way, saving the formulae for the Mathematical appendix, but in their place are what, words? His admiration for one of the founding fathers' plainspokenness belies the most intriguing aspect of quantum physics, they are all dreamers who can see beyond the angels dancing on a pin's head and find ways of telling their stories to others. Of course they use math, it is more convincing that way; but really, if an experiment fails to produce expected results, they can just change a fraction or something, right? Even Einstein gets caught up in the fudging-numbers game. But what impresses me most are the images the physicists use: cats in boxes, many worlds, an electron being fired from a cannon etc. Seems a bit bizarre, in the last chapters, to read how some things are not possible with quantum theory (like telepathy or time travel) when a more open-minded approach would be ""has not been proved yet."""
47,0192802526,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5482641-michael,3,"Bit of a let-down this one, I'm afraid. That's not entirely the book's fault. I went in hoping to learn a thing or two about how quantum mechanics work only to discover that we don't really know how it works. Sure we know the formulas and how to make predictions based on them, but we don't know why they work. This then leads into thoughts I'm sure many have had about quantum theory, mainly that it's infuriating. What's most infuriating is that I was able to piece together most of this material before I read the book from Wikipedia articles, so apart from the history I didn't really learn much. What then makes it even more frustrating is the author's lack of focus. I'm not sure if he just ran out of material that could be included at the introductory level (without delving into math) or what, but this book devolves into a discussion of scientific philosophy that seems wildly tangential to its purpose.In summary: If this is your first foray into quantum theory, it's not a bad place to start, but don't expect to get too much out of it, and don't be afraid to start skimming when it begins to wax philosophical."
48,0192802526,http://goodreads.com/user/show/35476004-jarred-aasen,4,"A Very Short Introduction's Quantum Theory was very helpful. As expected, it was slow going at the best of times, but ultimately helped me grasp some of these far out concepts. Polkinghorne is a very intellectual writer, favoring technical descriptions over using imagery to help explain his point. I personally thought he could have used more examples or analogies to help the reader understand his explanations more clearly. The few times he used solid examples (in explaining the transfer of information through entanglement with the analogy of the balls in the urn) really helped solidify the concepts. That aside, I thought this book was engaging and have a rundown on the current ongoings of quantum theory without diving too deeply into the mathematics behind it - which was much appreciated :) If you feel like giving your brain a workout and maybe even learning a thing or two, give this book a read. You'll be able to relate to electrons just a little bit more."
49,0192802526,http://goodreads.com/user/show/48845400-christopher-c-fuchs,5,"An excellent introduction to a subject often shrouded in mystery and hype. Polkinghorne skillfully walks us through the discovery of quantum mechanics, placing it in the broader context of scientific theories, the personalities of the scientists involved, and even a touch of philosophy. 90% of the book is clearly written so that even the mathematically-challenged can grasp the concepts and implications. The remaining 10% is more advanced than general readers may understand but Polkinghorne is compelled to include this material for a complete introductory view of the subject. This does not detract from the book's accessibility and I firmly recommend it to readers even slightly curious about quantum theory. Even if you don't grasp everything (as was my experience), you'll come away with some level of better understanding and a feeling of awe in what we've discovered and how much we still don't know."
50,0192802526,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1544407-jeremy,4,"Of the four Very Short Introductions I have read, this was by far the best. Mr. Polkinghorne never loses sight of his audience.I appreciated the enthusiasm the author brought to the subject, and I found his method of introducting Quantum Theory by tracing the history of quantum discoveries to be very accessible. He took care to avoid deep math, but didn't shy from it when necessary.There were still some parts of this book that went over my head, but I finished it with a desire to know more. I think he's fulfilled the mission of the Very Short Introduction."
51,0192802526,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4867359-giestas,2,"""There is a inescapable trade-off between the increasing accuracy of position measurement and the decreasing accuracy of knowledge of momentum.This fact is the basis of the uncertainty principle: it is not possible simultaneously to have perfect knowledge of both position and momentum. In more picturesque language, one can know where an electron is, but not know what it is doing; or one can know what it is doing, but not know where it is. In the quantum world, what the classical physicist would regard as half-knowledge is the best that we can manage."""

54,0192802526,http://goodreads.com/user/show/37780138-clifton-knox,5,A great short overview of Quantum Theory.This book is great for people seeking a basic view of Quantum theory. Polkinghorne has an easy to read style of writing and is able speak in terms a layman will easily understand. There is some mathematics in this book but it is nothing any undergraduate could not grasp. I enjoyed this book and I highly recommend it to anybody who wants to know what Quantum Theory is all about.
55,0192802526,http://goodreads.com/user/show/18666-pedro,4,"No, seriously, read this book. I know you are mostly into novels and biography, but give this one a chance. Best available explanation of quantum mechanics without math. If you want the math (some of it, anyway) there is an appendix. This is truly the science of the future, forget the books with DNA helices or bursting galaxies on the cover. "
56,0192802526,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5686440-vince,5,Awesome little book. I needed to read this just to clarify my decaying understanding of Quantum Theory. Professor Polkinghorne does a very good job of being fair-handed and clear on the various philosophical positions that quantum mechanics can produce when scientists speculate on the metaphysics implied by 'Quantum Strangeness'. Worth reading by the scientist and the non-scientist.
57,0192802526,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1809206-nick-gotch,3,This book was a nice little review of quantum theory for me. It might be a little advanced for the average person's background but only in some areas. It has some nice analogies and the historical background with mentions of specific scientists and their work is good.

The presentation of the content is a little confusing."
59,0192802526,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5152233-roddy,3,"Hard going, this one. Unless you intend to study Physics at university I would steer clear of this and go for Marcus Chown. I think Polkinghorne is on such a stratospheric level of intelligence that he just can't communicate well with the rest of us!"
