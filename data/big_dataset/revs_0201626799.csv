In my curiosity, however, I skipped to the prologue only to read an absolutely NUTTY conclusion, entirely divorced from the rest of the book. The author is right in suspecting that he is a bit mad. He draws on one of his 'mystical' experiences, draws parallels between the mysticism and the ambiguous relationship with 'ultimate' truth that scientists have, and calls this fear of ultimate knowledge the terror of god, meaning it literally -- yes, that we are projections of a metaphysical god biting at his fingernails, fearing his ultimate realisation, his telos, an immutable glob of nothingness beyond the joys of struggle, change and transformation. Really, I'm not kidding. And yes, I too thought it was a joke at first, some sort of badly played irony. Unfortunately I was wrong...A very simple criticism of his thesis is that before quantum theory, there was only chemistry etc. There were large swathes of nature that still couldn't be explained coherently then, just as there are now. In biology we have certainly established basic principles are and research is likely to be asymptotic. The same can't be said of physics. There is a lot we don't know about nature, and as long as there are things we can't explain, there wi be a possibility that we may one day explain it. Imagine this guy was writing a book like this in Newton's time. His analysis of the sociology of scientists is compelling but a bit warped. Saying that scientists are delusional about their hopes about the future just because they are optimistic about the idea that the best years of science are ahead is a lame criticism. Everyone has hopes and dreams about the future with elements that are not extant in our present time. Criticisms against him, that this book is just another 'end of' book, are right. There is nothing particularly special about our era of science or society. We are about as special as any civillisation in the past. Postmodernist views of science all in all seem compelling to me. We only have a superficial contact with physical reality, and most observable things are limited by our senses and intuitions as well as physical instruments based on our physics, a physics we have constructed in our minds. There is nothing to say that in the future, we can't change our minds about this physics, and gain more sophisticated theories and more sophisticated instruments. There is nothing to say that the state of physics today is as far as we will get. In fact, this idea is absolutely ridiculous.I think many scientists would agree that their object is not truth, but truth-seeking. I don't think much more should be said about it. It would be nice to discover more about the world, and there aren't any real limitations like what Horgan proposes. But I think many of us are content with the notion that we born and we die. Some of us like science because it is knowledge that accretes, which is something that is not going to stop happening. Fundamental discoveries or not, science is wrapped up in the idea that there are interesting questions we can hope to answer. Why is that not enough? Why is this delusional? There ARE interesting qns, fundamental qns, that may yet be answered through science. In fact, it is delusional to assert otherwise, which was the major affront of this book.I do suppose, however, that many prominent scientists choose to believe that a golden age of science lies ahead because they like the idea that there is still work to be done. Somehow, we also tend to conflate this intrinsic joy of learning about the world with being profound narratives, mystical truths about our existence. At the same time, we feel that there is always something more to be known and felt, which we sometimes glimpse through feelings of beauty and rapture. This quote of Wittgenstein perfectly sums up this sentiment:""6.52 We feel that when all possible scientific questions have been answered, the problems of life remain completely untouched. Of course there are no questions left, and this in itself is the answer.""The author, however, believes that 1. we have already got to the point of answering most pertinent scientific questions and 2. such an answer of having no answer to the question of existence is not satisfactory, and therefore we should turn to God to validate our existence. Of course, this is a matter of perspective, and I disagree with both the premises and the conclusion.I suppose the idea that we are at a point where we can feel secure about our understanding of our place in the world through the facts of science is correct, and that further ""fundamental discoveries"" may not change this view too much. In this sense, the philosophical problems of science may have come to an end. Of course, one never knows. One day, we might be able to slip into parallel universes..."
1,0201626799,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11509598-alex-lee,1,"At first I was excited to read this, as Horgan is able to write complex ideas clearly, but then about 1/3 into the book I got what he was doing. I found him disingenuous in how he presents these scientists, almost as caricatures. Much of his ""take"" on their theories are variated with rhetorical questions, and judgements that seek only to influence the reader into seeing that science may have a limit.This may be needed to shake people from their firm belief in science, but the way Horgan goes about doing so is melodramatic and without integrity. For example, he will criticize standard theory in physics saying something like how the field is only 20 years old, and we haven't made any progress! (hinting that there is something wrong with the theory) but then a few pages later he will say something like how black holes have only been discovered for 20 years, the field is too new to say anything meaningful yet. Not exactly a contradiction but you see what I am saying; the judgements he cuts into the text about the scientists themselves, or about their theories or presentation is less than honest. He seeks to make us uncertain about everything in his own book so we can feel that well, maybe this science is crappy or misguided in some way.This purely rhetorical way of attacking content given in good faith by interviewees is disgusting. For a book about complex ideas, there is some kind of philosophical naivete here, where we have expectations of progress that can be verified in some objective way. If Horgan was more honest, he would establish criteria in the book for what progress is, and how science can be measured as to ""living up to"" its potential. But he doesn't do this... although some of the interviewees do talk about this kind of criteria, Horgan seems more interested in finding their person odd than exploring their ideas. I do like the book for its breadth of exploration. And Horgan can be very clear when he wants to be. But his deployment is less than honest."
2,0201626799,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2412448-daniel-toker,3,"If nothing else, this book is a compelling argument for genetic engineering to make humans smarter. One passage which really captures the essence of Horgan's thesis:""Humanity, Nietzsche told us, is just a stepping stone, a bridge leading to the Superman. If Nietzsche were alive today, he would surely entertain the notion that the Superman might be made not of flesh and blood, but of silicon. As human science wanes, those who hope that the quest for knowledge will continue must put their faith not in Homo sapiens, but in intelligent machines. Only machines can overcome our physical and cognitive weaknesses -- and our indifference.""And I must admit that his argument that *human* science is waning is quite compelling. But he constantly confuses the waning of human science with the waning of science in general. Horgan seems to oscillate between a conviction that we know almost everything there is to know, that all that remains for science is to fill in the little details, and a conviction that humans are just too stupid or disinterested to continue with scientific exploration. One of my biggest qualms with this book was the ending. Horgan, who had until that point presented himself as a thoroughgoing monist, rationalist, and skeptic, does a double take and suddenly spouts a sort of mysticism totally detached from anything seen beforehand in the book. He even ends with an argument that once there is nothing else to discover, we must turn back to believing in God since we need something to believe in. That was a bit disappointing. These problems aside, it was very interesting to hear from the scientists and philosophers themselves what they take to be the destiny of their disciplines. Horgan is a fantastic writer, and manages not only to truly capture the personalities of those he interviews, but records these interviews in such a compelling way as to read like a good fiction novel."
3,0201626799,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4696922-ushan,1,"A senior editor at Scientific American interviews a bunch of celebrity scientists and philosophers of science, and tries to get their opinion on the thesis that science is about to end, which is to say we already know everything we can know within practical limits - we would learn a great deal about particle physics if we could construct a 1000-light-years-long particle accelerator, but we can't, so we won't. Unfortunately, this editor himself has no training in science, and so he is unqualified to critically present his respondents' answers. I am embarrassed to make a fool of myself in front of 100 bloggers when I make assertions about areas of science I don't completely understand; apparently John Horgan is not embarrassed to do it in front of what-is-the-print-run-of-the-book? 10000 readers?Site PhysicsWeb.org has ""highlights of the year"" from 1997 on, which include graphene, nondestructive measurement of spin, negative-refractive-index materials, laser-induced nuclear fission, neutrino oscillations, quark-gluon plasma. Computer science has had Grover's and Shor's quantum algorithms, inapproximability using the PCP theorem, and derandomization. Of course, there was much more progress in physics in the 1920s and in computer science in the 1950s, but it looks like science hasn't ended after all since this book was written."
4,0201626799,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8561745-avi,2,"It's easy to look back on this bit of prognostication from 20 years ago and see that it's mostly wrong about everything it says, but I feel like if I'd read it the day it was published I would still have recognized he basic journalistic dishonestly evidenced on almost every page. While it contains a few interesting insights into the philosophy of science, too much of the book is taken up with misrepresenting or simply denying the content of its interviews with prominent scientists in order to bolster the author's specious and spurious thesis."
5,0201626799,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7915393-simon-mcleish,3,"Originally published on my blog here in October 1999.John Horgan originally set out to write a book of profiles of the most eminent scientists of the late twentieth century, based on interviews he had carried out as a journalist for Scientific American. But he became fascinated by a theme he perceived in these interviews, the question of whether we might have almost reached the end of what science can discover about the universe.The first thing he has to do is to define the various ways in which science might end, to establish criteria against which the ideas scientists have about science can be measured, and it is rather unfortunate that this is the least clear section of the book. (This is really because Horgan does not separate this out and state it in an orderly fashion, in one place.)There may be theoretical limits on what can be known, a physical equivalent of Gödel's Incompleteness Theorem. The problem with this is that attempts to apply this mathematical result to science are never very convincing, as Horgan points out. He goes on to argue for this point of view in certain branches of science, where the major theories discussed are not empirically testable. This is clearly the case in historical fields of study, such as cosmology and evolutionary biology, where we cannot prove that any particular theories of the origins of the universe and of life are wholly correct, because these were one off events (as far as we know) in the distant past. All we can do is see if the theories we have come up with match up with what we see around us now (the microwave background and the distribution of matter, the fossil record and Earth's ecosystems).There may be limitations affecting science in general, if a final ""theory of everything"" is discovered. Then there would be no more fundamental revolutions to come in science; it would only be a matter of filling in the details. This is the attitude that nineteenth century scientists are accused of holding, though (again as Horgan points out) historical investigations have tended to disprove specific allegations (Kelvin's supposed speech in which he said that all that there was left to do was to discover physical constants to more decimal places; the patent office official who resigned because nothing was left to be discovered). There is of course the possibility that a revolutionary new discovery will be made, a new theory will be proposed, but even today, Horgan says, the evidence is against it. There has been a dearth of revolutionary ideas since the sixties; most of theoretical science since then has continued steady development of those of the first half of the century (relativity, quantum mechanics, subatomic structure, the synthesis of Mendelian genetics with Darwinian evolution) or from that decade (DNA, the standard model, the Big Bang). Theories currently touted as the next revolution (such as superstrings and various inflation scenarios) contain ideas that may be inherently untestable. This means that we may be moving into an era of what Horgan calls ""ironic science"", a term borrowed by analogy from Harold Bloom's The Anxiety of Influence, an analysis of poetry in the seventies. Lacking new discoveries to make, scientists move away from traditional science to reinterpret older theories and to discuss metascience. In other words, science loses its independent existence and becomes part of philosophy once again.The third reason that science may end is that we no longer have the power to invent deeper theories; science becomes beyond human cognitive abilities. There is, after all, no obvious reason why human beings should be able to grasp the universe of which they form part; in fact, the vastness of the universe by comparison with our minds makes it unlikely. The universe is a complex object; why should it be governed by a simple set of rules? Evidence for this point of view comes from the difficulty of grasping current ideas, increasing specialisation and the length of time needed for becoming a fully fledged researcher in a modern scientific discipline.The fourth reason is more mundane: scientific research is becoming too expensive. Governments, always parsimonious towards pure research, have become even more so since the end of the Cold War. Projects like the Superconducting Super Collider have failed to receive funding because the cost is perceived to outweigh the benefits, and the propaganda value gained from big science projects is less (would the US fund a moon programme today with the same urgency as granted the Apollo project?). In fields like particle physics, bigger and bigger experiments are needed if more fundamental discoveries are to be made, and even then there is no guarantee that they will be made (much of the last twenty years has been spent just confirming the details of the standard model rather than advancing any further). And then applications are not at all obvious; we may not be able to do exciting new things as a result of these experiments, and without applications (results, so far as governments and corporations are concerned), no one is going to fund the research.The first three reasons are interesting philosophical speculations, but it is the fourth that is in my opinion most likely to bring an end to the scientific search for meaning in the universe. The scientific establishment has naturally attacked Horgan's book, because it is negative about the future of science. Yet we live in a world where science is still to some extent seen as the universal panacea that will bring enlightenment and truth, and eliminate all evils (even though some of these evils, such as pollution, are consequences of earlier scientific 'advances'). In this environment, a negative voice is perhaps a good thing; nobody is attacking science strongly enough to destroy public confidence in it in the way that scientific blunders are doing (through food scares like the BSE crisis, for example). There is a tendency towards arrogance among successful scientists, and many could do with thinking a little harder about what they are doing.It is this arrogance which comes over most strongly from Horgan's book; the profiles (which still form the bulk of the material) stay in the mind a lot better than the philosophical argument. Either Horgan doesn't like eminent scientists, or they are a uniformly unpleasant bunch of people. I suspect that the truth lies somewhere in between. Scientists are not benevolent, absent minded, white-haired men in white coats; to be successful in the field can require many of the same qualities as it does to be successful in, say, high finance. The way that people look up to scientists, viewing them as a race apart, can breed arrogance; specialism can lead to an obsession with hobby-horses and blind misunderstanding of other fields. On the other hand, a few interviews with people like this are hardly likely to give you high expectations about meetings with others. So the interviews make the book more interesting, but they do present a rather one-sided view of scientists as a group of people."
6,0201626799,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5208457-d-m-dutcher,4,"Interesting book asking a cross-section of specialists across fields about the limits of science. Horgan's main argument is that science is unlikely to see any more paradigm shifts-new theories in which we radically increase our understanding of the universe. This is because of a few reasons:1. As science solves the low-hanging fruit, the cost of research rises exponentially and becomes impossible to justify.2. There are often perceptual barriers innate in being human that prevent us from either seeing the problem well enough to understand it, like researching our own consciousness, or act as hard limits to prevent empirical verification, like universal distances in astronomy.3. The lack of empirical verification tends to lead to what he calls ironic science: elegant theories which are closer to theology than scientific fact. String theory, for example.There's more than these reasons, of course. It's an entertaining book that tends to drag towards the end, as they stretch out into more soft and even psuedoscientific fields like chaoplexity or machine theology. And it also dimishes many famous scientists, though not by his intention. Many really seem like elderly, distracted cranks, full of their own inconsistencies and eccentricities. Still an interesting book, but chances are like me, you'll skim through the last chapters."
7,0201626799,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1924813-dan,1,"Song and dance from start to finish. If Horgan were serious, then this book would evidence only a lack of imagination. But one or two passages, unless plagiarized, suggest that the author is sufficiently knowledgeable and intelligent that he can hardly be thought to believe what he proposes. True, he quotes scientists whose statements appear to support his view, but he must have omitted everything and everyone else who might suggest otherwise.There is a story, untrue, that someone suggested a hundred years ago that the patent office should be shut down because everything already had been invented. Why does this book remind me of that?"
8,0201626799,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3583387-nebuchadnezzar,4,"I can't recall another book that advanced an argument I so disagreed with but found fascinating and informative anyway. Horgan stands in a long line of figures who have asserted an ""end of science,"" though he handles his argument in a manner that doesn't distract from the meat of the book, which is the interviews with philosophers and scientists.For many, the structure of the book will probably seem hodgepodge or scatter-shot. I found this to be an entertaining delivery, though -- as if you were suddenly thrust into a room filled with the big names of some of the century's major scientific debates, each one taking a brief opportunity to ramble, despair, or pitch their own Big Idea. Having worked in the lab and field myself, I know science is very much a human enterprise. If you spend time around scientists or read about their lives, I think you'll find that their life experiences and personalities very much shine through in their work. Horgan captures this incredibly well with a certain je ne sais quoi that is characteristic of much of his writing.I get the sense that the ""end of science"" theme in the book was bigged up just a bit for commercial purposes (""The Probable Decline in the Rate of Scientific Discovery"" wouldn't sell as well). I definitely agree that we are seeing diminishing returns in certain fields and that the complexity of our knowledge has grown to the point that the days of the lone inventor and garage tinkerer are over when it comes to major discoveries. His characterization of a certain postmodern sensibility he calls ""ironic science"" is astute. However, some of his own examples run counter to his argument. Neuroscience, a field just coming out of its infancy, still has much to discover about the brain and cognition, though I did still enjoy the chapter on it. Nevertheless, I don't feel that the faults in the argument detract from the book all that much as Horgan seems mostly content to let his interviewees do much of the talking.I can see why it wouldn't be everyone's cup of tea, but this is one of my favorite pieces of science journalism."
9,0201626799,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3802880-chiara,5,"I first encountered this book a couple years ago when I was, as I always am, wandering around in my favorite bookshop to occupy my free time and help out customers - most of which are to this day still firmly convinced I work there. Anyway at the time I found it expensive and far too pretentiously titled (also the Italian edition - beautifully elegant but serious nonetheless - with its non-figurative red cover kind of frightened me) so I put it back on the shelf and forgot all about it. A couple weeks ago I happened to be in a bookshop sale and found it again, still kind of pompous looking but with the red cover a little bleached out because of the wear and the significantly lower price; the former hesitancy immidiately turned into compassion for the abandoned book and I decided to give it a try.Horgan's thesis is that science might have reached in the last century its climax and therefore have little left in store for scientists. In the book he argues that there could not - and won't - be any discoveries comparable to that of quantum mechanics or Einstein's relativity. As a journalist Horgan happened to interview a great deal of influent scientists so he thought of putting those interviews together in this book which is divided in chapters named after each scientific field the interviewed people deal with - all of which follow the scary verdict ""the end of"". I have to say, I was too fast judging this book: I found it rather interesting and insightful. Don't misunderstand me, I'm no expert - so that could be partly why - but I enjoyed it a great deal. Horgan's writing is fluent and not a bit dull (as I pictured it to be from the non-figurative red cover). Also I really liked the fact that each time he gave a full description of the person - scientist - he was interviewing so that it was easier for me to picture him/her from more than what they were saying.Overall I'd recommend this book: it probably isn't as up-to-date as it could get - being 20 years old and all - but it certainly gives you an overview on the developings in the main scientific fields."
10,0201626799,http://goodreads.com/user/show/22094221-morgan,2,"The End of Science is about the end of new discoveries in scientific fields more than it's about the end of science as a method of discovery. It discusses many different reasons why scientific discoveries may be harder to make in the future, but the most important one mentioned is that science has been so successful. It's discovered all of the low hanging fruit, and the author claims that we've entered into an era of diminishing returns on investment into scientific investigations.The book is full of interviews the author did with various scientists and philosophers. Many of those interviews took place well after the interviewee did their most famous work. Often, the book compares two different types of scientist in a given field: one who feels that the topic is about solve all of its problems, and another who feels that the topic has fundamentally unanswerable questions. There are a lot of speculative psychoanalyses of various scientists in the book, and many are described as ""scared of success"".The book doesn't claim that the end of science is necessarily bad, just that it's happening. It does claim that many of the un-testable theories currently in vogue are not science as it used to be practiced. The value of these un-testable theories, according to the book, is that they inspire in people a sense of wonder, and a sense that science isn't settled law. Much of the book seems to argue that if we figure everything out, life will in some way be less worth living. I don't agree with that at all.Overall, I thought that a lot of the conclusions about science and the future were pretty tenuous. I also felt that many of the suggestions about what various scientists may have meant by their work or secretly felt were pretty unsupported. The main benefit of the book is that it goes over weaknesses and open questions in many different fields, which is incredibly thought provoking."
11,0201626799,http://goodreads.com/user/show/79493725-yk-ak-n,5,this is a true gem. to better your understanding of science and to laugh at popper. 
12,0201626799,http://goodreads.com/user/show/109535466-mike-parkes,4,"Perhaps you have told your boss to take this job and shove it when leaving a job or changing careers… John Horgan wrote a whole book that reads as a long resignation letter from his profession of science writing. One that I found immensely entertaining and infuriating at the same time, almost twenty-five years after it was written.This book is really two books in one. Book one contends that we are approaching the limits of science. The great era of scientific discovery is over, and “further research may yield no more great revelations or revolutions, but only incremental, diminishing returns.”  In Horgan’s view, many of the greatest remaining challenges – consciousness, the origin of the universe, the origin of life – are not “problems” that can be solved, but “mysteries” that cannot be answered, due to multiple factors including lack of historical evidence, the role of chance, and perhaps the limitations of our own mind.As a consequence, Horgan asserts that many of the best-known scientists working on these cutting-edge issues are actually practicing “ironic science”, generating speculative and untestable ideas that do not converge on the truth. Horgan makes an accurate point that the public has a strong appetite for scientific revolutions, which (aided by promotion by scientific journalists) leads to more publicity for some of the woolier theories than is warranted by the evidence, at the expense of more mundane science. Sometimes the emperor (Penrose, in this case) may truly have no clothes.But a little of this attitude goes a long way. The greatest strength of this book is that Horgan’s time as a writer for Scientific American gave him access to almost all of the best-known scientific minds. There doesn’t seem to be a well-known scientist still alive in the 1990s that Horgan didn’t interview and profile. Unfortunately, he uses this unprecedented access largely to simplify and mock the work and views of these scientists. Only Francis Crick and a very few others come away unscathed.Horgan has set up a bit of a strawman here. He may indeed be correct that the most fundamental theories of science (the Big Bang, Darwin’s theory of evolution, etc.) are unlikely to be overturned or modified in truly substantial ways (although I would suggest that he is unduly pessimistic about his conclusions as to where the limits are and what we can find out; for example, the discovery of “dark energy” since the book’s publication is one truly fundamental and unexpected challenge to our current understanding). But this is not the only type of relevant or interesting science. Horgan has little interest in straightforward science that does not overthrow paradigms ( mere “puzzles”), in historical/descriptive science (the understanding of biodiversity is “a mindless glass bead game”) or applied science. Many of these areas have seen huge advances in the two decades since the book was written, that I suspect engage the interest of many others, if not Horgan. For example, we now know vastly more about the history of life on earth, including human evolution, largely through application of molecular biology tools, and much more about the arrangement of matter in the universe (e.g., exoplanets).Book two is a philosophy book. If book one’s thesis is correct and we are reaching the limits to science, what does this mean for humans? For many scientists, and for Horgan himself (judging by the unusual epilogue), the end of science is nothing less than an existential crisis. “What will scientists do if they succeed in knowing what can be known. What then, would be the purpose of life?”However, based on a discussion with Francis Fukuyama, Horgan concludes, accurately, I think, that for the population as a whole, science is not such a central pillar of our lives: “science was less a byproduct of our will to know than our will to power”, and “whatever the long-term destiny of Homo sapiens turns out to be…it will probably not be the pursuit of scientific knowledge.” Certainly, coming to terms with a general slowdown in material progress - imposed by resource exhaustion, environmental concerns, and, yes, a slowdown in advances in many areas of applied science, is a broader question that many other writers have grappled with in more detail. I can recommend John Michael Greer – his essay on a requiem to the space age is a nice starting point: https://www.resilience.org/stories/20...All in all, I can strongly recommend this book, even if you disagree with its conclusions. A useful counterpoint is John Maddox’s “What Remains to be Discovered”, written just after “The End of Science”."
13,0201626799,http://goodreads.com/user/show/18216012-daniel-cunningham,2,"It seems there is a simple statement at the heart of this book: ""We're not going to find anything as world-altering as General Relativity, Quantum Mechanics, or Darwinian Evolution in the future."" And maybe this is correct. (modulo e.g. resolving dark matter/energy.)Attached to this is a critique that much of public science communication is just boosterism or ""ironic science,"" as defined by Horgan (which would be 'speculative' science to the rest of us.)It's hard to argue with either of these. Maybe we will need to replace the standard model to account for dark matter; but that replacement will contain the standard model. QM and GR need to be married, but that marriage will contain QM and GR. Will either of these things be as revolutionary as their predecessors? Horgan argues no, based on some faith and a bit of argument. I'm not so sure, but there is a strong possibility he is right.Nonetheless, science may be limited in many ways, few of which are ever discussed in pop-science books. This book tries to do that... but fails to be convincing on several fronts.The first is that while I share some of Horgan's sense of, ""Well, this is just BS,"" in regards to some popular theories/areas/subjects, he doesn't argue that these areas are non-productive so much as he argues that the people promoting/researching in them are ""ironic scientists."" He also, it seems, caricatures or even... cherry picks... to make his point. (That is my impression; not a fact.) Additionally, he fails to discuss whether the cruft around the edges is normal. Perhaps there is always a certain amount of BS swirling about the edges of 'real' science; perhaps 'ironic' science isn't new or unusual or significant. I think it's easy to forget all the ideas, good and bad and 'not even wrong', left on history's cutting room floor.Second, the argument that we've found out enough that there simply isn't room left on the map for world shattering discoveries to be hiding is compelling. But that is all. Maybe figuring out what e.g. dark matter is will involve some truly fundamental shift in physics. Maybe there is some deep revelation waiting in network/complexity/brain studies/sciences. Point is, we won't know until it happens. (Though, yes, we can, so to speak, constrain phase space and say it is more an more unlikely when/if 2050, 2100, 2250, 2500 passes and no new discoveries have come.)Third, even if his point is valid, I'm not sure it's quite the existential crisis he makes it out to be. E.g. terraforming Mars is 'mere engineering', but I'm sure it would absorb a lot of the mental 'spare cycles' of those so inclined. He mentions and kind of dismisses lifespan extension... as if this wouldn't be earth shattering to scientists and lay persons alike, even if not as fundamental in some pure, Platonic sense as e.g. General Relativity.Horgan also leaves some points just lying on the table. He discusses science becoming too complex for humans but what if it simply becomes too bulky? He could have explored more the idea that as science builds up there is more training required to become an expert who can contribute; already young scientists will be near 30 when finishing their first post-doc, and many will be older if they don't follow a strictly 'standard' educational path. This isn't, strictly speaking, a matter of science; it is at least as much one of pedagogy and perhaps one of human lifespan (so, science/technology.)"
14,0201626799,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2436371-dennis-littrell,5,"Well, no, not quite yetOne the strengths of this book is the outrageous way John Horgan writes about the august scientists of our time and the forthright way he reveals his subjective impressions. Also one finds delight in the colorful and descriptive language. Some examples:Visible matter in the universe as ""just foam on a deep, dark sea."" (p. 96) Dawkins as ""Darwin's greyhound"" (cf. Huxley as his ""bulldog"") on page 116.This exchange on page 125: ""What's beyond the brick wall?"" ""But that's Cartesian space, and even if space is curved you still can't help thinking what's beyond the curve, even if that's not the right way of thinking about it.""My sentiments exactly! and something I've felt for many years. I used to hate it when I was told that there was nothing ""as a matter of definition"" beyond the universe as defined in the Big Bang model, and advised to stop thinking in terms of something beyond!Useful as a Zen koan is Horgan's question on page 247, ""What would we do if we could do anything?"" Ditto for ""What will mind chose to do when it informs and controls the universe?"" (from Freeman Dyson on p. 254). Also appearing in this book is the question (my formulation), ""Why is there anything at all; why isn't there nothing?"" This question also appears in other books, for example, Edward O. Wilson's On Human Nature and John Taylor's When the Clock Struck Zero. I mention it because it is my favorite ""Zen koan"" kind of question. I first stumbled across it as a teenager, and experienced an instant enlightenment. It seemed to me that by being able to pose such a question I had proven the existence of God.. Not the sort of God Horgan talks about who is afraid of death. No this God was more like the God of the Vedas about which nothing can be said. I don't mean ""proven"" in the scientific sense or even in a sense that would necessarily be meaningful for anyone else. I suspect my experience was similar to that of Descartes when he thought he had proven that he existed when he said, ergo cognito sum. Of course he had proven nothing since to say ""I think"" is to assume a thinker, linguistically speaking, at any rate.I like Horgan's idea of ""ironic science"" and I'm amazed that he could get a whole book out of the idea of ""the end of science,"" since the end of science is just another way of saying the end of human knowledge or the limits of our ability to know or to explore.A nice bit of self-revelation at the end is Horgan's speculations on that God who created the world as a puzzle to ""shield himself from his terrible solitude and fear of death."" That was sporting of Horgan since now his critics will be able to accuse him of anthropomorphizing God as is done in some very familiar religions.Anyway this is an excellent book and I enjoyed reading it and I recommend it highly.  --Dennis Littrell, author of “The World Is Not as We Think It Is”"
15,0201626799,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10887793-julie,1,"This book did not age well.Written in the early 90s by John Horgan (for context, he's a journalist, and mainly penned pieces for 'Scientific American'), it's desperately trying to convince you that science, as most of us know it, has burnt out and, well, has nothing more to discover. I beg to differ. And I beg to differ with its style.He's American, so he naturally thinks the world revolves around him and his ideas. He's also white, and a man. And this was written in a time where basically trying to portray your interviewees as caricatures was acceptable. So yeah, the premise is 'if I disagree with them, I'm gonna slander them'. And that's what he does for 300 or so pages. His depiction of Popper is less than flattering, and so's the one of Kuhn (as a funny aside, the way he describes the interview is a frustrated Kuhn constantly going 'you're not getting this', him saying 'no, I understand' and then missing the point completely). However, I'm glad science proved him wrong. Because, even if your day and age is not the one of discovering novel great theories (I'm still a unification hopeful), at least we have a LHC. And that's the thing: science will never stop asking questions, it will just shift focus every now and again."
16,0201626799,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3735884-stephen-cranney,3,"Overall agree with his thesis (at some point our technological development will hurt diminishing returns and we'll plateau), but given the nature of the book you think he'd put more energy into updating it for new editions, but his examples were all still drawn from the 90s. "
17,0201626799,http://goodreads.com/user/show/34340409-sanjay-varma,3,"This would be a good book for someone interested in the topic. A few chapters were great such as the chapter announcing “The End of “Chaoplexity,” which contains a section about the limits of computer simulations used by global warming proponents. I didn’t like the way he portrayed scientists, in aggregate, as curmudgeons."
18,0201626799,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5437698-shameer-ks,4,"A book I recommend to the atheists, the die-hard fan of Dawkins, to use as a needle to prick in their inflated selves "
19,0201626799,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1826775-a-reader,4,"The end of science, or the Star Trek Factor?In “The end of science” John Horgan is pursuing provocative questions.Has science been entered an era of diminishing returns?Is physics moving towards absolute truth?Would be able physicists to prove a final theory in the same way that mathematicians prove theorems?John Horgan’s thesis is that we are coming to an era where all the fundamental scientific theories have been discovered and science as we know it today is coming altogether in an end. Horgan considers fundamental, theories such as Darwin’s natural selection, Einstein’s general relativity and quantum electrodynamics. That means theories that can apply, to the best of our knowledge, throughout the entire universe at all times since its birth.In order to prove his thesis, Horgan has interviewed interesting scientists and philosophers from the entire scientific and social-philosophical landscape. Roger Penrose, Noam Chomsky, Thomas Kuhn, Paul Feyerabend, Freeman Dyson, Stephen Jay Gould, Carl Popper, David Bohm, Edward Wilson, John Wheeler, Lynn Margulis, Andrei Linde, Daniel Dennet and many others.I must say that I disagree with Horgan’s argument and I find his view very shortsighted. Horgan is not the first or the last person to argue over the-end-of-science-era. At the end of the nineteen century, physicists also thought they knew everything. But only two decades later Einstein and other physicists discovered relativity theory and quantum mechanics. These theories transformed physics and opened up vast new vistas for modern physics and other branches of science.The end-of-science argument and timing (millennium and link with Fucuyama’s End of History) have caused wide-range and “confusing” reactions and responses form science critics, scientists themselves, and even from Clinton’s Science Advisor who publicly repudiated Horgan’s argument. We can safely say that it is a discussion/debate that still goes on.In my personal opinion the value of the book is not in the message and if we are/ or not denouncing it. Horgan is a science journalist with an education in literature. I think, his background makes the difference in the way he writes about science. With his prose style, he manages to fill gaps that other science writers fail to do, and make scientific writing an interesting adventure. He has the gift not only to make scientific theories understandable for the non-scientists readers but also to reveal beautifully his interviewee’s personalities. These interviews, the presentation of scientists as human beings, are the most interesting insight for me in the book.Reading the book I had the feeling that Horgan tried to construct a psychological and ideological profile of each one person and it was fascinating to “discover” the eccentricities of the scientists who invented?/developed? some of the most interesting scientific and philosophical theories in the 20th century.As for the end of science? As a scientist I am optimistic. The best in science are still to come. But my view (as a Star Trek fun) is possibly distorted by what Horgan call in his book (p.244-245) the Star Trek factor.“How can science be approaching a culmination when we haven’t invented spaceships that travel at warp speed yet?”"
20,0201626799,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2674867-lynn,3,"Started out great and then ended okay. This is really a book on philosophy of science, not science. Toward the end, it felt like a bunch of ramblings by scientists, half of which I’ve never even heard of. Great early interviews of those I have heard of though, Richard Dawkins, Karl Popper, Francis Crick, etc. Many of the later interviews seemed like a hodgepodge of musings by scientists; some interesting, some not so interesting. The book seemed to fall apart toward the end, as many of the scientists and even Horgan himself became almost incoherent. After starting out so great, it's too bad he didn’t end the book 100 pages early.As far as the main argument of the book is concerned, I guess I am somewhat convinced, but I’m not really sure “end” was that well defined. The definition kept changing as scientists talked with Horgan. I’m more impressed with his access to this group of scientists than the book itself, although I’m always impressed with his skills as a science writer. The fact that the book is almost 15 years old didn’t help either. "
21,0201626799,http://goodreads.com/user/show/120380-jeff,3,"The basic thesis of Horgan's book is that there is a finite number of revolutionary, paradigm shifting ideas in science (see The Structure of Scientific Revolutions by Thomas Kuhn). Given this, the reality of diminishing returns imply that more and more work must be invested between each major discovery, and most of science becomes filling in details. The book was panned by many scientific critics because it suggests that the grand scientific enterprise will inevitably slow. Given the fundamental nature of the debate, it is fascinating that even scientists disagree on how much truth there is to Horgan's argument. On the other hand, you don't have to agree with Horgan in order to appreciate his thumb-nail sketch of the many famous scientists he interviewed to bolster his argument."
22,0201626799,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2796168-shea-mastison,3,"This book has a fascinating premise and moments of great humor. John Horgan interviews many great contemporary scientists in an effort to discovery whether the age of relentless scientific progress is drawing to an end. It's uncomfortable to imagine that their are no new fundamental laws or theories for scientists to discover--nothing on par with the Big Bang Theory or Darwinian biology on the horizon. Being one of the types who could accept ironic science on its own merits; I think Horgan is wrong in assuming that the future of science will be detailed oriented only, but he does a good job of making that argument. If you like popular science or science journalism, this is worth a read. "
23,0201626799,http://goodreads.com/user/show/176402-peter,4,"I found myself feeling alternatively hopeful and very depressed reading this book. The underlying question, one that reaches across many fields of science, is whether the ""big"" questions have all been answered. Some say yes, definitely, and that contemporary science is just fighting over the incremental scraps. Others think there are other big questions, such as consciousness, that are still waiting to be confronted. Others think some questions will never be answered by our puny human brains, and we'll have to wait for robots to do it (for real). If you read just a couple of chapters, check those on physics as well as the chaos/complexity chapters."
24,0201626799,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10761851-corn,4,"With a title like that, how can you only casually read this book? Well the message might not be as drastic as the title suggests, but it does predict some sort of end. And now, 15 years later, it makes for interesting reading. Especially the interviews with many big names in the field are still very valuable. But as a scientist, I don't feel like being in the twilight at all. Because for all the talent packed together in the book, not a lot of changes that happened since then were even remotely foreshadowed. Still entertaining to read, time has eroded its controversy and science simply carries on. Or to put it differently, predicting is difficult, especially into the future."
25,0201626799,http://goodreads.com/user/show/64863-lubna,3,"Overall, I really enjoyed this book - it is a series of interviews with noted scientists & thinkers & covers a variety of scientific fields including cosmology, evolutionary biology, physics, neuroscience, etc. It is very accessible to non-scientists & makes some controversial claims. A good introduction to some of the most perplexing & exciting scientific problems scientists are grappling with these days. "
26,0201626799,http://goodreads.com/user/show/712285-brian-steed,0,"Although primarily a vehicle for Horgan’s belief that science, with Darwin and Einstein behind us, has reached the point of diminishing returns and is now made up in large part of “ironic” studies, the book’s main fascination is the broad overview it presents of the way science is perceived by many of today’s prominent practitioners. Very absorbing stuff, and Horgan’s thesis is very persuasive. In fact, I think it’s permanently colored my view of the science timeline."
27,0201626799,http://goodreads.com/user/show/558206-eric,0,"I like it when math and science are linked to mathematicians' and scientists' personalities. Maybe I'm just being a fluffy headed idiot for this.Interesting book.After a while, the scientists just sort of swirl together into a indistinct jumble, and I had to sort of force-march my way through it.But I think it was worthwhile just to get a rough overview of what's going on in the scientific world."
28,0201626799,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7614037-dion,2,"This book reveals the bankruptcy of the ideas of scientists who wax philosopical without an understanding of the philosophical basis of science; their themes frequently contradicting it.
