0,9625936459,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3461034-trish,5,"For 8 years, from 1854 to 1862, Alfred Russel Wallace journeyed to the southern portion of the Malay Archipelago including Malaysia, Singapore, the islands of Indonesia (then known as the Dutch East Indies) and the island of New Guinea, travelling over 14.000 miles.But the 2 volumes he wrote about his journey chronicle not only his exploration of the region and his encounters there, they also describe in detail some of the 125.660 specimens he collected, mostly of insects though he also brought home thousands of molluscs, birds, mammals and reptiles. The books include gorgeous illustrations as well as detailed sketches (though I found out in the meantime that Wallace didn't produce these illustrations and sketches himself) that made reading this account even more exciting.The author structured the books to take the reader from island to island, much like the author himself travelled, telling of the islands' geographies, human populations, the volcanoes, plants and animals. In between we also learn of the difficulties such journeys pose, the threats, and how he was helped several times by all kinds of people, indiginous and otherwise.Volume 1 thus starts in Singapore, moving on to Malacca and Mount Ophir, then Borneo (which the author dedicated 3 chapters to), Java, Sumatra, Bali and Lombock, Timor, Macassar, Menado, Banda and Amboyna.Volume 2 picks up at Ternate, then moves on to Gilolo, the Kaióa Islands, Batchian, Ceram, Goram and the Matabello Islands, Bouru, Aru islands, Ké islands, then going back to the Aru islands for 4 chapters, before going to New Guinea, Ceram, Waigiou and, finally, Ternate. The last few chapters of this volume are dedicated to birds of paradise and the races of man.Apart from the amicable writing style, I noticed that Wallace was a bit different from other naturalists of his time by not describing himself as being very adventurous. Weird for a guy who travelled from island to island for 8 years. He seems to have been self-confident but not arrogant (you know, in a British colonial sort of way). And I loved that he only believed in what he could see for himself and examine (which probably explains his meticulousness).I must admit that I found these books by coincidence and that I hadn't known about this man before despite him being one of the co-discoverers of natural selection and him obviously having been an influence on other, perhaps more well-known, naturalists and later scientists! There is for example the Wallace-Line, a faunal boundary he drew in 1859 (it was named later by the English biologist Thomas Henry Huxley) that separates the ecozones of Asia and Wallacea, a transitional zone between Asia and Australia.Or the Wallace-Effect, which is a process of speciation (also known as reinforcement) where natural selection increases the reproductive isolation between two populations of species as a result of selection acting against the production of hybrid individuals as those would be less fit. While the modern concept originates from another scientist, Wallace did lay the foundation.As you can see, the man was important for our modern understanding of the natural world, evolution and geology and I'm glad I found this gorgeous edition of his journals (yes, the design is what made me buy them) and that I was thus able to complete my own journey through natural history and the voyages of discovery from around that time by also having read this meticulous man's journals."
1,9625936459,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10494659-stephen-joyce,4,"The Malay Archipelago by Victorian English naturalist Alfred Russel Wallace was first published in 1869 and dedicated to Charles Darwin. Wallace is perhaps most famous for postulating the view, without specific reliance on Darwin’s theory, that life evolves. The Malay Archipelago was an instant and resounding success and has since been republished and translated many times.Published by the National University of Singapore (NUS), this latest version is unique on several counts. Most notably, editor John van Wyhe, a historian of science at NUS and an expert on both Wallace and Darwin, has used his extensive knowledge to skillfully annotate Wallace’s original text—the first of its type in English. Hundreds of footnotes point out factual errors, provide explanations for inconsistencies, add more detail to illuminate certain points, provide context for certain sections and give common names for species of animals, insects and plants.The book is beautifully produced with a mid-section of color drawings that depict animals, birds, insects and flowers. Dotted through the chapters are new charcoal sketches of exotic birds, animals, indigenous people and significant places. As well as an updated itinerary and wonderful maps that brings Wallace’s epic journey even more to life, the original illustrations are also included. The Malay Archipelago text itself is, in Wallace’s own words, the result of “eight years of wanderings among the largest and most luxuriant islands which adorn our earth’s surface.” He travels across current day Java, Borneo, Sumatra, Sulawesi, The Philippines, Bali, Timor, Papua New Guinea and many more islands in between. We are treated to his thoughts, impressions, experiments, findings and analysis of scientific data on what he saw, experienced and collected during his wanderings.From a very modest background, Wallace survived by selling his specimens to museums in Britain—but he was no mercenary. His love for travel and commitment to the study of nature are revealed in every chapter. This, on a butterfly now called Wallace’s Golden Birdwing: The beauty and brilliancy of this insect are indescribable, and none but a naturalist can understand the intense excitement I experienced when I at length captured it. In the course of his trip over 100,000 creatures, insects, flowers, plants were collected, captured and studied by him and his team of assistants, most from indigenous populations. Of course, many birds and animals were shot and killed—the orang-utan being the most famous. Indeed, among the most astonishing sections are those that contain details of Wallace’s encounters with Borneo’s orang-utans. It is not for nothing the book is subtitled “The Land of the Orang-Utan, and the Bird of Paradise”.Despite shooting dead its mother (warning: there is little remorse for killing in the name of science) he shows incredible compassion and affection for an injured and orphaned infant orang-utan: When handled or nursed, it was very quiet and contented, but when laid down by itself it would invariably cry. I fitted up a little box for a cradle, with a soft mat for it to lie upon…and I soon found it necessary to wash the little Mias* as well…and when I brushed its hair [it] seemed perfectly happy. * Dyak name for orang-utan As well as being an adventurous explorer and skilled botanist it is clear Wallace was also a talented writer. The literary merit and page-turning qualities of his prose are evident at every turn. His writing is vivid and evocative, in particular, the extensive descriptions of the birds he caught, dissected or studied.On finding a new species of the famous Bird of Paradise, beautifully illustrated in this edition, Wallace writes: The general plumage is very sober, being a pure ashy olive with a purplish tinge on the back; the crown of the head is beautifully glossed with a pale metallic violet and the feathers at the front extend as much over the beak as in the rest of the family.* * *In later chapters, Wallace moves away from flora and fauna, giving us “A general sketch of the races of man in the Archipelago”. Seemingly incongruous with what has come before, these sections are nevertheless important because they define his views on the clear racial and cultural differences between the Malay and Polynesian peoples, i.e. that they developed almost entirely separately from each other.Some readers may wish to approach the ‘human’ chapters with caution. Wallace’s comments on “savages” and the relative beauty and moral character of different races appear insensitive or even racist to today’s ears. But he was of course a man of his era and the terminology he used needs to be viewed in the light of more respectful comments on the native populations.In one of more profound moments of philosophical insight in The Malay Archipelago, Wallace praises the law-free yet peace-loving societies he comes across all over the region and contrasts them favourably against Victorian Britain, with its growing socio-economic problems. Perhaps intending to criticise European society more than to proclaim the superiority of the people he met on his travels, Wallace writes: ...it is very remarkable that among people in a very low stage of civilization, we find some approach to such a perfect state. In such a community, all are nearly equal. There are none of those wide distinctions, of education and ignorance, wealth and poverty, master and servant which are the product of our civilization.* * *The publication of this book is a triumph for the NUS. Those interested in expanding their knowledge of natural sciences, including students and others already aware of Wallace, will find this edition rewarding.But it deserves to find a wider audience among lovers of the region’s flora and fauna as well as those attracted by a great historical travel saga. In his excellent, informative Introduction, John van Wyhe claims that Wallace was “indisputably one of the great naturalists” of his age.Elegantly written, The Annotated Malay Archipelago containing Wallace’s seminal contribution to science and nature, runs to almost 800 pages and can be dipped into now and again or enjoyed as a long involved read."
2,9625936459,http://goodreads.com/user/show/442654-andrew,0,"Oh, to be a 19th Century man of science and discovery! To drink bitters and claret upon a ship with a name like the ""HMS Gallant"" and smoke a pipe of finest Virginia 'pon the sands as your Balinese boys fetch you a cocoa-nut for an evening repast. As someone who was raised on a steady diet of Indiana Jones and Sherlock Holmes, I need no convincing.And Wallace is rapturous about everything he comes into contact with. Whether he's writing about the virtues of breadfruit, the plumage of a tropical bird, or how he beat an orangutan too severely this time, he's a compassionate and witty observer, and also faintly ridiculous.Of course, a lot of Goodreads reviewers are going to comment on Wallace's racism. To be fair, while he comes off as a haughty Victorian imperialist nowadays (yeah, those Malays need to be in perennial debt to coffee planters so they can develop a work ethic!), his views in the context of the time were almost radical: ""We shall never, as regards the whole community, attain to any real or important superiority over the better class of savages.""""As regards true social science, we are still in a state of barbarism.""Ladies and gentlemen of the jury, defense rests."

4,9625936459,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9946326-paulfozz,4,"With eight years of travel around the islands of Indonesia to condense into one volume there was bound to be some repetition, and at points I did feel a certain ennui when a pattern established itself of ""travel to island, meet head man, arrange house, go collecting, prepare collections, fight predations of insects upon collection, become dissatisfied with range of wildlife, leave island'. But though it did have aspects of this it is a book of such broad scope and I can see how Wallace wanted to cover every aspect of the region that he could, that you can forgive these small difficulties upon the reader. This was the period when evolution, geology and other sciences were being worked out and it is fascinating to see these new ideas taking shape in the pages of Wallace's book.He also demonstrates the oddities of the Victorian mindset; both regarding the indigenous people as 'savages' and primitive, yet at the same time feeling that they are somehow presenting a far more enlightened civilisation than that of the western world.A fascinating book, for certain."

6,9625936459,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10505847-mary-soderstrom,4,"A book that is as much fun to read as Voyage of the Beagle. The revolutionary ideas of Wallace and Darwin about the evolution of species were presented jointly, but only after Wallace had asked Darwin's opinion of his own exposition of the proposition. This book gives an account of the several years that Wallace spent collecting specimens and thinking about what he saw in what is now Indonesia and Malaysia."
7,9625936459,http://goodreads.com/user/show/152822-archer,3,"This has been permanently shelved for the time being. A brief note: from what I read, one of the more interesting aspects were the pure imperial aspects and different attitudes of the time. This man was, in as much as we could say of that era, a naturalist. Yet, the way he enacted this was more or less to kill any interesting animal he saw and preserve it for science. I had a hard time stomaching the massacres of orangutans, the orphanage of a baby, which he attempted to feed on coconut milk, and which subsequently starved to death. Herein lies the question, what is best for the environment. Unquestionably, this man's methods seem contrary to the preservation of animal life, but the knowledge he brought to the western world through the preservation of the dead specimens would eventually help to bring recognition of the amazing ecological diversity of lands outside their own, and the need to preserve them. BUT, would these places and their creatures be in danger at all if not for the spread of imperialism and western culture, which promotes intensive agriculture for export and convinces people of a need to live a very inefficient and wasteful lifestyle? Who is to say again that those very same people would eventually not develop these things on their own? So many questions.In one of David Attenborough's videos on youtube, he is reflecting on the things he has just seen, and then pulls out this book and proceeds to read from it. Apparently this was also Conrad's ""Bedside Companion,"" and Wallace, who wrote it, proposed a theory of natural selection in a letter to Darwin only a short while before Darwin himself was to publish ""On the Origin of Species."""
8,9625936459,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3295638-bramble,1,"Do not read the Stanfords Travel Classics edition. One of the few books I've ever read where the typographical errors detract from the sense and the enjoyment of the narrative. Natives in brass huts! Canoes on the peaches! I'd say the error rate is higher than 1/page.In fact, the publisher's negligence suggests ethical and intellectual failings bordering on criminal. The only book I've ever read where ONE LETTER WORDS were spelled wrong. Obviously this series is a scam which attempts to use automated character recognition and a spell-checker to make an easy buck from unsuspecting readers.Otherwise a fascinating artifact of one of Victorian England's most important field naturalists. You may cringe as he slaughters orangutans (for Science!), and his views of nature and society are certainly affected by his culture, but come on: this is a first hand narrative of the birth of biogeography, evolutionary theory, and our understanding of plate tectonics. Not to mention the ultimate 3-page rant on the moral inferiority of ""civilized"" vs. ""primitive"" man.I'd give Wallace's material -- to the extent I could judge -- 4-5 stars. The nocturnal sailboat expedition in comet-light is worth the effort by itself. And I'll be looking for a facsimile edition.I recommend this book. Find an edition with the original figures. Find an edition that's been proofread. "
9,9625936459,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1524436-nancy,5,"Alfred Russel Wallace is the man who simultaneously to Darwin came up with the theory of evolution by natural selection. Wallace had no college degree and came from a poor English family, unlike Darwin, and he deferred to Darwin and gave Darwin credit for the theory throughout his life. The Malay Archipelago chronicles Wallace's eight years exploring and documenting the natural history of southeast Asia from Singapore through Indonesia and to Papua New Guinea. Of strong constitution, unlike Darwin, he withstands malaria, dengue fever, being stuck at sea for weeks at a time, and near attacks by vipers and other creatures. Everywhere he went, he quickly won over indigenous people with his quiet and friendly demeanor, while he amassed tremendous collections of species new to science for museums in England. Read this book if you are interested in natural selection, biogeography, natural history, southeast Asian culture, and adventure."

11,9625936459,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1492668-mark,4,"Alfred Russel Wallace's 1869 account of his travels and observations in what is today Indonesia and that occurred mostly in 1858, the year that he and Darwin published on the Theory of Evolution. Wallace describes his adventures visiting the many islands in the archipelago and his constant search for and preparation of bird and insect specimens that he sent back to England and with which he supported himself. At one point he comments that he is the only white person residing on the thousand-mile-long island of New Guinea, where he is primarily interested in finding new examples of the Bird of Paradise. His description of hunting the Orang-Utan is especially disturbing in light of its recent endangerment. Wallace discusses the biogeography of the archipelago at length including the faunal divide that would later be called the Wallace Line. He also discusses the people of the islands at length, frequently comparing the Malay and Papuan ""races"" and their degrees of civilization or barbarity. This Victorian view of humanity is sometimes trying, although Wallace makes several comments admiring the noble savages around him who live in peace and harmony without any of the oppressive social structures that are necessary at home. (Later in life he became a social activist supporting women's suffrage and opposing eugenics, the destruction of the environment by human activity, and militarism.) The Folio Society edition of this book has beautiful color plates with drawings by the author and some photographs."
12,9625936459,http://goodreads.com/user/show/89078218-kannan-raja,4,"‪Victorian naturalist Alfred Russel Wallace’s book on his travels through Southeast Asia got annotated and enriched with John van Wyhe’s notes from other sources such as Wallace’s letters, sketches, journals, and the work of other travellers to region. The addition of the common names and updated scientific names in the footnotes greatly help the reader with recognising the species, or even doing their own reading on it later.‬ My personal favourite additions to the book would be the dramatic woodcuts and 19th century style colour illustrations. A must-read if you are into natural history! "
13,9625936459,http://goodreads.com/user/show/993082-shatterlings,4,"This is massively detailed and does become a bit overwhelming, but there are parts where we know what he is saying is revolutionary about evolution. The parts about human races make uncomfortable reading now but he was a product of his time and that’s reflected here. I did admire his forever trying to keep animals alive even though every time he failed. The parts where he complains about the food, the coffee, the accommodation, the travel and his illnesses were so human and made it feel like a postcard home. "
14,9625936459,http://goodreads.com/user/show/427428-tracy-duvall,4,"Wallace spent several years in the 1850s and 1860s killing and collecting specimens in what is now Indonesia and Malaysia for natural-history collections in Europe. He describes and discusses the plants and animals that he finds, how he came upon them, and aspects of their context, and he relates distribution of the species to his musings on geology and to the theory of natural selection, which he developed simultaneously to Charles Darwin. In addition, Wallace expresses his fascination with the local ""races,"" which he categorizes in a high-handed fashion, and with their technologies, which he describes in appreciative detail. Finally, he relates his own adventures, which are numerous, and procedures, which are interesting. Drawings illustrate much of the text. In present-day terms, this long, detailed classic reads much like a magnificent blog."
15,9625936459,http://goodreads.com/user/show/28486174-bdc,5,"A monumental work documenting Russel’s 8 years of travel throughout the Malaysian archipelago. Having spent much time in this area of the world I found it fascinating. He includes many descriptions of geography, tribal interaction, animal and plant life, as well as some history. The amount of detail he includes is staggering. His conclusions about whether or not the European has reached an advanced state over the tribal peoples he lived with were fascinating. I really enjoyed much of the book. However 5-10 pages describing the hundreds of different genus of beetle he discovered was a little too much for me. "
16,9625936459,http://goodreads.com/user/show/12572015-emile-poelman,5,"One of my favourites. A real classic of natural history and travel. Wallace, a contemporary of Charles Datwin, is my idea of real hero: wandering alone through treacherous rainforests of the Indonesian Archipelago, looking for rare species to send home... Leeches and malaria around every corner... Wow. And extremely well written."
17,9625936459,http://goodreads.com/user/show/30251169-margaretha-quina,5,"Wallace makes natural history really fun! A tour across our archipelago through the detailed, easy to read description within the book. Wallace is definitely a great writer; and it's amazing that he can achieve this level of detail with all the hurdles and difficulty in exploring all kinds of ecosystem Indonesia had to offer. His talent in describing any species, including human race (and his feelings, and his judgment to various race) is very entertaining. A recommended reading to anyone who's traveling Indonesia, or who want to simply explore the vast archipelago through papers and pages."
18,9625936459,http://goodreads.com/user/show/16212136-peter-pete-mcloughlin,4, The co-discoverer of evolution doesn't get the same credit as Darwin probably because he didn't have the upper-class connections that Darwin did. I like this bit of travel writing better than the voyage of the Beagle. It is more about his travails and the wildlife of Indonesia than moralizing about the natives. I would find both Darwin and Wallace interesting figures to have a chat with but I might get along better with Wallace.

Just my type of thing; historical science and voyage. Such an epic tale. "
20,9625936459,http://goodreads.com/user/show/41990253-mike-panton,4,It drags a bit at times when he explains insects in great detail but that’s to be expected given to that was one of his main purposes. I loved the bits of culture that I picked up from it.Overall it’s a great book about the wildlife and people of the archipelago as long as you know what you’re getting yourself into. It’s not a light travel guide. 
21,9625936459,http://goodreads.com/user/show/23599573-lithezebra,3,"It isn't Wallace's fault that he was a product of the 19th century, making parts of this book hard to read.

23,9625936459,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2915426-tippy-jackson,2,"If you are interested in a naturalist travel narrative- I recommend ""The World Was My Garden"" by David Fairchild instead.If you are interested in the area of biogeography explored by Wallace- I recommend ""Song of the Dodo"" by David Quammen instead.I was really disappointed with this and only got about 150 pages into it. Sadly, the image I had in my head of Alfred Wallace has been shattered. I heard stories about his adventures and thought that he lived an amazing life and that he was a survivor; he took the punches and kept going. He wasn't rich like Darwin and had to pay for his adventures by sending back specimens. He got malaria and other tropical illnesses during his travels. When he was coming back from his work in the Amazon, his boat caught fire and he lost most of his precious specimens and only managed to save a few and his journals. But he was so driven as a naturalist that none of these things could stop him. That was my image of him. However, while reading this, I was so annoyed by his constant whining-especially when it was about how the local people wouldn't give him exactly what he wanted, even when it was dangerous for them. The man who saved his journals from a burning ship wouldn't even climb trees to get rare specimens. What??There were a few interesting tidbits, but for the most part this reads like a catalog of all of the animals he found. He does have a few interesting theories, but those I knew from reading Song of the Dodo, which is way more interesting. Still reading this one, but I just came across this passage about how the Dutch chose to govern Java that threw me off a bit:""The mode of government now adopted in Java is to retain the whole series of native rulers, from the village chief up to princes, who, under the name of Regents, are the heads of districts about the size of a small English country. With each Regent is placed a Dutch Resident, or Assistant Resident, who is considered his ""elder brother,"" and whose ""orders"" take the form of ""recommendations,"" which are however implicitly obeyed. Along with each Assistant Resident is a Controller, a kind of inspector of all the lower native rulers, who periodically visits every village in the district, examines the proceedings of the native courts, hears complaints, against the head-men or other native chiefs, and superintends the Government plantations. This brings us to the ""culture system,"" which is the source of all wealth the Dutch derive from Java, and is the subject of much abuse in this country because it is the reverse of ""free trade."" To understand its uses and beneficial effects, it is necessary first to sketch the common results of free European trade with uncivilized peoples. Natives of tropical climates have few wants, and, when these are supplied, are disinclined to work for superfluities without some strong incitement. With such a people the introduction of any new or systematic cultivation is almost impossible, except by the despotic orders of chiefs whom they have been accustomed to obey, as children obey their parents. The free competition of European traders, however introduces two powerful inducements to exertion. Spirits and opium is a temptation too strong for most savages to resist, and to obtain these he will sell whatever he has, and will work to get more. Another temptation he cannot resist is goods on credit. The trader offers him gay cloths, knives, gongs, guns and gunpowder, to be paid for by some crop perhaps not yet planted, or some product yet in the forest. He has not sufficient forethought to take only a moderate quantity, and not enough energy to work early and late in order to get out of debt; and the consequence is that he accumulates debt upon debt, and often remained for years, or for life, a debtor and almost a slave. This is the state of things which occurs very largely in every part of the world in which men of a superior race freely trade with men of a lower race. It extends trade no doubt for a time, but it demoralizes the native, checks true civilization, and does not lead to any permanent increase in the wealth of the country; so that the European government of such a country must be carried at a loss.""This continues on like this. Why did this hit me in a particularly hard way? Because this Brit's description of colonization written in the 1800's is disgustingly close to what we're seeing today-that is working/middle class ""savages"" working for accumulated debts (from being tempted by more than what we need) and accepting the rule of a puppet government being run by other (business/rich people) interests. Apparently, this isn't a very good business model, for even those doing the colonizing must carry the country ""at a loss,"" after demoralizing the population! Wow! It's not like I'm unaccustomed to seeing the western middle class in this light, but to have it repeated back to me from a voice from the past, without any of the pretenses and justifications is kind of chilling. And this passage is just part of the whole. The similarities continue and it's very disturbing.  "

In the same time Darwin discovered about the evolution theory on theGalapagos island, Wallace thought of the same but then at the other part of the world, around and in Malaysia, Borneo and Timor. Being biologist in that time was totally different than being a biologist now. You also were a hunter and a survivor and had to be very commercial. The book contains great descriptions about countries never visited before by European people and of course about the flora and fauna (including the inhabitants). It was a really hard life for a biologist. In every country happens the same, shooting animals, trying to get other people to shoot those for you, skinning the animals, trying to keep the skins save from ants and other insects, trying not to get ill yourself and that 600 pages long. It was sometime a bit boring to read. And sometimes also unbelievable how easy for example big apes could be shot or big butterflies could be caught without taking notice of the population of that species. He didn;t mind that he caught the last specimen.Darwin is far more famous, while Wallace studied a lot more countries, species and for more years, so not all the credits should go to Darwin. "

Alas, the fearsome tides of ants have penetrated my collection and disarticulated all the fine longicornis specimens. Seldom have I wanted more to accompany the author of a book of travel. Wallace, contemporary of Darwin and co-expounder of the theory of Natural Selection spends five years exploring the distant reaches of what is now Indonesia, and shows himself to be a generally decent fellow, who unfortunately is at the spearpoint of the name-and-subjugate tendency of western scientific thought; the obsessive collectors' desire to have all things accounted for. This harkens to Judge Holden, of Cormac McCarthy's Blood Meridian, who considers it a personal affront that a thing should exist without that he knows its name. Although Wallace's delight in the living wonders of the world is infectious, it's sad to contemplate what feats of destruction the laser-beam of human analysis has since wrought on the beauty of Earth.

He should be in the similar status with Charles Darwin. He independently discover Evolution Theory and wrote it to Charles Darwin. Without his mail, Darwin may never publish his book. Wallace is a field scientist, he experienced it in remote locations, observed real behaviour of animals. His book is so details not only the animals life but human life as well. He described vividly Papua people, Bugis people, Ambonese, etc.Having said that, Wallace is still a Victorian traveller and scientist. He killed number of Oranggutan, shooted so many birds, thousands of them just for selling. Those thing i am against with, but in his days it's considered normal so i don't blame him."

Despite being very much a product of his age - for example thinking nothing of shooting orang-utans dead- he also provides very enlightened (and no doubt controversial for the time) views in his unfavourable comparisons of modern western society with the so called 'barbaric' peoples of Indonesia and around. His enthusiasm for the natural world, whether for insects, birds of paradise or of plants is infectious - and his honesty regarding the difficulties of the voyage, as well as his often limited financial situation, all help him come across as a very charming narrator. The only difficulty is the book's length. At over 700 pages it can become a bit 'samey' at times and it certainly does become a trial of endurance in places. I must admit to wondering how it was chosen for the Penguin Pocket Classics series, as it is not the most accessible or immediately crowd pleading book. Despite this, I am glad I persevered to the end, as the book's most powerful and profound words are contained in its closing pages."

Unfortunately the author appears to be so captivated by collecting ever more numerous species of beetles it reads largely like a catalog with very little effort to create drama. I skimmed the last half, and fast. One possibly unique thing about it was the author's assertion that the peoples of these islands were divided into two main races, the Malay from the Asian continent and the Papuans from the ocean islands. Had no idea that concept prevailed in the 19th century, or ever. This is not to belittle the accomplishment. Even today no one knows how many languages or separate groups or tribes of people are there. At least he tried to be exhaustive and included long appendices listing what he thought to be all of the islands, peoples and languages."
34,9625936459,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9232176-richard,4,"This is quite an interesting book covering Wallace's many years of residence in Indonesia, in the mid 1800s. Obviously a lot has changed since then, but this is a marvelous snapshot of the historical period and the naturalistic thinking of the time.I paid 48,300 rupiahs for a hard-cover copy at a book stall in Denpasar, in 1990. (It's actually an ""Oxford in Asia Handbook"" edition, printed on cheap paper in Singapore for the local southeast Asian market.) I read it cover to cover on the Tokyo subways during my commute sometime in the following months. Once in a while, I long not only for the glory days before everything was McDiscovered™ and McPackaged™ for tourists, when travel was difficult and time-consuming, but also for the days when I had two hours per day of nearly uninterrupted reading time on the subway and could devote serious attention to tomes like this..."
35,9625936459,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4653106-lu-s-nunes,5,"This book is the perfect demonstration of interdisciplinarity in the genesis of the earth sciences. Biogeography, science that was created by Wallace, appears in this book as a science research spot. The book is almost a book of adventures. In this revolutionary scientist we realized the audacity and boldness of the scientists of the nineteenth century. A pleasure to read. Worrying as the devastation of forests was already present at the time. However, it was precisely because of this that Wallace might collect several specimens of beetles."
36,9625936459,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1083046-colleen,0,"Excellent travelogue. There are pages spent on the culture of this region, including an excellent tale about a Rajah who tricks his prince underlings into giving him a correct census so the rice tax can be accurately predicted and gathered. When the princes come up with a lower amount of rice, he handles this 'mistake' very diplomatically and is successful in getting the correct amount of rice the next year. Really astute politics. Although the book was written in the late 1800s, it reads like a great modern travelogue. Gave up reading to dive into The Savage Detectives."
37,9625936459,http://goodreads.com/user/show/143763-mads,5,"I searched for this book after reading an essay by David Quammen about going to the Aru Islands to search for the greater bird-of-paradise. A century before Quammen's trip, Wallace had extensively traveled throughout the archipelago and written highly detailed journals about the species, customs and landscapes he encountered there. Wallace's description of how a durian smells and tastes like is the best description of this supremely Southeast Asian fruit."
38,9625936459,http://goodreads.com/user/show/974210-erik-graff,4,"The two big books by Wallace are his description of travel on the Amazon and upon the Malay Archipelago. While the first is pretty much sheer nature in the wild, this book, given the nature of the region, is much more like anthropology and ethnography in addition to nature study. Having never read anything about the region before, only about things that happened there pertaining to WWII and contemporary politics, I found it fascinating albeit a bit rambling."
39,9625936459,http://goodreads.com/user/show/190772-wulan,3,"Nice one. Quite like it! Interesting descriptions of natural life in Borneo, Sulawesi and Aru. What I have in my hand is an extract from The Malay Archipelago. The pocket-sized book is ""Borneo, Celebes, Aru"" by A.R. Wallace and it's published by Penguin Classics as part of their Great Journeys series. It's not on the web yet so I can only put the complete book. "

He is most famous known for the Wallace line which I have had the opportunity to witness see for myself. He was ahead of his time. This is a timeless book on the Malay Archipelago's anthropology, geology, culture and biodiversity. "
41,9625936459,http://goodreads.com/user/show/15965180-carolyne-thornton,5,"This book is amazing. It was written in 1869 and in 1991 I went to one of the places described in the book, in South Sulawesi Indonesia, called Bantimurung, where there is an abundance of butterflies and a waterfall. It was exactly as Alfred Russell Wallace described it, I never would have thought to go there if I hadn't read that book, along with other places such as Ambon. "
42,9625936459,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4766289-hajira-shaheen,3,"Not always do you find a travelogue of an epic 1800s naturalist to read. So if you can get over about 20 pages of detailed hunting and skinning Orangutan tactics and the natives of SE Asia being regularly called savages, you’ll find this an interesting read. Keep reminding yourself that Wallace lived in a different era. Also a good guidebook to start planning your itineraries in the region. "
43,9625936459,http://goodreads.com/user/show/16626063-david-hover,5,Wonderful book for anyone interested in Indonesia and its natural history. Great story of adventure in a time and place now long gone. At times it is racist by today's standards but it is worth getting beyond that to discover his journey and observant nature. He demonstrates well the importance of careful and detailed observation.
44,9625936459,http://goodreads.com/user/show/778498-andrea,3,"It took some effort to make it through this but it was worth it in the end. I read some of it while I was in a Malaysian rainforest, and that made it much more enjoyable, since I was experiencing a similar environment. Definitely not a book to read when you're sleepy, though."
