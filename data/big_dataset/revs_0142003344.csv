0,0142003344,http://goodreads.com/user/show/95099-jenn-pellerin,5,"I'm an atheist. I've always been and always will be (god willing). When I was a kid, I used to envy the religious folks who seemed to be having such deep meaningful fun all the time. It's not that I hate religion, or the idea of god, it's just that I can't really get my mind around it after a childhood devoid of spirituality. Newsflash: if you don't take a lot for granted, religious theory makes NO SENSE. The only place I've ever found deeper meaning is in biology and physics and neurology. SO...reading this book is as close as I've come to a ""religious experience"". Reading about the evolution of the human mind, and how our basic drives--and the complex mechanisms we've developed to serve them--manifest themselves within culture, and simultaneously CREATE culture...it's just...positively uplifting. Thinking of human nature in this way makes me appreciate everything ""human"" in a much deeper sense. Music sounds better, machines are blowing my mind, babies are tiny geniuses! Hell, I may even read some poetry. How about THAT?I would recommend this book to everyone I know. It's just thick enough that some paragraphs warrant a second going over, but just engaging enough that it won't leave you frustrated and bored. "
1,0142003344,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3583387-nebuchadnezzar,2,"I contend that there are two Steven Pinkers. Pinker 1 is an eloquent, witty, and insightful writer on the issues of cognitive psychology and linguistics who has the rare talent of making his subjects accessible and appealing to academic and lay audiences. Pinker 2 retains the writing ability, but instead uses it for pushing his pet theories, usually political in nature (cf. his most recent Better Angels of Our Nature). This book comes straight from the pen of Pinker 2.There are really two main components of the book: Lengthy rants against his ideological opponents and an extended argument in favor of a watered-down hereditarian view of human nature. Pinker rightly notes that ""nature vs. nurture"" is a false dichotomy and then goes about ascribing enormous amounts of deterministic power to genes. He relies on a number of controversial and dubious sources as well as his own misinterpretations of some research, such as Bouchard's infamous twin studies.Lacking actual examples of those who hold this ""blank slate"" view, Pinker dredges up some long dead academics to serve as a scarecrow. He rails against J.B. Watson and B.F. Skinner, even though his intellectual hero Noam Chomsky rebutted Skinner and behaviorism in general in the 1960s. Next he'll be telling us Lamarck was wrong about evolution! He also engages in some tired Margaret Mead-bashing typical of sociobiology/evolutionary psychology partisans by citing Derek Freeman's ""debunking"" of Mead. Pinker missed the memo that Freeman's work was subsequently discredited (see Paul Shankman's The Trashing of Margaret Mead).Pinker astutely points out that proponents of environmental or cultural determinism do not associate these theories with the horrors of communism (Lysenko famously denounced genetics as a ""bourgeois pseudoscience""), but they do associate biological theories with eugenics and Nazism. However, in general, Pinker unleashes a firestorm on a field of straw men. Some of his more contemporary ""blank slaters"" are so-called ""gender feminists,"" whatever those are. (Everyone except Christina Hoff Sommers?) Demonstrating that he's willing to slurp up just about any ""finding"" in pop evolutionary psychology, he offers an extended defense of Thornhill and Palmer's A Natural History of Rape: Biological Bases of Sexual Coercion. The defense parrots the authors' framing of the controversy, with Thornhill and Palmer as the hard-headed, rational scientists telling the cold hard truths versus the hordes of fluffy-headed, irrational, emotional, and ""politically correct"" feminists. Any mention of the scathing reviews the book met in the scientific press (see Cheryl Brown Travis's edited volume Evolution, Gender, and Rape) is omitted or given cursory treatment. Pinker uses pop evo psych in a number of other places as a means to club over the head the bogeywoman of gender feminism. This generally seems to involve projecting modern gender roles and stereotypes back into pre-history based on rank speculation. Simon Blackburn put it best: ""Meet the Flintstones."" (See, e.g., Cordelia Fine, Lise Eliot or Rebecca M. Jordan-Young for critical overviews of current sex-difference research.)I could go on about the technical shortcomings in this book, but Blackburn and H. Allen Orr have already done a much better job of it in their reviews than I could:http://www.phil.cam.ac.uk/~swb24/revi...http://www.nybooks.com/articles/archi...Pinker attempts to posture as a defender of science against the demons of unreason, but he is simply defending his own views and pet theories about science. He is pushing stealth hereditarianism under the banner of consilience, to borrow E.O. Wilson's term. ""The blank slate"" thus becomes an epithet to write off anyone who wants to say, ""Hold on a moment, it's much more complicated than that!"" For those looking to get into evolutionary psychology: Skip this and pick up Laland and Brown's Sense and Nonsense: Evolutionary Perspectives on Human Behaviour for a scholarly overview of fields studying evolution and human behavior and Buller's Adapting Minds: Evolutionary Psychology and the Persistent Quest for Human Nature for a critical view of evolutionary psychology.For those looking to read Pinker: Skip this and pick up something by Pinker 1, like The Language Instinct: How the Mind Creates Language or The Stuff of Thought: Language as a Window Into Human Nature"
2,0142003344,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1713956-manny,4,"Steven Pinker takes on the old nature/nurture question, and does an excellent job of it. Are we the products of our genes or our upbringing? Pinker tells you in the first few pages what the new consensus is: both, but genes are probably more important.He has some wonderful stories to back up the general points. Here's one that particularly appealed to me. During the 60s and 70s, you often heard that boys and girls are indoctrinated from an early age so as to conform to conventional gender roles. Without that conditioning, girls would e.g. be as likely to want to play with toy guns, or boys with dolls. It was just a theory, but it was one that many people believed.So, says Pinker, how could we investigate the question scientifically? It's difficult. What you'd like to do, if you had the chance, would be to take a few dozen boys, castrate them at birth, surgically transform them into girls, and then raise them like other girls without ever telling them what you'd done. At various points in their development, you could compare them with a control group of biologically normal girls, and see if there were any significant differences.Needless to say, no one would ever permit such an appallingly wicked experiment. Except that it's actually happened. Every year, it turns out that a small number of male infants do have to be castrated and turned into girls, most often as a result of botched circumcision operations. Historically, they've usually not been told what happened, since this was deemed to be in their best interests.Studies on these unfortunate children show that they nearly always feel deeply conflicted, and quite different from other girls. They have all sorts of impulses which they feel are bizarre and wrong, and which can sometimes lead them to suicidal despair. In some cases, they have later been informed that they are actually male, and their reaction has typically been one of relief. They weren't weird after all. They were just male without knowing it.Well, if you thought that story was interesting, he's got dozens more that are nearly as good. I loved this book."
3,0142003344,http://goodreads.com/user/show/69589444-jen,5,"Do you believe that the human mind, at conception, is a Tabula Rasa? Because John Locke was completely out of his depth regarding the architecture of the brain and said something that sounded good? Well, here’s a Hobbesian Hammer to mangle the handsome features of your Rousseaian naïveté. Are you convinced that, despite evolution’s demonstrable power to produce a wide variety of phenotypic delights and inform the instinctual capacities of creatures big and small, it had nothing to say about the scaffolding of the human mind? If this isn’t sophistry in the service of ideology, I’ll eat a live dolphin. This is where I would normally trot out such tired qualifiers as:Yes, of course, the human mind is malleable (to an extent), and the effects of cultural copulation are manifold and obv(invid)ious. No, the shackles of these behaviors are not made of adamantium (what clearer evidence of our power to chuck a spandrel into our deepest evolutionary drives than nutting into latex (or sheep skin, for those with allergies, or a Gatorade bottle for the desperate), or pharmaceutically tinkering with the baby oven, or, more terrible still - exercising abstinence), we have big frontal-loafs for a raisin.

And so on. During the interim between awareness, sexual maturity, and Koital Kombat, our data is subject to outside forces which reconfigure it in ways that are bolded, italicized, and hyperlinked. Nature and nurture (as the wise among us say) are perennial fuck buddies.This book is amazing.Read it you bastards!"
4,0142003344,http://goodreads.com/user/show/220791-lena,4,"The Blank Slate is Steven Pinker's ambitious attempt to close the gap between the conventionally accepted dogma that human beings come into this world free of innate characteristics, ready to be molded and shaped by society, and what science has begun to reveal about genetic predisposition. Prior to reading this book, I had no idea that the origin of human nature was such a contentious topic amongst modern intellectuals. Seems that a lot of people think acknowledging that something like violence might have been evolutionarily adaptive is the same thing as condoning violence and excusing those who engage in it, or that admitting that men and women are genetically different justifies discrimination against women. Pinker spends a lot of time in this book carefully addressing these concerns while at the same time making a compelling argument that the current tendency to deny any genetic influence on society's more vexing ills only handicaps our ability to successfully deal with our most serious problems.Pinker is not shy about tackling controversial topics as he makes his points. The chapter in which he pointed to evidence showing that a child's intelligence and personality are shaped far more by genes, peers and random influences than they are by parents got him an enormous amount of mail, as did the section in which he discussed genetic influences on our appreciation of the arts. Despite the radical nature of many of the theories Pinker presents, I found myself having continuous ""ah-ha!"" moments as I read this book. At its core, the idea that we are shaped by our genes as well as our experiences fits far better with reality than the idea that we are all nothing but moldable blank slates. Though these theories may not intellectually fashionable, Pinker makes it clear that there are a wealth of benefits to be gained by accepting what science has to tell us about the true origins of human nature. "
5,0142003344,http://goodreads.com/user/show/957634-daniel-clausen,5,"In some ways, this book is both a tragedy and an inspiration. How is it a tragedy? It's a tragedy because the book is responding to very ideologically-based, simple arguments for the Blank Slate, the Noble Savage, and the Ghost in the Machine that I think don't really need to be addressed. Many of the points in the book I was thoroughly convinced of before reading the book -- I knew that genetics played some role in determining personality and aptitude; I was convinced of the probabilistic approach to human behavior; and I was convinced that versions of ""is"" do not automatically translate into ""ought"". On top of that, much of the book is spent rehashing the very petty politics of what happens in university departments and on college campuses -- the politicization and tribalization of knowledge. It's a stark reminder that even in environments where people should be better and do better, they often give in to their worst instincts. So, the book is tragic in that much of this material, in a more perfect world, could have just been skipped or ignored. The author could have begun this book from a different starting place where readers have no ideological axes to grind, open-minded examination of evidence and arguments take place, and we are all intellectually and emotionally ready to live in a world of nuance. But no, that is not the world we live in, so that is not the book we get. And that is tragic. The book, though, is also an inspiration. Why? Because it attempts to lift the conversation to that place where nuance and evidence are grounded in a humanistic understanding of our role as scholars and thinkers. The author, through his exploration of the various themes and evidence, tries to make us all epistemic creatures -- people who can have beliefs and values but suspend them in order to explore counter-evidence, new theories, and hypotheses, and sharpen our values with our knowledge. As epistemic creatures, we would also be able to ask that all-important question: How do we know something? In a moment in history where so much discourse is polluted by vulgarity, that is refreshing...but it's also tragic. Because in a world where we are all trained from a young age to have the epistemic and moral habits of scientists, this might have been a more nuanced and at once infinitely shorter book. "
6,0142003344,http://goodreads.com/user/show/272430-daniel,2,"Louis Menand has written a typically excellent piece on Pinker's arrogance: http://www.newyorker.com/archive/2002...I found this book simultaneously interesting and exasperating, because the author is obviously a highly educated, well-read man who thinks he knows everything about every subject. There is a whole class of these public intellectuals (the late Carl Sagan, Richard Dawins, et al) who play this game: they use the public authority they have gained by virtue of (at least modest) academic accomplishment in one field to pronounce authoritatively on every damn thing under the sun. (Most of his scholarly journal output is in psychology and language, according to his cv; his PhD is in experimental psychology.) And maybe Pinker has figured it all out, but don't you think he could cut those of us a break who still think we exist? ""Cognitive neuroscientists have not only exorcised the ghost but have shown that the brain does not even have a part that does exactly what the ghost is supposed to do: review all the facts and make a decision for the rest of the brain to carry out. Each of us  there is a single I in control. But that is an illusion the brain works hard to produce..."" And with that he dismisses the idea that you and I exist at all; there is no ""you"" there, only a collection of atoms with some remarkable properties (observable by other lumps of atoms). Wow, I am glad that's all settled. More generally, it's good to know there's no need for a field like philosophy. Pinker has a footnote to support his claim that the brain has no ""I,"" but one of his sources (predictably) is Daniel Dennett, the Tufts philosopher and enemy of the mind (and Anything Else Immaterial). Elsewhere Pinker claims Hitler thought he was doing God's will (footnote to some article in an atheist magazine I looked up -- check out Free Inquiry, Volumbe 19, Issue 2, and judge for yourself whether you would *ever* cite this source in a serious academic inquiry) and that the Catholic Church teaches that 'ensoulment' takes place at the moment of conception. Let me take this last nugget for a moment. I'm guessing Pinker has spent little time in Catholic churches or reading Catholic books or magazines, so I can see why he thinks a statement like ""the catholic church teaches ______"" is an easy one to make. To those of us who have done some of those things, though, it is not so trivial. Sure, in broad strokes, one can formulate simple statements with confidence (e.g., that God exists or Jesus is the Son of God or even abortion is wrong), but his assertion is packed with some things that are far harder to disentangle. Most importantly, he uses the word ""ensoulment"" -- and this is central to his argument at this point in the book -- implying that the Church firmly teaches this concept that he is upset about. I do not know that the RCC says much (currently, anyway) dogmatically about the philosophical underpinnings of a word like ""ensoulment."" What I do know is that I am familiar with the phrase Ghost in the Machine (one of Pinker's bogeymen in this book) from Catholic authors who, like the late JPII, were critical of Cartesian dualism. So, I am being long-winded, but I am trying to get across that Pinker has these convenient cartoon notions of what other people say and because he is so frightfully intelligent he assumes he has it all figured out. If he would just say to himself, ""It is possible that there is one thing I think I know that I do not,"" I believe his tone would be far more congenial and the book much improved. But then again, there is no self for him to say it to, so what's the point? "
7,0142003344,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3781470-tristan,4,"""I'm only humanOf flesh and blood I'm madeHumanBorn to make mistakes""--The Human League, HumanMost of us instinctively feel the acquisition of scientific knowledge follows a linear path, first operating from a solid factual base, and then modifying itself as it goes along in an objective fashion. Ultimately, a common agreeance on a certain topic will be reached, and the findings will translate into well-considered policy. Ideally, that is how it should work, with scientists serving as neutral observers, freely informing us, the public, on whatever findings they come across, whatever the implications. This is not always what actually happens, of course. Not by a long shot. Ironically - also tellingly -, when it comes to the in-depth study of the human animal, there is active, hostile opprobrium by (a certain school of) social scientists and ideologically motivated activists alike. Scientists who try to find biological causations for certain human behaviours or perceived inequalities are frequently ostracised, pelted by slurs, and made pariah's in their own fields. The sober truth is that the scientific community is not free at all from anti-intellectualism and bullying tactics.It seems nothing much has changed since the 2002 publication of this book, which I'm informed drew out considerable polemical discourse at the time. I'm not surprised. Anno 2016, the social sciences in Western academia are still infested with social constructivist thinking, with no sign of it abating any time soon. In fact, it might even have reached its zenith, having entrenched itself even further. It's not difficult to make an analogy with creationists. This exemplifies how far we still have to go as a species to attain a higher level of rational thinking, which means being willing to demolish some of our most cherished beliefs. Ego investment still is riding high, it seems.Biological innateness. Determinism. These terms observably evoke unpleasant feelings in many. However, in order to come face to face with the homo sapiens which, during its brutal evolutionary process, has acquired certain survival - often nasty -instincts, one should let go of such reservations . Funnily enough, it was some of the most prominent Enlightenment thinkers (such as Rousseau) who introduced the blank slate theory. But are we blank slates, almost solely informed by the culture that surrounds us? Hardly, as Pinker shows us -with the aid of a plethora of immensely interesting case studies - in this intellectually dense, yet highly accessible book. Genes and our biological make-up determine our behaviour to a far greater extent than culture or our upbringing ever will. Pinker even goes as far as saying that parental influence on their child(ren)'s formation is pretty much negligible. Peer group interaction is a far more important determining factor. However, Pinker deftly reasons that even with the ever-expanding, confronting knowledge of the human coming from the exciting fields of neuroscience and evolutionary psychology, there is no need for us to defeatedly resort to fatalism or nihilism. On the contrary, an intimate, unsentimental understanding of what we are will help us enormously in developing a truly humanistic ethos and thus in crafting a pragmatic society which can be beneficial to all of us. The utopian vision, with its aim to 'mould' the human psyche (social constructivism), the 20th century has adequately shown to only lead us into disaster."
8,0142003344,http://goodreads.com/user/show/155663-david,5,"What an impressive book! I have been reading a number of Steven Pinker's books, and they are all excellent. I was particularly interested in how politics and social activists have worked to slow down the progress of science. The concept of a ""blank slate"", though socially attractive, has held back science and our understanding of human nature.The chapter on children was especially interesting. Pinker rightly gives much credit to Judith Harris' excellent book The Nurture Assumption: Why Children Turn Out the Way They Do. The subject is not finished, though. Pinker shows that while 50% of the variance in human nature is due to genetics, the remaining 50% of the variance is still in question. It is NOT correlated with home life or parental upbringing. It seems to be a combination of peer influences, and fickle fate."
9,0142003344,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8365747-l-e-duncan,2,"So here's a case where you have a book about how much of our personalities and, well, nature is innate, rather than nurtured into us by our parents or our environment. If The Blank Slate were two hundred pages and focused just on brain science, it'd be one thing. The trouble is that it ends up reading as if Pinker gathered every single study that seemed to support his position and threw it into a blender, and then threw in a number of screeds against groups he has a bone to pick with. The result is a somewhat uneven and contradictory book where one chapter asserts that women don't go into math because they are innately unlikely to like it, and another chapter asserts that no one is innately good at complex math, which is why we have school to pound it into kids' little heads. Pinker's insistence on environment and parenting having minimal influence is sometimes undercut by the studies he presents and his own conclusions. Pinker is quick to say that differences between men and women are innate, whether it's emotional, a difference in a bell curve intelligence spread, or in general interests, but he'll attribute differences between races and ethnic groups to environment or oppression, forces he largely dismisses otherwise. Or we can note that Pinker asserts first that women are better caretakers then men, then secondly asserts that parenting is fairly irrelevant (as long as there's a man to look up to, no comments on where women fall on this influence spectrum), and then thirdly asserts that how well kids get along with parents is predictive of their overall success, which would suggest . . . parenting isn't irrelevant? He also tends to reduce complex issues, such as art or culture or rule of law to biological imperatives, which is a bit odd when he also asserts human individuality and specialness (as long as they also fall within the Norman the Normy Norms that define actual human nature, I suppose). He'll say art has no influence on anyone, really, so everyone hates modernism and post-modernism because it deconstructs art, which no one needs, because everyone knows art isn't real. And by the by, prejudices/stereotypes are often innate and have some good sense and 100% reliable statistics behind them, and these prejudices can't be strongly messed with by media or culture, although of course we should treat everyone with respect, even if they're low IQ and will never amount to anything or. Except that human nature is so violent (at least, if you're a man) and suspicious that of course we will never treat everyone with respect and don't you dare Big Brother us into doing so. ... I got carried away. But the book is absolutely exhausting, wheeling from one conclusion to the next in a mixture of hopeless pessimism, wide-eyed futurism, white-knuckled warnings about not screwing up the status quo, and sudden naivete. I also find many of the absolutely-certain-claims somewhat suspect, as if statistics/brain scans from this or that study and some anecdotes and did you know tribal people actually kill each other?? are absolute proof of what a human is. You can't point out that many media reports of ""this causes cancer"" or ""this proves this parenting tactic successful!"" often exaggerate or segment the truth without making it impossible not to notice that nothing, even studies or statistics, exists in cold, objective isolation. I'm not being post-modern here. I'm saying that the very fact I know more about Pinker from this book than I do about human nature is par for the course. Does any of this matter? Does it matter to a childless female engineer that she's some kind of biological anomaly (and is she?). Is anything helped by positing that men are naturally violent and competitive, and ignoring the uncountable exceptions, or ignoring that women also compete against other women, for mates and otherwise? Is IQ, like, this magic statistic that determines human worth in society? Are you sure you aren't a supporter of eugenics? Etc, etc, etc. We can all agree that people are not meant to be programmed, that we should not force people who want to be poets to become mathematicians to fill a quota, and we should treat people well even when they're not like us. All right? All right."

(Steven Pinker in Oporto, on the 11th of November 2017. My photo.)""Nature, Mr Allnut , is what we are put in this world to rise above"" Katherine Hepburn to Humphrey Bogart in The African Queen""Hillary Clinton may have advanced the dumbest explanation in the history of psychobabble, but she does not deserve the charge of trying to excuse the president's [husband] behavior""Pinker makes the case against a man who gets his formation/make up only from the outer forces of parenting, education, etc. He seems to defend the conception of a man who is not a “blank slate” upon which experience writes on. 

He invokes genetic arguments (based on fraternal and identical twins’ studies) to back his thesis. He also approaches brain analysis and anthropological studies to justify the existence of some “universals” (for instance in the art domain). Even the moral sense. Ergo: there are innate responses: man is not devoid of a certain type of make-up at birth.

He, sort of, denounces the political appeal of a “blank slate “human being to justify the fears of inequalities and certain types of interventions. Those political fears are meant to be refuted. Thomas Jefferson meant “equality “of rights.

Nevertheless, he seems to be a bit cautious about Noam Chomsky’s ideas of an “innate circuitry”, or a universal grammar/plan. He points to the works of Jean Piaget and others, consisting of “personal ideas”.As for the fear of machines, thinking machines, running “amok”, Pinker thinks it’s a “waste of energy”. I really don’t agree. The singularity is at hand at any moment. We’ve witnessed one such an episode on Facebook*, quite recently.Again, this is truly a case against empiricism, against those like John Stuart Mill and John Watson, who were proponents of a major role of experience in Psychology. The book of Pinker is a huge amalgamation of proof that psychopathology, personality traits, as well as love, consciousness and will, are biologically determined.

Well, I know Pinker is an atheist and a lover of the beauty of Darwin's theory of evolution. He's so hopeful regarding the completion of the Human Genome Project, one which may uncover the roots of the intellect and emotion. I think a few years ago I've bought that Time magazine issue. So much so for a biological determinism, I wonder how would Pinker deny refute a God Gene gene? or a set of them? It's, really, no monkey business. I'm not sure whether Pinker has read the book by Dean Hamer: The God Gene: How Faith Is Hardwired into Our Genes. Maybe some have it [the gene/s]; maybe some don't. I've got to grab that magazine again.*https://www.forbes.com/sites/tonybrad...Interesting review here:https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/20...UPDATEPinker on Covid19:""With coronavirus, it’s genuinely hard to know whether surfaces are potential vectors, whether six feet is enough or not enough, whether masks help or don’t help” Does he wear mask?In: http://m.nautil.us/blog/steven-pinker..."
11,0142003344,http://goodreads.com/user/show/34203976-sundus,4,"Wow What an interesting and exquisitely written book!!!This is my first read by this author “Steven Pinker”. He is a psychologist and author of several books and articles on cognition and linguistics. In 
The Blank Slate: The Modern Denial of Human Nature
 he refuted the widely held belief that the human mind at birth is a tabula rasa /blank slate to which the environment (nurture) gives form and substance. He further explained that neither genetics nor environmental conditions are solely responsible for determining a person's behavior instead; individuals are created by a combination of both innate human nature and the conditions of upbringing and environment. A must read for those who want to be introduced to the nature-nurture debate by examining scientific evidence.
Some of my favorite parts from the book:

 There are different kinds of truth for different kinds of people. There are truths appropriate for children; truths that are appropriate for students; truths that are appropriate for educated adults and truths that are appropriate for highly educated adults and the notion that there should be one set of truths available to everyone is a modern democratic fallacy. It doesn’t work.

As technology accumulates and people in more parts of the planet become interdependent, the hatred between them tends to decrease, for the simple reason that you can't kill someone and trade with him too.

The Darwin Awards, given annually to “the individuals who ensure the long-term survival of our species by removing themselves from the gene pool in a sublimely idiotic fashion”, almost always go to men.

Much of what is today called ""social criticism"" consists of members of the upper classes denouncing the tastes of the lower classes (bawdy entertainment, fast food, plentiful consumer goods) while considering themselves egalitarians.

THAT kind of crap. naturally, i wanted to rip his smug white face off...so, in conclusion: if i had my own copy of this book, i might rip out the introduction and the last couple chapters and feel okay about it. maybe just keep the bibliography, though...."
13,0142003344,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1339246-gendou,5,"Pinker argues cleanly and decisively against the theory of the Blank Slate (and its corollary, the Noble Savage). You might say he wipes the Blank Slate clean. Or that he breaks it over his knee.He examines how motivations for wanting to believe in a Blank Slate come from four fears of human nature:1. The Fear of Inequality: if people are innately different, oppression and discrimination (like sexism and racism) would be justified. But people are, in fact, different. Ignoring this fact doesn't help address the real cause of discrimination, which is to judge people as a member of their group, instead of as an individual. It also opens up rational against discrimination to attack by any evidence against the blank slate.2. The Fear of Imperfectibility: if people are innately immoral, hopes to improve the human condition would be futile. Ignoring human nature doesn't make people any less likely to commit crimes. When they do, it doesn't help us decide when and how harshly to punish them. Ignoring human nature is especially foolish in the case of rape. Denying that rape is a sexual crime, and insisting that it's only a violent crime (which it is, also) isn't going to deter any would-be rapists, who, as it happens, are motivated by sexual urges, not the urge to commit violence.3. The Fear of Determinism: if people are products of biology, free will would be a myth and we could no longer hold people responsible for their actions.4. The Fear of Nihilism: if people are products of biology, life would have no higher meaning and purpose.He attacks proponents of the Blank Slate like Stephen Jay Gould, parts of the political left, some feminists, etc.He draws an important distinction between gender and equity feminism.He draws an interesting distinction between the Utopian vs. Tragic vision, and how these influence political leanings.He even calls out modern and post-modern art for their philosophical denial of human nature!"
14,0142003344,http://goodreads.com/user/show/618361-chuck-mccabe,5,"Pinker examines the concept of the mind as a blank slate capable of taking any impressions that arose in England and France in the mid-18th century and became the basis for liberal democracy in the 19th and 20th centuries. The ""blank slate"" underlies the nurture pole of the nature/ nurture debate and looms huge in political and social policies. Drawing on an immense body of research in psychology and other social sciences, linguistics, and evolutionary biology, Pinker makes the case for the nature pole, arguing that it is now apparent that the human brain is not a blank slate, but in fact bears powerful imprints of our evolutionary past that in effect hardwire us to feel, respond, and behave in specific ways. The denial of this human nature is now an impediment to solving many problems that are now plaguing Western democracies. -- This is an exciting read for anyone interested in contemporary social and political issues. It powerfully summarizes a huge body of knowledge that is forcing us to rethink who we are and how we ought to organize our collective behaviors."
15,0142003344,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1183419-david-redden,3,"The Blank Slate was an informative, thought-provoking and polemic book designed to refute ordinary conceptions and intellectual arguments which cut against a sociobiological understanding of humans and human society. I detected a couple instances in which the author, Stephen Pinker, overstated scientific conclusions, leading me to doubt the accuracy of his other scientific evidence. I also have reservations about the rational-actor lens through which he interprets human nature. On the other hand, the writing is good and many of his points are well taken. In sum, this book amounts to an interesting point of view that, while not entirely accurate, helps us see human society in a different light.First the bad. In the couple areas of social science with which I'm somewhat familiar, he sometimes overstates the scientific research he uses as support. For instance, he briefly qualifies research suggesting inheritable differences between male and female brains but then proceeds to lay it all out as unqualified fact. All of this research was done on adults, which means that some of the differences might be hereditary, but this is far from established fact. The same charge has been laid against his sister Susan, which, interestingly enough, may support some of his other arguments about intra-family similarity in tendencies. His hypothesis about hereditary differences between male and female brains may in fact be true, and it definitely matches up with most peoples' intuitive observations of their own children. In any case I agree with him that it should make no difference when it comes to placing value on males or females, but none of this excuses the fact that he overstates the scientific conclusions.In Chapter 12, Pinker similarly runs roughshod over stereotypical associations. He proclaims, “[P]eople’s ability to set aside stereotypes when judging an individual is accomplished by their conscious, deliberate reasoning.” While researchers have shown that thinking carefully about an individual's characteristics can dampen the effect of stereotypical associations, it doesn't reduce their effect to nil. In fact, subsequent studies suggest otherwise, because stereotypical associations effect more than just memory recall; they effect perception, interpretation and memory encoding. Academic social psychologists who profess otherwise are mostly legal defense experts and corporate human resource consultants. I doubt that Pinker cherry-picked or intentionally misrepresented the science, leaving me with the conclusion that he again overstated scientific conclusions.As another minor but related point, Pinker might be misusing quotes, taking them out of context or reading too much into them. He quotes several intellectuals and researchers to prove that the philosophical ideas of “the blank slate” and “the noble savage” are broadly represented in academia. This may all be true, but after catching him overstating scientific conclusions I started to notice that many of these quotations could contain different, more nuanced meanings than Pinker squeezes out of them.Pinker tips his hand most revealingly in Chapter 18, in which he writes, “In a cutthroat market, any company stupid enough to overlook qualified women or to overpay unqualified men would be driven out of business by a more meritocratic competitor.” This represents a brash oversimplification of history, cognitive science, social psychology; an underestimation of the influence of dumb luck; and an overestimation of humans’ ability to accurately evaluate the merits of other humans. It suggests that while Pinker’s erudition is broad, he makes up for its sometimes lack of depth by looking only as far as required to confirm his preconceived vision of rational actors in a rational society, which he in turn derives from the apparent rationality of evolution. The idea that we inexorably act rationally is not a necessary conclusion from our status as products of a mercilessly rational evolutionary process, but I understand how this can be a reassuring conclusion for people uncomfortable with ambiguity.With all these faults, it’s still a compelling read. Pinker presents a great deal of fascinating and oddly intuitive scientific research in very accessible fashion. I’m satisfied by his assertion that we are creatures with inherited tendencies and skills, one of which is the ability to not allow our tendencies to rule tyrannically over us. He made me feel more confident and justified about my loose, respectful, loving relationship with my children, which others might see as too permissive for my children’s good. He carefully defines positions, quoting authorities from multiple disciplines to make his points, so he’s either very well read, has a number of well read research assistants, or perhaps both. His prose was confident like most polemics, but stops short of the patronization that ruins so many of the others.Overall, The Blank Slate was entertaining, interesting, and informative, but I strongly recommend that you read it with both an open and critical mind."
16,0142003344,http://goodreads.com/user/show/14824621-elenabot,4,"This book is not without its flaws. As others have pointed out, the picture here might just be a tad bit too simple. However, Pinker accomplishes one important feat in this book, and that is to point out that our theories of justice and morality are not hostage to the empirically falsifiable claim that there are no innate differences between individuals. Our moral commitment to respecting the human dignity, equality, freedom, and human rights of any and all regardless of gender or race is in no way advanced by stifling scientific research that might reveal essential differences between individuals. In fact, Pinker argues that it is quite the contrary. He nicely shows how extreme postmodernist, social constructivist views share a disturbing commonality with totalitarian thinking, in that they both do violence to the natural tendencies and inclinations of individuals by making armchair prescriptions that ignore these. Instead, he argues that to respect individuals implies first and foremost to recognize and nurture their innate tendencies, whether through education, parenting, or through empirically-informed ethical practices and social policies. In contrast, what postmodern views tend to share is this social constructionist view that there are no essential properties that define who people are. Instead, people either:1) ""make"" up their identities, ex-nihilo, (whatever that means, and however that is supposed to work out in practice for embodied human agents who are constrained in the range of possible identities that they can adopt by virtue of their very embodiment), or 2) are passive receptacles of social ""codes"" that determine who they are, as well as being pawns of larger institutional forces that lack any agency and standing as responsible, autonomous individuals.Ultimately, both views hinge on the notion that there are no innate, natural constraints that might define what it is to be a functional human agent. This can be seen, for instance, in the second- and third-wave feminist dogma that biology is irrelevant to psychology, and that gender is entirely a social construct. Pinker rightly reminds us that this is an empirically falsifiable claim, and that we had better not build our ethical theories about gender equity on a claim that, he says, has been shown to be false by evolutionary neuropsychology. Moreover, he argues that this rejection of human nature is actually counterproductive when it comes to advancing the goals of social justice. This is because, by ignoring empirical evidence regarding the conditions that are conducive to human flourishing, it cannot possibly engage in practices that are likely to lead to such flourishing. So if we care about promoting the flourishing of, say, women, then what better guide to understanding what such flourishing might be could we have than a psychology that is as free from ideological policing as possible? To deem certain thoughts unthinkable because they are anathema according to our latest ideology (e.g., second- and third-wave feminism's cardinal sin of gender essentialism) is to pit truth against right, which makes us less likely to get the latter, since the former is the only reliable guide we could possibly have to understanding what the latter could be. Thus, he argues that we needn't fear that the scientific approach to understanding human nature will legitimize bigoted, unethical views. He seems to have a pretty firm conviction that the principles of ethics are universal and grounded independently of any kind of empirical considerations. This isn't to say that we can meaningfully apply these universal principles without empirical knowledge. If these principles are to apply to human beings, we had better have empirical data about what human beings are really like. Because individuals aren't just abstract, characterless units, but rather have innate characteristics that define them as the individuals that they are, equality cannot be sameness or interchangeability. Thus, for instance, second- and third-wave feminism needn't police biology and psychology in the fear that such sciences might uncover data showing that women on average exhibit cognitive differences from men. Should evidence of such innate differences appear, it would in no way undermine women's claim to equal human rights, since difference doesn't imply inferiority. Just because human individuals exhibit a vast degree of variation in aptitude and natural ability doesn't imply that some are to be accorded rights that others lack. Each one of us has capacities that others lack, while lacking capacities that others possess. Nevertheless, we already accord equal recognition to others despite these everyday, obvious differences. In addition, such ideological policing of science, and such a need to cover up in advance what the science might show, reveals too much about our own fears. We implicitly confess the weak foundations of our ethical principles every time we put restrictions on science ahead of time.Moreover, because humans are adapted to living interdependent lives as members of purposive groups, freedom cannot imply that individuals are to be seen as free-floating atoms, while groups are mere aggregates of such atoms. Rather, a great deal of our flourishing and thus of meaningful freedom depends on properly adjusting ourselves to others. Hence, freedom must be tempered with equality if human flourishing can be attained. Finding the right way of mutually constraining freedom and equality is the goal of political thinking, and Pinker argues that it cannot be achieved if we ignore the innate traits of individuals."

I don't disagree with his basic thesis, but I do disagree with his cartoonish characterizations of his opponents, namely, feminists, the left, social scientists, etc. If you're going to write a book in which you are right and everyone else is wrong and stupid, you should at least make sure you support your huge thesis with unassailable facts. He did not. It's one thing to say ""we are not a blank slate."" Totally fine. But quite another to say parenting and environment make no difference whatsoever, that women are not in fact under-represented in the sciences (that one made me the most mad), and that art is now crap (why is he even qualified to critique modern art?). Anyway, I'm sure it's not his fault--his biology made him that arrogant. "

19,0142003344,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7668412-andrea,4,"How refreshing that S. Pinker abundantly refers to the vast trove of literary works, picking out gems of insight into human nature, in his elegant scientific analysis! Perhaps no surprise from a cognitive psychologist so implicated in the study of linguistics and language acquisition, but welcome all the same.Far from rendering his propos less scientific, his quotes from literary sources (throughout the book, not limited to the chapter on the Arts) give depth and relevance to his arguments, which are anything but ""warm and fuzzy."" And the opening chapters in Part 1, while perhaps too drawn out for many readers (including myself) provide a very coherent framework for the reasoning (The Blank State, The Ghost in the Machine, and The Noble Savage) behind the denial of human naure by many well-intentioned scientists and politicians.Unfortunately, Pinker has obliged himself to take great pains to explain, again and again throughout the book, that understanding some of the more unpleasant aspects of human nature(selfishness, violence...)does not mean that one condones the behaviour. I would think that most readers already grasp this point without needing to be continually reminded of it, but I suppose he addresses himself to his detractors (and potential deniers).I especially enjoyed chapters 8, ""The Fear of Inequality"" and 11 ""The Fear of Nihilism"", which are not only convincingly written, but full of humour as well. Ditto for the chapter on children. Any parent who has managed to raise children despite the continuous onslaught of conflicting childrearing advice by the ""experts"" can attest to Pinker's observations.Well-written, meticulously documented, and insightful; a good place to begin reading within the currents of evolutionary psychology and sociobiology.

The Blank Slate aka “Tabula Rasa” (adopted by the empiricists): the mind has no innate traits, and therefore all knowledge comes from experience or perception.2. The Noble Savage (adopted by the romanticists): people are born good and corrupted by society and civilisation.3. The Ghost in the Machine (adopted by the dualists): each of us has a soul that makes choices free from biology.Much of the book is dedicated to examining fears of the social and political consequences of his view of human nature:1. The Fear of Inequality: If people are innately different, oppression and discrimination would be justified. Moreover, absolute egalitarianism might be in principle unachievable.The Russian novelist Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn summed the dilemma up:“Human beings are born with different capacities. If they are free, they are not equal. And if they are equal, they are not free.” 2. The Fear of Imperfectability: If people are innately immoral, hopes to improve the human condition would be futile.3. The Fear of Determinism: If people are the products of biology, free will would be a myth and we could no longer hold people responsible for their actions.4. The Fear of Nihilism: If people are the products of biology, life would have no higher meaning and purpose. Here we can speak of different types of nihilism: Moral Nihilism, Existential Nihilism, Epistemological Nihilism... Here is an article by Pinker ""Science is not your Enemy!"": An impassioned plea to humanists...https://newrepublic.com/article/11412...طبيعة فطرية: هل هي فكرة مرعبة؟(نحن لسنا، كما يفترض الكثيرون، مجرّد ألواح فارغة تشكّلها البيئة.)في كتابه (اللوح الفارغ: الإنكار المعاصر للطبيعة البشرية) يحاجج ستيڤن پينكر بأنّ العلم الحديث (علم النفس التطوّري وعلوم الأعصاب على وجه الخصوص) قد تحدّى ثلاثة عقائد بخصوص الطبيعة البشرية، متقاطعة فيما بينها وتشكّل وجهة النظر المهيمنة على الحياة الفكرية والثقافية المعاصرة:1. عقيدة اللوح الفارغ (تعرف أيضاً بالاسم اللاتيني الصفحة البيضاءTabula Rasa ) ويتبنّاها الإمبيريقيون: العقل البشري لا يمتلك سمات فطرية أصيلة، لذلك فإنّ كل المعرفة سيكتسبها عن طريق الإدراك والخبرة\التجربة.2. عقيدة الهمجيّ النبيل ويتبنّاها الرومنسيّون (يعدّمني ياهن): الإنسان كائن مسالم وخيّر بطبعه، ثم يأتي المجتمع والحضارة لتخرّباه.3. عقيدة الروح في الآلة ويتبنّاها المثنويّون: العقل البشري (وكأنه روح تسكن الجسد) بإمكانه اتّخاذ قراراته بصورة مستقلّة بشكل كامل عن البيولوجيا (الجسد البشري). تبدو هذه العقائد متغلغلة في الثقافة الغربية المعاصرة بدءاً من جون لوك وليس انتهاءً بكارل ماركس... وفي عام 1954 مثلاً أراد الكاتب ويليم غولدينغ William Golding في روايته الرمزية أمير الذّباب Lord of the Flies التي تكشف عن طبيعة العقل البشري أن يقنع القراء بأن الإنسان يولد وفيه غريزة الشرّ، وأنّ كبح هذا الشرّ هو دور الإنسان نفسه. وقد استطاع اثنان على الأقل من ابطال روايته مقاومة هذه الغريزة. ولم يحسم الأمر ما إذا كان هذا نتيجة رواسب التنشئة الاجتماعية أم نتيجة وجود عامل بيولوجي للخير.ثمّ يتفحّص ستيڤن پينكر عن قرب المخاوف من النتائج الاجتماعية والسياسية التي ممكن أن تنجم عن الاعتراف بطبيعة بشرية أصيلة نابعة من علم النفس التطوّري وعلوم الأعصاب، وهي:1. الخوف من عدم القدرة على تحقيق المساواة الاجتماعية ""المطلقة"": إن كان البشر مختلفون أصالةً، فالاضطهاد والتمييز قد يكونا مبرّرين. ومن جهة أخرى قد تكون العقائد المساواتية egalitarianism المهيمنة على مجتمعات الغرب (الليبرالية الديمقراطية) غير قابلة للتحقيق من حيث المبدأ.لخّص الروائي الروسي ألكسندر سولجستين معضلة شعارات الثورة الفرنسية (المساواة-الحرّية) بالعبارة التالية: ""يولد البشر بقابليّاتٍ مختلفة؛ إن كانوا أحراراً فهم غير متساوين، وإن كانوا متساوين فهم غير أحرار.

22,0142003344,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4658045-paul,2,"I can't finish this. The first third or so of the book is interesting and important, mostly because of the discussion about cognitive neuroscience. I think it's extremely important that any educated person in the modern or future world get a solid basic understanding of what we know (and don't know) about how the human brain works. Obviously that will govern our whole understanding of psychology, sociology, and human life in general. Anyone who wants his or her worldview to actually reflect reality has to take that into account.It's quite important to note, as the author does, that a great deal of contemporary thought by people who are more or less avowedly atheistic and materialistic nevertheless attributes or implies quite unphysical abilities for the human mind.That said, the book sidesteps the actual issue of the soul and consciousness. A couple of times the issue seems to appear as a murky blob beneath the surface, but it's dismissed with typical reductionist verbiage like ""consciousness is actually an illusion that several brain circuits work very hard to maintain."" Descartes was tragically wrong about a number of things, but the point stands and will forever stand that if my consciousness is an ""illusion,"" there is still a me to be deluded.In reality, the scornful statement ""ghost in the machine"" is useful to a certain point. Obviously, all our thoughts and emotions and other qualia or mental phenomena or whatever you want to call them have physical manifestations in the brain. There is not a ""big"" ghost that handles most cognitive functions in supernatural space and then hands the greatly digested results to the menial physical system for, say, motor control. Without the appropriate parts of the brain, we can't think or feel in the ways proper to those parts. However, that only constitutes a ""proof"" of the nonexistence of the soul if you're a reductionist in a hurry to sweep the remaining details under the rug and move on. There is still all the room in the universe for a soul, not only as an epiphenomenon that maps physical brain states onto our conscious qualia, but as an entity that can exert influence back on the body at certain neural (or other) breakpoints, at least at a fine enough scale that we can't measure them, and likely enough at an even finer scale where quantum physics assures us that we can never measure them. This ""small ghost"" is by no means disproven, and whether or not it's a more satisfying explanation of human existence is, at least at this point, more a matter of taste than anything else.The discussion of evolutionary psychology is somewhat interesting for its actual content, some of which could be quite valid. It's more illuminating in the sense that it allows me to see the modern biologist's worship of evolution as deity in action. Rather half-cocked, unlikely-sounding theories can be passed off as clearly established fact if they invoke the Divine Name of Evolution. Psychology as a whole is probably in a state roughly corresponding to geology in the mid 20th century, where workable paradigms are out there and starting to win the fight against the unworkable paradigms. Evolutionary psychology sounds more like the half-baked world of 19th century geology, with solid pieces of observation and reasoning cemented together with a mixture of vagueness and absurd cocksurety.The book then ambles off into a series of ruminations by our fairly insufferable author, who is about 1/20 the social and political critic he thinks he is, where he makes either astoundingly obvious or blatantly inept statements and claims about human life in general and where he sees ramifications of the biology of the brain in these situations. I spent most of last month avoiding the audiobook and I'm finally giving it up as bad business.I would recommend finding another book to introduce oneself to cognitive neuroscience. I will be looking for one and welcome suggestions."

And thank you Morgan for the recommendation."
24,0142003344,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1677868-steven-peterson,5,"Pinker takes on a perspective regarding human nature that tended to dominate the social sciences in the 20th century (with many adherents of the position still active now), namely that humans are ""blank slates"" and their life course is highly malleable. He says (Pages 2-3): ""That theory of human nature--namely that it barely exists--is the topic of this book. . .Challenges to the doctrine from skeptics and scientists have pushed some believers into a crisis of faith and have led others to mount the kinds of bitter attacks ordinarily aimed at heretics and infidels.""The first part of the book examines the theory of ""the blank state,"" the position that Pinker targets in much of the rest of the book. He notes some of the bitter academic politics going with the struggle over the question of the nature of human nature. Academics advocating the view that biology and evolution play a role in influencing human nature have often suffered at the hands of their critics (some egregious examples are included in the book). However, Pinker argues that we will develop a much richer understanding of humankind if we consider the variety of influences on human nature and move away from the sterile (my words, not his) blank slate metaphor.Indeed, much of my academic research has focused on how an understanding of the life sciences can enrich our understanding of politics (I am a political scientist). An awareness of the neurosciences, evolutionary theory, genetics, and so on enrich our understanding of policy choices and our understanding of political behavior. Pinker, by addressing the myth of the blank slate, does a boon for those who have a richer, more integrated sense of human nature."

With age I have come to dislike the idea of an ideology, any ideology. Anything that compels us to think that something is correct or good because it ought to be correct. Reality does not care how any of us feel about it. Also accepting something to be true does not in any way imply that I have to like it or support it. So often we see these things mixed up in our modern intellectual mindset, and if anyone suffers from such distractions then this book is a must read for them."

The Blank Slate, for me, is one of those rare books. My understanding of human nature, gender, politics, violence, learning, and, most significantly, my view on child-raising will all be affected by this book from here on. In fact, I would go so far as to say that The Blank Slate will be as significant and influence on the second third of my life as Atlas Shrugged was on the first third. I find it somewhat interesting that both books were written by anti-Marxist atheists, though I must grant that Pinker is vastly less emotional about it than Rand.The book itself is long and deep and very articulate. I enjoyed the reading of it, but would never call it a light read. It contains ideas that will challenge your world view, no matter what you currently believe.I first heard of Steven Pinker through TED (www.ted.com), where Pinker has given two talks in the last few years. For the twenty minute version of his thoughts, listen to his TED talk on violence. If you want the ninety minute version of The Blank Slate, Google ""Pinker MIT Blank Slate"" and listen to the talk he gave at MIT as part of his book tour.

I've turned over the corner of ten or twelve pages of particular interest wanting to re-read particularly important paragraphs that piqued my interest. Pinker argues well about a number of things, discusses various sociobiological (and less scientifically grounded) statements about subjects as wide-ranging as parenting, violence, art, rape, left/right wing politics, neuroscience, morals, selfishness/altruism, intelligence, game theory, religion.. I got more of a general sense of his arguments about the nature/nurture debate than an unequivocal answer - but I think that's Pinker's point, there is no easy or neat conclusion to draw."
28,0142003344,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3897817-morgan-blackledge,4,"I love Steven Pinker and I loved this book.NOTE: What an ironically lame review of a book that is legitimate genius! In retrospect, I must not have had the time/wherewithal to write the review this amazing book deserves. It had (and still has) a HUGE influence on my thinking and way of seeing the world. How many books can you say that about? Clichés like ‘transformative’ or ‘monumental’ or ‘important’ come to mind when I try to describe it in a quick pass.That sounds lame and hyperbolic, but that’s honestly appropriate when describing this work. I guess I’m left where I started. I love Steven Pinker and I loved this book."
29,0142003344,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2199404-andy,2,"Pinker claims there is much opposition to the idea that biology (as opposed to parenting, etc.) is an important determinant of human behavior. This seems fishy to me because it is the exact opposite of my reality. Also, his narrow focus on a particular type of research might confuse people regarding the implications of the science. In medical practice, there is extreme tunnel vision on biological causes of disease to the exclusion of other explanations. The reflex standard position in our society now is that behavior problems in kids are ""ADHD"" or some other medical diagnosis to be treated with a drug. Does a huge percentage of kids really suffer from congenital Ritalin deficiency? When you do blinded trials of Ritalin, most kids referred for treatment do just as well on placebo. Meanwhile, there are real interventions involving school environment or cognitive behavior that could help but are generally not even considered. So it seems like our culture not only accepts biological explanations of behavior, but does so to excess. The ""3 laws"" that he preaches are based on studies that only look at stable, middle-class families. They find that parenting/environment doesn't really matter. OK, fine, as long as you exclude bad parenting in a bad neighborhood. He does specifically mention this caveat, so he is not lying, but he is minimizing what seems to me like a much more important point for social policy. Readers who don't pay careful attention will walk away with the message that ""parenting doesn't matter."" If this helps them relax about college prep coaching for their toddlers, then that's nice, but we shouldn't forget about unlucky children who are beaten and malnourished and definitely do more poorly on average than kids who benefit from a nurturing environment.I'll take his word for it that there is a Blank Slate/Noble Savage dogma in various pockets of academics, but still I feel like Pinker is mainly arguing against a straw man. To a certain point this is OK, because it's a useful device for livening up what would otherwise be a boring restatement of the obvious. He is a good writer and covers lots of interesting topics in a witty, eloquent fashion. This book is a starting point for discussions, but nothing more. After looking at other reviews here I see that Pinker has indeed gotten facts wrong, including misquotes of his opponents regarding major points. I can't give more than 2 stars then despite the quality of the writing. I should have looked at Goodreads before reading this one!"
30,0142003344,http://goodreads.com/user/show/56884005-kalle-nordenstorm,3,"Reading this book feels like hearing an intelligent person trying to talk sense to an obstinate child. Every once in a while you pick up an interesting fact, but the ratio of information to text is not high enough to make this book worth ones time. The info is drowned in a sea of qualifiers and platitudes, time after time he states that eugenics and Social Darwinism is bad, much of the book feels designed for soothing the idiotic frenzy of leftist apparatchiks, and to avoid being called a Nazi apologist.I wish Pinker the best of luck in giving people a nuanced view on nature-nurture, but my rating of this book none the less is three stars. After three attempts I still cannot bring myself to finishing the book, so any higher rating would be dishonest. You can learn more from a 100 page book written for smart people, than from this 500 pager written for idiots.A side note:My dad is a priest and intelligent except when it comes to religion, then his intelligence drops by 50% and his honesty by 90. This book is written for people like my father, who are idiots when it comes to a certain issue, but the issue is heredity instead of religion."

This book has been rendered into laymans' terms, thankfully, yet still reeks with references to endless scientific studies. On the way it debunks many common myths about the preprogramming, or lack thereof, in human beings. It also comes dangerously close to knocking the props out from under the assumptions necessary to support most religious principles. Yet, the author goes to great lengths to tell the truth as he sees it without directly offending social sensibilities. Many of his observations, with appropriate support, cause major paradigm shifts for most readers, I suspect. We are not as virtuous as we like to think and we are driven by self-interest far more than we care to admit. Reading this work will make you reflect upon and possibly change some of your attitudes and behaviors. "

33,0142003344,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2882673-john-vibber,5,"A brilliant argument for an evolved biological human nature. Pinker uses evidence from ethnology, evolutionary psychology, and sociobiology to make a surprisingly convincing claim that the nature vs nurture puzzle has finally been solved . His thesis addresses three common assumptions about human nature and then renders each one scientifically and historically bankrupt. The 'blank slate' is the assumption that there is no inborn human nature; all humans are the product of nurture/environment. The 'noble savage' assumption contends that each child is born perfect only to be corrupted by society. The 'ghost in the machine' assumption purports a free will characteristic of a mind or soul separate from our biological self. Pinker presents a cornucopia of evidence for a new point of view on psychology, child rearing, societal organization and even happiness.  I have read very few books that have so successfully questioned my assumptions and changed my point of view."

37,0142003344,http://goodreads.com/user/show/971451-marshall,5,"Just when I started lamenting how seldom I read a book anymore that forces me to re-think my assumptions, The Blank Slate comes along! This is an ambitious book, 528 pages cutting across our entire culture, leaving nothing untouched--politics, morality, philosophy, economics, psychology, history, gender, anthropology, violence, children, the arts, and language.The premise is that a philosophical invention of the 20th century has created a lot of confusion and social ills, justified by a misunderstanding that it could eliminate racism and inequality. That invention Pinker calls the ""blank slate,"" the idea that we're all born into the world as malleable, with no innate tendencies, completely shaped by society. This philosophy has two corollaries that tend to run alongside it: the ""noble savage"" and the ""ghost in the machine."" The ""noble savage"" philosophy is the belief that our nature, if isolated from our wicked modern culture, is pure and peaceful. The ""ghost in the machine"" is the idea that each of us has a self that drives the body, existing separately from it.Sounds harmless enough, right? This stuff is at the heart of many of our political and philosophical debates, with far-reaching implications. Misunderstandings about human nature have been used to justify damaging social policies, disastrous economic experiments, and horrific violence. The blank slate is at the heart of Marxist regimes, for example.This book meticulously sets up a persuasive argument against the blank slate, in favor of a scientific understanding of human nature, informed by Darwinism, particularly the burgeoning field of evolutionary psychology. It counters misunderstandings about human nature, and dispels fears about what this line of thinking could lead to, most notably the Holocaust. This man's poignant logic is practically flawless. He has a knack for raising excellent points that made me think hard, and question my beliefs, since I too harbored many of the misunderstandings and fears this book addresses. He won me over, big time.I do wish he'd better addressed the subject of moral relativism and ethical dilemmas. He's arguing for human nature, which is objective and universal. Some thinkers like Ayn Rand take this to its logical conclusion and argue that there are black-and-white definitions of Right and Wrong written in human nature. That leads to the questions of how we can discover these rules, and which authority we should trust to interpret them. Rand says it's self-evident to anyone thinking rationally, and of course she counts herself as such a person, so this is a clever way of electing herself the authority on Right and Wrong. Those who don't obey her edicts are outlaws and should be forced to obey. This ended up creating a cult of personality that still exists among many Republicans and Libertarians, and it creeps me out.So I still have a fear that the philosophy of human nature can be used to justify such intolerance. Of course, this book also made a strong case that the opposite can be just as terrible, allowing horrific violence to persist in the guise of tolerance."
38,0142003344,http://goodreads.com/user/show/20989544-laura,4,"A bittersweet reading.I incredibly enjoyed most of this book, Pinker is a talented and delighting writer with a really good educational background, a prominence in the cognitive sciences.As the title says, he takes the hyphotesis of the blank slate, that though been socially accepted for many, it's untenable. In the first parts he will completely discredit this hypothesis, while exposing some findings of geneticians, evolutionary psychologists and cognitive neuroscientists, this to present a perspective that although being a ''dangerous idea'' (that can have fatal repercussions, think of eugenics) has strong scientific studies, a more ''nature'' explanation for behavior. This summarizes it:This book is primarily about human nature —an endowment of cognitive and emotional faculties that is universal to healthy members of Homo sapiens. Samuel Johnson wrote, ―We are all prompted by the same motives, all deceived by the same fallacies, all animated by hope,obstructed by danger, entangled by desire, and seduced by pleasure. The abundant evidence that we share a human nature does not mean that the differences among individuals, races, or sexes are also in our nature. Confucius could have been right when he wrote, ―Men's natures are alike; it is their habits that carry them far apart.The book is divided in six parts, I especially liked the first part: ''The blank slate, the noble savage, and the ghost in the machine'' and the third part ''Human nature with a human face.'' In general, the parts that were related to cognitive Neuroscience (a little repetitive, but acceptable).Well, it was a 5 star book in my opinion, up until when I got to the last part, there, it became a really frustrating and exasperating reading, not only because of the extreme ideas (the chapter about children), just because he didn't explain or base his opinions on solid evidence, he just started critiquing other scientists' findings with speculations (a really arrogant attitude). This put me in conflict, I had never asked myself my position on these ideas and I don't know yet what to think about those matters. I think that if you are going to criticize a bunch of theories, you need to strongly base your allegations and I feel he didn't do that. Though the end was hard to read, I will stay with the good opinion I got when reading the majority of the book. He really does a good job ''destroying'' the blank slate hypothesis."
39,0142003344,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9971840-jeffrey-guterman,4,"This is a must read for anyone interested in human nature. It was in Pinker's book, The Blank Slate that I was introduced to Francis Crick’s, The Astonishing Hypothesis. In the opening passage of Crick's book of the same name, he writes:The Astonishing Hypothesis is that ""You,"" your joys and your sorrows, your memories and your ambitions, your sense of personal identity and free will, are in fact no more than the behavior of a vast assembly of nerve cells and their associated molecules. As Lewis Carroll’s Alice might have phrased it: ""You’re nothing but a pack of neurons."" (p. 3)Crick’s work, along with others who have refuted René Descartes’ mind-body dualism, suggest that there is no ghost in the machine. This was an epiphany for me. Crick's work, along with Pinker's excellent discussion, was the answer to the big question that I had for all of my life: Who am I?How liberating it has been ever since reading Pinker and Crick to at least tentatively conclude that I am a glorified biological machine. This is not to say that I, like other humans, do not have the capability to ""transcend"" the confines of my body and strive for so-called spiritual endeavors, such as love, creativity, knowledge, and relationships. Crick's hypothesis, as Pinker suggests, is astonishing because it may be true. I say it is also astonishing because if you take it seriously, it has the potential to produce pure amazement at the fact that you were born at all and to treasure every moment of consciousness. "
40,0142003344,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3532236-charlie,2,"Note: I read this book in that I read about as much of it as I wanted to (I forget how much, but at least 100 pages). It was not the book I was hoping to read, which may mean that I have rated it lower than it objectively deserves.Pinker's book is an amalgam of science, philosophy, and contemporary commentary. I found the science very interesting, the philosophy moderately interesting, and the contemporary commentary a wrench in the works. His chief interest is to defend, against what he thinks is a dominant paradigm, that humans both collectively and individually come equipped with a significant amount of biological pre-programming. Our evolutionary history and basic biological configuration place significant constraints on our choices. He argues that this is not ""reductionism,"" but a fair accounting for the evidence. He also alleges that his viewpoint has been persecuted by the academic and political community. Such examples litter the book.I am interested in Pinker's work and his arguments, but this book seemed to be doing too many different things at the same time. To me at least, it lacked flow. However, some sections were quite interesting. I am open to reading more by Pinker, if I can find the right book. "
41,0142003344,http://goodreads.com/user/show/68320929-helder-gonzales,3,"This book is based on a powerful idea: modern humanities deny the concept of ""human nature"" and instead believe that humans are born Blank Slates (empiricism), that in the state of nature we were Noble Savages (romantism) and that our minds don't operate by physical principles but are something else entirely - The Ghost in the Machine (dualism). These assumptions, according to the author, do not reflect the latest developments in behavioral genetics and evolutionary psycology. Pinker argues that the Blank Slate myth leads to dangerous social engeneering atempts, causing much harm. The book tries to show the dark implications of radical social constructivism from many angles. Although it does bring some brilliant insights, Pinker's taste for unnecesary controversy makes this opus much longer and hard to read than it should. There are entire chapters that are basically reviews on quarrels between authors that treated the theme. As he tries to adress too many topics - like violence, sex, gender, arts, parenting, biology, politics, among others - the book loses focus and becomes a bit tiresome. Still it's worth reading, even if don't completely agree with it - it's the kind of book that makes you think."
42,0142003344,http://goodreads.com/user/show/18942380-william-schram,5,"In this book, Dr. Steven Pinker attempts to dispel the three theories of the Blank Slate, the Noble Savage, and the Ghost in the Machine. Does he succeed? I think he did a pretty good job in his attempt. For those not in the know, the Blank Slate is the idea that human beings have no innate tendencies or habits, the Noble Savage is the idea that human beings are basically good but corrupted by society, and the Ghost in the Machine is the idea that there is an immaterial thing that operates your body, like a soul or something.All of these theories crumble under close scrutiny, but people cling to these ideas since they feel that the alternatives open the door for bigotry and the dissolution of all morals. It is not something that I ever considered. I feel that even though I don’t really believe in that sort of thing, I still need to live in society and follow its rules. So although I liked this book a great deal, I don’t really have anything deep or meaningful to add. I give it five stars out of five."
43,0142003344,http://goodreads.com/user/show/73077948-alina-lucia,5,"Reading this book has been a transformative experience for me, and I just happened to read it at the perfect time, a time where I was having trouble verbalising my moral convictions as a scientist. It was as if Pinker read my mind and listed my ideas, only in a more eloquent, well structured manner. He argues that the acceptance of innate differences and tendencies between members of our species, a result of genetic make-up, should not be detrimental to our moral reasoning, but rather the opposite. Acknowledging such truths, and using reason and logic to transcend our innate limitations, would allows us to make more informed decisions within many realms of society, including politics, bioethics and education. Pinker's argument resonates well with that of Rakitin in Dostoevsky's ""The Karamazov Brothers"", when he says: ""Humanity will find in itself the power to live for virtue, even without believing in immortality. It will find it in love for freedom, for equality, for fraternity."" And what a wonderful thought that is."

This could be a book for you if you currently thinks that behaviour is only influenced by the environment.

I value and was excited about his thesis - exploring the controversy over admitting that as humans we retain differences (gender, ethnic, cognitive, etc.) which are inherent and are not the result of our environment's influence, but I wish he would have stuck to the topic rather than waste his time name bashing."

It makes the case for a science of human nature, and in the process is devastating to so-called conventional wisdom, political correctness and other silliness. The highlight for me is how clearly he lays bare the utter waste of human activity that is postmodernism. It was one of those rare moments when an author seems to be giving the exact words to the reader's earlier intuition or experiences. I constantly found myself wishing I could travel back in time to one ""philosophy of science"" panel in particular just to be able to ask a few better questions!"

50,0142003344,http://goodreads.com/user/show/15394822-bukk,5,"This book is a warhead, and this warhead lays waste to an entire field of intellectual laziness, dishonesty, and plain incompetence through the sharp eye for reality of its writer. This isn't to say the disciplines Pinker discusses are fundamentally lazy or dishonest or incompetent, but that a number of the practitioners of these disciplines are on record for being each of these things, by favoring ideology and worldview over objectivity, by supplanting empiricism with wishful thinking, and engaging in a laundry list of other disreputable tactics to try to forcefully align reality with a preconceived idea of truth, and he presents their flawed positions before thoroughly debunking them. He masterfully presents his case for nature's influence on the human mind and our cognitive abilities with a series of examples and studies, as well as fairly representing the cases of ideologues within sociology and other social sciences who forward theories that are incompatible with reality (the blank slate, the noble savage, the ghost in the machine). He eloquently dismantles them from the inside out with a wealth of peer reviewed resources and a refreshing honesty that is lacking in particular academic fields. His characterization of the zealots who are responsible for the various problems reviewed in the book is spot on and reveals his deep understanding of human psychology and human sociology, which appears to be superior in some instances to sociologists' grasp of their own field. The way he dissects postmodernism with a zest for fully exposing its nastier facets is almost unheard of this day and age, and is for that reason all the more awe inspiring. One of the telling features of this book's power is not even a trait of the book itself, but of the reviews the book has garnered over its years of publication. Interestingly, the reviews on Goodreads are all of the same flavor. You'll find that the negative reviews come overwhelmingly from those who are followers of the ideologies Pinker crushes under his gavel of intellectual acumen, and their appreciation for the book is colored by this devotion to creed, rather than a curiosity for the complex beauty of reality. Another brand of review comes from those not familiar with the ideologies Pinker is criticizing, and so many see it as a bizarre attempt to debunk outdated ideas that no one holds. None of these criticisms address his actual claims or show a strong familiarity with the ideas he is going after. One gets the sense that massive cults devoted to the preservation of ideological purity have poured through the cracks to unleash their displeasure at the iconoclast who dared question their dogma. There are a number of criticisms of Pinker's book available online, though I've yet to find one that seems like the product of someone who actually read the book, or who was not fundamentally and romantically attached to the ideologies he debunks, thereby turning their reviews into a cage match of, ""Look, our ideas are great, and I am not going to listen to some deviant try to take this dogma away from us!"" Mis-characterization abounds, and ideological pleading takes the place of what could instead be reasoned reviews. Even scientifically literate reviewers (some of whom are supposedly scientists) have engaged in full-fledged anti-scientific analysis of his work, and have promoted intellectually fraudulent claims as a strange rebuttal to his examination of human nature. Almost every review that is not pleased with this book comes from someone desperately wanting to defend the ideologies Pinker spends 500 pages dismantling and eviscerating, far more eloquently than any reviewer has yet been able to try to piece them back together. Another unfortunate finding in many reviews of Pinker's book is the seemingly universal ignorance of third wave feminism and gender studies programs, (although, judging by the political fountain from which these writers seem to unanimously come, their ignorance seems staged to conveniently dismiss Pinker's valid criticisms instead of undertaking the laborious act of meeting his criticisms with a fair acknowledgment of the plagues from which the bad ideas are derived) which allows many reviewers and critics to believe that Pinker is concocting an extremist straw man, or addressing fringe views and attributing more power to them than they hold. Unfortunately, Pinker is profoundly right in his assessments, and the swarth of reviewers unaware of the institutions he's discussing imagine he is debunking some radical fictional thing existing only in his head. He is not. He is one of the few public intellectuals keen enough on the latest trends in postmodernist philosophies to adequately address them and give them fair treatment. Unfortunately, much of the wrong-headedness that has resulted in these bad ideas is not limited to University professors or impressionable undergraduate students, but is accepted and celebrated by people from all walks of life, including those who write book reviews for publications that somewhat foster the same politics and platforms championed by these vogue creeds. You can see the conflict. Pinker is crushing trendy ideas that have been celebrated by a large number of people for a long time, and it would have been remarkable if his groundbreaking work had not been met with a lot of unhappiness. Read some of these poor reviews here:http://www.nybooks.com/articles/archi...http://www.theguardian.com/books/2002...http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/200...Pinker presents the conflicting ideas of some prominent social scientists in the context of non-fiction for the first time, and lets us watch as they fall down under their own inconsistency, nonsense, and inability to accurately explain the very phenomena they were designed to. It should be no surprise that many thinkers devoted to the vogue creeds that are rampant in academic and public intellectual life are unhappy about Pinker's work. At every step, Pinker shows us the amazing capacity for anti-science within the social sciences, and how so many academics and intellectuals are susceptible to fashionable thinking and vogue views of reality that are so far out of line with observation and experiment that it makes one wonder how such fields have found funding for so long. But Pinker touches on this, too, and gives us a tragic view of where some of academia may be heading, but with a hopeful eye for where it could, instead, go. There is, to my knowledge, no better book for completely refuting the unfortunate (anti-)intellectual fashions of the era, while simultaneously enlightening the reader on the complex nature of human psychology and behavior. A wonderfully engaging and informed book from cover to cover. Recommended for: Individuals attached to postmodernism, cultural Marxism, critical theory, or related ideologies who are willing to engage with facts and objectivity outside their comfort zone. Particularly important for those whose years in academia were spent in Gender Studies programs in lieu of anything related to critical thinking (you'll see a lot of worldviews reduced to nothing but the silliness that set them in motion, presenting an honest picture of a sad vista of bad science). This will be a hurdle, but a worthwhile and enriching one. Also for anyone wanting a better understanding of how we work as humans. "
51,0142003344,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5317831-kerem,5,"I'll give it 4.5 stars overall, so why not round it up to 5?The very short summary of the book is that it focuses on three long-existing concepts - blank slate, nobel savage and ghost in the machine - and from a broad range of perspectives as well as with plenty of data and research literature, shows how they do not represent the reality in the cognitive sciences.In a bit longer summary, the book is a detailed and long critique of various ideologic perspectives from postmodernism to radical scientists, who wish to see human beings as blanks to start with (and filled with whatever doctrination or training or education they would wish.) The book has a more scientific focus to start with, presenting an interesting journey through cognitive science in the last decades, from evolutionary psychology to behavioural genetics. Then it dives into a part that gives different perspectives of why nature/nurture debate has been seen as problematic by various groups, and follows this up with some hot topics such as gender and children, argumenting why it is actually beneficial to accept a perspective providing more of a nature rather than nurture view (and of course with plenty of studies from a range of disciplines.) Pinker is in general witty, provides strong argumentation and the overall writing style of the book is very enjoyable.Even though the book is written in early 2000's and with quite a bit of a motivation of Pinker's feeling of 'had enough of these ideological and narrow perspectives' at that time, it still preserves its relevance in this day and age, considering what movements such as identity politics have become. The addition to the 2016 edition providing a critique of the book and how things changes in the 14 years between is also valuable in this respect."
52,0142003344,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1512303-dennis,4,"Steven Pinker takes on just about everything under the sun in this book on the evolution of the brain, psychology, and personality of homo sapiens as he debunks the long-favored notion of the blank slate championed by liberals for decades. The ""blank slate"" is the idea that humans are malleable and bear no real differences at birth, regardless of gender, race, ethnicity, or even socioeconomic background. Pinker also challenges the noble savage and ghost in the machine ideas of the person that have been in vogue in various circles over time. Of course, the blank slate is intuitively bunk (is it not?) to any parent of any child who recognizes immediately that their baby has innate qualities and preferences that differentiate them from others. But some just won't believe it until they see the scientific ""proof.""The first several chapters are not so exciting and invoke a sizable ick factor as the author lays out the theory of evolution to argue that there is no soul, but rather we are a ""hunks of meat"" walking about as the products of natural selection in which neurons, quarks, chemicals, etc., interact in concert and give the illusion of ""life."" While there is much to be admired in the research of many scientists since the days of Charles Darwin, not one has or could conclusively prove there is no God or that there are no souls. Belief in evolution alone is but another faith proposition and an alternative to belief in a supreme design. But all that aside, whether we descended from apes or were created after the earth came to be within 6,000 years is of no particular interest to me as far as the purposes of this book are concerned. I still just don't believe that the processes of creation and an intelligent designer are mutually exclusive concepts.What I really enjoyed was the author's application of sociobiology to a number of relevant current issues. Feminism, for example, has long fought for the proposition that men and women are exactly the same but for their genitalia, despite a whole host of evidence to the contrary. One recent example is a proclamation by someone I know that ""color knows no gender,"" when this is simply a denial of scientific facts. Many, many things are innate, such as certain preferences for colors (who am I to deny my daughter her favorite color pink, which she decided without any encouragement from us), gender roles, even the differences in the choices of profession. Women in particular may wish to persist in fighting against the grain, but they are fighting against nature and will continue to battle resistance embedded in our genes. So it's utterly refreshing to read scientific validation for what we already knew. The author is clear to distinguish between the worthiness of striving for egalitarian ideals through public policy and the facts that certain traits and attributes are in the fabric of our DNA whether we like that or not.This is not to say that Pinker does not touch on other topics that cause me discomfort. One such area is the idea that children are influenced by their environment less than we think. As support, the author cites studies of identical twins separated at birth who are raised in different environments yet turn out to be remarkably similar. While this does not discredit the importance of environment altogether, it confirms the relevance of heredity and that genetic factors count for a lot of our temperaments, our likes and dislikes, and our personalities.Portions of the book are devoted to providing biological explanations for the differences between political preferences, and that helped me see people a bit differently. Some are ""wired"" to be open to new experiences, while others prefer taking a cautious approach to changes in traditions and institutions. Understanding that this is biological phenomena helps to diffuse some tension as I wonder how some people can be taught one thing but then choose another. Simply put, our genetics can go a long way to explaining what we will prefer in the ballot box.I also really enjoyed the chapter on art in which the author demonstrates why the blank slate philosophy undergirding the modernist and post-modernist movements never resonated broadly with the population at large, because they denied human nature and attempted to affirm the concept that humans are created from birth rather than born with ingrained attributes. It makes intuitive sense that we force a square peg into a round hole by celebrating dysphonic music or art exhibits about detached torsos, graphic depictions of vaginas, and polemical crucifixes suspended in urine. This type of art is intended to shock and bring attention to the artist because the subject matter itself is of no appeal to human nature and the artists still believe that human nature is shaped and not inherited. Time to get with the times and stop denying science.Over all I would say this made for a very interesting read on various factoids from the author's broad depth of study. That is, after the first hundred pages or so which were tedious and didactic. Nevertheless, like almost anything there are two or more sides to every study and I suspect the author has cherry picked studies that affirm his own beliefs. Still, the information is meant to be presented objectively and there isn't as much condescension as might be expected from a scientist, an academic in his position. Pinker seems to articulate more libertarian than progressive views, which again is refreshing for somebody so steeped within a culture of liberal ideologues. I ended up enjoying this more than I thought I would, learned a whole lot, and have been challenged to view a number of things differently than I did before. This was worthwhile to read although it is probably not for everybody."

Yeah you get those books every now and then, those *Mixed-Feelings* genre, but the content is interesting for anyone whod love to hear different opinion regarding the human nature from multiple fields all at onceDrink tea.. Because I told you so! "
54,0142003344,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5942822-alan,4,"Definitely packs A LOT of information into each and every single one of its pages. It is information that is necessary to be an informed citizen of the modern world. However, Pinker's prose often comes across as dry, due to the sheer number of factoids that are being thrown at the reader with each sentence. That being said, the book does deserve the praise that it has received."
55,0142003344,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1360306-joshua-stein,3,"I realize that Pinker has a huge (and well deserved) following and that this book has gotten raving (and well deserved) reviews. I was really excited to dig into this book, because I find Pinker's presentations really interesting, and his writing style very accessible and clever. He likes to present a lot of data, moving through large swaths of history, many regions of academia, and he presents wonderful tidbits of information. At times he can seem disorganized (so can someone like Malcolm Gladwell) even when there's a very intentional writing style underlying the chaos.I don't really have a beef with the book. It was very good. I think it's great reading for those who are interested in the doctrine of the Blank Slate. I think it's an interesting area of study, and Pinker really does a terrific job of not setting the position up like a strawman. He is rigorously academic and attempts to be fair in his presentation of his opposition. He's a very interesting writer, and I find him very fun to read.But there are some problems that I have with the writing and structure of the book that made it frustrating, at times. While setting up his analysis of the conservative arguments surrounding the Blank Slate, and the political theories that are tied to it, and establishing his view of the negative consequences of the view, Pinker seems to be very careful to make the religious right (already very much an enemy of Pinker's position, generally) while coddling his prospective allies. There is something frustratingly political about the way that Pinker seems to set up his text, locating all of his enemies very decisively and then trying to take those who are not strictly enemies and make them into allies, or at least ensure that they are not excessively put off by his arguments.The other frustrating note is that Pinker deputizes a number of very complicated debates in academic communities into his arguments without properly contextualizing them. While he does present disputes between many political theorists (from Locke to Marx) in an interesting way, and with some respect for the challenges and nuances of their views, when he looks at the issues surrounding a lot of the evolutionary biology that is involved in this argument, he doesn't take all of the context behind those arguments into account. It is interesting to note the political (and religious) commitments of Stephen Jay Gould, but it is difficult to attempt to deputize disputes he had with the academic community into your argument without proper respect for the context that surrounds those issues, and many of the controversies that his views in biology were embroiled in. Disputes between Gould and Dawkins, for instance, are extensive and it is difficult to discuss parts of that dispute without addressing the larger debate over punctuated evolution in which those views were a part.There are pretty big problems, I think for the tact that Pinker chooses in making his arguments. There are regions of the text where he is not really clear about all of his evidence, and how extensive it is (part of this is a result of the general aversion to footnotes in popular science literature) when he makes what appear to be debatable claims. In referencing the endnotes, it is clear that he is well sourced and thorough when making those claims, but it is difficult, given his penchant for using block quotes and telling stories throughout the text, to deal with the conspicuous absence of such support with respect to what seem like reasonably serious claims.Overall, though, it is a solid read. Being nominated for a Pulitzer is a big deal, obviously, and he deserves that. He is a terrific writer, even with the concerns I have about structure, and the content of the book is really amazing. It covers a great deal of ground very quickly, and with enough detail that those who have experience can appreciate and learn from it, and being accessible enough that a layman can understand it."
56,0142003344,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4143-phoebe,3,"I tried this book three different ways, and I almost didn't make it through. Probably, I wouldn't have if not for the mild social pressure of my book group to just-keep-swimming through the academic bickering, myriad intricate examples backing up a single point, and curious social prescriptions based on non-science related to the scientific findings that Pinker records in the first half of this tomb whose #1 purpose, as I understood it (and certainly, I could be wrong) was to prove that humans might be born with fundamental natures. What these natures are, are yet to be deduced.Sure. Okay. I'll bite. So I read a library copy, read a Kindle copy, and then listened to the audio book version. And I learned a whole lotta stuff, which I promptly forgot (very similar to my experience in high school and college, trying to retain info about subjects of mild interest to me). My biggest take away was the permission to wonder about what humans come packaged with out-of-the-womb. Second, to be wary of subscribing too deeply to the Noble Savage concept --more out of respect for the complexity of experience in early inhabitants of places than because it's somehow a bad idea to attribute dignity to them. Third, I still don't 100% understand what Pinker meant by the Ghost in the Machine (if not 'soul'.)Just as I was coming to the end of the book, it was explained to me that THIS was the study that resulted, in perhaps a round-about way, the expulsion of a Harvard University President just a year or so after I started my job in Cambridge, MA. I can now understand, somewhat, what lead to that (and to the hiring of Harvard's new(ish) and first female President Drew Faust. This book has so many words and runs so deep in content that it's easy to be swept along with the current and find yourself agreeing with the author almost by default --feeling magnanimous and a little light-headed once you've wrestled with the concepts he presents, and digested the material. Halfway through, I found myself spouting some of Pinker's ideas in conversation!All in all, I AM glad I read it because now I have lots of context for human behavior related to analyzing human behavior (meta!) I do find it hard, sometimes, to spend so much time in such a male space, a heteronormative space, and a white Canadian-American of certain-access-and-particular-reach space. I don't say this to diminish Pinker's work, but rather to point out some of the natural limits I bumped up against. And we all have natural limits, right? That's okay.Oh! One thing I nearly forgot: Pinker's Righteous Woman Shield!! In the chapter where he asserts his support of a certain strand of feminism he literally composes a LENGTHY list of women whom he holds up, I assume, as proof that he's not a misogynist when he says that maybe the ladies don't much like science or math (see Harvard President debacle above). Elsewhere, related to sexual assault, he never once mentions male victims, so I assume the blinders that led Pinker to feel he needed to present a literal list of female thinkers who'll back him up are the same blinders that permit him and others to ignore a rather enormous similarity between the supposedly opposite sexes --that both suffer these experiences. (I don't think trans-folk even make an appearance in the book.)Finally, I read part of this book while sitting in juror selection. That was odd and a little disturbing. Next time, juror selection = comics?"
57,0142003344,http://goodreads.com/user/show/662191-noreen,5,"This is the story of the politicization of social science. In the political climate of the sixties and seventies, with the civil rights and feminist movements, anti-war sentiment, the sexual revolution, increasing mistrust of capitalism and imperialism (colonialism), it was fashionable to subscribe to the utopian ideals of Marxism, socialism, communism. These depended on the blank slate -- that everyone is born exactly equal, that the individual isn't important, that society is the superorganism that shapes us and drives change. This was not supported by the theory of natural selection; however popular opinion, not science, led the way. Radical scientists and social constructionists, with their firm belief in Blank Slate doctrine and its sisters, The Noble Savage and The Ghost in the Machine, were in charge. Then E.O. Wilson published Sociobiology. The study of human behavior as innate (that we are born with a complex psychological endowment) was anathema to the Blank Slate. It was deemed to lead to determinism, racism, classism, sexism. Much vitriol was hurled at Wilson and others who studied behavioral genetics. Naturally, they were equated with Hitler. As data from twin studies, genomic studies, etc. accumulated, there was increasing evidence against the Blank Slate doctrine, but its proponents did not let go and they are still going strong. This stubborn adherence to the denial of human nature has led to failed social programs in many fields of endeavor. Real human nature lies somewhere on the continuum between the Tragic Vision and the Utopian Vision, and when people can get off their ideologies and pay attention to the scientific evidence in support of an innate, but not inflexible, human nature, endowed by Darwinian natural selection, we can make progress in more realistic directions. Pinker pulls no punches in examining the hot button issues in light of this nature versus nurture debate.There's so much to think about here. As I read, my feelings that there has historically been very little science in the social sciences, including psychology, were confirmed. Parenting advice has been, and still is, based on fashion rather than fact. I've been personally misled and misguided by blank slate thinking, and find I need to rethink a lot of my beliefs and reexamine my memories in light this new knowledge. I am now a firm Darwinian leftist. In light of the findings that our parents have far less influence on us than previously thought, I need to apologize to my mother. In line with popular trend, I blamed her for making me who I am.When I read the chapter on gender, I thought of a talk by self-styled feminist skeptic and blogger Rebecca Watson entitled ""How Girls Evolved to Shop, and other ways to insult women with 'science'"" as an example of the gender feminist mentality, which is dependent on the blank slate doctrine. Her lack of understanding of evolutionary psychology, and of science in general, is as clear as her bias. (https://m.youtube.com/#/watch?v=r9SvQ...) No wonder feminism has such a bad name. If I accept the label at all, I'd say I'm an equity feminist."
58,0142003344,http://goodreads.com/user/show/873902-ryan,5,"This is one of the most amazing books that I've read. It's well-written, well-argued and very interesting.The book is mostly about which parts of human behavior are hard-wired and which can be changed. The best example of both is language: we have an inborn ability to recognize nouns, verbs and grammar (rather than just hearing a bunch of gobbledygook), but we learn the language spoken where we grow up.The first third goes through a lot of the science, though the science is, of course, discussed throughout. The second third discusses why accepting that there is a human nature is not a threat to values or morality. Pinker is mostly concerned with fending off arguments from the left (what he calls the ""radical left""). This is because the radical left feels it's necessary to think that humans can be completely re-written e.g. gender and culture are just inventions and it is these cultural inventions that cause violence. The left also want to believe in the Noble Savage--humans were living peaceful, happy lives before big society came and ruined everything. Pinker shows the fallacies of these arguments. He also shows how liberal values need not, and should not, depend on these false concepts of human nature. And he's pretty persuasive. This is not to say that Pinker doesn't address the political right. The right does not, of course, like the findings that there is no Ghost in the Machine (i.e. a dualistic concept that a ""soul"" does our thinking for us). But, since the science mostly speaks for itself, and since most of the right's arguments are non-falsifiable claims to authority (e.g. ""My [insert relevant god here] says we are this way, so we are""], they get a lot less time in this book.The last third of the book deals with ""hot-button"" issues. I thought the Gender, Violence and Children chapters were the best (the Arts chapter lagged behind a bit). They were full of fun facts, interesting research, and wonderful explanations of knowing our real human nature can strengthen our morals (and get rid of a few unfounded claims to morality).The final section is very cool: Pinker uses several artists to show how certain artists have done a masterful job of describing our complex nature, where we humans, with all our inborn tendencies, needs and limitations, adapt (or sometimes fail to adapt) to the societies and environments we find ourselves in. Pinker cites some of my favorites: Emily Dickinson, Kurt Vonnegut, Mark Twain and George Orwell. So, even though a few spots are a smidgen dry, this book is just amazing. Highly recommended. "
59,0142003344,http://goodreads.com/user/show/705887-broodingferret,5,"This book was simply excellent. If there is one thing I have never been able to stand about postmodernism, it's the fact that it promotes a mindset that has a tendency to make empirical claims about the world without feeling the need to back up said claims with empirical evidence. In The Blank Slate, Pinker does a marvelous job of taking to task poorly-considered relativist views of the human mind, and he does it with an erudite eloquence that is impressive without being pompous. Pinker's main targets are what he views as being the three postmodern doctrines of human behavior: The Blank Slate (the idea that everything in human behavior and thought is learned, nothing is innate), The Noble Savage (the original human condition-i.e. hunter/gatherers in prehistory-was completely free of violence, discrimination, power structures, etc.), and The Ghost In The Machine (the mind is some kind of other worldly presence that controls the body, rather than the product of a physical, though incredibly complex brain). Pinker's primary points are that 1) the three doctrines are wrong, 2) the doctrines have traditionally been supported for political/moral reasons, rather than scientific ones (even in scientific circles), and 3) the doctrines are just as prone to misuse as the more empirical processes that are typically vilified by the doctrines' proponents, and are therefore not politically/morally superior to empirical views. And while Pinker does back his arguments up with a substantial amount of evidence, he doesn't limit himself to simply presenting data, but also covers the philosophical flaws of the postmodern mentality, insofar as it deals with the human mind and behavior. Nor does he aim to defend some super-reductionist view such as ""genes are everything"", as such determinism is just as wrong-headed as postmodernism. Instead, Pinker aims to demonstrate that the human mind is extremely complex and that the factors that influence it-genetic, social, environmental-are equally complex.While views of human behavior and mental function seem, if my experience is any indication, to have become more balanced in the 10 years since The Blank Slate's release (e.g. the more widely accepted idea that nature and nurture makes more sense than nature or nurture), many of the postmodern fallacies discussed in this book still seem to hold some sway on modern thinking, making The Blank Slate just as relevant now as when it was first published."
