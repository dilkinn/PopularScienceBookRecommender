0,030014878X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5919936-chris-lynch,5,"This will be a lengthy review, but no less than is deserved. You may even feel, after this review, that you have no need to read the book! This would be a mistake - all I am doing here is summarising in very broad terms, and giving some of my own thoughts on McGilchrist's opus.This is certainly the most remarkable non-fiction book I have read this century. You know the 'diamond bullet' quote from Apocalypse Now? This book was like a machine gun firing diamond bullets, straight into my skull, thud-thud-thud. Though it is not without a few problems, which I will address a little further on.Iain McGilchrist's thesis is that there are two fundamentally different ways of regarding the world, which have jostled for cultural domination throughout mankind's history; two 'ways of being' that correspond to two different types of attention that we give the world with our minds - and by a coincidence that he feels is too unlikely to be mere happenstance, the brains of complex organisms are divided into two halves, bridged by the corpus callosum, for no biologically useful reason that is immediately obvious - an argument might be made for redundancy, except that the experiences of stroke victims tell us otherwise. McGilchrist offers a wealth of neuroscientific evidence that the evolutionary advantage of this divide is to maintain the separation between these two types of attention, and thereby enhance the extent to which they are separately empowered by their inability to interfere with each other; thereby giving us two ways of looking at the world, the interplay of which gives rise to our incredible creative power. He is well qualified to talk about this - as well as having taught English and Philosophy at Oxford University, he is also a former researcher in neuroimaging, consultant psychiatrist and clinical director, and the chapter on brain function - the lengthiest in the book - is backed by over 500 references to published research.The two fundamentally different ways of regarding the world are not, as some people might initially assume, the socialism - capitalism divide, the mutual antipathy of which is described very aptly as ""little more than a farmyard scrap between two dogs over a bone."" McGilchrist sees the extremes of different types of economic organisation as all manifestations of the same way of looking at the world - that of the focussed attention of the left hemisphere, the model-builder, the manipulator, the game-player, which sees the world as an assemblage of parts that operate according to a set of rules.The right hemisphere, by contrast, gives open, broad attention to the world, seeing it as a unified, living whole. It doesn't chop the experience of the senses into categories for processing - this is the job of the left hemisphere - but rather, remains unfocused and more aware of the whole rather than its components. To state McGilchrist's assertion in the most horribly over-simplified and reductive way that does no justice to the splendour of his book, you might say it appreciates beauty and intuition rather than message and process.The Master and his Emissary is a polemical work. McGilchrist believes it is fairly evident that the culture of the western developed world is dominated to an undesirable degree by the left hemisphere, and that we have entered a phase of positive feedback in which this imbalance will continue to increase, to our detriment. The utilitarian (left-hemisphere) argument would point to things like mental health statistics, social breakdown, resource mismanagement and biodiversity loss that may adversely affect our own economic wellbeing. The right hemisphere would say - 'Anyone can see that this is just plain ugly'. The author clearly feels that right-hemisphere 'ways of being' need to be brought back into our world to a greater extent. As such this book may be seen by some readers - who choose to ignore McGilchrist's frequent reminders to the contrary - as a giant attack on rationality. But the fact that this book fights the case for more right-hemispheric intuition, empathy and sensitivity does not mean, as one review I have read rather snidely remarked, that McGilchrist wants us all to go back to living as simple-but-happy peasant subsistence farmers ruled over by slightly more left-hemispheric feudal overlords - which made me suspect the reviewer had skim-read the book or was being deliberately disingenuous.The author himself admits that there is a gap between the reductionist scientific evidence he brings to the table regarding the function of the hemispheres, and the conclusions we might draw about the way they have influenced cultural development, and the implications for society. He freely admits that his conclusions are intuitive, requiring 'necessary distance' and 'unfocussed attention' to see them rather than a reductionist proof. He likens the process to looking at a piece of paper covered in dots, embedded in which is a picture of a dalmation - if you can see it, you know it is there, even though its form isn't clearly delimited. And if you simply focus on the individual dots you won't see it at all. My own take on this, is that where we are debating what's best for society, the individuals that comprise it, and the world we live in, we don't have the luxury of controlled double-blind trials. We don't have a spare planet and the luxury of a few centuries to try out different models of society, and we can't control all the variables. Imperfect evidence and a healthy dose of intuition are our only guides here.I have in recent years read a number of books that illuminate and discuss the problems of modern society; but none that made sense of them as a unified whole in such a clear way as this book. It is a tremendously exciting read and one that caused me to experience many 'Yes!' moments of agreement and 'Aha!' moments of revelation. There is a danger, here, in that McGilchrist's model of hemispherically-based 'ways of being' is so seductive that it's tempting to start interpreting all sorts of spurious everyday events and experiences, and the behaviours of those around us, in terms of this model - ""He/She's so left-hemispheric"" could become a new insult in the mouths of people who subscribe to McGilchrist's thesis. Which isn't really what the author is aiming for, as this kind of 'dividing the world into two kinds of people' is exactly the sort of left-hemispheric behaviour he feels there's more than a bit too much of.Now, on to the more problematic elements of his work, which I mentioned at the beginning. I want here to pre-empt some fairly obvious criticisms that I think people will have of this book.First, religion. McGilchrist is manifestly not an unalloyed materialist in his personal philosophical approach to the world - he freely admits that he sees the purely mechanistic model of the world as a faith-based position like all other philosophies, and not a very appealing one at that. Anyone acquainted with scientific method, and possessing a modicum of philosophical sophistication, and who is honest with themselves, knows that try to reduce things as you may there always comes a point somewhere in your view of the world where you take things on trust, or faith, or belief - call it what you will. The only alternative is solipsism - denial that anything exists at all. So, the author feels that there is a place for reverence, awe and spirituality in our lives as a better alternative to cold, dead materialism devoid of meaning, even if we might not want to take an explicitly theist stance. With the current fashion in militant atheism, largely a counter-reaction to creationism and the I.D. movement in the U.S., this will make for uncomfortable reading and provoke more than a few knee-jerk reactions in people who would be the natural audience for this book. The writer points out that organised systems of religion with their rules and rituals are themselves constructions of the left hemisphere; but in the lengthy section of the book that deal with the cultural history of the west, scientific materialism (as a philosophical viewpoint, not scientific method, knowledge and application) takes a bit of a kicking, while religion seems to come off a bit lightly in comparison. Pretty much the only bad thing to have happened in the religious life of the west was the Reformation, it seems. Or at least, this is how it comes across - an apology for religion, if you will. I suspect McGilchrist would say that atrocities committed in the name of debased religion are no different to those committed in the name of anything else - and to be fair he doesn't harp on about how many millions were killed by atheist dictators either; his focus is solely on cultural contributions of the hemispheres. And he fastidiously avoids making personal statements of religious belief - one strongly suspects that he has religious or at least spiritual convictions, but he's not telling. Nonetheless, some people will fixate on this willingness to accept religion as a valid part of life and see it as throwing the entire edifice of his work into doubt. Such people could do with reminding that many scientists and thinkers of the past, whose work underpins our technologically advanced society, themselves held religious convictions, but that doesn't stop your light bulbs from working when you flick the switch. Next, the mystique of the Orient. McGilchrist says at the outset that he does not intend to examine the cultural history of the orient due to a lack of familiarity, but towards the end of the book he expresses a belief that east asian cultures may have something to teach the West in terms of getting back in touch with our right hemispheres. His evidence for this seems a bit more specious than for the other 'science bits' of the book, and revolves around the greater ability of east asians to work together as a team, and their greater willingness to conform to the needs of their family, peer group or working unit - in other words, a less individualistic approach. They also exhibit a better ability than westerners to look at a picture and grasp the relationships between parts of the scene, whereas westerners tend to fixate on details of the 'subject' of the picture and tend not to remember what was happening in the background. I have read of similar research results elsewhere. But does this really mean they are more in touch with their right-hemispheres? I can't help thinking of the immense bureaucracy of medieval China, the rigid doctrines of Confuscianism, the closing of the Silk Road, and no shortage of totalitarian regimes or inhuman cruelty arising from a lack of empathy - all control-freak behaviours that McGilchrist has identified with an unchecked left-hemisphere. Might it not be the case that what the author has taken as evidence of greater right-hemisphere awareness is in fact evidence of greater left-hemisphere cultural priming for the acceptance of a more collective, socialist society rather than the west's greater emphasis on individualism? But no less mechanistic, materialist and rules-based?For the record, I agree with McGilchrist that the West might learn something from the East, but in terms of getting the balance right between collective and individualist behaviour, which isn't necessarily the same thing as increased right hemispheric behaviour. However, it also seems to me that deciding where the best balance lies between these - which itself may vary dependant on the specifics of the moment - is an exercise for right-hemispheric intuition to resolve, so in a roundabout way maybe he's still correct.Third - Africa. This is a book written from the perspective of a white European, and someone who takes pains not to express strong opinions on things he feels he knows nothing about; a commendable characteristic. But the lack of any comment whatsoever on native african and african american culture and its influence on the cultural history of the West will not go unnoticed in some quarters. In this, McGilchrist is damned if he does, and damned if he doesn't, and he probably knows it. His dialogue is in terms of broad cultural epochs, not race; so it may not have occurred to him to go out of his way to discuss the impact of black culture. But even the fact that he might not feel it especially relevant is bound to upset someone. It could be worse, though - he may even be in the uncomfortable position of having nothing very flattering to say - he's clearly no cultural relativist - and this may wrongly be construed as racism. On a related note, he explicitly skirts the issue of gender differences in hemisphere function.These difficulties aside, I think this is a truly marvellous book and definitely a book for our times, and deserves to be widely read and discussed. Read it, and you will, even if you disagree with the author's central thesis, be treated to some fascinating revelations from the world of neuroscience, and a lovely stroll through the history of language, art and philosophical thought. It will be roundly criticised by those of a strongly materialist bent, or those with dogmatically utilitarian political beliefs, who will deny the dalmation is there amidst the spots, or will simply declare, in their usual self-referential abdication of responsibility, that if the hemisphere correlation is true, then the left hemisphere has clearly already demonstrated its evolutionary superiority to the right. It will also, unfortunately, be used as a prop by all manner of charlatans peddling snake-oil, underwriting their product's efficacy by claiming that it 'taps into the latent power of the right hemisphere'. Or somesuch. But for some of us, at least, it will answer in a very lucid and convincing fashion, what is surely one of the most-asked questions of the 21st century: ""Is it just me or is everything shit?"" And more than this, it will offer an insight into what might be done about it."
1,030014878X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4369435-jay-kamaladasa,3,"I'm being a bit harsh giving this 3 stars because it is a really good book and everyone should read it. But there are inherent flaws on Iain's arguments that I cannot come to terms with. The first being that he treats the Right Brain as superior to the Left brain (the master and the emissary), which in itself is a hierarchical (left brain) way of thinking. Second, the author doesn't realize that religion is mostly left brain oriented. The inability of the left hemisphere to deal with uncertainty is the cause of all this God, karma, reincarnation hypothesis. The third and most important is the fact that the author doesn't warn about the right-brain impulsivities that plague most of the Eastern world. The herd mentality, the lack of individualism, the lack of introspection, the lack of proactiveness are all causes of a dominant right-hemisphere suppressing the left brain. And anyone who's lived in an eastern country (or even a small village) would immediately realize this. So rather than giving the high-ground to one hemisphere, this book would've been so much better if it was balanced. Rather than a Master and an Emissary, it would've retained it's scientific touch (which it does so brilliantly in the first few chapters) if the story was about two masters, struggling, co-existing and co-inhabiting the brain. "
2,030014878X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/863801-ade-bailey,1,"1 It took McGilchrist 20 years to write.From the author's website, http://www.iainmcgilchrist.com/brief_... , comes a brief description of the book which you may be best to read first or only.Now I was very sniffy about even picking this book up. The author had been doing the publicity tour and several people after about the five minutes or so minute interview they may have heard, were waxing lyrical to me about how a real scientist confirmed what the ancients have always known. Such knowledge often elevates the anti-rational, 'emotional' right hemisphere, aka 'the female side' or Yin principle, while dissing the unfeeling logical male left hemisphere. And so on. When I did pick the book up I was delighted to find him dismissing such nonsense in no uncertain terms, actually more ferociously than I ever have myself. So I read on.McGilchrist has a compression of style which I like but demands attention and that tiresome, plodding thing called effort (such as an unfeeling rationalist may be able to give, unhindered by any feelings or imagination). He frequently raises topics and says he'll come back to them.He begins by looking at brain functions in a quite straightforward way, not dissimilar to Damasio in approach. For me,who's been interested in neurophysiology most of my adult life. much of it is fascinating. Like Damasio too, he veers towards the view that emotion holds everything together, that social skills acquired early on in human evolution correlate with right hemisphere locations, as does music or the early articulation of a musical language; utterly contradicting pop psychology, he suggests that there is plenty of evidence that many aspects of high intelligence are found in the right hemisphere's 'how'. Good scientist that he is (I say 'scientist' but remember he is too a highly experienced psychiatrist and of that school which tends to psychiatry as a humanistic enterprise), he stresses the status of his provisional hypotheses or conclusions gleaned from evidence, and stresses too the limitation of models, including conceptual models, of course. What I particularly like is the growing feeling that he is moving towards an exploration of the crucial role of metaphor in culture and thinking generally, and in art, philosophy and science particularly.I detect between the lines, and think it's not difficult to do, what I would call a naive cultural pessimism and things get worse as the book progresses. There are positions he takes or assumes which I think are not as transparent as he seems to think and I look forward to highlighting these in Part 2.I have made a shortish list of key questions which I shall have with me as I enter the main part of the book, something which I am very much looking forward to - partly because it is always worthwhile and interesting to see how a writer whom one respects relates to particular histories, philosophers and other key figures, as well as how the writer weaves together a coherent narrative - especially when it's something as big as the whole of human cultural evolution! 2 (up to the end of McGilchrist's Part 1)This is hard work. Extremely dense but I think I'm coping. Is there anybody out there? At best McGilchrist is bringing me excellent material on neuroscience. Sometimes I wish he'd stuck to that to make his case. He hasn't begun to suggest how brain and mind and culture relate together. (I most certainly hope he does not assume brain is the same as mind!) In fact, he's not making a case, he's constructing an argument, very much a Left Hemisphere (LH) activity, and he's doing it infuriatingly sloppily. Since he conflates reason/language'conceptual thinking with the LH which he is so definitely down upon, it is bizarre he has written such a long book depending on language, reason, sequential thinking. For him the Left Hemisphere is the usurper, the enemy of not only nature, art, religion, the body but of life itself. The LH offers only ghostly re-presentations of 'authentic' experience and, in its arrogance, believes its universe to be reality (whereas, of course, it is utterly separated from reality). Nowhere is there an acknowledgement of the immense philosophical difficulties that have saturated western thought regarding the ontologies of language, reason and thought. Instead we get a hotchpotch of his favourite artists, poets and philosophers as witnesses for his defence. If Heidegger, one of his favourites, or Goethe really have said it all before, why totally reframe it in neuroscience? He even, bizarrely, quotes a bit from one of the Upanishads about a bridge, which is supposed to be analogous to the corpus callossum's function between the brain hemispheres - keeping 'two worlds apart'.He has a go at Damasio (see my review, Descartes' Error) whom he claims has 'far outstripped Descartes at his own game' in making reason the master, and the rest (feelings, body) servant (presumably with reference to the somatic marker hypothesis). Yet, again, I wonder how on earth can he have spent 20 years systemising his own hypothesis, mining the ideas of thinkers from centuries past, concluding that lnguage (equals rational thinking) is a closed, self-referential system that cannot break out of himself (a concession to postmodernism he is forced to make) while using that very same system himself to build his system? I mean, if his 'truth' comes from some transparent, intuitive right hemispherical revelation, why does he need to go around the houses looking for chunks of language to build his case brick by brick?It may appear I'm not enjoying this much. Actually, I am for most of the time. McGilchrist seems unaware that it's ok to enjoy an aesthetic which is purely cerebral, more Bach than Wagner, more Apollo than Dionysus. There is a supreme joy in connectionism, the creative compounding of ideas, and actually his own writing at best is an example of this (presumably LH) aesthetic. As I said, he is clear (though I would think quite difficult for the novice) on neuroscience. In discussing a neurological correlation with the idea that consciousness is a 'canopy' that grows upwards from very deep, undivided brain structures before bifurcating (not totally, of course) at hemispherical level, he writes:There are known to be highly complex, and complexly interconnected, cortico-subcortical loops involving the basal ganglia, deep-lying nuclei in the brain, way below the corpus callosum, which, as we understand more about them, we realise increasingly are involved, not just in motor co-ordination as we used to think, but in both the segregation and the integration of motor, affective and cognitive functions. These 'loops' underlie subtle, emotionally laden aspects of experience. Although the cognitive, motor and affective elements are carefully segregated, even within the subthalamic nuclei - relay centres that are minutes (only 5-155 mm in diameter) - they are equally carefully interconnected....McGilchrist is concerned as here to explore, explain (and, dare one say, prescribe) processes of inhibition and facilitation neurocellular functioning in the status of integration or division; at a different level of his writing he employs logical reasoning to show how inhibition (e.g. of RH by LH) can be an example of integration (since division and unity can bring new unity, that is can be creative), but, to whet your appetite for the sort of writing you will encounter here:It is not, per contra, true that out of the unity of division and unity a new division comes, nor is it true that out of the division of unity and division a new division comes...I alluded above to the 'between the lines' cultural pessimism of McGilchrist. This is made explicit at times. He talks about 'meretricious' novelty or excitement seeking (of a left hemisphere cut off from authentic nature, life and so on, God presumably too). He talks about people (us) being dominated by the LH as a zombie 'whistling a happy tune as he ambles towards the abyss.' The actual words he uses referring to my earlier paraphrase are: The history of the last 100 years particularly.... contains many examples of the left hemisphere's intemperate attacks on nature, art, religion... The Left Hemisphere is described here as an autonomous monster! An entity that would destroy us. The writer is part of a much broader tradition of cultural conservatism. There is far too much to say about this tradition here but I dare say I shall return to it.There's quite a lot I have sympathy with in this work. I mean, as a lover of literature, I wouldn't be alone in mounting my own critique of society and culture. The difference is that McGilchrist is so dogmatically fixed into the vehicle of his exposition, so indignant, so sure he is an emissary from the halcyon cosmos that lies just over Sugarcandy Mountain. He has not, at this point of the book, realised that there are other frameworks that have grappled with his subject matter - and frameworks beyond the fine arts and fine ideas of philosophy. The fields of politics, economics, power, ideology and the psychoanalytic tradition (the latter a loose phrase; I'm thinking particularly of, though not necessarily endorsing, Marxist psychoanalysis and feminist psychoanalysis). Questions I take with me into the remainder of the book include. Where does tribalism come from? What does anthropology (or neuroanthropology) have to teach us about the evolution of the western world? Why has there always been war and destruction? Exactly when was the golden age and what was it like and how do we know? What is the role of complexity theory in suggesting explanations for the emergence of human societies, interactions and globalism? Will McGilchrist share his secret of staying immune from the onslaughts of language, reason, modern culture and 'the left hemisphere's intemperate attacks'?3Professor McGilchrist answers some of my questions, or at least addresses them at the start of Part II of his book. It should be relatively downhill for the second half of the book consists of his survey of 2000 years or so of Western culture in support of his thesis. I look forward to this as it's always good to see the myriad patterns that emerge from any such survey. How wonderful individuality is in shaping the past, lives, history, whatever; how many stories will there be always to be told. It does strike me that pattern making may be, as well as a coherent RH process, a legitimate and pleasurable LH thing to do. I'm sure I'll pick up little fragments of knowledge along the way, references to writers or thinkers new to me, quotable quotes and so on. Bricoleur that I am I shall store these against my ruin, and even try to make some assemblage of them. Of course, ironising is close to ire, and a contemptuous sneer of LH quality, but then again, suggesting one's own interpretation of the world as just that rather than making it a most beautifully humble gift is also pretty arrogant: the clue is in the rhetoric.He does, and I wish he emphasised this from the outset, make explicit the reciprocal relationship of culture and organism, long-term emergence and localised adaptation, and very lucidly shows how cultural transmission is so (I just know this is the wrong word) ""efficient"" (as well as influencing epigenetic factors involving the expression of genes). He acknowledges those other frames I mentioned earlier by which cultural history may be approached but doesn't really explain why, having dismissed them as too focused (missing the wood for the tress, as it were) his own approach is more freed to make an holistic overview. he comes very close, and this I find very easy to live with, to allowing us to live with the idea of the LH or the RH almost as anthropomorphisised entities, characterised by (deep) metaphor.He ends the short Chapter 7 at the start of Part II, before getting stuck into ""The Ancient World"" with the provocative statement: In our contemporary world.... we are busy imitating machines.Not that we are like machines, but we are machines. Earlier it was zombies, albeit happy ones, whistling as we walk towards the abyss. Who can save us?4As anticipated, the historical survey is 'easier going'. Not only that but extremely stimulating and well presented. The brief look at the introduction of the post-Socratic alphabet and use of currency in contexts of control, trade, power and wider historical developments is well done. the 'necessary distance' that, McGilchrist sees as crucial for being in the world (say in appreciating beauty, achieving empathy) is spelled out in terms of a period of harmony between the left and right hemispheres. It has now occurred to me that the writer may have been better advised in the earlier part of the book to emphasise the possibility that while the 'two worlds' of the hemisphere present a convenient fiction or metaphor, that a greater degree of relative closeness or distance between them would help his case. For instance, by his own painstaking arguments, the RH possesses its own 'syntax' (my word), language, cognition, and is not merely the passive recipient of 'experience' or 'perception' or 'presence': none of these things can be innocent or transparent. It may be better too, in terms of his central metaphor, to talk less, or imply less, absolute dominance of the (bad) LH or (good) RH, since it's likely that there are degrees of dominance. I would think that even the same individual can vary, voluntarily or unconsciously, modes of cognition and feeling depending upon context. T.S.Eliot, for instance was banker and poet.5No wonder the second part of the book was fast to read. It was virtually all familiar. His sermon during the opening pages of the final chapter could stand alone as ti gathers the predictions and analyses of many cultural pessimists. As the author says himself he will have failed if he has achieved clarity since that would be to betray him as a Left Hemisphere thinking. Oddly, he didn't begin to question his highly technological expert knowledge drawn from theory and the DSM (whose gargantuan taxonomy offered with no qualification as to its usefulness or uselessness) In particular, he seemed to me to hide behind his reader's ignorance to say the most alarming things about schizophrenia (which he was relating to 'culture' - you know, 'culture') given that it may cover a multidimensional cluster of affective disorders: some even think the term is more trouble than it's worth. But we are asked to judge an expert.He's an expert on much. A whole paragraph on every art movement in 'modernism'. A complete paragraph given to cinema. He gives less emphasis to political struggles. He ignores entirely the cultural works of the labouring classes, and elevates high culture in the forms of culture backed by Morality and Religion. He bemoans the loss through industrialism and urbanism of old social orders and hierarchies, talking of a 'breakdown' of 'the loss of a sense of belonging'. I would suggest that this was partly to do with nationalist wars, and with suffrage and the birth of socialism. I am not in the least surprised to have found myself thinking of Leavis and the Scrutiny movement.'Post-modernism' (Post-modernism) is encapsulated in four and a half pages. If a concept can be demonised, this is it. Post-modern art is a bully, all about power, tries to intimidate its vulnerable audience.Then again, this syndrome is 'familiar to psychiatrist because of the way psychopaths use displays of a lack of feeling - a jokey, gamesy, but chilling indifference...'The book is highly repetitive (and often it is angry posturing that is repeated), makes some interesting connections in the historical survey (but this is a highly selective survey designed to carry his ideological thrust), is interesting on brain structures -- although he has to concur at the end that even if future research doesn't support his correlative linkage between the two hemispheres, as metaphor of something like divided soul etc. will still hold - and then he's back to hundreds of years before 'neuro' had been coined!The worst thing about this book is its almost innocent assumption that the brain is the mind.Human beings are encultured creatures, and the history and development of cultures is not something I think McGilchrist has even considered as having provided a very erudite and larned body of knowledge - let alone being able to contribute to that body. Incidentally, a book I received today, Aping Mankind: Neoromania, Darwinitis and the Misrepresentation of Humanity by Raymond Tallis says that McGilchrist's thesis 'represents Neuromania at its most extreme.'"
3,030014878X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/180643-jim-coughenour,5,"Ian McGilchrist's thick book on the ""divided brain"" is the most interesting book I've read this year. I'd come to regard the fabled right brain/left brain antithesis as so much entertaining pop psychology (e.g., Daniel Pink's A Whole New Mind) — handy for provoking corporate robots, but hardly more than a convenient fiction. McGilchrist has convinced me that it's a metaphor worth taking seriously, that in fact it may be the fundamental metaphor for a scientistic age.McGilchrist's thesis is simple: the right hemisphere of the brain (the ""Master"" of his title) provides our primary connection to the world – to whatever is outside ourselves; the left hemisphere is its Emissary, breaking wholes into parts, analyzing and abstracting, devising categories, names and theories, then returning the results of its investigations to the right brain to be integrated into lived experience. The health of both individuals and civilizations depends upon the reciprocal connection. The problem is that the left brain, which imagines it ""knows"" things it can't possibly know, usurps its role and projects its own partial, definite vision of the world onto the world's essentially ambiguous reality.Stated simply (and the above is my own wording for McGilchrist's argument) I risk making the book sound as if it was written by a crank with an overweening metaphor. Nothing could be further from the truth. The book, which begins by examining a huge range of neurological research on the brain, then examines how the structure of the brain has affected (nothing less than!) the history of Western civilization, is continuously fascinating, rich in detail and bold in observation. Both its science and practice of philosophy are exemplary. McGilchrist takes almost 500 pages to build his case. Fortunately, he's an engaging and unpretentious writer.His argument reminded me of some of the most stimulating books I've ever read. A short list of ideational echoes: James Hillman's discussion of ""seeing through"" in Revisioning Psychology; Owen Barfield's examination of polarity in the evolution of consciousness in What Coleridge Thought; F S C Northrup's study of the Aesthetic and Theoretic components in The Meeting of East and West; Paul Ricoeur's theory of ""second naivete"" in The Symbolism of Evil; and Colin Falck's post-structuralist approach to literary language in Myth, Truth and Literature. Each of these books is a touchstone to me, and each is illuminated by McGilchrist's speculations.At the same time, McGilchrist's discussion and bibliography pointed me to books I'd never heard of and now can't wait to read: Louis Sass's Madness and Modernism; Stephen Gaukroger's The Emergence of a Scientific Culture; and Joseph Leo Koerner's The Reformation of the Image. I realize this review doesn't do much more than emphasize my own enthusiasm – but for the curious reader, maybe that will suffice."
4,030014878X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5558652-emma-sea,0,"I quit at 46% (which is actually 2/3 of the way through as the ebook finished at 68%) and watched the crib notesVery well written, thoroughly researched, but I found it a drag read. "
5,030014878X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/26188-jafar,0,"I find it impossible to rate this book. The author is astonishingly erudite, and this book must be the culmination of a lifetime of research and study. The problem with the book is not just that it’s difficult and dense, but, more importantly, that it’s difficult to put the pieces together and get a coherent picture. McGilchrist is making an enormous claim, and he has written a magnum opus to prove it. The individual chapters offer amazing information and insight into not just brain and neurology, but history, arts, linguistic, philosophy, and psychology. But once you finish the book, you ask yourself: Am I now convinced that the differences in the two brain hemispheres can explain the course that Western world has taken over the past 500 years? I’m not sure you can answer that question with a resounding yes.McGilchrist warns in the introduction of the book against the popular simplifications that the left hemisphere is hardnosed, logical, realistic, and boring (and male!), and the right hemisphere is creative and exciting (and female!). But once he proceeds with the long and detailed explanation of the differences between the hemispheres and their functions and the way they interpret the world, you feel like he ends up proving the same things that he had warned against as being misconceptions. Regardless – the first half of the book is a fascinating study of the brain. What he wants to prove is that even though the right hemisphere has a clear primacy in understanding the world, the left hemisphere has been more and more triumphant in dictating its picture of the world.The second half get into social sciences and tries to find and provide evidence for the aforementioned claim, and attempts to explain the more recent Western history based on the hemispheric differences. This is where it gets murky, and you feel that McGilchrist is turning from a scientist into a scientist with an agenda. There are so many questions that arise here. How did the left hemisphere suddenly become triumphant? Are we undergoing rapid changes in our brain structure? How do you prove a causal relationship between the course of history and the hemispheric differences? What if history and culture have taken a turn to the “ways of the left hemisphere” for completely other reasons? What does it even mean that now arts and culture are more influenced by the left hemisphere? The book is definitely a masterpiece – even though you can end up thinking that the author is too smart for his own good. This wasn’t an easy read. I tried reading it by the pool once. I felt ridiculous and put it away. "
6,030014878X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/974210-erik-graff,2,"This is an ambitious work, reminiscent of Hegel's Phenomenology of Mind, but without the happy ending. The first half is a review to date of research in the hemispherical differentiation of the human brain. The second half is a survey of Western history since Homer, told in terms of presumed shifts of hemispherical dominance. One is also reminded of C.G. Jung's Psychological Types, another survey of Western history related to psychological theory, focused primarily on the history of ideas.Personally, I found reading this tome an ordeal. The first portion was more intellectually interesting as I hadn't read much in this field since Ornstein and Jaynes in the seventies. This served as an update, but too long-winded and repetitive, The second portion was far more readable, but so selective as to be unconvincing. Besides, unlike Hegel or Jung, it was depressing.To McGilchrist's credit, his concluding remarks allow for the very real possibility that his beliefs about the differences between the hemispheres and their respective influences may be mistaken. He holds, however, to his historical narrative and, particularly, to his diagnosis of the current unhappy situation--a diagnosis with which I substantially agree. "

8,030014878X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/73783-taka,5,"Note to self: The first chapters are a real slog to get through, with a litany of neurobiological and psychological differences between the left and right hemispheres, but after McGilchrist sets down all the facts as he found them, it's a fascinating read. Though he repeatedly cautions the reader that the hemispheric differences are not to be considered absolute in any way (as they depend on each other and we are almost always using both hemispheres in our day-to-day lives), his book ironically reinforces the folk psychology view of the brain in terms of right and left. But then that's a infinitesimally minor issue. His sheer erudition is simply mesmerizing and what I often appreciate about erudite minds is that they approach problems carefully, tentatively, allowing for fuzzy boundaries and uncertainties, the way, say, Wittgenstein approaches philosophical problems, or Montaigne ruminates on various issues of how to live life better, or my translation theorist hero Douglas Robinson compares the act of translation to spirit channeling (which would be, in McGilchrist's terms, left hemisphere trying to describe a right hemisphere activity). In other words, McGilchrist is subtle and expansive and enlightening and—most importantly—anti-dogmatic. The huge takeaway from this book is that we have two diametrically opposed modes of living and looking at the world, represented by our different brain hemispheres. Our LH likes to look at the world and ourselves as machines (epitomized by scientific materialism a la Daniel Dennett and the other three Horsemen of new atheism), but the problem is that the metaphors we use to describe/understand something alters the nature of what we are looking at and what we eventually find from it. So if we think of the world as a huge machine, then we will only see the machine-like aspects of the world (helped by what psychologists call confirmation bias, theory-blindness, and self-fulfilling prophecy). On the other hand, the RH way of looking at the world is, familiarly enough, holistic, contextual, interdependent, and—dare I say this?—spiritual (as opposed to serial, isolated, linear, & mechanistic). It's always reaching out for the Other, seeking what lies beyond the literal. Metaphor is key here, and the crucial thing about this mode of living/seeing the world is that it needs to remain implicit & intuitive (just try explaining a joke or a metaphor without killing it) in order for it to function well. So what happens when LH tries to explain this thing that it doesn't understand? It kills it. RH is concerned with reciprocity, holiness, relationships, contexts, individuals, concreteness, etc. while LH is all about competition, control, power, acquisition, abstraction, overconfidence, and, of course, UTILITY. For LH, everything—altruism, artwork, religion, creativity, food, etc.—is reducible to utility. How do you get people to meditate? You tell them 15 minutes of daily meditation will decrease the risk of heart attack by so-and-so percent. Utility. How do you sell artworks? You tell them their relaxation effects will help them get through a nerve-wrecking business meeting. Basically, this book put into words everything I've felt wrong about our over-reliance on science (you can smell the reek of dogmatic condescension when you hear people categorically dismiss any ""unscientific"" phenomena with an air of epistemological superiority). Atheism, to me at least, misses the point (it's not whether God exists—a factual claim I really don't care to argue about—but HOW you see the world and live your life. It's your disposition toward the world we're talking about when we talk about spirituality and religion and belief (but alas, LH, being literal, doesn't understand the difference). I for one wouldn't want to live in a mechanistic world drained of mystery and wonder). I've always admired Wittgenstein, not only for his way of thinking, but also for his passionate yearning to believe in something larger than himself despite being unable to do so (too much philosophizing/LH thinking hampers RH activity; rationality kills faith, as it did for me in college).Once I realized that the scientific view is just that, a view and not THE view (clarity is not a degree of perception but a type of knowledge), and that the metaphors we use and the attention we bring to bear on the world changes the nature of what we are looking at, then all my intuitions and impulses and instincts I couldn't really verbalize (because they probably came from my RH self, which has a poor vocabulary and not so adept at language and expressing itself, and because it's in their nature to remain implicit) made A WHOLE LOT OF sense. Cool facts I learned (notes):-music as the precursor of language, acting as a way of uniting social groups-LH sees a whole made up of aggregate parts, while RH sees a whole as a whole (seeing individuals as belonging in a contextual whole, an aggregate from which they are not divided)-LH as an interpreter and confabulator who needs to be certain and right.-Altruism as a necessary consequence of empathy-""We can never make others understand something unless they already, at some level, understand it"" (p.153)-""How we see the world alters not just others, but who we are"" (p.167)-Clarity as a type of knowledge (p.182)-""We do not see paintings, as much as see according to them...We are aware of them but see through them, see the world according to them"" (p.183)-paradox as a way to truth (p.200)-imitation vs. copying: ""...imitation is imagination's most powerful path into whatever is Other than ourselves"" (p.248); the superiority of an imitation gene over other genes that code for a trait that happens to enhance the likelihood for survival (pp.251-256)-the change in the direction of writing from vertical to horizontal (LH likes horizontal lines) and right-to-left to left-to-right, a shift favoring LH processing-3 kinds of remembering: 1) remembering the long perspective of the historical past; 2) a projection forward to a time when you can see yourself retrospectively through the eyes of others after you are dead; and 3) the remembrance of your own past and its losses (p.302)-longing vs. wanting (longing happens between us and another thing, a desire for re-union; wanting is unidirectional, clear)-""The world is not a brute fact but, like a myth of metaphor, semi-transparent, containing all its meaning within itself, yet pointing to something lying beyond itself"" (p.312)-LH's either/or thinking vs. RH's metaphorical thinking at work in iconoclastic reasoning during the Reformation: ""Either the statue is God or it is a thing since it is 'obviously' not God, it must be a thing, and therefore 'mere wood,' in which case it has no place in worship. To see that 'mere' wood can partake of the divine requires seeing it as a metaphor, and being able to see that, precisely because it is a metaphor rather than a representation, it is itself divine. It is not just something non-divine representing the divine, it is something divine"" (p.316)-2 types of union/division: 1) LH: ""there is at one level the part of fragment, and, at the other, the generalized abstraction, aggregated from the parts""; and 2) RH: ""there is the individual entity in all its distinctness, at one level, and the whole to which it belongs, at the other."" RH can deal with specificity/particularities as well as wholes-communion vs. agency (David Bakan): ""Agency manifests itself in isolation, alienation, and aloneness: communion in contact, openness and union. Agency manifests itself in the urge to master: communion in non-contractual co-operation"" (p.321)-rationality vs. reason. Rationality can't ground itself according to its own principles of proof. The value of rationality has to come from outside itself (Godel, Escher, etc.). Reason: ""flexible, resisting fixed formulation, shaped by experience, and involving the whole living being""; Rationality: ""rigitd, rarefied, mechanical, governed by explicit laws"" (p.330)-""We are, and outght to be, obscure to ourselves, turned outwards, and working upon the world which surrounds us"" (p.356)-""We rush to the meaning too quickly in its subject matter...: (p.373)-fancy vs. imagination / novelty vs. newness: fantasy ""presents something novel in the place of the too familiar thing, and imagination clears away everything between us and the not familiar enough thing so that we see it itself, new, as it is."" (374); or ""Newness (seeing afresh what one thought of as familiar, as though for the first time) and novelty (deliberately disturbing the representation of reality in an attempt to 'shock' oneself into something that feels unfamiliar)"" (412)-the mythos of science: 1) myth of the sovereignty of the scientific method (vs. tinkering); 2) science as above morality coupled with the idea that it's the only sure foundation for decency and morality (history of its harm to humans notwithstanding); 3) myth of its brave stand against the forces of dogma (blind to its own dogmatism?)-""straight lines exist nowhere in the natural world, except perhaps at the horizon, where the natural world ends"" (p. 387 -Delacroix)-the story about a Benedictine monastery in South France. With their usual daily sleep of 4 hours and relentless work, all the monks were exhausted and sick until they were allowed to chant (p.417)-RH and LH in conversation: ""One says 'I do not know,' the other 'I know—that there is nothing to know.' One believes that one cannot know: the other 'knows' that one cannot believe."" (427)-RH's way: The RH's ""disposition is tentative, always reaching painfully (with 'care') towards something which it knows is beyond itself. It tries to open itself (not to say 'no') to something that language can allow only by subterfuge, to something that reason can reach only in transcending itself; not, be it noted, by the abandonment of language and reason, but through and beyond them. (p.427)-happiness in the developed countries is best predicted by ""the breadth and depth of one's social connections"" (435)-How we moderns see ourselves: ""We now see ourselves in largely mechanistic terms, as happiness-maximizing machines, and not very successful ones at that"" (436)-""We might have to revise the superior assumption that we understand the world better than our ancestors, and adopt a more realistic view that we just see it differently—and may indeed be seeing less than they did"" (461)"
9,030014878X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6243880-gary-beauregard-bottomley,5,"‘When the legend becomes fact, print the legend’ (the last line from the movie ‘The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance’). It doesn’t really matter if the metaphor (the legend) is scientific, what really matters if you learn and grow from it as I did with this book. This book is flawed but it can be liberating for those who strongly fit into his main metaphor and no longer feel the need to justify themselves to the world because they can now say “that’s just the way I am and I’ve got the metaphor to prove it!”. The book does at times get ahead of its own metaphor especially in the second part. In order to not be offended by the generalities in the second part of this book it’s best to imagine that you are listening to a Great Course Lecture on the history of Western civilization with bifocal lens which only distinguish between two ways of seeing the world: one abstractly the other concretely, the left/right brain metaphor. Of course, the author has more complexity than just that. He dissects the lateralization of the brain through multiple attributes and usually dichotomizes traits or states of being for how one lives in the world. It was really easy to follow his narrative especially since for me no matter how he would characterize his attributes with his thirty or so dichotomies my dominating characteristic was always of the left, so I would always know which attribute lied on which side of the brain just by asking which was dominant within me. All of the dichotomies can flow from whether or not one tends to see the world abstractly as units of translational symmetries that are invariant to a host of transformations (left brain), or whether one sees the world concretely and holistically by synthesizing a whole from parts and experiencing the parts as the sum of a whole such that the parts are more than the sum of the whole (right brain). The author in the first part of the book will almost always put autism as a deficit of some right brain attribute. He also states some mumbo jumbo about ‘theory of mind’ and autistics (neuro-diverse) have a deficit in mind reading, lack an ability to understand face movements and eye gestures, possess social awkwardness and lack ‘empathy’. Though, I think it’s just as easy to state that autistics are very strong left brain and have a propensity for seeing the world predominately with left hemisphere attributes and they don’t fall for the misdirection inherent in social interactions by deceptive face movements or eye gestures from those who want to dominant every situation while they (neuro-typicals) principally appeal to mythos and pathos through using feelings, intuitions, imaginations and misdirection rather than relying on logos. It’s possible in some diagnosed autistics they are just incredibly strong left brain and not autistic at all. The author asks Heidegger’s favorite question ‘why is there something rather than nothing’ and applies it to the brain and its lateralization. He’ll say that the right brain is the master and the left brain re-presents what the right gives it and that between the two hemispheres what goes on is a master/slave relationship in the style of Hegel. Two of my top five favorite books are by either Hegel or Heidegger and each is a major character for this author and Heidegger for him is his protagonist in this book. The author mentioned that both Nietzsche and Heidegger acknowledge a world without a meta-narrative which means that the world does not have a narrative about the narrative and the author notes that they are only observing not prescribing. In the terms of the book, the left hemisphere creates the facts about the world, pretends it has certainty, while the right hemisphere provides the meaning to the facts and creates the meta-narrative. (The author does point out that there is a story teller within the left hemisphere as well but of a different kind). The author does slip into pseudo-scientific Freudian/Jungian mumbo jumbo from time to time by over relying on unconscious behavior determining who we are by using functional archetypes. Also, he will unconvincingly invert Jaynes’ “The Origin of Consciousness in the Breakdown of the Bicameral Mind” to explain parts of what he’s trying to get at; I would say an inversion of pseudo-science is still pseudo-science. He’ll explain anorexia, schizophrenia, autism, and other DSM worthy diagnosis by simply explaining them as deficits of the right hemisphere, forgetting how humans can be complex, need context, history and relativity in order to make worthwhile conclusion. The author probably mentions about a hundred different philosophers and how they fit into his overall theory. Usually, when that many different philosophers are brought up the author is just dropping names. I didn’t think that with this author because the author was able to put them into his narrative and couple them to his metaphor. Immanuel Kant takes space, time and causality out of the world and gives us intuition, imagination and the transcendental deduction (all right brain using this author’s metaphor); Henri Bergson cries out for ‘creative evolution’ (by all means read the Nobel Prize winning author Bergson and his book ‘Creative Evolution’, it is well worthwhile) and ‘lived time’, more right brain way of thinking. There’s one book this author didn’t mention, Gilles Deleuze and Félix Guattari’s ‘Anti-Oedipus: Capitalism and Schizophrenia’. That book speaks about a ‘body without an organ’, that would include the left brain in this author’s metaphor and they put schizophrenia (the micro way of seeing the world, according to them, and the micro definitely would be within the left brain according to this author), and they would say that it is really the schizoid who is sane in this insane world and that the macro way of seeing (the right brain according to this author) leads to paranoia and fascism. This author puts fascism in the left not the right. It’s always possible to take a metaphor too far. The author will say that left brain people are individualistic and the right brain people are more cooperative and he cites the Japanese as right brain people and Americans as left brain. The author has the right brain enslave the left and makes the individualistic left part of the right’s cooperative whole and takes his right/left brain metaphor to explain the sum of the parts of the brain as a whole. One does not need to accept all of the author’s uses of his metaphor in order appreciate this book. There’s a book that explains this part of his story better than this book does; it’s called “How Emotions are Made’ by Barrett and tells a similar story by having our emotions controlling our body budget by desiring homeostasis, and in this author’s metaphor the emotions would be of the right brain. It’s more complex than I’m letting on but this book and Barrett’s book complement each other to a large degree. I’m glad this book was fairly successful. It has a lot to offer. It’s flawed on many different levels and a lot of the statements the author makes are problematic to say the least. Overall, his major metaphor (backed by science, nevertheless) is an incredibly profitable way to look at the world. I seldom have found a book where an author is covering as many philosophers and thinkers, and I, the most critical critic, didn’t find fault with his interpretations. That in itself makes this a very good book! Oh yeah, the author definitely prefers the right brain interpretation for the world and thinks the left brain people need to change."
10,030014878X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7531999-vagabond-of-letters-dlitt,1,"2/10. A terrible book which could be profitably, and with little loss, compressed from its current 600-page bloat to no more than the 40 or 60 pages of a short thesis, and even more profitably then have its thesis inverted. I save the appellation 'truly terrible', which I don't believe I've used before, to denote that if someone were to write the exact inverse of this book - interpreting opposite to the author in a framework inverted from that present - that someone would probably have a four-star work. It's confusing and a bit hard to mark down as a 'one', when everything is got so wrong that you just have to read the opposite to get some right. The work is tedious, and tediously written, to boot.I'll start out by saying the author denies both the law of non-contradiction and the law of the excluded middle /explicitly/, and seems to deny the law of identity around page 285 implicitly. With that as a given, how he expects to write anything (serendipitously, he's not exactly true to his denials so the work is still 'readable' in a very loose sense) is beyond me. I think he'd accuse me of 'rationalism' (meant as a slur) for thinking so, and for hewing absolutely to all three of the classical laws of thought. He blames non-contradiction and the law of the excluded middle for the ills of modernity and the mental illness of schizophrenia both! The author rambles and rambles, repeats himself ad nauseam (many entire passages of significant length are repeated verbatim or almost so passim), draws untenable conclusions, and contradicts himself in numerous ways (first he attributes an attribute to X, then to Y, then its opposite to X, and then muffins and rhubarb to Y), rendering his entire presentation solipsistic - the work is at core extremely anti-rational and anti-language (!) and the author is attempting to use (semi-)reasoned linguistic argument to convince his readers that reason is useless (except for manipulating sets of self-referential symbols in internally consistent systems - and technology!), in fact evil, and is a betrayal of 'real, authentic, and intuitive' human nature which he spares no word or expense in incessantly bolstering and promoting. The book is actually two books. Book I is unconventional neuropsychology. Book II is a work of amateur historiography and social criticism with only minor links to Book I, which exists solely to attempt to establish the meaningfulness and truth of the author's diminution of reason and language in favor of immediate intuition, haziness, mystery-mongering, etc. - to reason and language unfettered he attributes all of the ills of the world in Book II. And even then he's not very convincing, with a deficient grasp of the history he interprets. There needs to be a warning on the cover that 'this book contains poetry', and a good hundred-page chunk of Book II is nothing but art, art criticism, art interpretation, etc. of poetry and painting mainly which I had to cursorily skim at best, technically putting this in to the category of 'DNF' - 'did not finish'.Modernist and Postmodernist in varying compositions to the core, every cliche of those philosophies and the search for 'authenticity' are on brazenly naked display here. Further, McGilchrist is a complete relativist, but repeatedly puts the disclaimer, 'just because there's more than one mutually inconsistent truth' or 'just because truth is not unitary does not mean ""anything goes"" and any meaning whatsoever can be attributed to [whatever he's talking about]', but never shows how this could possibly be true beyond the repeated assertions. 'Mutually inconsistent truth' renders meaningless either consistency or truth. Or both.Everything is twisted to fit the needs of the author at the moment, and then untwisted or retwisted as the need arises. The author refuses to make value judgements on every third page, with the entire book being one massive value judgement - that sort of thing, along with inconsistent assumptions and attributions of lateralized function in the service of 'whatever makes the right hemisphere look good' (add a dose of handwavium: the author reifies the hemispheres, and then emotionally attributes or predicates of them as if the right hemisphere were his friend and the left his enemy and he were writing an almost-pathological polemic... it makes no sense to reify brain structures in such a way and then predicate ethically and emotionally of them).The author would defend all of this by declaiming that he's trying to express something which 'can not be expressed in language', attempts at which - along with using reason to frame language - again, the author decries as the ultimate bete noire of all the evils of modernity. It is partially redeemed by (1) the inclusion of some important and interesting facts which are, however, interpreted incorrectly and set within an utterly untrue, incoherent, inconsistent, and self-referential (the author decries this on every page, ironically) framework, and (2) the concluding chapter, 'The Master Betrayed', which would be better set to print as a separate work after being shrove of its connections to the author's theory of brain lateralization and its meaning for history.The inclusion of important and interesting facts (no matter how badly and destructively interpreted, and how nonsensically, the facts still can theoretically stand on their own and be placed in to a more congenial setting), and the concluding essay, which is probably stronger than I admit (since it's at the end of the book, and I'm so fed up with it - bordering on disgusted - by reaching the end, you could stick a masterwork there and I'd likely give it a middling review) saves it - I think - from a truly one-star or rating. I'll give it two of ten, but in the five-star system it resolves to 'one' anyways - call it a 'high one'. The book reminds me in all the wrong ways of 'The Devil's Pleasure Palace' but with a good deal more factual information scattered throughout and a scientific veneer."
11,030014878X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2531665-charlene,3,"This book had a lot of potential. Clearly other people feel as if it reached it potential. I am in the minority of people who rated fewer than 5 stars, but I was so happy to reach the end. The introduction spent pages and pages telling me what I should think. Just show me the data and the methods by which the data was acquired. He went on and on... and on about how it's not respectable to study hemispheric differences. This book was written in 2009. Students and highly respected professors alike, in universities all over the world, were discussing differences in brain hemispheres. It was not a subversive topic, at all. What was and is subversive is suggesting there are male - female differences or that the brain is completely lateralized without considering the interactions between regions. McGilchrist addressed this at the beginning of Chapter One. So why make it seem as if he was trudging down the lone road of hemispheric research? Why spend pages and pages to suggest this is a much bigger controversy? I probably should have stopped at that point, but I love, and I do mean LOVE, to learn about the brain-- the most wonderful of human tools -- and how it went about building the world that we know. I could not wait to get to the chapters about the Ancient World, Enlightenment, and so on. But, this book could have been a 5th as long, a *lot* more relatable, and much more expressive of the awe that is the human brain and how that brain connects with other brains to create cities, philosophies, scientific concepts, etc. When I finished this book, I had a strong desire to read this same book but one written by an author who used far fewer words to concisely relate the information this author tried to convey."

This is where neuroscience comes of age. McGilchrist offers a readable account on the workings of the hemispheres, then a sweeping account of how in history since the Greeks -- reflected in literature and philosophy and science -- they have come to dysfunction, the rationalistic left brain usurping the intuitive gestalt function of the right. It's too complicated to try here, but McGilchrist makes a lot of sense of how rationalistic, positivistic science and technology have come to rule the roost in the last 200 (or 3 or 400) years. The last chapter is a veritable Bach fugue that pulls it all together and makes the whole slog (some 500 pages) all worth it. Great and important book."
13,030014878X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4901358-yannick,2,"Part 1 is great and would get 4 stars on its own, but I'm left wishing I hadn't invested so much time reading part 2. The principal thesis of the book is a defense of the right brain against the mainstream view of it as a flaky, playful, and less competent portion of the brain. Part 1 does this on the grounds of the latest science, which provides fascinating revelations. For example, a right-brain stroke is more debilitating than an equivalent left-brain stroke, and many of common psychiatric illnesses of our day, such as schizophrenia and autism, have been linked to reduced activity in the right brain relative to the left. The right brain can better solve certain puzzles that baffle the left with their complexity. Clearly, the right brain is doing something far more essential than it is normally given credit for, even by neuroscientists.McGilchrist makes the case that the right brain's advantages have to do with engagement with the outside world, so the discussion naturally tends to go beyond the laboratory. As the book progresses into part II, the arguments are increasingly based on the art, poetry, and philosophy of the Western world through the ages. I can't help feeling that the the author got lost in this vast topic, and that the book devolved to an old man's ramblings about his favourite things. A highly educated old man with lots of interesting thing to say, structured in chronological order, but nevertheless lacking in rigour. He occasionally finds solid ground, for example the tendency of portrait subjects to look to the left, but soon leaps back into the quicksand without a rope. It would be too easy to list the numerous holes and contradictions in the arguments of part II.It is equally easy to question whether I am trying to apply left-brain analysis to a discussion that was meant to be properly understood by the right-brain. How do you get past that, when any protest might be a symptom of your own shortcomings? Fortunately, McGilchrist avoids accusing his readers this way; even when confronted in interviews, he graciously retreats to the laboratory evidence of part 1. The book's conclusion even admits vulnerability to charges of naivete or copping out. Since the controversial hypotheses are offered without pretense, I can't complain of error, but I feel like I've wasted some of my time. Part 1 revolutionized my understanding of the ""divided brain""; part 2 left me quite dissatisfied about ""the making of the Western world."""
14,030014878X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3958395-harry,5,"This work is not for everyone, but I give my highest recommendation. If you have ever had an interest in the brain, consciousness, or how we all perceive and engage the world, this might your cup of tea. Iain McGilchrist does an incredible job with developing our current understanding of the brain from a hemispheric point of view. The work completely altered my understanding of the right and left hemispheres. The way the right and left sides work are not what you may think. The book then takes you on a trip through time and suggests how our hemispheric balance as a civilization may have have changed over history. He also looks at current cultures and suggests different balances due cultural behaviors, etc. He also gives ideas on how our current hemispheric unbalance might be brought into a more fruitful alignment. So much food for thought here. It took me a while to work my way through and there is some technical jargon, but so well worth it. One of the most significant non-fiction books I've ever read."
15,030014878X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6965537-james,5,"I picked up the idea of the left and right side brain through the well-regarded book Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain by art teacher Betty Edwards. In her book, the left-brain handles the perceiving and processing verbally and analytically. In describing the right side of the brain, however, she instructed students to understand and draw of edges and lines, space between items, perspective, and proportion between things, light and shadows and the whole (gestalt) as the first four. The left and right sides function very differently, and for artists, her advice was to draw on the right side.  The author, Iain McGilchrist, taught literature before studying medicine. The Master and His Emissary: The Divided Brain and the Making of the Western World, demonstrates that the right hemisphere takes stock of the whole (Gestalt) and the right region is more abreast with the world. The left provides precision on the many details of the world, e.g., measurement, mechanistic models. Western culture, moreover, values the left hemisphere above the right side--meaning, the left should be and has been in charge throughout western culture since early times. My thesis writes McGilchrist, is that for human beings there are two fundamentally opposed realities, two different modes of experience; that each is of utmost importance in bringing about the recognizably human world' and that their difference is rooted in the bihemispheric structure of the human brain. It follows that the hemispheres need to co-operate, but I believe they are in fact, involved in a sort of power struggle and that this explains many aspects of contemporary Western culture (p. 3); philosophy in the West is essentially a left-hemisphere process (p. 137). EEG coherence data point to the predominance of the right hemisphere in REM sleep and dreaming (p. 188). Coleridge wrote of his love of 'the Great' & 'the Whole.'--Those who have been led to the same truths step by step thro' the constant testimony of their senses seem to me to want a sense which I possess--They contemplate nothing but parts--and all parts are necessarily little--and the Universe to them is but a mass of little things (p. 202). My dear friend Guy Burneko, who recommended reading McGilchrist, observes that clearly, the differential binary of the human brain is complementarity with having our two eyes and two ears and two legs (Burneko, Guy C. New Reflections on Things at Hand: Contemplating Ecohuman Sustainability, Kindle Edition, Location. 6171)."
16,030014878X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/18942380-william-schram,5,"In his book The Master and His Emissary Iain McGilchrist delves deep into the brain and what it tells us about ourselves. McGilchrist mainly focuses on the differences between brain hemispheres that everyone has. Most people have heard of the differences between the right brain and the left brain. These are often far too generalized to be of use to anyone and there are always exceptions. McGilchrist speaks of the myths and facts of the different brain hemispheres and attempts to answer a simple question; why does the brain have hemispheres at all?Early on, most of what we learned about the brain hemispheres and the various things it is good at is through people that have had disorders or lesions on that section. Basically, we learned through what that person could not do. In our modern times, we have devices to probe the secrets of the brain, but even that is somewhat limited.McGilchrist starts out by talking about each hemisphere in terms of what it is capable of. Language processing, musical proficiency, various tasks that make us human, and so on. The most suggestive experiments occur with people that underwent a procedure to sever the Corpus Callosum, the large bundle of nerves that connect the hemispheres together and inform them of what the other is doing.The book is really good. My only problem was with the size of the print. Other than that, there are plenty of images and a massive bibliography. The author explains the references by stating that he did not want to miss any facts or misconceptions."
17,030014878X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/90150641-ronin-winter,5,"Wow... a beautiful and erudite book. It starts off with the statement that the common perception between the dichotomy of the left and right hemisphere is a myth yet holds some truth. The left and the right hemisphere have opposing viewpoints and perspectives on the nature of reality; the left sees the world as mechanistic, sequential and analytical, it breaks down reality bit by bit delving towards conceptual and metaphorical frameworks of the world. The right on the other hand sees the world in a holistic manner tending to see reality as as whole rather than breaking it down by bits: this difference in perspective ultimately leads to both hemisphere pursueing different truths. Iain McGilchrist states that many of the philosophical problems that arise are as a result of the left hemisphere thinking; he emphasises the right hemisphere to be the Master of reality and of truth while the left hemisphere should play the role of the emissary helping the right seek truth. This truly is a multi-disciplinary book reflecting on a host of domains such as art, literature, mathematics, neuroscience, psyschology, philosophy and many more; allowing the reader to partake on a journey of the nature of truth and reality. "
18,030014878X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/19540749-richard-newton,4,"A long slow read for me. McGilchrist seems to be one of those people who really does have a brain the size of a planet - few people could be a consultant psychiatrist, have done scientific research at John Hopkins and taught English at Oxford. His wide spanning knowledge shows in this book where he flows effortlessly between discussions about the structure of the brain, philosophy, literature, poetry, art and history. This is intellectually impressive stuff.This is a disturbing book, well argued and researched, that explores McGilchrist's view that we are becoming increasingly left brain dominated. The disturbing side comes from the implications for society. Unless you have some knowledge of modern theories of the brain - you probably won't know the difference between left and right brain dominance (and it is not that trite pseudo science that is often said about the brain). Read the book to find out! It is an intriguing and interesting hypothesis.Criticisms? Yes there are some. I want to pick on 3. This is not to put you off the book, but to make sure you know what you are getting into if you read it:1) There are ten endorsements on the version of the book I have. Seven of them are from people with the title ""professor"". This should be a bit of a give-away that this is a fairly academic book. I have no issue with that - more a problem with the style that comes with this. It is written in a fairly academic style and it does read at times as if you are listening to an old professor ramble away. McGilchrist may have lectured in English at Oxford and know tons about literature, but his style is at times rambling and ponderous. Long sentences, with lots of sub-clauses. This does not always make for an easy read. I have been told he is a brilliant speaker, perhaps - but again great speakers don't always make great writers. 2) McGilchrist produces a lot of evidence for his theory. If you do not have a brain, an education and have done the research to match his, (i.e. you are like me) then all you get are the data in favour of his arguments. For all I know there are equal amounts of good data pointing the other way. This does not detract from the book, but I think it does mean you have to be clear you are only seeing one side of the argument. You probably will never see the other side unless someone else decides to write it and you choose to read it.3) Most of his arguments in favour of increasing left brain dominance relate to things like art, poetry, literature, philosophy, music and so on. It is, in other words, a fairly elitist view of the world. Are the habits we see in people watching or participating in sport, TV or mainstream cinema and what sorts of politics are currently fashionable equally a sign of left brain dominance? I have absolutely no idea, but it would have been good if Gilchrist could have found some everyday examples to back up his theory.Conclusions: read this if you like scholarly works, like inter-disciplinary thinking, cultural and artistic history, or have an interest in brain science and philosophy. If you are looking for some popular science, this may not be quite what you were expecting. "
19,030014878X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11993337-marjan,5,"This is a phenomenal book, perhaps one of the best I've ever read. It is neither short nor an easy one. There are more than 500 pages of very dense text that could easily span above 800 in a bit more conventional typesetting... But the true challenge comes from the author; a true erudite, a modern day polymath, who effortlessly combines neuroscience, with philosophy, with literature, with arts, with social sciences and humanism, and even things that are completely in between, to create a coherent argument on the duality of our brain and how it is reflected trough the history and our doings.The first part of the book examines neurological evidence (patients with brain strokes, split brain patients, schizophrenics, etc), then moves to philosophy, further on to the history of the Western civilization and at the end he tries to synthesize a conclusion that merges all of this together. The language is rich and amazing to read (McGilchrist was an Oxford professor of English before turning into neuroscience), but that makes things only slightly easier on the conceptual level. The first part demands at least basic preexisting knowledge on neural anatomy and neural development, the second part is much more rewarding to be read by prior reading of philosophers (all the big names; Aristotle, Plato, Nietzsche, Heidegger,...), and the last part requires knowledge of basic history and history of Arts (pictorial, music, literature, drama...). Needless to say, I had some difficulties getting trough to the middle part (since philosophers have never been exactly my coup of tea), but I enjoyed the neurological and the art-historical parts so much more. They felt like a balsam for my soul: the last quarter of the book is a powerful assault on modernism and the nonsense of art of 20th century. In that he says everything I wanted to say, but couldn't find the right voice for it.This is one of those books (along with Antifragile by Taleb) that completely (re?)shaped the way I see the world and myself (in it). Not just that it gave me a deeper understanding, it also gave shape and meaning to my own ideas, by which I feel flattered. Of course, I am being openly biased in that, for it is easy to like a book which agrees with you, but what the hell... Every page was better than the previous one!"
20,030014878X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/26166559-darin-stevenson,5,"This book is a key element in understanding the modern milieu in which our species has become 1/10th of our ordinarily accessible intelligence, and think ourselves deities. McGilchrist has done a promethean task; ironically, too — he has sketched with incredible insight and detail the nature of the hemispheres as their are peculiarly organized for producing distinct worlds, and what happens when the dominant ‘twin’... attempts to usurp sovereignty. Essentially, cognitive, relational, social, political and most of all ecological omnicide. The solution is missing. I have been assembling similar intelligence and solutions from nature for over 20 years now. We overlooked 9/10ths of our intelligence (which is nonverbal and not based in ordinary aspects of discrimination) in the same way we overlooked 50% of the cell bodies in our own -bodies- and 97% of ‘whatever dark matter/energy is’ in space. Armed with McGilchrist’s exposé of the structure of the matter, and some uncommon toys that can rebalance the interplay and renew evolutionary development of cooperation between the hemispheres with the RH in clear evidence if not emphasized... we could transform our species and human intelligence in a heartbeat.The other thing is missing is the study of the bird these two wings make when they are able to act in unity. That bird is impossible, and when free to fly it makes most of human creative, spiritual and intellectual history look like little more than an acceptable launchpad for otherwise impossible prodigy. Our true potentials, particularly of our societies, have been boldly obscured... this book can give us crucial foundations in our understandings of how this comes about and what we might be able to do in response."
21,030014878X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/65978670-tiago-faleiro,5,"This book is brilliant. On one hand, I feel bad for delaying reading it. But on the other hand, the wait allowed me to get into other topics which made me get a lot more out of McGilchrist's work. The book starts by clarifying some myths about the brain hemispheres, mostly coming from pop-psychology books, especially old ones. For example that the left hemisphere uses logic, words, and language, while the right hemisphere uses feelings and symbols. Some even reduce the whole hemisphere to binary functions, such as rationality vs intuitive, system I vs system II, or male brain vs female brain. This is all false. However, there is another common conception in pop-psychology. Not about myths regarding hemisphere difference, but that hemispheric differences themselves are a myth. This, again, is incorrect. There are most definitely differences across the two brain hemispheres, they just aren't as simplistic as the examples first mentioned. Generally speaking, the difference isn't on ""what"" is done, by ""how"" is done. The left hemisphere deals with units, the right with aggregates. The left hemisphere if focused, engaged with a goal in mind. The right does not have a ""purpose"". The left hemisphere deals more with abstractions. Things that are clear, fixed, explicit. On the other hand, the right hemisphere deals with the concrete, the individual, the evolve, interconnected, and implicit. They are two different takes on reality that work together to make a coherent understanding. Most importantly, while the left hemisphere has traditionally been considered the main hemisphere (mostly because it's associated with language), he argues that the right hemisphere is the in fact the most important. And almost all cognition involves starting at the right hemisphere, then going to the left, and back to the right. What the title is alluding to is that the right hemisphere is the master, while the left hemisphere is his emissary. And when the emissary overestimates his role and tries to overtake the master, things don't go well. And the left hemisphere always has this tendency. It can't break out of his own narrow perspective and consumes everything under its categories and conceptualizations. The first part of the book deals with all the psychological and neuro-imaging evidence for these claims. Evolutionary analysis, split-brain experiments, brain damage, and more. However, surprisingly, I don't consider this a psychology book. Rather, this is all the groundwork for the second part of the book, which is heavily philosophical. The beginning is more or less to convince you that there is such a thing as hemispheric differences, and explain what these are. While this is important, I feel this was overly done. It was a bit repetitive and somewhat tedious to read at times. If you're mostly concerned with the philosophical element, you could honestly most of the first part entirely and still get the main benefit of the book. Just read the first couple of chapters and move to Part 2. This will save you about 100 pages and make the book more enjoyable in my opinion. If you're curious about all the specifics of hemispheric differences and you like neuropsychology, then feel free to read the whole thing as intended. The second part of the book is the true gold of this book. He argues that not only do we have two different modes of interpreting the world, but that these modes can emphasized, and they can be influenced and influence culture itself, which produces massive cultural shifts in human societies. He begins with Greece in the 6th century BC Athens, the Renaissance, the Reformation, the Enlightenment, Romanticism, and modernism, and post-modernism. He explains how each period can be seen in the light of hemispheric differences. I was quite skeptical at first, but he argues it well. The biggest thing I got out of the book was how there is much more to reality then what we can rationally apprehend, and how our view of the world is filtered and pre-interpreted without us even knowing it. This is something I've long thought about it, but he articulates these problems very well, and linking it to neuroanatomic makes the case a lot stronger. It's also mindblowing how knowledgable the author is and how wide his scope is when presenting his case. From philosophy, literature, painting, sculpting, poetry, and music. It's really hard to try to justify how these could have possibly been influenced by something like hemisphere differences, but after reading the book the link is really hard to ignore.Honestly, I think for a lot of people this would change how you think about the world, especially if you're more oriented towards rationality, language, and science. While I was already familiar with many of the philosophical ideas he was trying to present, he linked them with things I never knew or never thought about and made them a lot more explicit. Especially regarding the Reformation and Enlightenment, it really added an incredible amount of in-depth to my understanding of such periods, their evolution, and their broader context in the Western world. His exploration of metaphor and poetry was also brilliant. Even if the case for brain hemispheric difference is massively overstated, honestly his thesis would still be incredibly insightful. There are most definitely two ""realities"" to our experience. They seem to be influenced by hemispheric differentiation, but if they are not, their ontological status is impossible to ignore nevertheless, regardless of its neuroanatomic origin. It's not an easy book honestly. At times it is very dense, but it pays off. The shift is perspective is incredible, and for anyone that is truly interested in understanding both how human beings engage in sense-making and also the history of ideas in the Western world, you can't afford to skip this masterpiece."
22,030014878X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/13626166-siddarth-gore,5,"The defining features of the human condition can all be traced to our ability to stand back from the world, from our selves and from the immediacy of experience.Boy what a book. I would just love to talk about this with anyone who is brave enough to bring it up.The right hemisphere's particular strength is in understanding meaning as a whole and in context. It is with the right hemisphere that we understand the moral of a story, as well as the point of a joke.In short one part of our brain looks at the big picture. It feels generally. It forms first impressions. It is vague, yet complete. It doesn't seek perfection, but attains harmony.The left hemisphere is the hemisphere of abstraction, which, as the word itself tells us, is the process of wresting things from their context. This, and its related capacity to categorise things once they have been abstracted, are the foundations of its intellectual power.And the other half is relentless in its pursuit of utility. How can the world be manipulated to suit us better. How will it look if I turn it upside down? If I take it apart? It loves specifics and rigor. It cannot handle paradox, one of them has to be false.The evidence is that this is not because insight makes you depressed, but because being depressed gives you insight.No one likes being depressed. But melancholy is not necessarily a bad thing. It has something which fun/joy lack. Depth perhaps.language, unlike more intuitive, musical, forms of communication, is the perfect medium for concealing, rather than revealing, meaning.That much is clear to those of us who speak.Blake's saying that ‘to generalise is to be an idiot’, being itself a generalisation. It draws attention, in Gödelian fashion, to the truth that every logical system leads to conclusions that cannot be accommodated within it.Though much of the book has mind benders embedded in it, most of the interesting stuff is in the first half. The second half deals with how the Western world moved from right hemisphere centric thinking to the left. And how this is a big disaster. Since I am mostly unaware of what the Western world was up to I found this part pretty tedious. Also most of it sounded like conjuncture anyways.One consequence of such a model, I admit, is that we might have to revise the superior assumption that we understand the world better than our ancestors, and adopt a more realistic view that we just see it differently – and may indeed be seeing less than they did.What an end!"

You might come out of it wondering whether some claims made about your brain, its history, and how it will affect your future might not be literally true, but be nevertheless useful as metaphors or analogies that can help you think about how you think.I guess what I'm trying to get at is that what you take from McGilchrist probably depends on how you expect to listen to him. If you want hard, evidence-based, empirical and definite SCIENCE, then you'll probably read it in that way and feel a bit underwhelmed. If you're OK with something that's interesting and stimulating but doesn't necessarily get at hard facts so exclusively or neatly, then you might find it sparking some interesting thoughts.(That said, I also don't think it makes spiritual, alternative, or pseudoscientific claims. I'm not really sure it makes many claims at all, just observes a few tidbits that have to do with neuroscience and goes 'well, wouldn't it be interesting if...?')"

Right brain: the world, wisdom, integration, music/dance, whole picture, learning new skills, where, when, why, knowing when to quit (or at least slow down), dealing with unpredictability, bullshit detection, social connection, depression, empathy. I didn't read the chapters on different periods of Western culture to see examples in painting, music, drama, poetry to see how the right brain view makes these arts understandable. I did read his last chapter on what if the left brain dominated a society because that's what has happened. Surveillance society gobbling up the planet. We need the energy and focus of the left brain but without the governor (clutch and brakes) of the right brain society's needs are not met.

25,030014878X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8529191-h-m,5,"“Time is running out,” writes Iain McGilchrist, “and the way we think, which got us into this mess, will not be enough to get us out of it.”. As the philosopher, linguist and poet Jean Gebser stated, we are now in the late-stage [left-brain], deficient mode of the mental-rational structure of consciousness, and there is no guarantee that we'll successfully evolve to the next predicted stage, that of the integral – for as McGilchrist sees, our remaining escape routes to a more right-hemisphere, or balanced and holistic mode of being, are now in the process of being closed off.The Master and His Emissary: The Divided Brain and the Making of the Western World is a deeply-researched yet expansive, seminal masterpiece – vitally relevant and necessary in these modern, post-modern and post-truth times in the West."

What about a divided brain makes us more likely to survive than a brain that is not. Amazing. There are lots of pages in this book explaining the talents of the right and left side of our brains. And, the theory stated succinctly is the left side is gaining more and more power in this world, and is not serving us well, not serving us as an emissary should. If this were written in five pages, I would have loved it. But, after hundreds of pages of weak examples and too many extraneous references to philosophy, literature, art and music the idea was completely lost. At least, that is what my left hemisphere things. My right hemisphere rather enjoyed it. "
27,030014878X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4834485-ann,4,"Wow--while I found this book completely fascinating, it is NOT an easy read. It took me a long time to finish it, though I'm very glad I did. I am intrigued by the workings of our brains and this book was a very thought provoking, informative way of looking at current brain research and how it applies to history. This book points out the complexity, the divided nature of thought itself and asks about its connection with the structure of the brain. McGilchrist looks at the relation between our two brain-hemispheres in a new light, not just as an interesting neurological division but as a crucial shaping factor in our culture. He questions the accepted doctrine that the left hemisphere is necessarily dominant, the practical partner, while the right more or less is just kind of artsy-fartsy. :) I quite liked the title of the book, which comes from the legend of a ruler whose domains grew so large that he had to train emissaries to visit them instead of going himself. One of these, however, became so self-assured that he thought he was wiser than his master, and eventually deposed him. Thsi, according to McGilchrist, is what the left hemisphere of the brain tends to do. In fact, the balance between the left and right hemispheres is a delicate one, where many things can go wrong. When something needs doing or thinking about, the left hemisphere organizes it so that it can be done in a specialized area of the brain, but then the right hemisphere needs to take over again and decide what to do next. It needs to integrate new knowledge into the larger areas of the brain.The author suggests that encouraging categorical thinking without background experience or without looking at the bigger picture is coming to the point where it distorts both thought and lives. He showed how the ideas of ""thought"" have changed and been either right-dominant or left-dominant throughout Western cultural history. He came to modern times by describing our thinking as seeing so many things as objects, detached from us and frequently splitting body and soul. It brought me to think more about the spiritual realm of science and how it has changed throughout history--how it might change more as we ask questions and look more into the connections in teh divided brain."
28,030014878X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1003570-marcali,5,"Like a religious tome-- need to own, re-read & contemplate. Can't help but think of Leonard Schlain's work positing that the rise of alphabetic language fueled domination by the left hemisphere, resulting in changes in culture. (Also seems like this book explains why we are Predictably Irrational and Strangers to Ourselves, etc.)Oddly, reading this (& others) prompted me to ponder Fiction (perhaps because have taught Romeo & Juliet to 9th graders). That is, Fiction's domination over worldview is complete-- so that now instead of contemplating our experience and then exploring it (& other's) via stories and reflecting on each (oral tradition?); instead, fiction (codifying experience in metaphors) becomes the measure by which we all suffer, striving to achieve ideals. As in ""the five colors make a man blind; the five tones make a man deaf."" (suppose non-fiction is an extension in this regard)So our great astonishing pinnacle of evolution-- that makes possible manipulating our environment through the ability to represent the world abstractly-- also contains seeds of destruction, a la ""Aristotle's Cave"" (mistaking symbols for the real). Kinda reminiscent of quantum dilemma. (i.e., when you fix reality in language by describing it, you are no longer accurately representing reality).(gotta say-- the review ""Who am I kidding?"" made me laugh out loud!). "

What was most off putting for me was the second chapter dealing with what each brain hemisphere is responsible for, it is particularly dry and list like and coupled with the fact that there are 535 notes in its 61 pages it started to feel like an initiation rite.  The book picks up pace in the second more culturally orientated second half, with frequent quotes from philosophers inserted to add authority to the voluminous text. I feel that if you have an interest that leans more towards the humanities side of things or are familiar with neuroscience then it would be perfectly possible to skip the first half altogether."

McGilchrist summarized the last few decades of research on the differences between the cerebral hemispheres and takes us on a tour of the implications of this research. McGilchrist looks at the functions of lateral differences in information processing and awareness across the animal kingdom and in the evolutionary history of our own species... but he doesn't stop there. He goes on to explore the shifts in hemispheric preference and influence throughout Western Culture from the ancient Greeks through the middle ages, the Renaissance, the Reformation, the Enlightenment, the Romantic period, Modernism and Post Modernism. Finally he compares western culture to eastern culture where perhaps the shift to preferences and tendencies of the left hemisphere are not quite as far along. This is an incredibly ambitious venture but I would conclude that McGilchrist succeeds in shedding light on our human nature by illuminating the implications of our divided neurology. "

Some of this has been covered or hinted at by others, but not in this way. Something McGilchrist says which bears repetition is that he does not want to fall into a simplistic or stereotypical way of thinking about the left and right brain, and he doesn't. I've seen good and bad newspaper reviews ie reviews by people who really have read it (Mary Midgely) and by people who have skimmed it (Boyd Tonkin).Remember also that while there cerebral hemispheres the division does not apply the whole brain.This is obviously the work of his life. His love and care in researching and writing or creating it is evident. I will be reading it again soon because I'm sure it has more to show me.Even so I'm not saying I agree with every word but that is not the point.Thank you Mr McGilchrist, or should that be Doctor?"

Through the Balwin effect, the left hemisphere, the eponymous emissary of the book, has transformed our world into a post-modernist void, usurping its master, the right hemisphere, which connects to the real world and is the root of insight and love/agape.

Peterson promoting this book, this book excoriating Pinker and Chomsky, the latter holding court on Democracy Now... Here are some of my favorite parts of McGilchrist's magnum opus.In the section Music and Time, having observed that ""It has been said that music, like poetry, is intrinsically sad"": ""The relationship between music and emotion is fascinating, and to some degree baffling. Suzanne Langer said that music not only has the power to recall emotions we are familiar with, but to evoke 'emotions and moods we have not felt, passions we did not know before.' Music seems, in other words, to expand the range of possible emotions limitlessly because the emotion experienced is so bound up with the peculiarity of the work that mediates it, yet the lexicon with which we are obliged to describe the feelings remains frustratingly limited. Thus the 'sadness' of a piece of Bach will be quite different from the 'sadness' of a piece of Mozart, and 'sadness' in the Matthew Passion will be different from the sort of 'sadness' we might discern in The Musical Offering...""And he goes on to discuss individual movements in the St Matthew Passion! This passage gives a sense of the breadth of culture and research which have gone into this book, distilling out the compelling case for the relationship between the hemispheres, and between the structure of the brain and the development of culture. The arguments about music and language make me think about Tolkien, his evocations of music, pity, and etymology, and the status of his mythology for beginning to accomplish just the sort of realignment between the Master right hemisphere, associated with imaginative empathy, as well as spatial depth and musical wholes, and the Emissary left, the wordy, categorizing, atomizing and unfolding usurper whose messages are meant to be reconnected and given meaning within that larger whole from which they receive their material without knowing it--Socrates' daemon, Nietzsche's Birth of Tragedy, Pullman's night fishing in the half-light of Keats' negative capability, etc.More, in the section on the direction of writing: ""Although both oriental and Western languages are generally read from the top down, so that at the global level they still conform to the right-hemisphere preference, at the local, sequential level they have drifted in the West towards the left hemisphere's point of view. This process started with the move to phonetics. While 'almost all pictographic writing systems favour a vertical layout....practically all systems of writing that depend exclusively on the visual rendition of phonological features of language are horizontally laid out.' ...[Greek] continued to be written right to left until the seventh century BC. However, at around this time a fascinating change occurred. Between the eighth and sixth centuries, Greek began to be written in what is known as boustrephedon, literally 'as the ox ploughs,' which is to say going to the end of the line, turning round, and coming back - alternating direction line by line. By the fifth century BC, however, left to right was becoming the norm, and by the fourth century the transition was complete, and all forms of Greek were being written left to right.""He connects this with Athenian democracy, Platonic philosophy, and the rise of currency. It reminds me of Barzun's fascination with the shape of the book vs the scroll--how scrolling makes sense for organizing horizontally units which are vertical, whereas a book organizes in vertical layouts units which are horizontal. I've often imagined a book in which each line could be stacked vertically with branching possibilities like harmonies, whether through hyperlinks or by some mystical suspension of the reader's boundedness to spacetime.Finally, McGilchrist arrives at a similar concern as Mukherjee: metaphor and its relation to the truths recognized by science. Throughout, he has referred to a tale by Nietzsche, he claims to be unable to say just where he read it, but it sounds a great deal like the parable of the vineyard owner in the Gospels, which he does not refer to, to my recollection, and like Hegel's dialectic, which he does, particularly the master-slave sections. In likening the hemispheres to a servant and his master, considering ""alienation versus engagement, abstraction versus incarnation, the categorical versus the unique, the general versus the particular, the part versus the whole, and so on - it seems like a metaphor that might have some literal truth. But if it turns out to be 'just' a metaphor, I will be content. I have a high regard for metaphor. It is how we come to understand the world.""Embodied there in the language and style is the crux of the argument, I think: that science must, even if it doesn't realize it, bow the knee to poetry, which underlies it and orients itself in turn humbly towards the unknown; that in this stance in awe of the world meaning can arise which is individual, true, and yet admits of being shared. It's an invigorating, astonishingly convincing, treasure trove of a book. Read it!See episode 16 of Bookwarm Games for some thoughts on the implications for postmodern art and theory."

37,030014878X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/13979671-paul-cockeram,5,"Over the course of thousands of years, the human animal has increasingly become the self-conscious animal, growing ever more enchanted with the mysteries of how and why we think. Neuroscience has lately become our greatest hope, it seems, for solving this ancient mystery, and Iain McGilchrist worked for twenty years on the problem of self-consciousness. In examining the problem, he crossed boundaries between the sciences and the humanities, relying upon brain imagery and numerous studies while also delving into aesthetics theory, continental philosophy, art history, religion studies, and cultural theory. The result is this wide-ranging, deeply considered magnum opus, The Master and His Emissary. Think of it as a users manual for the animal brain and the human mind, both. It’s required reading for anyone who wants to understand how they think, who would rather learn the sources and causes of anxiety than take a pill to dispel it.The book is long, the argument is powerful, and the scholarship is beyond reproach. Fortunately, McGilchrist is also an exceptionally lucid writer of readable, even enjoyable prose. In him, the soul of an art lover comes together with the method of a scientist and the clear, deep thought of a philosopher. Basically, he argues that human thought follows a certain pattern: We all have access to two ways of perceiving the world, which are most likely tied to the two hemispheres of our brains, and Western culture is suffering a perilous imbalance toward one of those ways of thinking. With respect to “the nature of the world that each [hemisphere] brings into being,” McGilchrist demonstrates that “the right hemisphere’s vision is more global and holistic, based on the recognition of similarity with an ideal exemplar, and on where this is positioned in the context of other examples, whereas the left hemisphere identifies single features that would place the object in a certain category in the abstract.” One part of us focuses on granular details from which it tries to build a picture of the whole (like making a tree out of leaves and sticks and bark), while another part of us takes in a vision of the whole and identifies individuals within it (like recognizing a pine tree in the forest, or picking a friend’s face out of the crowd).McGilchrist proposes that the right hemisphere, which is responsible for our vision of the whole context, is the metaphorical master who labors in the background, while the left hemisphere is the emissary sent into the world to manage the master’s affairs. He argues persuasively that our conscious minds work best, and we as a culture thrive, when these two ways of thinking work in harmony with one another. But the left hemisphere, the emissary, tends to betray its master, tends to seize power for itself and deny its master’s existence. McGilchrist points out all the shortcomings and delusions to which the left hemisphere is prone: it demands certainty rather than ambiguity; it insists upon literal meanings for language and art rather than suggestive meanings; it deals poorly with metaphors and always tries to simplify them; it deals better with the abstract world than it does with the concrete, embodied world. The personality profile that McGilchrist’s description suggests is bound to remind readers of people they know, most likely their bureaucratic bosses or their fundamentalist friends or rationalist acquaintances. Readers familiar with cultural theory will also see reflections of Western culture in the left brain’s way of thinking. The book is divided into two parts. Part one outlines the major distinctions between the way each hemisphere conceives the world. Taken from neurobiology and brain scanning data and numerous psychological studies, this section is heavy on science and is meticulously cited (the book includes about 54 pages of endnotes). This is where I learned why melancholy and empathy seem like natural companions on one hand, while calculation and detachment are companions on the other. This section is filled with fascinating case studies of stroke patients who suffered a variety of brain lesions and changed in significant ways, based on which hemisphere had been damaged. Some patients even deny that their left arm is their own, claiming a doctor left it in their bed. (This happens when the right hemisphre is damaged, disrupting the patient’s sense of their own body’s integrity.) This section also includes some handy tests to determine whether you’re schizophrenic. Now, as a young teacher, a student sometimes asked a question I couldn’t answer, and I occasionally caught myself making up answers. That was a habit borne in my left hemisphere (and I’ve thankfully overcome it). Whenever I happily concede that I don’t know the answer to a question, or whenever I am uncertain about things, that’s my right hemisphere talking. This is also the part where McGilchrist explains why more realistic people tend to be sadder, and why more empathic people are also sadder, while those who demand positive attitudes at all times tend to practice more denial and overestimate their control of the world.In part two, McGilchrist interprets history through the lens of these neurobiological insights. He traces artistic and intellectual movements from the ancient world through the postmodern twentieth century, uncovering a back-and-forth pattern between the world view favored by the right hemisphere and the one favored by the left. He makes a persuasive case that in Greek culture the right hemisphere’s influence was rising, while Roman culture reveals a left hemisphere ascendence. McGilchrist likewise interprets all the major movements, from the Restoration through the Renaissance, Enlightenment, Romantic, Modern, and Post-modern eras. Any American philosopher or reader who is familiar with continental philosophy will recognize McGilchrist’s affinity for that style of thought, and the end notes from part two read like a bibliography of the field’s greatest names, like Merleau-Ponty, Heidegger, Foucault, and Gadamer. I happened to be familiar with a lot of these writers’ work, which helped immensely in following McGilchrist’s argument here. Those who haven’t read their work might find this section less persuasive or compelling. Nonetheless, there does seem to be a strong, right hemispheric pattern across the thought of these diverse writers.Can it be just a coincidence? Then why does their thinking also resonate with the aspirations of artists across all media? Here’s an example: “For Merleau-Ponty, truth is arrived at through engagement with the world, not through greater abstraction from it; the general is encountered through, rather than in spite of, the finite” so that “the artist [did] not merely reflect what was there anyway, albeit in a novel way, but actually ‘brought into being a truth’ about the world that was not there before, perhaps the best example of the universal being manifest through the particular.” As that quotation demonstrates, part two is also where McGilchrist brings musicians, playwrights, painters, poets and aestheticians into the discussion, revealing how they frequently represent a right hemispheric view of the world in their artworks. This is the complement to the left hemisphere’s rationalist, scientific world view—the culture and beauty that support, even contextualize our analysis and our calculations.McGilchrist clearly sees the strength of both hemispheres’ perspectives. He outlines their proper relationship as one of give and take, helping us to see how we might become more fully human. How can we bring the two hemispheres together in order to live with integrity? The basic strategy is here, in his assessment of philosophy: “I believe that, despite appearances, philosophy begins and ends in the right hemisphere, though it has to journey through the left hemisphere on its way.” To put it another way, consider one of McGilchrist’s favorite metaphors for the process: think of an artist, like the legendary dancer Fred Astaire, who practiced his choreography to an unprecedented and heroic degree. Custodians of the movie lot regularly reported seeing Astaire practice through the night, emerging sweaty and exhausted in the early morning. Astaire was taking his body’s intuitive movements (right hemisphere) and sending them to his analytical self (left hemisphere) to break the movements down, learn and practice them step by step. In order to perform the dance, however, and to be the light-on-his-feet professional who stunned viewers, Astaire had to send all that training back into his intuition (right hemisphere). The result was a dance that looked spontaneous, completely hiding the hours of practice and toil that went into developing it. Readers who favor a left brain, rationalistic, logical world view will inevitably object to McGilchrist’s argument and ignore many of his conclusions. That attitude is evident in some of the reviews you can read on this web site. I once gave a talk where a rationalist philosopher left the room as soon as I mentioned Michele Foucault—I can only imagine the rage that man would unleash upon McGilchrist. However, none of this relieves rationalist thinking from its many limitations, or repairs the damage it has wrought. When Descartes severed the head from the body, he attempted to abstract the world out of existence. “I think, therefore I am,” he said, as if that thinking weren’t being done with a body, living in an embodied world. Descarte’s emphasis on thinking over embodied existence lead Western culture to an insistence on rational thinking above all other types (left hemisphere). McGilchrist carefully demonstrates how “rationalistic systems contain the seeds of their own destruction. [. . .] There are always elements that arise within the system (rationally conceived goals) that cannot be achieved by the system (rational means of pursuit), and that indeed draw our attention to the limits of the system, and point us beyond it.” Have you ever tried to fall asleep? Setting yourself the goal of falling asleep and then consciously, rationally striving for sleep leads to guaranteed insomnia. The left hemisphere wants to either grasp things or create them. But in many cases this strategy is doomed to failure, for “the left hemisphere, despite its view of itself as bringing things about, can only say ‘no’ or not say ‘no’ to what it finds given to it by the right hemisphere (just as the right hemisphere in turn can only say no or not to ‘the Other,’ whatever it is that exists apart from ourselves).” I urge anyone with a brain whose workings they want to understand: Don’t say no to this massive, important work. "
38,030014878X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7243199-steve-greenleaf,5," Growing up in America as a member of the Baby Boom generation, I know that I’ve lived in the best place and the best time in the history of the world—or at least very close to it. Canada, some European countries, Australia, and later Japan can lay some claims to being the best places ever, but suffice it to say that I’ve been lucky. Yet, despite all the material comfort and security that my country and culture have allowed me, there’s still a sense that things aren’t as they should be. The twentieth century is full of contradictions: untold wealth and material prosperity with horrific wars, deep economic depressions, the threat of nuclear annihilation , and a culture that sometimes seems alien to human concerns and that degrades the natural environment. Thus, despite my good fortune, I’ve been sympathetic to critiques of our culture. My introduction to such a critique came from Theodore Roszak’s The Making of a Counter-Culture: Reflections on the Technocratic Society and Its Youthful Opposition (1969), which I was assigned to read in my freshman year in college for my course “Introduction to Political Theory”. From that introduction, I went on to read the likes of Hannah Arendt, Lewis Mumford, Jacques Ellul, Phillip Rieff, the Frankfurt School, Jürgen Habermas, William Irwin Thompson, Wendell Berry, and others. I’ve found resonance with critiques of contemporary Western culture (which has been adopted in many essentials by a large part of Asia as well). I hasten to add that I’m well acquainted and sympathetic to the champions of our contemporary world, too, and as this is also “the best of times”. I appreciate the positive perspective as well. I mention all this because now I have now encountered a new diagnosis and critique of many of the problems of Western culture that strikes me as uniquely insightful and truly ingenious. College literature professor turned psychiatrist, Iain McGilchrist, has written a two-part book about the anatomical split in our brains and how that split in functions affects how we perceive the world and creates our culture. According to McGilchrist, we can consider our culture from the perspective of the different functions of the two different hemispheres of the brain.(For some further background, see my earlier post about McGilchrist’s RSA Animate presentation and the book he wrote as a follow-up to this masterwork under review here.) In the first part of the book, McGilchrist focuses on anatomical and functional details of the brain, with the well-known but often misunderstood division of the left and right hemispheres. The split is not, as first thought, a neat division of language and logic on the left versus vision, music, and feeling on the right. Functions for each of these skills draw on both sides of the brain. However, the brain is divided and is different on each side. In fact, it doesn’t even sit symmetrically within the cranium: it’s torqued (Yanklovian torque) as if twisted it slightly from the bottom so that the right front is slightly larger than its left counterpart, and the left posterior just a bit larger than its right counterpart. This anatomical anomaly, in addition to the fact that the two sides are joined by a bridge, the corpus collosum, that serves as the gatekeeper of the traffic between the two halves, gives some clue to the division of functions within the brain. The gatekeeper often performs its most important work when it inhibits traffic between the two halves. Why? Because each half has its own outlook or way of perceiving the world. McGilchrist spends much of the book examining the two different ways each side of the brain perceives the world: the right deals with living, dynamic, unique, and context-dependent portions of the environment. The left side deals with (and creates) the static, still, and minutely focused parts of our attention. Each side has evolved to deal with two different needs. The two sides of the brain cooperate, but they their perspectives are largely separate. Thus, language involves both sides of the brain, but the left side, with its emphasis on static and detailed information dominates in vocabulary and syntax issues. Thus, while an impulse toward speech may originate in the right brain, those impulses must pass to the left side to obtain full expression. Here is where stroke victims and the subjects of split-brain surgeries (severing the corpus collosum to alleviate epileptic seizures) provide amazing clues about the differing functions of the two hemispheres. McGilchrist wades through this research to deepen our understanding and appreciation of these issues. But if the book was only a catalog of “our amazing divided brain!” it would prove interesting but not profound. The profundity and deep value of the book comes from McGilchrist’s ability to trace the effects of this division of the brain into daily life, especially into a portrait of its effect on the formal culture of the West. (He doesn’t address Eastern culture, begging off for a lack of acquaintance.) McGilchrist’s knowledge of Western culture, especially literary and philosophical culture, is impressive. McGilchrist argues that Western culture since the Enlightenment, and especially after the Romantic reaction to the Enlightenment, has been dominated by a left-brain perspective. It has focused on the static, the manufactured (i.e., not living, not organic), that which we can manipulate and control, and that which pays easily identifiable dividends. The left-side also prefers the literal to the metaphoric and the artificial to the natural. McGilchrist finds this especially true in the 2oth century when examining contemporary literature and philosophy as well as the broader cultural milieu. McGilchrist finds times in Western cultural history when attitudes, beliefs, and practices, reflecting the two differing perspectives and functions of the brain, were balanced, such as Periclean Athens and the Renaissance. Problems arose early, on the other hand, when the pre-Socratics, such as Heraclitus, with his emphasis on flux and change, were shunted aside by Plato and Aristotle, who preferred the static and “reason” as the ideal. Indeed, from Plato through Kant Western philosophy emphasized the left-hemisphere perspective (with some exception for Spinoza: “Spinoza was one of the few philosophers, apart from Pascal, between Plato and Hegel to have a strong sense of the right-hemisphere world.” McGilchrist, Iain (2010-08-16). The Master and His Emissary (Kindle Locations 3804-3805). Yale University Press. Kindle Edition.). In the wider culture, religion offered a good deal of counter-balance to the left-sidedness of philosophy. McGilchrist argues that with Hegel, philosophy begins to take a corrective turn. He writes:  Hegel, along with Heraclitus and Heidegger, has a particular place in the unfolding story of the relationship between the cerebral hemispheres, in that, it seems to me, his philosophy actually tries to express the mind's intuition of its own structure – if you like, the mind cognising itself. His spirit is like an unseen presence in this book, and it is necessary to devote a few pages to his heroic attempts to articulate, in relation to the structure of the mind or spirit (Geist), what lies almost beyond articulation, even now that we have knowledge of the structure of the brain. McGilchrist, Iain (2010-08-16). The Master and His Emissary (Kindle Locations 5477-5481). Yale University Press. Kindle Edition.Along with Hegel, Schopenhauer, Nietzsche, Heidegger, and Wittgenstein, among German-language philosophers, receive extended and sympathetic treatment (demonstrating that McGilchrist willingly suffers through some dense and challenging prose to retrieve nuggets of insight). Also receiving favorable treatment and consideration are lesser known figures like Husserl, Scheler, and Merleau-Ponty: each gives voice and insight into to the function of the right brain. Finally, McGilchrist considers the American pragmatists John Dewey and William James for their useful perspectives on philosophy and the organic nature of reality.McGilchrist, following Leon Sass, agrees that modern culture displays many of the traits of schizophrenia. Publisher’s Weekly writes of Sass’s book Madness and Modernism: Insanity in the Light of Modern Art, Literature, and Thought: “Does the schizophrenic's chaotic inner world resemble modern art and literature? Sass, a clinical psychologist and Rutgers professor, argues that schizophrenia and modernism display striking affinities: fragmentation, defiance of authority, multiple viewpoints, self-referentiality and rejection of the external world in favor of an omnipotent self or, alternately, a total loss of self. While the parallels he draws often seem superficial, there is much to ponder in Sass's notion that schizophrenia's core traits are exaggerations of tendencies fostered by our culture.” As this quote suggests, McGilchrist, following Sass, finds striking resemblances that McGilchrist identifies as a manifestation of a left-brain perspective run awry. Identifying and counter-acting this trend is a defining part of McGilchrist’s project. He writes: My choice of the Nietzschean fable of the Master and his emissary suggests that right at the heart of the relationship between the hemispheres I see a power struggle between two unequal entities, and moreover one in which the inferior, dependent party (the left hemisphere) starts to see itself as of primary importance. McGilchrist, Iain (2010-08-16). The Master and His Emissary (Kindle Locations 5481-5483). Yale University Press. Kindle Edition.Is all of this worth the effort? I think so. It’s a very valid and live issue, I believe. How we view our world, what perspectives we take, will change the course of our actions. If we do in fact give predominance to the left-brain perspective, we will reap consequences that will likely back-fire upon us. Like the Sorcerer’s Apprentice, we have loosed its magic on the world, but there are grounds to believe that we have lost control. We need the Master, the living world of the right-brain, to come to the rescue. "

40,030014878X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9801725-graham,4,"I hugely enjoyed this book. It was difficult, and a lot went over my head. But I am very grateful I had the chance to read it (and grateful to McGilchrist for the epic effort it must have ben to produce it). There are great touches of humour, and moments of masterful and clear teaching. The Part 1/Part 2 structure works well. First, an exhaustive and convincing summary not only of what we know about hemispheres, but why we know it. Followed by a more speculative cultural/historical set of observations whose plausibility I can't appraise but are hugely enlightening and entertaining. I learned a lot. Imagine spending 30 (or more!) hours In the genial company of a very well-read and opinionated academic. Like a dinner at a fancy university: one doesn't hope to understand half of what one's dining companion is on about, but one occasionally gets an insight, a feeling, for which one is if not permanently improved, at least very grateful for an interesting experience. And he doesn't hold back his on opinions. They are great, like those of an opinionated teacher, and are amusingly-phrased, good fun, and food for thought. There are a few disconcerting moments. For example (p. 344). “Cassirer notes that in Arabic there are between five and six thousand terms for ‘camel’, the category for which we have one”. In the end-notes McG seems to acknowledge that there might be “scepticism” on this point of fact. True or not, it doesn’t really matter. In this agreeable and erudite monologue, an authoritative and avuncular sequence of elite urban-legend trivia is natural, to be expected. It’s part of the show. There were moments where I really wanted to learn, but felt instead I was being showed off to. For example, the idea that the properties of the world are neither entirely intrinsic nor entirely subjective, but an iterative intermediate of the two. Perhaps McGilchrist wants to try to explain, but gets carried away on beautiful phrases. I am a sucker for this mystical style, and find the writing beautiful and poetic. But I can't shake off a gear of gullibility for falling for phrases that are a little impenetrable. It jarred to read that ""the two hemispheres became more independent of one another's operations at an early point in the history of the West."" [p.244]. Is McGilchrist suggesting a physiological change? Like Westerner's brains are wired differently from Oriental's? One reads on hungrily for the data. But the mechanisms he offered (Baldwinian effect, epigenetic ""mechanisms"") didn't enlighten this layman, and even seemed rushed out grudgingly as if McGilchrist didn't want to be bothered with explaining the details. It can't be unarguably true that contemporary Western life is characterised by ""[d]enial, a tendency to conformism, a willingness to disregard the evidence, a habit of ducking responsibility, a blindness to mere experience in the face of the overwhelming evidence of theory."" [p.235]. The West's response to the COVID-19 pandemic seems to prove that we *do* value human life over bureaucratic efficiency, and that our empathic right hemispheres are still a strong influence on real events. At least, I hope that's part of the explanation. I am personally greatly attracted to many ideas in this amazing book: of mystery, of poetry that increases the heart rate but can't be explained. And I can't quite swallow 100% the suggestion that such ""romantic"" appreciation of art, or mystical sentiment, are necessarily, or have ever been, reliable antidotes to totalitarianism."

I think the overall thesis is fascinating, but I mostly liked his description of how our minds influence and shape the world around us. That has kept me thinking for months. As I read further in the book, I kept returning to that and ended up not even caring about most of the chapters about the history of thought, art, culture, etc. It took me forever to finish this book. It’s dense and difficult to read, which started to wear on me by the end. Favorite quotes:Mind has the characteristics of a process more than of a thing; a becoming, a way of being, more than an entity. Every individual mind is a process of interaction with whatever it is that exists apart from ourselves according to its own private history.P. 20Attention changes what kind of a thing comes into being for us: in that way it changes the world. If you are my friend, the way in which I attend to you will be different from the way in which I would attend to you if you were my employer, my patient, the suspect in a crime I am investigating, my lover, my aunt, a body waiting to be dissected. In all these circumstances, except the last, you will also have a quite different experience not just of me, but of yourself: you would feel changed if I changed the type of my attention. And yet nothing objectively has changed. P. 28We arrive at the position (which is so familiar from experience) that we cannot attain an understanding by grasping it for ourselves. It has already to be in us, and the task is to awaken it, or perhaps to unfold it –to bring it into being within us. P. 155Whatever it is out there that exists apart from us comes into contact with us as the water falls on a particular landscape. The water falls and the landscape resists. One can see a river as restlessly searching out its path across the landscape, but in fact no activity is taking place in the sense that there is no will involved. One can see the landscape as blocking the path of the water so that it has to turn another way, but again the water just falls in the way that water has to, and the landscape resists its path, in the way it has to. The result of the amorphous water and the form of the landscape is a river. The river is not only passing across the landscape, but entering into it and changing it too, as the landscape has ‘changed’ and yet not changed the water. The landscape cannot make the river. It does not try to put a river together. It does not even say ‘yes’ to the river. It merely says ‘no’ to the water –or does not say ‘no’ to the water, and, by its not saying ‘no’ to the water, wherever it is that it does so, it allows the river to come into being. The river does not exist before the encounter. Only water exists before the encounter, and the river actually comes into being in the process of encountering the landscape, with its power to say ‘no’ or not say ‘no’. Similarly there is ‘whatever it is that exists apart from ourselves’, but ‘whatever it is that exists’ only comes to be what it is as it finds out in the encounter with ourselves what it is, and we only find out and make ourselves what we are in our encounter with ‘whatever it is that exists’.

This is the part that sums up the neuroscience, and it is clear this is his field and he knows what he is talking about. However, in the second half he goes on to discuss art, and it becomes clear that he does not know what he is talking about, and makes a number of errors that turn his central argument into gibberish. Had he gained a better understanding of what he was speaking about, his central argument would have been strengthened, but as it stands, his argument is weakened by the many ways that he is just plain wrong. For instance, he claims that left hemisphere dominance began with Plato, with his conception of perfect forms. Then he claims that the Renaissance and Ancient Greek Sculpture demonstrated right hemisphere dominance. But...the Renaissance and Ancient Greek Sculpture were centered around perfect forms! In fact, Plato was so highly prized in the Renaissance that Raphael painted Plato holding his Timaeus in the School of Athens. In fact, one can draw a direct link between the Platonic ideal and Renaissance art. So he ends up contradicting himself in this section. He then contradicts himself later by characterizing the Romantic period of art as right brained, due to it being intuitive and emotional, while also declaring Bach right brained, when intuitive and emotional are hardly the way I would characterize the mathematical, spatial thinking required for Bach to compose such complex counterpoint. He characterizes Mozart as right brain dominated by pointing out the sadness that creeps into Mozart's later work (sadness and melancholy being emotions housed in the right hemisphere, with joy and undue confidence in the left) thereby ignoring the fact that the majority of Mozart's work is quite light and joyful. And finally, he emphasizes that harmony and perspective are both right brained phenomenons, ignoring the fact that they are also coherent logical systems with rules (which he declares is left brained). Had he only explored how certain systems could be right brained if they were spatial (a fact he never touches on, although he does discuss how the perception of depth resides in the right hemisphere), or how it was the unification of the hemispheres that was important in creating great art (a fact he touches on far too briefly), he could have saved the coherence of his argument. Instead, he continually contradicts himself through sheer ignorance. I'm also really annoyed by his continual characterization of great art as being 'mysterious' and coming through mystical, divine inspiration that cannot be controlled or even taught, while simultaneously holding up as the pinnacle of great art works that were arrived at through logic, rules, and years of intense training. On the other hand, this is admirably ambitious, and I think his ultimate thesis is correct, it's just a pity that he did not take the time to understand how the fields he applied his theory to actually worked.

Thank you for falling in love with a subject so much that you were able to write this.This book cleared my mind greatly on the human experience. We are deeply affectionate, artistic, religious and intuitive creatures and to feel fulfilled we need contact with the sacred. Reason is more of a lining around a sphere of energy/intuition/soul that comes from within and which we will never have 'grasp' on but we need to cultivate lest it will cripple, bringing analytic reason with it. And this is what we are seeing in society at large.McGilchrist is a true maverick. He came from the world of the humanities and landed in the world of applied medicine and psychiatry. He thus has a unique combination of sensitivity and respect for the unknown and a great curiosity for practical mental health problems and their origins (when the mind breaks you can get a glimpse of how it works). He achieves to tackle a neurocientific topic from a completely different perspective of anyone I've read, tracing parallelisms between the two hemispheres and different historical movements like the Roman Times, Middle Ages, Renaissance, Romanticisim and, yes, Modernity. He sees each of these periods as a moment in time when one of the hemispheres won territory over the other, by imposing it's point of view (difference between the hemispheres is not on the 'what' they do but on 'how' they see the world). He gives ample neuroscientific evidence on the different ways the two hemispheres see the world but, as he beautifuly writes in the last paragraph of his book:""[...] if it turns out to be 'just' a metaphor, I will be content. I have a high regard for metaphor. It is how we come to understand the world.""Clearly, a book that I'm going to keep for my descendants. Thank you Iain."
44,030014878X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/68388652-mytwocents,3,"Ironically there are the occasional assumptions based on abstractions that are not true, almost as if the writer is dressing up in the clothes of the right hemisphere but still carrying out the work of the major left. I want to credit McGilchrist with trying to do the impossible but I will instead criticise him for being foolish to do it in the wrong way.As the inconsistencies and blindfolded approach show, like most non-fiction works, it is the tyranny of the analytical mind trying to fit evidence into it's own assumed conclusions.It is fitting that the holistic and balanced world view that originates in the East thousands of years ago and is preserved in many forms through multiple civilisations to this day, is ignored almost entirely except a few pages at the very end. Western thought is still stuck in epistemological circularity as this shows, but many people have reversed an objective world view by exploring eastern culture and faiths.This is a harsh review but I was always seeking the author, or should I say compiler, to open up and offer far more personal experiences and anecdotes beyond the lab and peer reviewed reports. The power of literature is it's holistic nature in distilling the truths of life into characters that act out our own mythology. We learn by telling stories, not by remembering abstracted facts, I know the author knows this, so why not tell a story Iain?! If others feel in this way disappointed, I would recommend Neil MacGregor's Living with the Gods, a Radio series exploring art and religious history.I started reading this after seeing the Blake society 2016 lecture, but I was disappointed. I have been picking this up here and there, I have not finished it and I may not, it repeats itself a lot and is unnecessarily long. The disappointment is similar to seeing a child fail an essay when you know what they mean and what they want to say, you know they have the power and potential to do it, but they don't."
45,030014878X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/25866988-matthew,5,"This book is a challenging read. To understand it better, I took several side trails educating myself on many of the topics covered- history, religion, philosophy, art. The effort was well worth it. The general concept of the book is that the two halves of the brain present different worlds to us. The left hemisphere concerns itself with certainty, grasp and control, the right hemisphere with care and betweenness and paradox. As history has progressed, there is evidence that the brains have changed through mimicry resulting in different periods of history where each hemisphere has grown more dominant. It seems that at this point where we are at in history, the left hemisphere has created a world in its own image and has come to see the right hemisphere as a threat which must be overthrown. McGilchrist suggests that we can escape from the left hemisphere's entrapment in a hall of mirrors through connection to body, spirit and art. The prose with which McGilchrist writes, makes this book hard to put down despite its enormous complexity. As someone who has found the left hemisphere's explanation of the world quite convincing (and well as quite suffocating at times), this book has presented a new (and substantially researched) way of seeing and experiencing life, full of depth and beauty. This book has had a profound impact on me and I don't know how any discussion on the big questions about life, faith, and meaning would be complete without the ideas expressed in this book. "
46,030014878X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/22001050-gary,4,"This is an extraordinary book. It is big and dense, but nevertheless quite readable. And its underlying theme is one that any reader would be able to grasp and apply in thinking about the world we live in. It is difficult, even dangerous, to reduce this data-driven and nuanced presentation to a few words. It does see many of our ""modern"" problems as arising from the dominance of left-brain processes. These are the literal interpretations of acquired knowledge. Those are just fine, so long as they are properly balanced by the intuitive curiosity and perception of context by the right brain. It is the latter that he fears are being subordinated. He argues that the proper balance between the two hemispheres was most notably achieved in ancient Greece. The insights drawn from brain experimentation and analysis are fascinating in themselves. For example, why do people everywhere hold an infant in their left arm instead of the right? If you're interested, read the book; but it has to do with the expressive, empathetic qualities of the right brain (which appear on the left side of the body). It also provides some opportunities to frame behavior on a grand scale. Looking at the Trump election through the lens of hemispheric dominance is both enlightening and frightening. I found this book an endless source of thought-provoking insights. But it requires a serious commitment of time and attention."
47,030014878X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/58497343-secondme80,5,"Read the 2nd, extended edition that just came out right now. It was a riveting read as McGilchrist not only ""illuminates"" his readership on brain function as they are spread hemisphere-wise and front-to-back, but also on more than 4.000 years of cultural history around the world.Having done quite some reading on culture, organizational change, and cultural shift, the argument of ""Master and Emissary"" nearly felt as if I had been admitted into a circle of seeing clearly. I noticed that some reviews took issue with the image of ""Master and Emissary"", claiming that was left-hemispheric, rationalist/competitive thinking. But the way I understood it - and McGilchrist comes back to that point at every turn of his reasoning - he goes back to the Hegelian concept of ""aufheben"", which is basically a folk-culture approach to dialectics: something is ""cancelled"", ""kept"" and ""lifted to a higher level"" all at the same time, as that is what the German word encompasses as potential meanings.I also like how McGilchrist differentiates ""reason"" from ""rationality"". When we - modern people - talk ""bottom line"", we often tacitly interchange the second for the first, then wonder why we are not getting where we are headed for. I could go on and on reporting on the exciting intellectual journey on which this book takes its readership. But if you can do so with an open mind, I warmly recommend that you go and see for yourself (skipping passages may be de rigueur)."
48,030014878X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/64284266-shante-zenith,5,"McGilchrist is the first to place the binary I had intuited as existing within the hemispheres of the brain: the right hemisphere perceiving the world as an interconnected, dynamic, living whole and the left hemisphere perceiving the world as a series of static, machine-like parts to be controlled. These hemispheric differences in perception are clearly aligned with the differences in world view of the gift versus that of the commodity. McGilchrist goes further, explaining that these two world views are not equal, but rather, the left hemisphere’s world view is a corruption (literally a “taking to pieces”) of the right hemisphere’s way of seeing the world. In order to for learning to happen, that which has originated in the right hemisphere as a whole and been deconstructed by the left hemisphere must always be reintegrated into the right hemisphere. This is a beautiful description of “praxis.” The word McGilchrist uses to describe this three-step process is Aufhebung, an untranslatable German word used by Hegel to describe the natural process of “sublation.” The concept of Aufhebung has been very influential to me, especially after I learned through subsequent research (c.f. Money, Language, and Thought) that the word originally was used to mean “monetary interest” in the writings of Martin Luther."
49,030014878X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/27619244-ant,4,"Wow, this was a mission and a half to read, so it is frightening to think what went into the creation of it!The first half of this weighty tome is quite an in-depth view of the differences with between the left and right hemispheres of the brain. This is to introduce a nuanced view of how the two halves affect each other and produce different views on the world. As one would expect, the evidence for a particular point usually comes from case studies where damage to a particular part of the brain in a patient changes behaviour or world view. This really does turn what could be a very dry subject into something quite fascinating.The second half is a much more personal discussion of the consequence of such a division in the brain. This is not my area of expertise, so I will refrain from making value judgements on the quality of the evidence or the conclusions drawn from it. However, I will say that I feel McGilchrist introduces the subject matter in a way that feels as though I can follow the thread of his argument, despite my knowing that I would need to read through a few more times to fully follow the arguments.Well worth the time to read. It certainly left me with a lot of interesting ideas to ponder and in it’s final conclusions reminds me not a little of Schrodinger’s What is Life? "
50,030014878X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/843976-isaac,5,"My five star rating is specifically for part 1 of this book that ends on page 237. Part 1 is a must read book that breaks down the left brain versus the right brain and explains so much about life and particularly understanding very left brained people who have a hard time understanding that there is more to life than what can be proven in a double blind study.So much of life can be broken down between these two brain hemispheres and their areas of specialty. The beauty of this book is that even strongly left brained people can appreciate the evidence based presentation of the left vs right brains.I am currently re-reading The Lonely Man of Faith by Rabbi Joseph B. Soloveitchik and his distinction between Adam the first and Adam the second can be clearly connected to the left brain vs the right brain. The second part of this book was much more difficult to read. While the underlying theme of showing how different eras had different parts of the brain as their primary function is fascinating, the details were a bit mind-numbing and required discipline to get through. In contrast the first half of the book felt fascinating and revealing with each page.Bottom line, Part 1 of this book is a must read to truly comprehend life and how we function."
51,030014878X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/51639055-john,5,"Life changing book. This book changed my perspective on life, and I am not sure I caught most of the positions and supporting evidence. It was a tough read for me and thus slow going. It is not the kind of book I can read while going to bed. It required careful reading, but it was WORTH it. It is a fantastic book, and perhaps it was better in the end for me having taken it in small chunks. The author presents an argument together with scientific evidence about the brain as well as his circumstantial evidence looking at society with respect to various aspects such as music and art. This mix of 'art and science' is fascinating. I am someone for whom I would guess is susceptible to being overpowered by left brain thinking, so I think I am personally more self aware for having read the book, but also, my view of the world and why it is the way it is has been altered in a way that I find uplifting and enriching. I feel like I have rediscovered a part of me that had gone dormant after entering the Uber rational world of law and the Uber practical/technical world of business. Thank you, Mr. McGilchrist. And thank you to Russ Roberts for interviewing the author on his podcast, econtalk, or i likely never would have heard of or read this book."
52,030014878X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10669928-john,4,"This sweeping tome, which takes the reader from the neurobiology of the brain to Nietzsche's our reflections on society and God (as well as the reflections of several other philosophers), is hard to finish, and yet impossible to put down. It's hard--McGilchrist's attention to detail from half a dozen fields of study, and his assumption that his readers can keep up, is almost overwhelming. On the other hand, his thesis--that the left and right hemispheres of the brain are both opposed and yet need each other (but the left is winning and that is bad)--is fascinating and, at least, plausible. This is no simple left/right brain dichotomy story. One of the difficulties, but beauties of this work is that McGilchrist spends a lot of time describing the overlap and dependency of each part of the brain on the other. What is new is that he sees the brain's battling hemispheres as a microcosm of our world's cultural and philosophical battles. In the world, the left brain--rationality, rules, clarity, numbers, algorithms, detail, etc., etc.,--is winning the war against intuition, the big picture, relationships, connection and attachment, meaning, philosophy, metaphor, ambiguity, and so on. Read it. Even if you think McGilchrist's basic metaphor is flawed, there is a lot of insight here."
53,030014878X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/30286067-paul-brandwein,5," To say that the right brain is more creative and that the left is more analytical is grossly oversimplifying things. After exhaustively describing the different ways the hemispheres of the brain function ( the right hemisphere is the “master”, the left is the “emissary “) apart from each other and in concert, the author shows how he sees this reflected in western culture from Ancient Greece to postmodernism. McGilchrist shows how during different periods of history the culture has reflected thought based on the hemispheres working in balance shifting to periods where the left hemisphere is ascendent. Indeed he finds that today things are so out of balance with the left hemisphere seemingly “running the show” that he fears for the future.  Little did I realize when I picked up this book that I would be getting a short course on the history of western philosophy in addition to the thorough discussion of neurobiology. Despite the fact that this was a demanding read, it opened my mind to do many concepts and connections to the way we perceive, create, and relate to the world.. I think his arguments are quite compelling. If you have the stamina I think this book will change the way you see the world."
54,030014878X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/15014899-clivemichael,5,"Wow, monumental overview of fascinating research and observation. Loved the book metaphor. This is a dense and comprehensive exploration. I was educated, inspired, and challenged both cognitively and emotionally. Worth a second read.... after some reflection/integration.""...cruelty does not exist in ‘nature’: only humans with their left prefrontal cortex have the capacity for deliberate malice. But then only humans, with their right prefrontal cortex, are capable of empathy….Empathy is intrinsic to morality.""""We can choose to imitate forms of thinking or behaving; and by doing so both speed up our evolution by many orders of magnitude, and shift it away from the blind forces of chance and necessity, in a direction or directions of our own choosing."""" The point I wish to emphasise here is that the left hemisphere has to ‘blot out’ the right hemisphere in order to its job at all. That is surely the import of the functional and anatomical evidence that left hemisphere superiority is based, not on a leap forward by the left hemisphere, but on a ‘deliberate’ handicapping of the right."""
55,030014878X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/39367681-peter,5,"I approached this hefty book without the certainty that I would have the stamina to finish it. The first part is an exploration of something that is both familiar and very, very strange - our brains. I think that Iain McGilchrist successfully walks a very fine line in his guided tour of an organ that we think of as a single entity and the seat of our individuality and reveals its true nature as a pair of interconnected but often estranged twins. The understanding he offers illuminates many of the peculiarities of how we think and behave and I, for one, was riveted. The second part ambitiously attempts to place the development of human civilisation in the context of the divided brain. As such, it takes a commitment from the reader to follow the complex arguments, but rewards attention with some extraordinary insights which genuinely changed how I look at the world.As a psychotherapist, I have some question marks over some of his conclusions - particularly in relation to the role of the brain hemispheres in schizophrenia. But, I can only thank this author for this amazing book and for enriching my understanding of myself and those around me."
56,030014878X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/118906065-ignazio-pacces,4,"I read this book a couple of years ago. I think that realizing that our brain is made of many different parts is very important to understand ourselves and how we behave. I believe thinking of our self as splitted in two is really illuminating and can help us change when we realize that we actually consider only one of them to rule our lives. To think of the two brain's hemisphere as two different 'people' is a very useful metaphore. And when he says that our reality is in the hand of a greedy emissary I truly believes he makes a good point, it explains a lot of our world and about the widespred absence of perspective.It is a book written to convince about these facts, in an kind of survival urgence, but I am actually already of a very similar opinion, so reading this book has been a way of deepening and rooting my belief. For this very same reason I found too many repetition of the same concepts, too many showing the same thoughts in different perspectives, and all those strategy you use when you really want your readers understand what's your point. Because the left hemisphere usually tries to ignore everything can threaten its authority. "
57,030014878X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/84483078-elizabeth-mcinerney,1,"This is a brilliant book, but I have to give it 1 star because I just can't finish it. I have tried twice now. For me, the problem is the length and the depth. I am interested in the subject, but not that interested (and I am someone who likes to read books about the brain). I need the abridged version. I believe the true audience for this book is other brain researchers or professors of philosophy. They would probably love it!At least this time around, I got about a third of the way in. The first time, I only made it a few pages. Every sentence and every paragraph is so dense, one simply cannot casually zip through it. Realizing that, I picked it up again, vowing to stop and think about every sentence. Doing that, I was able to get into a nightly rythm, and appreciate it's brilliance. But in the end, I just found it to be too much work for me.I give 1 star to books that I cannot finish, and 2 stars to books that I finish but wish I had not. If I ever pick up this book again (it is sitting by my bedside) and finish it, I will change the rating. "
58,030014878X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4784985-anne-janzer,4,"Wow. I spent time working my way through this book—partly because I wanted to chew on its concepts and live with it, and partly because it's long. Having put forth a fascinating thesis on the bilateral brain function, the author then takes that thesis through recorded history, philosophy, art and music... I may have skimmed just a bit through a few of the discussions of different movements in visual arts. That said, the basic premise is fascinating, and reading this book has in fact changed the way I see the world and my own self. You could read the first couple chapters and the last and come away a changed person. At the very least, you'll have a deeper and more nuanced perspective on how your brain works and how the different hemispheres sustain different approaches to the world. I will return to my copy, no doubt."
