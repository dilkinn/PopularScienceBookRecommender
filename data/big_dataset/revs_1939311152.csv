0,1939311152,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4213258-bradley,5,"Apart from just a few niggling quips I might have had with a few parts of this absolutely fantastic collection of essays, I think I've found one of my most absolute favorite books of all time.  I've read a ton of philosophy over the years and more psychology, thanks to my degree in psychology, but nothing QUITE prepared me for this. What we have here is not just a man in the process of designing, from the ground-up, a nice AI that won't turn around and rationally destroy us all because we're vermin, but a man who has gone ahead and taken the idea of real rationality and turned it not only on his work, his life, and himself, but has gone out of his way to give us the benefit of his experience.Sound like a self-help book? It isn't. Or, at least, any of us could use it that way, but to me, it's probably the single-most-useful, courageous, funny, and excruciatingly smart book I've read in a very long time. Does Eliezer have charm? Hell yeah. Does Eliezer champion Bayesian probability? HELL YEAH. Does Eliezer throw a perfectly understandable spotlight on our desperate need to reduce bias and seek truth no matter how painful? Yes. Very much so. And he sends a lot of great light on the whole field of AI research, Cognitive Science, Philosophy, Quantum Physicists, and everyone who might be laboring under faulty models of thought and lazy thinking. Above all, he's passionate as hell about Thinking Clearly. It also helps that he's fantastically devoted to rigorous standards, correct predictive models, and thorough ethical considerations. This isn't all about AIs although we know he is passionate about it. It's about EVERYTHING.And he's right. We need rationality, and I mean, REAL RATIONALITY. I mean meticulously and carefully considered thought. Courageous exposing of our own faults. Our stubbornness, our ability to get up when we fail and learn from our mistakes and DON'T MAKE THE SAME MISTAKES AGAIN.This isn't just a primer on logic. It's pretty much a beacon of shining light in the darkness. :) And Eliezer brings it all to us in such a charming and self-deprecating way that I wouldn't be surprised if he gains a cult following of aspiring Rationalists flocking to his cause.Of course, he would question the HELL out of that. Jeeze... I feel like we have a modern Socrates in our midst. Only, this modern Socrates is building on ALL the myriad scientific foundations of those who have come before and is unwilling to take even a dram of Hemlock. :) (He already tried that as Eliezer of '96.) :)So. What am I trying to say here?Oh, nothing much. I don't care who you are or what you're into. EVERYONE should read this monster of a book and see for themselves. This world is not hopeless. Not when we have such minds in it. Of course, that means we all need to step up to the plate and don't let bias, willful ignorance, or intellectual dishonesty win.Everyone needs to step up. Even if you don't use Bayesian. :)"
1,1939311152,http://goodreads.com/user/show/24334027-mikko,5,"Confession: The ideas in this book helped shape my identity and gave my life a direction.Do you,a) want to improve yourself as a human being, orb) think that 'Nah, I'm pretty much fine the way I currently am'?If you said yes to either question, this book is for you. It is a revelation that will make you a better human being. And the fact remains that it is usually those who think themselves wise that need a wake up call the most.You will learn that you are wrong about most of the things most of the time. And you need to learn that, even though it hurts. But you will also learn how to live with that, even embrace the fact.You will learn to spot when you are being wrong, and stop yourself. And you will be thankful of that fact.You will learn that being rational and logical does not equal being inhuman, cold or oblivious to the social environment around you, as Hollywood would have it. On the contrary, you will learn more about yourself, other people and the way humans work, and how to improve the quality of life of yourself and those around you.You will learn that the universe is a beautiful place. You will discover the joy of trying to understand it a little better.You will learn a set of tools to see everything in a new light.It is time to update the humanity. This book does the job.Actually, it is not one single book, but instead six books rolled into one. And, to be more precise, it is the the comprised totality of the author's blog posts in Overcoming Bias and Less Wrong which he wrote during the late half of the '00s and which have since given birth to a community dedicated to living their lives rationally and promoting rationalistic ideas around the world.The book itself is comprised of six books with varying themes (disclaimer: they are merely my own understanding of what the parts are about, and only comprise a fraction of their contents):I: Map and Territory'What is rationality?'What does it really mean to be rational?''Why is is valuable to care about the truth?'II: How to Actually Change Your Mind'How do I become rational?''How do I avoid the pitfalls along the way?''What are the basic tools I should master?'III: The Machine in the Ghost'Why is it that human beings have not evolved into fully rational thinkers?''How do the neural networks in our brain work?'IV: Mere Reality'How to observe and live in the one universe that actually is there?''How does science work?''What is quantum physics and why should I care?'V: Mere Goodness'How to rationally investigate ethics?''What is valuable?''How to be human as efficiently as possible?'VI: Becoming Stronger'How can I put this into practice?''Where do I muster the strength to keep improving myself?'[And various observations about what it is like to be a rational being in a community.]Ok, I should now probably point out that the book is around 1800 pages long. That may scare you, which is understandable. However, I believe some books and sections are more important, more fundamental than others. Book I ignites the spark that is rationality and serves as a good introduction, but personally, I think Book II is the most important one. Read that, at least.And now, time for a pros-and-cons-list.Things I like about the book:- It is a vastly important book. WHY on EARTH don't we teach these things to our kids in schools?- One might think that a book about rationality is destined to be a dry one. Well, one would be wrong, then. The text is personal - reading it is almost intimate at times. Sometimes it reads like a guide, sometimes it reads like a sales pitch, sometimes it reads like a love letter.- The format - approximately 343 bite-sized chapters of only a few pages - makes it simple to digest. Suggestion: read one chapter a day, you'll be finished with it in about a year!Things that I dislike:- Could have used some editing. Maybe some of the chapters are not that essential in the grand scheme of things. In addition to the introductions, which were okay, maybe summaries would have been in order as well. 'So, what did we learn in this sequence? Bullet points.' As it is, the book is essentially just the totality of blog posts with only some structure.In summary: 4,5 stars. The content is clearly worth five stars but I find the transformation from blog posts to a series of books lacking. Maybe could have left some chapters out, or combined them. It's hard to pick and choose what sequences or chapters to read. Ah, maybe I'll just read it all in order, from cover to cover, then!"

3,1939311152,http://goodreads.com/user/show/24751204-jimmy-longley,2,"Reviewed as part of my 100 books challenge: http://jimmylongley.com/blog/books/Run-on Sentence SummaryRationality, a long and meandering collection of posts from the blog Less Wrong, purports to instruct people how to leverage probability and and understanding human biases to be better but squanders the premise digressing and bashing religion.ImpressionsThe promise of this book is enticing. We are told that by learning to behave rationally, we will behave more optimally and see the world more clearly. I was hoping for something technical, and at times it delivered. There lots of fancy terms, such as his *""Conservation of Expected Evidence,”* which states that *""The expectation of the posterior probability, after viewing the evidence, must equal the prior probability.”*`P(H) = P(H,E) + P(H,¬E)``P(H) = P(H|E) × P(E) + P(H,¬E) × P(¬E)`Therefore, for every expectation of evidence, there is an equal and opposite expectation of counterevidence. For example, he cites how during WWII, it was argued in congress that the fact that there was a conspicuous lack of sabotage from Japanese citizens in the United States implied an organized fifth column. This idea seems superficially plausible. However, by the Conservation of Expected Evidence, for this belief to be valid, that would mean the presence of sabotage would have to be evidence **against** a fifth column existing, an idea that is clearly absurd.As implied by the subtitle, this book is long - my kindle clocks it in at an average reading time of 34 hours - and unfortunately, the good bits are few and far between. Rationality is not really a book, but a copy of every rambling post from his blog, loosely sorted into general themes. If he had made any real effort of condensing the material into an actual book, it would have been far more enjoyable and might have actually reached some form of cogent thesis.Yudkowsky is annoying and arrogant, constantly referencing how busy he is reading complicated math papers. He grandiloquently proclaims how it is his moral duty to bring the noble cause of rationality to the people, but instead spends half the book taking pot shots at fundamentalist Christians and other easy targets. About one, he recounts, > ""Most people like this will pretend that they are much too wise to talk to atheists, but she was willing to talk with me for a few hours.”Perhaps it doesn’t occur to him that these people might not want to talk to him because he is a condescending asshole? Yudkowsky also authored Harry Potter and the Methods of Rationality, a fanfiction that explores what would happen if Harry Potter behaved intelligently and rationally. I disliked the book, because instead of being the paragon rationality as promised, Harry just comes off as a petulant little brat. At the time I assumed that his immaturity was simply a plot device, but now as I read Rationality, I got the uneasy feeling that this is how Yudkowsky views himself, and thinks he is better for it.I was determined not to let my personal distaste stand in the way of learning, but once again, it just wasn’t worth it and I could not bring myself to finish it.Final ThoughtsOne of the first arguments in the book is that rationality is not the same thing as it is portrayed in Hollywood. Unlike the cold spock archetype, rationality and emotion can coexist. I agree with this premise in general, but I’d still argue that Yudkowsky’s shortcoming is his lack of empathy. The extremely high rating of the book on goodreads seems to be due to the fact that only his cult following has picked it up. Maybe if he had given the reader more thought, he could organize this book in a more accessible way and actually reach a wider audience.Favorite Quote“If you see your activities and situation originally, you will be able to originally see your goals as well. If you can look with fresh eyes, as though for the first time, you will see yourself doing things that you would never dream of doing if they were not habits.”"
4,1939311152,http://goodreads.com/user/show/26518817-gleb-posobin,5,"Whew, I have finally finished “Rationality: from AI to Zombies” by Eliezer Yudkowsky, which is a collection of his posts from overcomingbias.com and lesswrong.com, organized in “sequences” — sequences of posts on the same topic.What does it mean to be rational? Why is that a good idea to act rationally? What prevents us from making optimal decisions? How can we fix ourselves? Do we even need fixing if we feel happy? Why “rationalists” are not more successful than other people?This large collection of essays explores huge number of questions, including the ones above. It will help you understand human brain, evolution, quantum mechanics, foundations of science, probability theory a little bit better, and will likely let you see some of these topics in a new light. I even want now to get understanding of physics, the desire I remember experiencing last time about five years ago.Also, thanks to this book there are more than 15 new titles on my to-read list.I seriously consider this to be the most useful and thought-provoking book I’ve read (admittedly, my sample of books is rather small, but still)."
5,1939311152,http://goodreads.com/user/show/16212136-peter-pete-mcloughlin,5," Imagine a bunch of blog posts the almost the length of the bible but scintillating, humorous, and inciteful, and original. I enjoyed this book quite a bit and learned many new things from it. I don't know if I buy everything in them but I enjoyed the exploration and mental workout they provided. It covers rationality, AI, consciousness, Many Worlds Interpretation, ethics, and an autobiographical bit by the author. The writing style is very engaging if sprawling. I recommend to anyone who likes new ideas. Warning there is some opinionated polemic but mostly interesting stuff."

7,1939311152,http://goodreads.com/user/show/26066459-jesper,5,"Do you consider yourself rational? Do you think being rational is important? After reading this book, my answers to these questions are ""not very much at all"" and ""it's the most important thing in the world"". More than anything I've read before, this book gives me the sense of being important, in a way that if more people read this book and get it then the world would be a much, much nicer place to live.So, what's this book about? Like the title says, it handles the subject of rationality - not the Hollywood stereotype of the emotionless 'rational' person, but rationality as the Art of actually archieving your goals, or 'systematized winning' as the author puts it. Rationality in this sense is not merely some personality trait, but a MORAL imperative if you're serious about doing as much Good as possible (as the book argues much more in-depth).The topics of the book are very broad: they range from cognitive biases, Bayesian statistics, and the nature of intelligence to politics, religion, science, evolution, AI, philosophy, quantum mechanics, and morality. The common element in all these topics is that Yudkowski uses each of them to point out the ways in which our usual way of thinking leads us astray and how to undertake the difficult task of becoming more rational (i.e. actually winning at life!). Perhaps the best thing about this book is how it regularly it will completely shatter your beliefs about each of the subjects it touches (or at least for me it did). Yudkowski's writing style is very direct and animated, but he's not afraid to get technical when required. I'm a big fan of his writing but I've heard of other people that they absolutely can't stand it. So it's probably best if you just read something by him and judge for yourself.Perhaps the greatest point of critique I have against the book is that while reading it may fill you with the need to become more rational, it doesn't mean you automatically become more rational as a consequence. But that's not the fault of the book, but just a sign that this stuff is incredibly hard! There really should be more opportunities to train your rationality skills in practice, something Yudkowski also talks about in the final parts of the book.There's also a few other things I didn't like (though I don't consider them deal-breakers in the slightest):- The book (actually 6 books in one) is very long: 1750 pages is nothing to sneeze at. Though even just reading the first part would be worthwhile.- The book is basically an edited collection of blog posts, this means it often jumps from one topic to another or conversely repeats a point many times.- The author rants a lot about religion. It's understandable given his background, but for someone who's already an atheist living among other atheists it gets boring after a while. In conclusion, I think the ideas in this book can (and should!) be presented in a more universally compelling and accessible way. But that shouldn't stop you from reading it, as there currently is nothing else quite like it. It may very well be the most important thing you read in your life!To finish this review, here are some of my favorite quotes: ""If what you believe doesn't depend om what you see, you've been blinded as effectively as by poking out your eyeballs.""""If science is a religion, it is the religion that heals the sick and reveals the secrets of the stars.""""The world's greatest fool may say the sun is shining, but that doesn't make it dark out."" ""You cannot obtain more truth for a fixed proposition by arguing it. To improve our beliefs, we must necessarily change our beliefs.""""There is never an idea so true that it's wrong to criticize any argument that supports it.""""That which can be destroyed by the truth should be.""""When the basic problem is your ignorance, clever strategies for bypassing your ignorance lead to shooting yourself in the foot.""""The truly important problems are often the ones you're not even considering, because they appear to be impossible, or, um, actually difficult, or worst of all, not clear how to solve.""""It is written nowhere in the math of probability theory that one may have no fun."""
8,1939311152,http://goodreads.com/user/show/59340194-hamish-seamus,5,"I learned a lot of really good stuff from this book. I learned that the entropy of statistical mechanics and the entropy of information theory are fundamentally the same thing. I learned that the many world's interpretation of quantum mechanics is a more natural way of understanding the Schrodinger equation than the Copenhagen interpretation, but it isn't clear how to get Born statistics in MWI. I learned that it's easier to use Bayes' Rule using ratios than using percentages. I learned about a ton of heuristics and biases. I learned about how to make Occam's Razor mathematically precise. I learned that if you subscribe to objectivist meta-ethics you are susceptible to ""if killing babies was the right thing to do, would you do it?"" arguments. I learned to be suspicious of mysterious answers to mysterious questions. I learned that you need to have a more powerful epistemology than science in order to get anywhere in life. I learned that certainty of a proposition commits you to never changing your mind about it. I learned that a couple of hundred years ago evolution gave better predictions of the age of the world than did physics. The difference between intensional and extensional definitions. The list goes on.Yudkowsky is very intelligent, very well read, and has a strong drive to understand the world as deeply as possible. His writing can go in any of a hundred directions, and wherever it goes you're certainly going to learn something interesting and probably something useful. He's also a very engaging writer. I really enjoyed two of his sci-fi/fantasy works: HPMOR and Three Worlds Collide. The guy knows how to create narratives which are so weird and yet compelling that you can feel your imagination expanding from them. And he can wrap up non-fiction with a true narrative with the same awesome quasi-mystical weirdness which makes you want to sign right on up to his worldview. And yet, I have a hard time saying that this is a good book. The thing is, when Yudkowsky wants to make a point he just goes on and on and on and on. The best example of this is the sequence on quantum mechanics. He starts the sequence by promising to provide an intuitive guide to a subject which is so often taught so that the students are as confused by the subject matter as the original researchers into the phenomena were. Great! However, after a couple of essays, he seems to get sidetracked into raving about how mainstream physics is being stupid in not embracing the many worlds interpretation, and then spends 90% of the sequence just making that argument from every possible angle (when one angle would have quite sufficed). Who is he writing this for? No outsider is going to be convinced that this guy with no formal qualifications is right when the rest of the physics establishment is wrong. Is the whole thing directed at physicists? Then why did he say he was going to explain QM in an intuitive way at the start. And oh God is it long. So much longer than it needs to be. Which is a real shame. Because it would be one of the best books I've ever read if about half of it was cut out. As it stands it would maybe still make the top ten, but it's very much a love-hate relationship. I also spent a lot of the time while I was reading this book oscillating between thinking that Yudkowsky has all the answers, and thinking that he's a crackpot. ""If all this apparently super interesting and useful stuff is true,"" I kept thinking ""then why haven't I come across it anywhere else, and why isn't it academic mainstream?"" Well towards the end of the book I came to realise that a large part of this book is just Yudkowsky synthesising the views of a bunch of very smart modern, cutting-edge academics. This both made the whole thing a lot more palatable, and somewhat (but not a whole lot) less impressive. In sum, this is the kind of book which can legitimately change your life for the better, but it really needs a good trim, and should be more explicit about where the ideas come from."
9,1939311152,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5917740-nilesh,4,"This long, long, long, blog collection in the name of a book has countless flaws, but its biggest achievement is it makes one think.I should modify that: it makes its readers think based on where sciences and technologies are today. If one picks up any philosopher from previous centuries, their work might appear much more structured, pathbreaking, readable and/or comprehensive but almost always misguided based on what we know today. To learn something even from the best works of the greatest of all time, one needs to bin far too much and reinterpret the rest as the work based on the knowledge available at the times of these thinkers is proven almost decidedly inadequate if not wrong with the scientific progress of recent decades. Most recent era ""philosophers"" still spend far more time trying to improve on the fundamentals of these greats, rather than Mr Yudkowsky who has no space even to mention any Aristotle, or Kant or Nietzche and likes (not wholly true as there are occasional mentions).A collection of blog does not make a good book. The hundreds of chapters are disjointed and repetitive in equal measure all through. The short length articles are great in negating various theories, while one never gets a full description of the author's own construct. The author is at his best in shooting down what he deems as wrong ideas, although many of the gaps in his own thesis are never addressed. The repetitiveness is worse than one may have come across in any book, as blog articles themselves were rarely edited by any professional, but what is more egregious is almost no selection in the collection (arguments repeat in toto as many as ten or more times in certain cases). As the book progresses, one sees the author's own idea evolution (a term he hates for little reason outside the Darwinian sphere like some other including ""emergence"" while preferring identical terms like ""reductionism"") where he seems to be contradicting some arguments he made earlier. There is nothing wrong in one's idea development, as the author vividly describes in the book, except that consistency within a single volume is generally helpful!These are trifles, in a way. This reviewer has developed his own theory of ""rationality"" as a result of all the thinking he was forced to do. The description below - completely my own - is a result of the book and not representative of the author's views in any form or shape. Some may find that useful - to the extent they are understandable. The arguments are basic and need more refinement, but worth putting down here in case they make anyone think more.To start with, I am not a professional ""thinker"". Neither have I spent time writing this down formally, without errors, or to encompass many situations that would not fit the model below. Yet, what I intend to show is the limitations of rationality, the reasons behind reductionism/emergence, why we will always need philosophers and a few other things the book does not mention.""Rationality"" in a way is Domain-specific. Say, it is possible for one to start with a set of givens G1. And, one has an analytical G1-independent process toolset T1. In the world we live in, G1/T1 interactions could explain many more things in a domain D1. However, the domain explained is limited and the rationales behind G1/T1 are unfathomable. Over time, G1/T1 could expand and more could be explained, but the domain explained is only a small sub-set of the vast reality we have. Those who learn from the reality to believe in such G's, T's and D's where they exist, work in their improvements and manipulations to improve our existence are rationals.  For example, the toolset could include the Bayesian methods, all math equations and similar while one is working on the quarks and basic particles along with fields (the givens G-set) to explain the domain that would explain a proton or a neutron. Yet, the quarks will not explain our politicians, or the evolution of life, or the oceans or even a hydrogen atom. To explain elements, one needs a different givens like protons and neutrons and possibly different tools. Like to explain the characteristics of a river or an ocean flow, the givens cannot be hydrogen or oxygen atoms or even water molecules. Same goes if one tries to explain human choices or Big Bang or the working of a plane.There are thousands of domains, and there are huge gaps in our knowledge in the form of how or why these domains emerge and gaps between them. What works within these domains is always baffling, and not just with equations like the quantum theory or the workings of our DNA or mind. We have to simply take reality as given and develop those paths where we ""understand"" more and more of ""domains"" with those Gs and Ts. Gs and Ts need not be a small set. They need not be simple. Like they need not be deterministic. Here is why rationality is bounded itself. Why quarks combine to produce a proton of a totally different characteristics, why a water molecule has no resemblance to its constituents, why the DNA works the way it works - the number of such questions remain infinite - not just what came before the Big Bang or could happen eventually. This is why those who try to fill those knowledge gaps with their own narratives, be they religious leaders, philosophers, dreamers or even rationalists, should not be grudged. Over time, most such narrative-based explanations will appear hopelessly simple, but few could simply be agnostic to everything not fully covered by some such Ds, Ts, and Gs.In other words, rationality itself is based on reality which is anything but rational. Those of us who are quick to damn the romantics or the religious have our own numerous simplistic ""ideas"" whose underlying assumptions we bury in a mountain of unsubstantiated arguments. One does not need to forgive or ignore every hopeless narrative-based idea or thinker, but equally one does not need to be completely dismissive either. The framework presented here could make one more tolerant of belief in ""consciousness"" as a given in explaining many human affairs. It would explain why ""emergence"" is an important way to describe suddent appearances of domains and their limited applicabilities (from quarks, one cannot go to DNAs for example). Most importantly, this could prove a good framework to understand what machines can learn and what they cannot completely on their own, and the givens they will need.The above framework may not have any use. But, the book made me think. This will be the case for most who go through this turgid volume. In fact, the above is just one of the tens of times the author made me think of something new or say ""aha"" at something he presented. "

There is a certain sort of person that is excited by applied rationality and I've only met one of those people outside of something like Hacker News or the Less Wrong mailing lists. You should read this book, it could change your life and the way you look at the world, just like it changed me.Maybe you'd prefer Harry Potter and the Methods of Rationality. Yes, it's fanfic, and it's totally ruined the canon HP stories for me. But given my experiences, you probably won't be into it for reasons I completely fail to understand.This book pulls together many of the great blog posts from Eliezer (see https://wiki.lesswrong.com/wiki/Seque...). It's great to have them in a single collection I can read easily on my Kindle. They're probably better in a web context though, where you can jump around a lot and easily review previous ideas.I have this crazy belief that you should find these ideas supremely compelling. It's crazy because all available evidence points to you not enjoying it. I think you should try anyway; I'd be happy to learn that I was wrong."

Want an intro to these ideas that's more of the fanfiction sort? Start with Harry Potter and the Methods of Rationality, and see if at the end of it you don't want to get started on being more of your own Harry. Or start instead with Thinking Fast and Slow, a survey of many overlapping insights about how we think and how to think better, by the Nobel prize-winning father of the field himself, and the admitted source for a lot of Eliezer's views.

You probably have an opinion already formed. I don't know what it would be like going into this book with preconceived notions. I somehow managed to not hear about Rationalists, Yudkowski, or most of his ideas - though I had read Superintelligence by Bostrom.Anyway, I couldn't shut up about this book the whole time I was reading it. Which was quite a while, because it is a comically large book. However, it manages to stay engaging the whole way. I like the format - a series of essays, connected by repeating themes. I recommend it to the same people that I recommend Gödel, Escher, Bach. Smart people."
19,1939311152,http://goodreads.com/user/show/34440174-rodrigo-sampaio,2,"Disclaimer: I did not finish this “book.” I stopped nearly half-way after realizing how much was still left. Much of the other commonly-found criticisms on the low-rating reviews seem to me spot-on, so if you’ve read enough of them and already feel discouraged, my review can be skipped to the very last paragraph. To start: this is not a book, at least not in the traditional/expected sense. It’s a huge collection of essays that leads to a very long and clumsy compilation, full of redundancy and unnecessary parts. Actually writing a book might have yielded a good result.I picked it up because I listened to the author’s somewhat insightful (though similarly condescending) interview with Sam Harris, and because I am very committed to rationality, so I was looking forward to a good “catch-all” on the topic. The good average rating further encouraged me.Like other low-rating reviewers, however, after reading some of it I was surprised by the book’s high rating. Not that genuinely liking it is impossible, but one would guess that not many people would embark on such a long journey without some prior intention of liking it or an unyielding reverence to the author, so maybe that accounts for half of it.For those already reasonably secure about their rational being, however, his form of writing takes away the motivation to plough through his huge maze of self-referencing essays. The author is (irritantly) condescending, (intentionally?) complicated, and conveys a (constant) need to assert himself as uncannily smart and privy to thinking’s hidden secrets. What could have been a golden collection of great insights was turned into a painful treasure hunt.One has to cut through pages of often boring, always unnecessarily complicated writing to find interesting points and insights (my highlights are available, for whatever it’s worth, so I’m not summarizing them here). At some point, however, I just felt the treasure was not worth the hunt, and if I lost some hidden pearl later in the book, well, so be it.A humanely-sized 300-page book (as opposed to over 2k) would have captured the same knowledge in way more compact form, a stark contradiction to the author’s own praise for short/efficient coding. For anyone interested in the overall topic of rationality, there are certainly tons of better sources to go for, and taking a look at the book’s own references would help identifying them.But one word of support: some of the low-rating reviewers take issue with the occasional criticism of religion as if this were a core reappearing theme, but I don’t think this is a fair assessement vis-à-vis the irrational nature of religion and its entirely justifiable status as rationality’s attack victim. I found the references to it rather balanced and on-point, so if that’s the only thing preventing you from trying, read on!"

These essays are fumbling attempts to put into words lessons that would be better taught by experience. But at least there’s underlying math, plus experimental evidence from cognitive psychology on how humans actually think. Maybe that will be enough to cross the stratospherically high threshold required for a discipline that lets you actually get it right, instead of just constraining you to interesting new mistakes.

everyone needs to learn at least one technical subject. Physics; computer science; evolutionary biology; or Bayesian probability theory, but something. Someone with no technical subjects under their belt has no referent for what it means to ""explain"" something. They may think ""All is Fire"" is an explanation.
A very modern sort of rationalism, with buckets of scientific insights and a few genuine innovations* unified into a grand theory of reason and action: probability theory + decision theory. An ongoing concern. Yudkowsky’s writing suffers from this thing where we incorporate the ideas, but everyone begrudges the insight they glean from him and forget they thought otherwise. This is perhaps because his site carried a heavy pall of nerdiness (fan-fiction and Streisanding), a status deficit which prevents people from according the ideas their actual merit. His dismissive attitude to high-status people and ideas also drives a lot of people crazy, sometimes making them unable to care if the ideas are right. So we minimise his contribution to the life of the new mind, some of the brightest prospects in the dark world. This is unfair but the new mind is the main thing, and broader than him already.The section intros by Rob Bensinger, written a decade later, are helpful, but this book may need refreshing every decade, because of the replication crisis. This is no insult.*Some of Yudkowsky's new ideas (not the mere popularisations): 	 The abstract research chain into FAI: i.e. logical uncertainty, tiling, corrigibility, value learning. The leading academic textbook on AI gives a full page to his ideas. 	 Pascal's mugging (see final footnote here). 	 A new completeness theorem in probabilistic logic, discussed by a big-name mathematical physicist here. 	 The term ""Friendly AI"" 	 Probably the first to tie the Jaynesian probability calculus plus the Heuristics and Biases program plus rule-utilitarianism.  "
24,1939311152,http://goodreads.com/user/show/13386331-denis-vasilev,5,"Excellent book on rationality. Very long read, densely packed with ideas. "
25,1939311152,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5185619-scott-wozniak,3,"The first half of this book was amazing. He managed to get very deep and profound on what it means to think rationally--and still be engaging and witty at the same time. I was anticipating a five star review. And then a little past halfway into the book he began to attack religion/faith. Whole chapters are devoted to the fallacy of faith, with most of the focus on the irrationality of Christianity/the Bible. I don't take away stars from the rating for believing differently than me. I fault him for the tragic violation of his own principles. Example: He teaches about the confirmation bias, how we look for evidence that supports our belief and ignore the evidence that doesn't. Then (much later) he says the Old Testament couldn't be true because the Egyptian records don't mention the Jews at all, going so far as to say that the Old Testament of the Bible is bogus history. In the process, he is ignoring a massive amount of archeological finds that have validated the Old Testament's history. In fact, the Old Testament of the bible has been used many, many times by even secular archeologists to help locate validated ancient sites. Modern historians may argue over the miracles in the bible, but very few doubt the historical data because there are so many validated records and finds supporting it. But the author fixated on a single piece that supported his view (and that was a lack of evidence, not evidence to the contrary).There are more examples, such as how he has an early chapter on how it's rational to create mental models for things we can't see directly (e.g. atomic structure). But then later he scoffs at those who believe in a reality that can't be seen directly. Or how he presents all people of faith like the guy at a cocktail party who couldn't answer his philosophical challenges with clarity (an ad hominum failure).Sad to see his passion to debunk religion destroying his rationality."
26,1939311152,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7653366-adarsh-rao,0,"When I started this book for the first time, 2 years ago, I found answers to questions I didn't even know I had. Moments from high school where something didn't make sense but I couldn't quite put a pin on what it was or what was wrong about it. Moments from my childhood where some particular train of thought did not make sense.So much of my thinking laid bare, expressed so eloquently.So much of the way I think now, I find, leads back to ideas I've read from this book. I never fully internalized these ideas. I never fully 'understood' them. But traces of them linger on and permeate a lot of my thoughts. Eliezer warns that it is extremely dangerous to be half-Rationalist. And that remains my biggest worry. I yearn for people who I can spar with to improve myself at this art. I yearn for Rationalist Dojo's where I would get to practice this. I've strongly recommended this to a lot of my friends, ~10+ people, but it hasn't caught on with ANY of them. I'm not sure why. This book mattered to me because I care about the truth, curiosity is important to me. ""Yearn to see the world as you clearly can."" YMMV.I've gotten immense clarity out of this book, even if I've not really practiced much of the art outside of this. I intend to.I'm extremely thankful that this book exists in this world. Thank you Eliezer for writing this."
27,1939311152,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11936064-djcb,4,"Eliezer Yudkowsky bundled his many blogpost (overcomingbias.com, lesswrong.org) on the Art of Rationality in a book. I had read quite a few of the blog-posts before (perhaps half?), but it's nice to have them all in one place.Yudkowsky's big project is building a Friendly Artificial Intelligence. That is, an artificial intelligence that provably beneficial to mankind (by some measure), and even inspect and improve its own source code while keeping the ""friendliness"" intact. It's a really difficult problem. In the context of that, Yudkowsky tries to understand intelligence, epistemology, ethics, ... -- esp. the first parts of the book are pretty much ""philosophy through the eyes of a computer programmer"". The latter part of the books shows a bit more... ""mature"" Yudkowsky, aware of his limitations. The core of his ideas are baysianism -- starting from the basic P(H|E)=P(E|H)P(H)/P(E)  to a meta-method of science, following Ockham's Razor (i.e., minimizing Kolmogorov Complexity). Now, does this all make sense? Sure, it does, very much so. It's more than just another way of looking at the world; it's pretty much the way, given a few basic assumptions. But that makes this a good book? Well, there's a lot of good stuff. There's also quite a bit of repetition, meandering etc., and the books is really a bundle of blog posts, which could use a bit more structure and quite a bit of culling / editing. "
28,1939311152,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6766462-franta,4,"Update: I did not finish the book as I got fed up with Yudkowsky intellectual masturbation...Beware: it is a bit ""never ending"" book. Yudkowsky goes on and on about problems with General AI, getting deep into meta level, making it a niche expert-level material.This is composed of 6 ""standard""-sized books. The quality and style are rather consistent throughout, but the topics change - from basics of bayesian reasoning, human biases, to science of cognition, ethics, philosophy, decision science, mostly in relation to AI development.The first maybe a third is recommended reading for most rationalist, it is basically a Bayesian probability reasoning applied to everything, especially to human decision making, which is mostly faulty... It is witty and funny as well as practical.The second half of the book that deals with AI philosophy and ethics topics is just not that interesting as I am neither an AI researcher nor a philosopher.Overall, it is a great, witty, fun and readable book, though it surely could be distilled to maybe half the size.The first half is definitely 5 star material, but I rate the second 3.5 stars as it's a very niche topic and it would be better to release it as a separate book for a different audience.I enjoyed the audio version, which is narrated well."
29,1939311152,http://goodreads.com/user/show/41337133-jorge-rodighiero,4,"A 1813 pages course about the ""art to finding the truth and accomplishing value from inside a human mind"" To accomplish this, Yudkowsky helps us ""to learn our own flaws, overcome our biases, prevent ourselves from self-deceiving, get ourselves into good emotional shape to confront the truth and do what needs doing"""
30,1939311152,http://goodreads.com/user/show/12115505-mona-m-abd-el-rahman,4,"This book is a collection of blog posts. To enjoy this kind of books, you need to be able to enjoy a dense collection of non-linearly organized thoughts.The first two parts of this book are about rationality. This book contains many, many examples of ways in which you can trick yourself into believing an illogical argument, or leave a mental conclusion in place that really should be overturned on closer inspection. I think the author overrates rationality. Rationality is a great root philosophy when you need to determine whether a statement is true or false, or when you need to pick between a small number of clearly delineated choices. But often you need to take action when the space of possibilities is quite vast, or make a decision where your data is all so fuzzy and poorly categorized that reductionist offers little practical help. I suspect there are cases where human biases are actually really good for you, despite being irrational.The other four parts goes into three areas and tries to take a hyper-Bayesian methodology to get a rational approach for each of them. Quantum mechanics, evolutionary psychology, and the author’s personal life.The discussion of quantum mechanics is focused on whether the “many worlds” interpretation of quantum mechanics is correct, as opposed to the “waveform collapse” theory. The author’s stance is that not only is the “many worlds” theory correct, but it is so clearly correct that the fact that many people don’t agree with “many worlds” shows that they are insufficiently rational.The evolutionary psychology discussion is similar. Yudkowsky claims that scientists are constantly hoping for evolution to favor morality, which leads to a bias in favor of more pleasant interpretations. The underlying claim is that for unsettled areas of science, there is still one rational interpretation that is superior, and if scientists disagree on how to interpret findings on the frontier of science, it is because they are not rational enough.The author frequently cites Aumann’s agreement theorem - that two perfectly rational people with the same knowledge cannot disagree. Therefore in practice two rationalists should not disagree. It seems like the thing for them to do is to argue incessantly, and if they cannot come to an agreement then each should conclude that the other is not rational enough. That feels a bit wrong.The last section of the book discusses more personal issues and the trouble with growing this rationalist movement. Yudkowsky mentions he has trouble “getting things done” and he also has trouble getting groups of people to work together. To me, both of these seem like problems with what I would colloquially describe as “overthinking it”."
31,1939311152,http://goodreads.com/user/show/83724534-simran-singh,3,"Actually, it is not one single book, but instead six books rolled into one. And, to be more precise, it is the the comprised totality of the author's blog posts in Overcoming Bias and Less Wrong which he wrote during the late half of the '00s and which have since given birth to a community dedicated to living their lives rationally and promoting rationalistic ideas around the world.The book itself is comprised of six books with varying themes (disclaimer: they are merely my own understanding of what the parts are about, and only comprise a fraction of their contents):I: Map and Territory'What is rationality?'What does it really mean to be rational?''Why is is valuable to care about the truth?'II: How to Actually Change Your Mind'How do I become rational?''How do I avoid the pitfalls along the way?''What are the basic tools I should master?'III: The Machine in the Ghost'Why is it that human beings have not evolved into fully rational thinkers?''How do the neural networks in our brain work?'IV: Mere Reality'How to observe and live in the one universe that actually is there?''How does science work?''What is quantum physics and why should I care?'V: Mere Goodness'How to rationally investigate ethics?''What is valuable?''How to be human as efficiently as possible?'VI: Becoming Stronger'How can I put this into practice?''Where do I muster the strength to keep improving myself?'What does it mean to be rational? Why is that a good idea to act rationally? What prevents us from making optimal decisions? How can we fix ourselves? Do we even need fixing if we feel happy? Why “rationalists” are not more successful than other people? These are some of the basic questions the basic attempts to tackle. This large collection of essays explores huge number of questions, including the ones above. It explores human brain, evolution, quantum mechanics, foundations of science, probability theory a little bit better, and will likely let you see some of these topics in a new light. Reading this book made me suffer a twinge of regret for not pursuing Physics in my undergrad. For it is in the glorious, dull, nuanced details of a discipline does it beauty shines. However, in parts, there is a slight condescension visible, taking pot shots at orthodox Christians and other easy targets. A bit of needless meandering and ramble of self serving vacuous flaunts. The topics explored are too fundamental and important, so criticism dwarfs, relatively. Do give it a read. "

The book consists of 333 blog posts, divided into 6 ""books"" on different, but related topics, all leading up to rationality, and so I read blog posts slowly over time, and I have to say, it was worth every minute.If you are curious about the topic of rationality, this is, in my opinion, a good book to start on the topic.I plan to re-read parts of it which have faded from my memory over the course of these two years, and I plan to recommend this book to every curious fellow I know.I don't want to take this book up as the ""Holy Book"" or the Bible of rationality, as Eliezer puts it himself:I drew on multiple sources to create my Art. I read many different authors, many different experiments, used analogies from many different fields. You will need to draw on multiple sources to create your portion of the Art. You should not be getting all your rationality from one author—though there might be, perhaps, a certain centralized website, where you went to post the links and papers that struck you as really important. And a maturing Art will need to draw from multiple sources. To the best of my knowledge there is no true science that draws its strength from only one person. To the best of my knowledge that is strictly an idiom of cults. A true science may have its heroes, it may even have its lonely defiant heroes, but it will have more than one.So, I will continue by reading more sources on the subject, sources suggested by Eliezer, and other sources he might not even touched upon. I need to broaden my domain of sources to avoid bias, and this is one line of rational thought I've learned from this book.The book is available online for free: https://www.readthesequences.com/, go on and start it, even if slowly."
33,1939311152,http://goodreads.com/user/show/33717713-galen,4,"I'm really on the fence about this book.On the one hand, it's unevenly written. It's pretty repetitive in some parts, and wonderfully spare in others. While this unevenness is probably a product of its initial creation (as a series of blog posts on lesswrong and overcomingbias), it's still a major problem with the book. It's also, at times, distractingly 'Eliezer Yudkowsky'-ish. It leans heavily on a set of experiences and patterns of thought that are frequently frustrating and occasionally overbearing. The core material is good, but it's hard to access in parts. I abandoned this book a number of times before finally white-knuckling to the end, and 'annoying presentation' was to blame.On the other hand, it's one of the best textbooks on 'Applied Rationality' available. In some sections, it's really the *only* textbook available. Inasmuch as the ideas tied up in the applied rationality movement have changed and improved my life, Yudkowsky's work probably deserves quite a bit of credit.Like a lot of other reviewers, I recommend that you reads Book I ('Map and Territory') and II ('How to Actually Change Your Mind') and then skim/skip the rest. "
34,1939311152,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2523859-mike,4,"The founding Bayesian rationalist text (not to be confused with the rationalism of Descartes and Spinoza – Bayesian rationalism subsumes both rationalism and empiricism).Written in a style reminiscent of Seneca's letters, yet far more ambitious. It may sound like an exaggeration, but this is easily the best book I know of (and I've read dozens of great ones) on how to think: how to think clearly about complex problems, how to reason under uncertainty, and how to do so despite running on flawed human hardware. While the Bayesian rationalist viewpoint is not everything, I would not recommend attempting to go beyond it (into postrationalism or, if you must, postmodernism) without a firm intuitive grasp on the fundamentals.Only four stars because the book is considerably longer than it needs to be, and also because many of the examples and phrasings are awkward. Yudkowsky is a skilled writer; a good editor would turn this into a masterpiece.A note on the machine learning examples: this was written before deep learning really started to take off around 2012, so many of the ""neural networks"" described look a little odd. But the conclusions hold up well."
35,1939311152,http://goodreads.com/user/show/72152423-stephan-t-ahonen,4,"The first half of the book is an amazingly revealing and insightful set of essays about cognitive biases, harmful patterns of thought, and changing your beliefs in response to evidence.My most significant criticism of the first half of the book is that it can seem very repetitive, as it was originally written as a series of self-contained essays rather than as a single coherent work. I can forgive this.The second half of the book is ""now that I've told you how to think, I'm going to tell you *what* to think,"" and that's where it turned into a chore to me as I found myself quite frequently disagreeing using ideas and techniques that I'd been taught earlier in the very same book.The last few chapters are autobiographical and were not interesting to me in the slightest, and at that point I was coasting into the home stretch just to be able to say I read the whole thing.I think everybody should read the first half of this book. It starts going downhill in Book IV or so, and is barely worth reading once it starts talking about Quantum Mechanics."
36,1939311152,http://goodreads.com/user/show/30128202-alex-baldwin,4,"It took quite a long time to finish reading Rationality. The chapters are quite short essays, most of which are taken from the authors blog. Each chapter causes you to pause and reflect on a short lesson or mind bending rationality problem. The footnotes and bibliography are exhaustive and will make you want to branch out your research to dive into the source material. You have to be profoundly interested in rationality to make it through the whole book. There's not really a way to shorten or summarize it even. My Kindle notes are a small tome by themselves. I'm taking away a keen sense of how a rationalist solves problems and the worldview of a deeply obsessed AI researcher. There's nothing else like it and I loved it. "
37,1939311152,http://goodreads.com/user/show/12470817-kazu-otani,5,"Great read on the theme of ""how to think"", which draws from / goes on tangents into evolutionary psychology, probability theory, decision theory, quantum physics. Highly recommended. I was intimidated by the thought of reading ~1800 pages, so I listened to this on audiobook which took 44 hours. Because this book is a collection of blog posts, ideas are repeated multiple times through different blog posts, and I feel that this allowed me to absorb a larger portion of the material than the ""higher level skim"" I usually get with audiobooks. Still had to go back and read some of the more complicated posts, as well as the ones that involved figures. This book is a lot to absorb, and I think I need to do another listen/read-through to really understand everything. "
38,1939311152,http://goodreads.com/user/show/69752012-jeffery,3,"I found the central theme in the book to be on skepticism - how to know what to believe. The solution proposed was to check facts, think more, and think harder. The book was very wordy and the author sometimes quite ostentatious, but it had quite a few deep thoughts and questions. Like all good books, quite eye-opening, but don't expect the book to change the way you think and live. My biggest gripe with the book is its length; things are stated, restated, and restated again without change. There are summary ""chapters"" of summary ""chapters"". A lot of cutting needs to be done in order for it to be considered a book. "
39,1939311152,http://goodreads.com/user/show/24181989-bruno-arine,4,"You think you're a rational person? Nope. Not until you read this.Writing a review about this book is inhumanly difficult. Firstly, because rather than a usual book with a tightly structured narrative, it's a compilation of articles written by Yudkowsky for the hive of the rationality online community known as Less Wrong. Secondly, it's got a gargantuan quantity of them; some are not as enticing as I'd like, but in general they are quite impressive. It's one of those books that make you reflect on the way you think and perceive the world, with a twist: you'll catch yourself mentally solving probability problems way more often after some time."
40,1939311152,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2704424-nick-klagge,3,"I enjoyed reading this, but wouldn't necessarily recommend it to most others. I got interested in it after reading Yudkowsky's excellent ""Harry Potter and the Methods of Rationality."" Like HPMOR, this book is excessively long, and pretty readable. (It was a great book to have on my e-reader on an international trip.) But, it's more or less just a loosely organized collection of blog posts. As such, although I enjoyed it while reading it, my recall of its content a couple of months later is fairly limited. HPMOR touches on basically the same themes, but in a much more structured and engaging (and therefore memorable!) way. "
41,1939311152,http://goodreads.com/user/show/71012801-pauli-taipale,4,"For me the useful stuff was in the books II & IV. Book I goal is to give the reader a proper mindset which motivates book II. Book II contains mostly ways to improve readers decision making. Rest of the books can be skipped if the specific topics are not relevant for you. Book IV is recommended if you are interested about research and want to use the methods of Book II in that context. (Book IV contains clear bias towards many worlds interpretation of quantum mechanics, should be taken with a grain of salt)"
42,1939311152,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7485119-yevgen-antymyrov,4,"I feel dumb when I say that I did not enjoy this book. Yes, I learned a lot from it, but I did not enjoy the format. It's a series of semi-organized essays with a lot of overlaps between them. Some essays were mind-blowing, others extremely boring. I did not read this book, I listen to the official podcast/audiobook edition. The quality of audio and narration is significantly lower than of HPMOR's. But still, it's free. It may seem like a negative review, but it's only because expectations were very high. If you are interested in human rationality and AI, you should give this book a try."
43,1939311152,http://goodreads.com/user/show/69917271-noam-gal,5,"Amazing book, skip all the fiction parts, especially the stories about the Bayesian conspiracy, those were basically a waste of time. Definitely keep in mind that this is a collection of essays and blogposts so it can be quite nonlinear and occasionally repetitive. However, many of the essays are extremely interesting and well written. I quite enjoyed this thorough exposure to Yudkowsky's thought."
44,1939311152,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1942198-tom,5,"Took awhile to complete, as it was easy to take breaks after sections. And some sections could have been omitted entirely (e.g. the lengthy detour into refuting p-zombies). But the lessons taught, and the mental shorthand established for certain phenomenon is as rich and generally applicable as anything I've ever read. The exhortations are stirring and the alternate rational world sketched is something to aspire to. Well worth a 50-hour investment."
45,1939311152,http://goodreads.com/user/show/100035343-priyan-p,2,"Not a thought provoking book at all despite it's implicit claim of putting a new pair of eyes on the topic. The book is stakes its claim by its technical breakdown but comes across as rather superfluous. That being said I am not surprised by the multitude of five star ratings, this book will have a certain appeal especially in engineering circles. For every subtle and complicated question there is a seemingly simple and straight forward answer , which is wrong."
46,1939311152,http://goodreads.com/user/show/17995285-yohan,5,"Holy shit, this is the the single most important thing I have ever read. I only want to understand more from it's pages . I don't think I have truly applied even 25% of what is covered here . I imagine that would take 3 years.I'm very grateful to ey for condensing all these thoughts. Most comprehensive and true guide to rationality I have ever seen."
47,1939311152,http://goodreads.com/user/show/22614612-caroline,3,"I was irritated they left the good parts out of the quantum sequence, which made me wonder whether the same thing happened in any other sequences I hadn't read already. An ebook was definitely a better format to read these in than just a bunch of blog posts, though. And I understand why they had to cut stuff."
48,1939311152,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9299757-gary-boland,3,"Front loaded with useful information on the different biases and how they affect our judgement, this mammoth book (2500 pages) is overlong and repetitive in places. Still, found it the be beneficial. I just wished the author (who is largely self-taught) had leveraged an editor before releasing this opus. "
49,1939311152,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5009680-qonita,4,"The first book is great but i can't stand his increasing cockiness starting from the second book. If you're alright with it, the book offers a lot of useful insight to fix our biased thinking. The exhausting 2000 pages might be quite discouraging, but even if it's not this book, i recommend everyone to read any book on rationality and logic. It's very enlightening."
50,1939311152,http://goodreads.com/user/show/52887656-charlie-de-c,4,"This was a slog, and an enormous time investment which felt ultimately worthwhile.Bad: A fair amount of repetition, an uber mathy section that was hard to follow on audiobook, so damn long.Good: mind blowingly genius moments of revelation, enables shifts in perspective, and picks apart your basis of critical thinking and rationality."
51,1939311152,http://goodreads.com/user/show/31775134-daniel,5,Don't go into this expecting concise philosophy. This book rambles. Each essay rambles. I read somewhere that if printed by normal standards it would be somewhere between 1 and 2 feet thick.This is possibly the book that every single human should read. This is the one book that has definitively shaped who I am for the better.
52,1939311152,http://goodreads.com/user/show/66600909-dan-ryan,5,"Must read for anybody that wants to improve their thinking. This book is gigantic though, so don't feel like you have to finish it before reading something else. It is split into many well organized related bite-sized essays with copious amounts of cross-links. Loved it!"
53,1939311152,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1559568-devon-fritz,4,"This book is super long and is a collection of rationality articles written on LessWrong. Although a lot of the core ideas are repeated throughout, there are many gems that you can take with you for a lifetime. I also found the parables to be well-written and entertaining in their own right."
54,1939311152,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5576926-david,2,"Whew, finished it (had it not been an audiobook, I would have tapped out). I really like Yudkowsky's fiction, but I found this to be a slog, even though it's on a collection of topics that I normally really like. 2.5 stars."
55,1939311152,http://goodreads.com/user/show/14010469-andrew-clough,5,Some parts (A Humans' Guide to Words) are clearly better than others (Becoming Stronger) but there are many things in here I found incredibly valuable when I first read them and it was worth re-reading in book form.
56,1939311152,http://goodreads.com/user/show/26750910-alexey,5,"Whoa, didn't expect this kind of experience but this book shattered a bunch of my beliefs. Bayes rule, belief in belief and task time resources estimation are completely new discoveries for me to name a few.Yep, now it's my favorite book"
57,1939311152,http://goodreads.com/user/show/23822203-danila-sentyabov,4,"It's more wordy than it should have been in more than one place, but I can't think of a better starting point for the quest of becoming more rational anyway."

59,1939311152,http://goodreads.com/user/show/15474029-panashe-m,4,"Essential reading for thinking people. It's a very long book, so it can certainly be a slog to finish."
