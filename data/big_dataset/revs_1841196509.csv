It was a wonderful listen. Lots of history, lots of philosophy, lots of maths and a sprinkling of science all narrated by one of the most pleasurable narrators I have listened to. There were parts that amazed me, parts that made me laugh, parts that made me sad and parts where I could not quite follow audibly and probably needed a diagram or the written book. While Brian Clegg is not the most awe inspiring and beautiful science writer out there, he is an under-appreciated work-horse kind of writer that consistently produces books that are fun, fascinating and accessible. Part of his style that I like is that he is so sensible. There are no large and outrageous claims in his books, they are based on well-researched and well-established material. Probably the best way I can put it is that he isn't out to write sexy books. To some this may seem boring, but to geeks like me it is refreshing and like a comfortable companion that is not out to prove anything, just to tell you a great yarn. Also his books are not aimed to be definitive volumes on the subject, he always refers the reader on to where they may find out more. These are more like a well-produced documentary, with interesting stories and overviews of deeper concepts.So once again Brian has produced an entertaining little volume. I'd recommend his works to both the layman and the professional. The layman gets an interesting introduction to the material and the professional find out many little interesting historical facts and stories along the way."

When I tell people this, they usually express surprise, saying something like, “Well, aren’t those very different subjects!”And it irks me so.They’re not, not really. Firstly, mathematics and English are both forms of communication. Both rely on the manipulation of symbols to tell a tale. As with writers of English, writers of mathematics have styles: some are elegant yet terse, seemingly expending little effort while getting their point across with an admirable economy of symbols; others are expansive and eloquent, elaborating at some length in order to furnish the reader with an adequate explanation. Secondly, as with English, mathematics is very much grounded in philosophy and history, and it is a subject that is open to deep, almost spiritual interpretation.If you balk at that last idea, don’t worry. You’ve probably had it drilled into your head since elementary school that in mathematics there is only one correct answer! How could such a reassuringly logical subject be open to interpretation? Despite its apparent objectivity, mathematics is just another human endeavour, and like all our mortal works, it is vulnerable to our flaws, foibles, and fits of passion. Mathematicians can be just as stubborn and argumentative, if not more, than other people. There are many famous follies and feuds in the history of mathematics, and that is one of the reasons I enjoy learning about it so much.Infinity is one of the mathematical concepts most central to those feuds. It’s one of the areas where math rubs up against the spiritual realm—for, as some mathematicians and philosophers have wondered, what is infinity if not God or some kind of greater being? So it seems natural to look at our shifting views on the infinite along the continuum of the history of maths. In A Brief History of Infinity, Brian Clegg does just that, following the classical, somewhat Eurocentric development of math from Greece to Rome, then zig-zagging down to the Middle East and India before flying back to Britain, France, and Germany.As with most tricky math concepts, the trouble with infinity begins with its definition. One must be very careful with definitions in math—for example, it is not enough merely to say that infinity means “goes on without end”. After all, the surface of the Earth has no “end”, but that does not mean the Earth has infinite surface area! Rather, the surface of the Earth is unbounded. Grasping the idea of infinity as “not finite” is easy enough, though: there is no “last” counting number, because you can always add one to the largest number you can conceive, and suddenly you have a new largest number. So infinity is a quicksilver of a concept: intuitive and easy to grasp, yet also elusive and far too fluid for some mathematicians to handle. The Greeks, with their mathematics strictly confined to the geometric figure, would have no dealings with the infinite. Infinity confused Galileo, who nevertheless bravely meditated upon it in his final days. And the shadow of infinity hangs over the controversy of the calculus that caused the divide between Newton and Leibniz, and correspondingly, between Britain and the Continent.The story of infinity gets even more interesting after that. In general, I love the history of mathematics during the 1700s and 1800s. So many brilliant minds pop up during that time: as Newton and Leibniz exit, Euler and Gauss enter. Later, Cauchy and Weierstrass formalize the concept of the limit, which does away with any need for infinity in calculus at all! There are plenty of names and plenty of stories—and this is where A Brief History of Infinity starts to lose its edge.The first few chapters of this book are fascinating. Clegg devotes a lot more space to the Greek philosophers than others might, going so far as to mention some of the more obscure ones, like Anaxagoras. He provides a considerably detailed development of Zeno’s paradox (well, paradoxes) and a nice, if basic, grounding in the idea of an infinite series. Clegg lays the ground well for what will come in later chapters, all the while emphasizing the reluctance of the Greek philosophers to abandon the solidity of numbers found in the real world.But as we get closer to those magical two centuries following the great Newton–Leibniz schism, the story of infinity gets more complicated as more people get involved. This book is very similar to 
Zero: The Biography of a Dangerous Idea
. In my review of Zero, I praised the author’s ability to stay focused:The story intersects with the lives of many famous mathematicians, but the obvious slimness of this book testifies that Seife managed to distill only what was necessary about their lives in his quest to explain the mystery of zero.To be fair to Clegg, this book is almost as slim as Zero. And although he happens to go off on many a tangent, he at least has the ability to find his way back on track quickly enough—that is, his tangents are interesting and informative. He sometimes seems to go into more detail than is strictly necessary to get the point across, and once in a while he waxes melodramatic—as is the case when he links Cantor’s madness to his study of infinity. Overall, however, Clegg’s writing is crisp and clear.I’m also impressed by the detail and depth of Clegg’s explanation of the math. He goes so far as to list and briefly elaborate upon each of the axioms of Zermelo-Fraenkel set theory! I was half expecting him to mention the Banach–Tarski paradox after that—he doesn’t quite get there, but he does explain the difference between ordinals and cardinals, develop the continuum hypothesis, and even mention Gödel’s Incompleteness Theorem. He tackles whether imaginary numbers are truly all they’re cracked up to be. And he even discusses nonstandard analysis—we didn’t even learn about that in university.Don’t let my awe scare you away, though. Rather, think of it like this: if you are not particularly mathematical and read this book, you will gain a wealth of knowledge. You will be fun at parties! If you are particularly mathematical, then depending on how much you like the history of math, you might already be familiar with most of these anecdotes. But the book will still be fun to read, and chances are you will learn at least one or two new things.So I would recommend A Brief History of Infinity to most people—perhaps not with the same zeal that I do Charles Seife’s Zero, but with a similar hope in mind. I hope this book, or at least my review of this book, demonstrates why I find math, as well as the history of math, so fascinating. It’s not just all about numbers, solving for x, and finding the One True Solution. Mathematics is a subject with a long and storied past, one that is fun to explore by looking at the humans who progressed—or regressed—throughout the centuries. A Brief History of Infinity is a book in this mould. While its organization and its focus leaves something to be desired, its scope and ambition do not.

Other than that maths just is not my strong point. But when a complete maths fool such as myself enjoys a book like this then there has to be something going for it. Infinity? Of course, how could there not be. Read and enjoy! "
3,1841196509,http://goodreads.com/user/show/13304810-peter-baran,3,"Not a bad overview of the history of infinity, though it sits on the fence a lot, and is a little prone to classic pop science micro biographies to limp along (hey here is Godel, he was brilliant but he was nuts...) Infinity is a subject I used to know a lot about, and since I have been out of the incomprehensible big stuff game I wondered if much new had come up. One bit of quantum computing aside, not really, and the book isn't strong on some of the philosophical implications, but it is a brief history."
4,1841196509,http://goodreads.com/user/show/101061320-mary,4,"This book was my break from the seemingly endless amount of novels waiting for me. I can't believe i let it gather dust in my bookcase for a year. It was a graphic guide on infinity for dummies. See, i am a whore for the logically absurd, you know... the whole shebang. So you can only imagine how i devoured this book. While reading some parts, my heart literally throbbed as if im reading the best romantic novel in the world (aka PnP). It was soooo interesting. It made me wanna delve deeper into the subject. It dabbed ideas of infinity from mathematics, science, philosophy, theology, etc- the ultimate crash course. I was introduced to some of the most important pioneers of, basically, all human knowledge present. From St. Augustine to Newton to Leibneiz to Hume to Turing to so on and so forth. To be honest though, i was hoping i'd see a female pioneer, but the author wasnt able to do so (even though there are lots of em). So.... I dont know... Anyways, I read it slowly on purpose because i wanted to suck it all in. I constantly stopped to write interesting topics on my commonplace book. I didnt want it to end immediately. I wanted more words. I wanted more explanations. Its just that good. Brian Clegg's writing wasnt too technical but it also wasnt unscholarly. It was, at times, humorous even. It wasnt one of those incomprehensible book for the brainwacks so extra points for that lol. Id love to add more but im currently dumbfounded. Maybe tomorrow : )"

Philosophers and mathematicians have gone insane contemplating its nature and complexity - yet it is a concept routinely used by schoolchildren.Presented by the renowned astronomer Heather Couper, these programmes take the listener on a journey with an endless audio horizon and feature contributions from musicians who write endless music; science fiction authors, who create infinite worlds and timeless beings; theologians; Buddhist lamas; astro-physicists and mathematicians.It is infinity... in a nutshell.Part One: Space and the Universe--------------------------------This first programme takes us outside the known universe, and tries to measure whether it has a beginning and end.If a star is a fixed number of light years away, how do we know if there is anything lurking beyond the stars which will not show itself to a human being on earth for several more light years? Are we more comfortable with the finite? Is this why we developed theories like Big Bang to explain things we don't know in sizes which we do know?A group of experts show how the human mind prefers to stop short of a total acceptance of the truly ""without end"".Supersize, it seems, has to stop somewhere! Part Two: Mathematics---------------------Imagine a hotel with an infinite number of rooms. Even if the hotel is completely full and there are no vacancies, another guest can be easily accommodated...This is just one of the fascinating insights that Heather Couper will be exploring in the second part of her quest to think the unthinkable.She is joined by mathematicians, psychologists, Sci Fi writers, theologians and a room full of monkeys to try and grasp a handle on how infinity can be seen in our world. The programme looks at how infinity has troubled some of the greatest minds and thinkers, with sometimes deadly consequences. We also learn how Infinity drove one such mathematician to the brink of sanity. Scary stuff indeed. But the entire concept of infinity in mathematics is maddening, and the deeper we go, the stranger the results become.Infinity has also played an important part in the arts. Heather explores the music of Steve Reich, Michael Nyman and Philip Glass to see how endless repetition has inspired these great composers.Join Heather on this tour of an endless audio horizon, where 1=0 and 2 is just a number bigger than 1.

6,1841196509,http://goodreads.com/user/show/55663930-simona,3,"Good book overall, but oftentimes the author manages to contradict himself in the same phrase or paragraph, and uses hopelessly confusing and sometimes inappropriate illustrations to get the point across. I wouldn't have understood him had I not encountered the concepts before, and he really lost me on the one thing I hadn't. And most annoyingly, mathematical concepts are so loosely used that would make serious mathematicians cringe - among many other things, calling irrational numbers ""irrational fractions"" was maddening. While toning it down so it would be readable and accessible to any interested person, it shouldn't have been so hard to keep it rigorous and mathematically correct. Besides, introducing new people and relating the story of their lives was done in such a way that you were wondering what could possibly be their connection to the subject, which makes the reading anything but smooth."
7,1841196509,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3452722-koen-crolla,2,"Poorly written, both as regards actual language use and overall structure. Clegg seems to be confused about what he's actually trying to communicate, and doesn't appear to be able to distinguish actual mathematicians (or proto-mathematicians) exploring the concept of infinity from crackpots merely abusing language.The result is something that lacks both a historical narrative and enough rigour to pass even as popular mathematics. And there's no shortage of better books on the same subject; just read Taming the Infinite or The Infinite Book or something instead."
8,1841196509,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6733229-bennett-coles,4,"This was a very interesting exploration of a concept we bandy around every day but have no real understanding of. By first exploring the philosophical and religious approaches through the millennia toward infinity, Mr. Clegg provided a surprisingly well-rounded view of humanity's quest to grasp the ungraspable. The mathematical and scientific approach to infinity eventually enters the story, and Mr. Clegg reveals that many today accept infinity as a useful tool in their calculations without really bothering to understand what it means. Infinity in modern physics is often treated like the ""weirdness"" of quantum physics: it makes no sense, but it works. This book doesn't offer (nor does it promise) a true understanding of infinity, but it is a fascinating look at how great minds try to tackle one of the many concepts that may be forever beyond human understanding."
9,1841196509,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3462402-aaron-humphrey,3,"This book is more about the people who thought about infinity than it is about infinity itself. As such, it's sort of an orthogonal projection of the history of science onto one particular subject, so it includes Newton vs. Leibniz and the infinitesimals and limits of calculus, as well as the feud between Cantor and Kronecker over Cantor's infinite sets. For someone who doesn't know the theory (I didn't run across anything I wasn't already familiar with--I can prove that the integers, whole numbers, and rational numbers are smaller sets than the real numbers without working too hard), it should be fairly approachable."
10,1841196509,http://goodreads.com/user/show/16196730-ellie-julio,1,"Dammit. I wanted to like this book; I really did. I'm fascinated by the topic of infinity and enjoy a well-written non-textbook discussion of math, science, and/or history. Sadly, this isn't one of those. The author uses far too many swathes of other texts (and then summarizes them) and has an odd writing style that simply puts you to sleep. I gave it five chapters before I had to put it down. Life's too short to read boring books."
11,1841196509,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8734089-shanmuganathan,1,"This book is a very boring read. The main problem is that some verses from other books are simply copy-pasted at various junctures. This makes the book very hard to read. One can read one, two, three ... infinity by George Gamow or some of the Simon Singh's or Carl Sagan's books instead of wasting time on this book."
12,1841196509,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3250423-mark-schnitzius,2,"A largely tepid affair. Another history book masquerading as a math book, with all the usual fear of actually attempting to explain some harder concepts. That's a little harsh, I think; there were some decent bits, but nothing that isn't covered better elsewhere."
13,1841196509,http://goodreads.com/user/show/24956566-marco-hokke,2,Badly written and without a clear idea or point.
14,1841196509,http://goodreads.com/user/show/22027036-nick,4,"""Do numbers go on forever?"" my 4-year-old daughter asked me the other day. Infinity, or at least the idea of very big numbers, grips the mind at a tender age. But little did I know, until I read this book, that the numbers that go on forever are just one form of infinity, and that there is a 'bigger' infinity, one that is paradoxically compressed into the tiny gap between 0 and 1. This was the brilliant insight of Georg Cantor, whose pioneering work on infinity in the late nineteenth and early twentieth century helped drive the poor fellow mad. The proof is an elegant one: think of a list of every number between 0 and 1, such as 0.493683037468, 0.876806059576 and so on. Now construct a new number, taking the first digit of the first number in the table, the second digit of the second number and so on. Then change every digit in this number (for example by adding 1, shifting 9 up to 0). The number produced logically can't be the same as any number in the list - even though that (infinitely long) list included every number between 0 and 1. It was as if Cantor had discovered a new 'dimension' of infinity. No wonder he lost his grip on sanity - although opposition from a vindictive rival, Leopold Kronecker, was perhaps what drove him over the edge. Cantor's story is just one of the fascinating episodes in this book, which tells of the mathematicians and philosophers who have pondered infinity and how perceptions of this impossible number have evolved over the centuries. On the way, there are several interesting diversions, including one on how the Ancient Greeks managed without having a concept of fractions. Rather than thinking of a ""half"", they would visualise a shape that was smaller than another by a factor of 2, thinking of the relationship purely in terms of whole numbers.In many ways, this book reminded me of Robert Kaplan's excellent The Nothing That Is: A Natural History of Zero, except that Clegg tilts more towards maths and Kaplan towards history. And though the concept of zero can be problematic, that of infinity is more mind-bending by far. There's something about infinity we can't get our head around, almost by definition, but in Brian Clegg's genial company, it is fun to try. My only slight reservation was that while most of the mathematical concepts were excellently explained, other parts of the book made me painfully aware of the lacunae in my knowledge, especially the chapters which touched on calculus. That said, the non-mathematical reader shouldn't be scared of attempting this book, which is a fascinating journey for the mind.""You will catch a glimpse of beauty that stops you in your tracks, but moments later you are not sure if you saw anything at all. Then, quite unexpectedly, the magnificent animal stalks out into full view for a few, fleeting seconds..."""
15,1841196509,http://goodreads.com/user/show/51664350-paul-weiss,3,"Be sure you know what you're buying!Perhaps I should state what I think should have been made a little more obvious. Clegg's ""A Brief History of Infinity"" is not a mathematics book. It is definitely a history book. In fact, it outlines the history of man's struggle to come to grips with the exceedingly complex and devilishly bewildering concept of infinity. Of necessity, of course, it touches on matters mathematical but the meat of this book is the history.A BRIEF HISTORY OF INFINITY delves into man's contemplation of matters infinite from the earliest days of its discussion by Greek philosophers, to St Augustine's theological musings of creation, to Leibniz and Newton battling over bragging rights for the creation of calculus, to Cantor's transfinite numbers and even to the implications of infinity in quantum physics.Having noted that the book is more focused on history than mathematics, it's definitely worth pointing out that the mathematics would still be daunting for a complete neophyte. That said, my hope was for somewhat more mathematics and a little less of the historical background. For example, I found the section on Leibniz and Newton's battles with Bishop Berkley over infinitesimals quite dreary and plodding.But, the misunderstanding as to the exact nature of the book can probably be laid more at my doorstep. A more careful examination of previous reviews and the marketing info on the book cover would have better informed me as to what I was stepping into.Recommended.Paul Weiss"
16,1841196509,http://goodreads.com/user/show/26546620-usman-baig,4,"The concept of infinity invariably comes up in countless places when one contemplates life, be it mathematical or otherwise. What is the biggest number? What is the length of the longest line? These and other such questions have fascinated mathematicians for centuries but as Brian Clegg shows, infinity as a mathematical concept was not properly dealt with until very recently. Even though the infinitely small is essential to the working of calculus, there was a certain vagueness around the concept due to mathematicians resorting to ‘potential infinities and infinitesimals’ in order to avoid the paradoxes that this subject throws up. This book with its slow pace and engrossing style, treats this concept and its history in a way that will allow all readers , even the ones unfamiliar of basic calculus to enjoy the read. That is a tall task for a book that aims to explore the understanding of the infinite through the centuries. On the other hand, the reader more adept at Maths may feel a little unsatisfied by the depth provided in the discussion of Set Theory and George Cantor’s contributions. A stand out feature of book is the author’s brief introduction to each new mathematician that played a role in the history of the subject. These pieces not only put those specific individuals into the academic context of their time but also provides us with tidbits of their personal lives so that we may appreciate their contributions on a higher level. All in all, this is a highly readable book and a suitable primer to more advanced studies of the infinite in the mathematical world. "
17,1841196509,http://goodreads.com/user/show/600757-stephanie,5,"I was going to give this book 4 stars only because I thought there could've been more content, but when I thought about it, there really is so much to say about infinity. But in order to maintain the audience's attention, and to attract a wider audience, I would have to say that this book did an excellent job. Virtually anyone can read it. It does help to have even a minimal understanding of calculus, but Clegg does a good job of explaining the concepts that involve infinity. It's truly so fascinating how complex this topic is. I really enjoyed the different accounts of men who tried to tackle this concept, some had nervous breakdowns, some got into pretty intense encounters with other men doing the same thing. It was really something to read about.Would recommend this book to anyone who wants to whet their appetite regarding infinity."
18,1841196509,http://goodreads.com/user/show/60854850-alex-chan,4,"Good mixture of the mathematical bits and history of the relevant people. Covers a lot of ideas in a fairly compact way.I don’t know how accessible the mathematical explanations are (I skipped them; I’ve already come across most of it), but the historical details all worked. And the cast in each chapter is usefully small – there’s not much skipped around “oh, this name was last mentioned three chapters ago, who was that again”? So that was nice.Glad to have read, now going on the charity shop pile for the next person."

In the end, though, there were too many quotes (which didn't add as much as I guess the author thought it did), and there was also almost no mention of anything beyond Europe and how they thought of infinity, but I have a hard time believing nobody outside of Europe thought about it at all. I guess they messed with the narrative he was going for."
20,1841196509,http://goodreads.com/user/show/33004524-ashar-malik,5,This book is a nice read.

30,1841196509,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1385685-diana,3,"This book discusses the attempts by philosophers and mathematicians throughout the ages to grasp the concept of infinity and the infinitesimally small. I'm not sure quite how much I fully absorbed. The subject is very interesting, but quite complex. Even so, Clegg did a good job of urging me to keep reading by making the chapters short. I had a tenuous grasp on things in the first half of the book, but once it gets to set theory I had to quit trying to understand and just go along for the ride because the subject was so beyond my mathematical knowledge. The harder the subjects were the more interesting the story became about the figures involved in the study of infinity. Most intriguing was Georg Cantor, the German mathemitician who invented set theory and discovered how there could be different levels of inifinity. The resistance to Cantor's revolutionary ideas on infinity reminds me of many of the themes discussed in the Oppenheimer book I read last year. Sadly, despite his theories being correct Cantor had a nervous breakdown which Clegg attributes to his study of infinity and his poor treatment by some in the mathematical community. I was left wondering if people like Cantor were driven mad by their study of infinity or were they drawn to the subject because their brains worked a little differently to begin with. It's such a difficult subject to grasp that I think Cantor had to be a very special type person to want to immerse himself so fully in the topic."
31,1841196509,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6934307-sam-eccleston,5,"This is a fascinating overview of the history of the concept of infinity; chiefly from a mathematical perspective but also encompassing various relevant aspects of religious and philosophical thought on the subject. What becomes clear over the course of the book is that many of the paradoxes involving infinity are seemingly irresolvable, and that the different perspectives on the reality and nature of infinity are grounded, in many cases, in equally well structured arguments. This work is a great companion to 'The Scientific Revolution' by Steven Shapin; the two works cover many of the same historical figures from a slightly different angle. The book does occasionally move from topic to topic in a slightly confusing way, and once or twice complex ideas are not explained quite as straightforwardly as they might be, but generally the exposition is clear and easy to understand."
32,1841196509,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5945208-kriegslok,3,"I restarted this book three times thinking third time lucky. In the end I'm not sure restarting helped to make up for the sheer, in places, mingboggling content. It's little wonder that contemplating the infinite has sent great brains over the edge. Heavily sided towards mathamatical approaches to infinity it probably helps if you have something better than a CSE fail in maths to appreciate the finer points. That said while I struggled my way through many pages and failed to understand a lot of what was presumably designed to be understood by the novice, I still found the effort worthwhile. Anyone who understands what Calculus is will probably get a lot more out of the book than I did. Still, I recomend the book to anyone curious about the infinte."
33,1841196509,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5935582-dan-cohen,3,"Not a bad book, but not quite as engrossing as I had hoped either. I have perhaps a little more background in the subject than most readers so I found much of the book a little slow. I also found some of the philosophical or semi-philosophical sections a little unconvincing. It reads a little as if the author doesn't really understand aspects of the subject very well, which can be engaging if done deliberately but in this case does not exactly inspire confidence that you are reading a definitive account. However, for anyone without much background in the subject I'd recommend it."
34,1841196509,http://goodreads.com/user/show/31989642-debi-robertson,3,"So I finished. I feel like a hot poker has been shoved up my nose and my brain has been scrambled. I liked this book and the writer did a great job. It left me with a lot of questions that will need to be clarified in my own time.

I’m a sucker for the subject, so I enjoyed it immensely. His style is straightforward and easy to understand, but the “brief” aspect of it did leave me wanting to know more "
51,1841196509,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1385685-diana,3,"This book discusses the attempts by philosophers and mathematicians throughout the ages to grasp the concept of infinity and the infinitesimally small. I'm not sure quite how much I fully absorbed. The subject is very interesting, but quite complex. Even so, Clegg did a good job of urging me to keep reading by making the chapters short. I had a tenuous grasp on things in the first half of the book, but once it gets to set theory I had to quit trying to understand and just go along for the ride because the subject was so beyond my mathematical knowledge. The harder the subjects were the more interesting the story became about the figures involved in the study of infinity. Most intriguing was Georg Cantor, the German mathemitician who invented set theory and discovered how there could be different levels of inifinity. The resistance to Cantor's revolutionary ideas on infinity reminds me of many of the themes discussed in the Oppenheimer book I read last year. Sadly, despite his theories being correct Cantor had a nervous breakdown which Clegg attributes to his study of infinity and his poor treatment by some in the mathematical community. I was left wondering if people like Cantor were driven mad by their study of infinity or were they drawn to the subject because their brains worked a little differently to begin with. It's such a difficult subject to grasp that I think Cantor had to be a very special type person to want to immerse himself so fully in the topic."
52,1841196509,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6934307-sam-eccleston,5,"This is a fascinating overview of the history of the concept of infinity; chiefly from a mathematical perspective but also encompassing various relevant aspects of religious and philosophical thought on the subject. What becomes clear over the course of the book is that many of the paradoxes involving infinity are seemingly irresolvable, and that the different perspectives on the reality and nature of infinity are grounded, in many cases, in equally well structured arguments. This work is a great companion to 'The Scientific Revolution' by Steven Shapin; the two works cover many of the same historical figures from a slightly different angle. The book does occasionally move from topic to topic in a slightly confusing way, and once or twice complex ideas are not explained quite as straightforwardly as they might be, but generally the exposition is clear and easy to understand."

In the end I'm not sure restarting helped to make up for the sheer, in places, mingboggling content. It's little wonder that contemplating the infinite has sent great brains over the edge. Heavily sided towards mathamatical approaches to infinity it probably helps if you have something better than a CSE fail in maths to appreciate the finer points. That said while I struggled my way through many pages and failed to understand a lot of what was presumably designed to be understood by the novice, I still found the effort worthwhile. Anyone who understands what Calculus is will probably get a lot more out of the book than I did. Still, I recomend the book to anyone curious about the infinte."

I have perhaps a little more background in the subject than most readers so I found much of the book a little slow. I also found some of the philosophical or semi-philosophical sections a little unconvincing. It reads a little as if the author doesn't really understand aspects of the subject very well, which can be engaging if done deliberately but in this case does not exactly inspire confidence that you are reading a definitive account.

113,1841196509,http://goodreads.com/user/show/72567015-quinnformel,4,"A good summation of the history of mathematical thought in the nature of infinity. I’m a sucker for the subject, so I enjoyed it immensely. His style is straightforward and easy to understand, but the “brief” aspect of it did leave me wanting to know more "
114,1841196509,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1385685-diana,3,"This book discusses the attempts by philosophers and mathematicians throughout the ages to grasp the concept of infinity and the infinitesimally small. I'm not sure quite how much I fully absorbed. The subject is very interesting, but quite complex. Even so, Clegg did a good job of urging me to keep reading by making the chapters short. I had a tenuous grasp on things in the first half of the book, but once it gets to set theory I had to quit trying to understand and just go along for the ride because the subject was so beyond my mathematical knowledge. The harder the subjects were the more interesting the story became about the figures involved in the study of infinity. Most intriguing was Georg Cantor, the German mathemitician who invented set theory and discovered how there could be different levels of inifinity. The resistance to Cantor's revolutionary ideas on infinity reminds me of many of the themes discussed in the Oppenheimer book I read last year. Sadly, despite his theories being correct Cantor had a nervous breakdown which Clegg attributes to his study of infinity and his poor treatment by some in the mathematical community. I was left wondering if people like Cantor were driven mad by their study of infinity or were they drawn to the subject because their brains worked a little differently to begin with. It's such a difficult subject to grasp that I think Cantor had to be a very special type person to want to immerse himself so fully in the topic."
115,1841196509,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6934307-sam-eccleston,5,"This is a fascinating overview of the history of the concept of infinity; chiefly from a mathematical perspective but also encompassing various relevant aspects of religious and philosophical thought on the subject. What becomes clear over the course of the book is that many of the paradoxes involving infinity are seemingly irresolvable, and that the different perspectives on the reality and nature of infinity are grounded, in many cases, in equally well structured arguments. This work is a great companion to 'The Scientific Revolution' by Steven Shapin; the two works cover many of the same historical figures from a slightly different angle. The book does occasionally move from topic to topic in a slightly confusing way, and once or twice complex ideas are not explained quite as straightforwardly as they might be, but generally the exposition is clear and easy to understand."
116,1841196509,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5945208-kriegslok,3,"I restarted this book three times thinking third time lucky. In the end I'm not sure restarting helped to make up for the sheer, in places, mingboggling content. It's little wonder that contemplating the infinite has sent great brains over the edge. Heavily sided towards mathamatical approaches to infinity it probably helps if you have something better than a CSE fail in maths to appreciate the finer points. That said while I struggled my way through many pages and failed to understand a lot of what was presumably designed to be understood by the novice, I still found the effort worthwhile. Anyone who understands what Calculus is will probably get a lot more out of the book than I did. Still, I recomend the book to anyone curious about the infinte."
117,1841196509,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5935582-dan-cohen,3,"Not a bad book, but not quite as engrossing as I had hoped either. I have perhaps a little more background in the subject than most readers so I found much of the book a little slow. I also found some of the philosophical or semi-philosophical sections a little unconvincing. It reads a little as if the author doesn't really understand aspects of the subject very well, which can be engaging if done deliberately but in this case does not exactly inspire confidence that you are reading a definitive account. However, for anyone without much background in the subject I'd recommend it."

I liked this book and the writer did a great job. It left me with a lot of questions that will need to be clarified in my own time. Not for the feint of heart, this read, but certainly worth the effort. It brought back a lot of public school math of my time. I think I understand the concepts better."

176,1841196509,http://goodreads.com/user/show/72567015-quinnformel,4,"A good summation of the history of mathematical thought in the nature of infinity. I’m a sucker for the subject, so I enjoyed it immensely. His style is straightforward and easy to understand, but the “brief” aspect of it did leave me wanting to know more "
177,1841196509,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1385685-diana,3,"This book discusses the attempts by philosophers and mathematicians throughout the ages to grasp the concept of infinity and the infinitesimally small. I'm not sure quite how much I fully absorbed. The subject is very interesting, but quite complex. Even so, Clegg did a good job of urging me to keep reading by making the chapters short. I had a tenuous grasp on things in the first half of the book, but once it gets to set theory I had to quit trying to understand and just go along for the ride because the subject was so beyond my mathematical knowledge. The harder the subjects were the more interesting the story became about the figures involved in the study of infinity. Most intriguing was Georg Cantor, the German mathemitician who invented set theory and discovered how there could be different levels of inifinity. The resistance to Cantor's revolutionary ideas on infinity reminds me of many of the themes discussed in the Oppenheimer book I read last year. Sadly, despite his theories being correct Cantor had a nervous breakdown which Clegg attributes to his study of infinity and his poor treatment by some in the mathematical community. I was left wondering if people like Cantor were driven mad by their study of infinity or were they drawn to the subject because their brains worked a little differently to begin with. It's such a difficult subject to grasp that I think Cantor had to be a very special type person to want to immerse himself so fully in the topic."
178,1841196509,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6934307-sam-eccleston,5,"This is a fascinating overview of the history of the concept of infinity; chiefly from a mathematical perspective but also encompassing various relevant aspects of religious and philosophical thought on the subject. What becomes clear over the course of the book is that many of the paradoxes involving infinity are seemingly irresolvable, and that the different perspectives on the reality and nature of infinity are grounded, in many cases, in equally well structured arguments. This work is a great companion to 'The Scientific Revolution' by Steven Shapin; the two works cover many of the same historical figures from a slightly different angle. The book does occasionally move from topic to topic in a slightly confusing way, and once or twice complex ideas are not explained quite as straightforwardly as they might be, but generally the exposition is clear and easy to understand."
179,1841196509,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5945208-kriegslok,3,"I restarted this book three times thinking third time lucky. In the end I'm not sure restarting helped to make up for the sheer, in places, mingboggling content. It's little wonder that contemplating the infinite has sent great brains over the edge. Heavily sided towards mathamatical approaches to infinity it probably helps if you have something better than a CSE fail in maths to appreciate the finer points. That said while I struggled my way through many pages and failed to understand a lot of what was presumably designed to be understood by the novice, I still found the effort worthwhile. Anyone who understands what Calculus is will probably get a lot more out of the book than I did. Still, I recomend the book to anyone curious about the infinte."
180,1841196509,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5935582-dan-cohen,3,"Not a bad book, but not quite as engrossing as I had hoped either. I have perhaps a little more background in the subject than most readers so I found much of the book a little slow. I also found some of the philosophical or semi-philosophical sections a little unconvincing. It reads a little as if the author doesn't really understand aspects of the subject very well, which can be engaging if done deliberately but in this case does not exactly inspire confidence that you are reading a definitive account. However, for anyone without much background in the subject I'd recommend it."
181,1841196509,http://goodreads.com/user/show/31989642-debi-robertson,3,"So I finished. I feel like a hot poker has been shoved up my nose and my brain has been scrambled. I liked this book and the writer did a great job. It left me with a lot of questions that will need to be clarified in my own time. Not for the feint of heart, this read, but certainly worth the effort. It brought back a lot of public school math of my time. I think I understand the concepts better."
182,1841196509,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11484240-jim-bryant,4,"I thoroughly enjoyed this book. Infinity seems like a common enough concept until you follow the idea into the numerous paradoxes it seems to spawn. This book takes us through the development of the idea over time and some of its practical applications. The idea has been advanced by some very interesting individuals, some of whom are introduced in this book."
183,1841196509,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5900232-heather-browning,3,"This book combines a history of maths/ philosophy with discussion of the concepts of infinity themselves. He used examples well to help illustrate some of the more difficult ideas to do with infinity, and I found the history of the people who studied infinity interesting, though I think there were just too many characters introduced overall. A nice overview."
184,1841196509,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7033444-s-b-redstone,4,"If you are interested in astronomy and love to wonder about the universe, and where space, atoms, and time originated, this is a terrific book. Since I have been writing science fiction, this was an invaluable resource as well. I am just fascinated by the thought that space is! And infinity. It is just mind boggling. He offers a great history of astronomy as well. "
185,1841196509,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3687193-steve-gillway,4,"I was like little red riding hood strolling through a nice book, whem whoosh. I was ambushed by maths. The author lulls you into a false sense of security ( 1, 2, 3, 4 ...) and then blam, you are off in a dark forest completely lost. Some great tales here concerning the personalities involved in the development of infinity and similar numbery things."
186,1841196509,http://goodreads.com/user/show/15854961-patrick-pilz,3,"This is a tough book to follow if you are not 100% sound in mathematics, and I mean theoretical mathematics. 'How Big is Big, how small is small"" is a much better book when it comes to understand numbers, except infinity. As infinity does not exist in the real world, it does not matter whether you read a book about it or not. There is no practical value in understanding infinity after all."
187,1841196509,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8630703-snufkin,5,"I wouldn't have believed that infinity was so interesting, surprising, problematic, enlightening, shocking! It is written beautifully and brings in some unforgettable characters in the history of infinity."
188,1841196509,http://goodreads.com/user/show/19003048-alan-medcalf,3,"An exploration of the history and development of concepts of mathematical and philosophical ""infinity"" - more on the historic and philosophical side of the blurry line that infinity shares with mathematics. Interesting read."
