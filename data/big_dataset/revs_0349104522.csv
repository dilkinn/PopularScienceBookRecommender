1,0349104522,http://goodreads.com/user/show/16086777-siddhartha,5,"2013 December 22nd was the 125th birth anniversary of Srinivasa Ramanujan. He was a genius whose early death, owing to a multitude of factors not entirely in his control, was a tragedy too profound for tears, as someone said.That mathematicians are trying to come to terms with his papers and notebooks to this day, is a testimony to his originality. There was a news about his last notebooks on mock modular forms being proven just last month.This biography by Robert Kanigel is a work of outstanding literary and scholarly accomplishment. The author clearly researched his subject thoroughly. He succeeds in successfully recreating the early 20th century rural Tamilnadu as well as Ramanujan's isolation in war time England for the readers. I was never good at Mathematics. And i never regretted it anytime until i read some of the mathematical parts in this book. I could understand the importance of Ramanujan's work, thanks to Kanigel's explanation. But i wished i was good enough at Mathematics to at least attempt to experience the beauty of it. Instead, i had to rely on metaphor for it to make any sense to me. A must read for anybody who is interested in Ramanujan, Mathematics, Hardy, Biographies or any good book."
2,0349104522,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5012269-siby,4,"Ramanujam is considered one of the best mathematicians of all times, in the same league as a Jacobi or Euler.Even though his work is well known within the mathematical community, outside of it, he is virtually an unknown quantity. Robert Kanigel has put in a lot of effort researching material to write such a comprehensive biography of a genius from a century ago. Ramanujam was born in a poor Tamil brahmin family and had little access to formal education. He had an unnatural flair for mathematics and nothing else! After a life a penury and struggle, with no one in India capable of even understanding if his work was brilliant or a just pure drivel, Ramanujam got the recognition he deserved when his papers reached the British mathematician Hardy. After a brief period of collaboration with Hardy in England and some brilliant individual effort back in India, Ramanujam passed away, at the age of 32. In his short life, Ramanujam achieved a lot. A meteoric rise to fame, FRS and fellowship to Trinity and a body of mathematical work that is still being studied and analyzed more than a 100 years later. One can only wonder what he could have achieved had he lived a few more years. This book is very comprehensive, being not just the story of Ramanujam, but also a social biography of colonial India and war time Europe during the early 1900s. Does digress from Ramanujam's life quite a few times, with details on life in Britain, or the social customs of Brahmanical India etc. There is no mathematics in this book and so, can be read by anyone interested in the romantically tragic, but brilliant life of Ramanujam"

I really had an amazing time reading this one and I was reading this at a time when no other book seemed nice [I really tried a lot of books from the Hitchhiker’s guide to Sherlock to Child Thief ….but nothing worked] .   It’s a very ,very well written and thoroughly researched book and I would just like to say that I haven’t read many biographies, but this is exactly how a biography should be done .What Robert Kanigel has done with Ramanujan’s biography ,is simply mind-blowing, he makes you love Ramanujan not only for his mathematical genius but for the amazing and beautiful person he was, It almost felt as if I were transported back to the period from 1887 to the early 1900’s and living each moment right from when he was born ,one could literally feel his(Ramanujan's) anguish when he was going door to door in search for a job with his notebook in his hands ,his joy when Hardy said “A Yes”or when he received an F.R.S. ,his impatience at not finding Janaki when he reached India and 26th April 1920 trust me, I couldn’t stop those few tears that escaped my eyes. I loved each and every moment spent with this book and I think, I can see myself re-reading this all over again sometime soon.  P.S.There isn’t a great deal of maths, so anyone could read it. Whatever little maths has been done to give an” idea” of Ramanujan’s contribution to maths, is well explained ."
4,0349104522,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3035194-lubinka-dimitrova,5,"One of the best-crafted biographies I've ever read, this book offered not only a deep insight into the story of Ramanujan himself, but also a social biography of colonial India and war time Europe during the early 1900s. Not too heavy on mathematics, it had just enough for the reader to acquire a basic idea of Ramanujan's accomplishments and his contribution to many and various branches of science(note to self: audio books are not well suited for understanding equations). The book is a fertile ground for thoughts about the importance of chance in life - what would have happened if the conditions in India were different at that time, or if his mother was a different person from the one she was, or he himself, for that matter (his strict vegetarianism in war-time conditions pretty much condemned him), or even - what would he be able to achieve, were he better educated in the basics, had he lived a bit longer or were he born in a different era... Almost 100 years after his death, the results he stated, both original and highly unconventional, have inspired a vast amount of further research, and his biography turned out to be an utterly compelling read."

This is how, I feel, biographies should be written. When reading the book, it actually felt as if you were with Srinvasa Ramanujan all through his life...The greatest lesson to be learnt from this life story of Ramanujan is that to encourage and support a person for their skills and talent instead of insisting that they follow the syllabus and curriculum prepared/decided by the State and Educationists from earlier generations.A #mustread book whether one likes mathematics or not..."
6,0349104522,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2531665-charlene,5,"Exceptional, brilliant, tragic, and mind altering. I first watched the movie by the same title and felt as if I missed so much. It turned out to be the case. The entire first half of the book was about Ramanujan's life before working with G. H. Hardy. So many shocking details; not the least of which was that fact that no university in India would allow Ramanujan entrance because he continued to fail his English exams. It was heartbreaking to read about his shame, which was so profound, he took a train and ran away. The second half of the book dealt with the groundbreaking mathematics worked out by Ramanujan, despite the shocking lack of education to arrive at these ideas/equations. To call it astonishing would be to minimize his accomplishments in a severe manner. He is often referred to as the 3rd most brilliant human who ever lived. However, considering where he came from, I personally view him as more brilliant than Newton. Another aspect of the book that you won't see in the movie is the wonderful biography of G. H. Hardy. He was a brilliant mathematician but an even more brilliant humanitarian, fighting against people in his own institution to champion Ramanujan and later fighting against people on multiple continents to help Jewish academics escape Nazi Germany. Because of the importance of the ideas of both of these men to society as a whole, I consider this book a must read. "
7,0349104522,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4587507-ash,5,"Ramanujan is one of the greatest mathematicians and the most famous mathematician that India has ever produced. I hardly knew anything about him or his contributions to mathematics. I picked this book up with the sole intention of knowing more about this genius. And I am so glad that I did. It was such an inspiring story that I feel every young person must read it.Ramanujan has been compared with mathematicians like Euler and Jacobi. Ramanujan was a genius, he was -""... the man whom the English had moved heaven and earth to bring to Cambridge...""The book is full of quotations, interviews compiled by the author and it shows how much research went into this book. Author has done a great job of not being judgmental about anything he mentions in the book. It is one of the best biographies I have ever read. Ramanujan's story is very interesting since it is a rags-to-intellectual riches story, where an Indian clerk who did not even complete his graduation scribbles theorems in a notebook, which even surprised the most educated mathematicians in colleges like Trinity (where people like Newton taught). Without any formal education, he came up with theorems which took many years for other mathematicians to decipher or come up with proof. Unfortunately, he died at the age of 32. I wonder what other major contributions he would have done, had he lived for 60 years or so!Ramanujan never got any support, while in India, maybe because of British Raj or maybe because nobody understood the significance of his theorems. Hardy, who was a mathematics professor at Trinity college studied the letters that Ramanujan sent and made him come to Britain with the help of Neville (a colleague). Hardy and Ramanujan together published many papers. Littlewood was another professor who appreciated Ramanujan's talent. Ramanujan who did not get good vegetarian food (since he was a Brahmin) and had to face the brutal British chillness fell sick with tuberculosis. I believe he would not have fallen sick had his mother let him take his wife with him to UK. It was sad to know that he even tried to kill himself, because of the loneliness and rejection of fellowship as a result of racial prejudice. He later ended up getting fellowship from Royal Society and Trinity college.Laurence Young had written -""Teaching Ramanujan was like writing on a blackboard covered with excerpts from a more interesting lecture""He believed in God and attributed all of his brilliance to God. Some of the work that he had done, had already been discovered by someone else. But since he was not in touch with the western world and had no formal education, he was not aware of these discoveries. The book talks about his religious beliefs, personal life, his relationship with professors like Hardy, Littlewood and Neville, about Hardy's life, his contributions to mathematics, his struggle to get recognition for the work he had done, his struggle to feed his poor family and his eccentricity and stubbornness. His interest in mathematics was so great that he worked on problems even when he was in hospital and even few days before dying.At one point, he was so poor that he could not afford to buy a notebook. He would then write in-between the lines on an already written notebook using a different colored ink pen. Such was the determination of this man!As Hardy says, a mathematician has to have an intuition first in order to come up with anything new, which Ramanujan had in abundance -""a mathematician usually discovers a theorem by an effort of intuition; the conclusion strikes him as plausible, and he sets to work to manufacture a proof""As P.K. Srinivasan said,""The British thought Indians were inferior, and Ramanujan showed otherwise.""His contributions include the infinite series, tau conjecture (also called Ramanujan's hypothesis), a field known as probabilistic number theory, partition problems, mock theta functions, Ramanujan's identities, composite numbers and many more. The book briefly talks about his theorems and papers. I would really like to get hold of ""Collected papers"" of Ramanujan which was published by Cambridge University press. His last set of papers written by him just before he died, were compiled as ""The Lost notebook"" and published later. I am sure most part of his theorems would not make sense to me. Those who are doing research in that field would understand them better. There was a book which inspired Ramanujan to a great extent and I was really happy that I got to browse an online copy of the book. The book was called ""A synopsis of Elementary results in pure and applied mathematics"", by Carr. Another book that was mentioned in this book (and I want to read) was ""A mathematician's apology"", written by Hardy.Hardy says,""There is always more in one of Ramanujan's formulae than meets the eye, as anyone who sets to work to verify those which look the easiest will soon discover"".I was really surprised to know that it took about 3 months to arrive at a proof for one of the theorems written in his notebook. Ramanujan never bothered about proving any of his theorems.I had no idea that his mathematics has applications in pyrometry, crystallography, atomic research, string theory, splicing telephone cables, cancer treatment, statistical mechanics, computer algorithms, space travel, cryptology, particle physics, fastest known algorithm to determine pi by computer and many more fields. Probably even he had no idea that it had so many practical applications.As J.B.S Haldane says, new Ramanujans in India find little encouragement and recognition for their talent -""But it is scandalous that India's great men should have to wait for foreign recognitions...""Hardy, who was the most distinguished mathematician in Britain says: (Had he been discovered earlier and educated in a good University,) ""... he would have been less of a Ramanujan, and more of a European professor, and the loss might have been greater than the gain""""I owe more to him than to any one else in the world..."".While reading the book, I was interested and I did research on Nobel Prize laureates from India for Physics/Mathematics and found only two names in the list: C.V. Raman and S. Chandrashekar. The other laureates are for Chemistry, Biology, Peace, Literature etc. Don't you think it is too small a number for a country with highest population?!I highly recommend this book.I watched this documentary - ""Letters from an Indian clerk"" shot in 1987 by BBC. It was an interesting documentary about Ramanujan and it ran for about 60 minutes. They even interviewed his wife who was 87 years old at that time. Ramanujan died when she was just 20 years old. I felt so sad looking at her talking about her husband who had died some 67 years back. Did she even remember his face properly? I doubt that. :( They also showed many photos of Ramanujan taken when he was at Cambridge. I had not seen most of these photos before.The Man who knew Infinity movie is releasing in 2014. Earlier it was reported that R. Madhavan would play the lead role. But now I am seeing Dev Patel being casted. He doesn't even suit the role. And I personally dislike him. I don't want to watch the movie anymore. Madhavan would have fit the role perfectly, since he resembles Ramanujan and is a much better actor. Got the info from IMDB, here, here and many more websites.P.S: There have been no good books written about Aryabhatta so far. Isn't it time someone wrote one? Do you know any books on any of the other Indian mathematicians?"
8,0349104522,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5483197-ananthu,5," A fascinating account on the short but outstanding life of the enigmatic and extraordinary Ramanujan.From a young, unschooled Indian clerk to an exemplary mathematician, his journey albeit he died at the mere age of 32, is nevertheless awe-inspiring. Even in his final days, he never left his slate and continued to give prominent contributions. Such was his love for Mathematics. He failed in everything else but scored high in Mathematics. But it just wasn’t enough to clutch him a degree. So he wasn’t admitted for higher education but it was G.H. Hardy, Apostle of Proof, after Ramanujan’s failed attempts to contact two other noted Mathematicians of the time, who did discover this Intuition Incarnate who was evidently stuck in a rut in India, which closed all the doors on his dreams just because he lacked a degree. Rules couldn’t be bent, they said. But they did not yet realize what intellectual treasures lay deep inside him. His glowing eyes just couldn’t persuade them. Together, Hardy and Ramanujan produced astonishing results which made their names indelible in the history of Mathematics. G.H. Hardy later described his kinship with Ramanujan as the ‘one romantic incident in his life’. Mathematics was the only thing which intertwined them. Hardy was an atheist while Ramanujan was a stout Brahmin. Hardy loved cricket but Ramanujan showed no interest. Only Mathematics linked them. And it did do a little harm to Ramanujan. Read to find out!Robert Kanigel has produced indeed a delightful book. With writing so exquisite, I was moved and almost shed a tear during the last portion of the book. Ramanujan’s own country failed to encourage him. It was Hardy and England which showed Ramanujan to the world. Although he had disadvantages many, fortunately his genius did finally overcome them. Ramanujan showed the world what Indians are capable of; that India has potential. But who knows many Ramanujans might still exist, waiting only to be discovered."
9,0349104522,http://goodreads.com/user/show/12430250-pallavi-kamat,5,"This is one of the most fascinating and incredible books I have read in recent times. It is the biography of the famous Indian mathematician Srinivasa Ramanujan.The book’s blurb states: “The Man Who Knew Infinity is a fascinating biography of the brilliant, self-taught Indian mathematician, Srinivasa Ramanujan. It is also a history of the astonishingly fruitful cross-cultural collaboration between this young, ill-educated mathematical genius and his mentor at Cambridge University, G. H. Hardy – a relationship that turned the world of mathematics upside down before it withered and died through a combination of Indian bureaucratic short-sightedness, superstition, English spiritual asceticism and the First World War. Robert Kanigel, author of The One Best Way, tells this extraordinary tale, assessing the legacy of a man whose work contains some of the most beautiful ideas in the history of science, and whose major papers are still being plumbed for their secrets today.”When I picked up the book, I was a bit apprehensive about reading the biography of a mathematician – I wondered if I would be able to follow it. However, my apprehensions were laid to rest. Kanigel’s attempt at piecing together Ramanujan’s brilliant and short life (he died at the young age of 32) is an outstanding oeuvre. Right from his childhood in the small town of Kumbanokam to his dedicated single-minded focus on learning mathematics to his journey to Cambridge and back, Kanigel paints before us a vivid picture of South India in the late 1800s/early 1900s.The book is outstanding for a number of reasons. Most importantly, because it brings out the human element in each and every action or decision that Ramanujan took. You almost feel pity for the young Ramanujan who is unable to clear his exams because he would not study other subjects due to his interest in Mathematics. At the same time, you are also amazed at how he would sit in the courtyard of his home dedicatedly solving problems on his slate and erasing any errors with his elbows to avoid lifting his arms. But the best way in which the human aspect is brought about is by highlighting throughout the book how Ramanujan craved for appreciation and recognition at each stage; even though he knew he was brilliant and outshone everybody else, he still wanted others to say that.Kanigel is also able to narrate to us life at Cambridge during those times, how the other mathematicians were in awe of Ramanujan for his genius and how Ramanujan, who never had an Indian degree to his name, was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society (F.R.S.) and a Fellow of Trinity College, Cambridge.The other important part about this book is the way the relationship between Ramanujan and his mentor Godfred Harold Hardy has been elaborated. The importance of having a mentor at a critical juncture in life and how it leads someone to achieve his true potential has been beautifully brought out. It is as if this relation was meant to be – else why would only Hardy respond to Ramanujan’s letters when the latter had written to two other Cambridge mathematicians as well?The only sad part which ran through the book is the fact that ultimately it took a foreigner to recognize the genius in an Indian; Ramanujan had to go to Cambridge because his brilliance was not rewarded in his own country. This, unfortunately, seems to be the situation today as well though it is changing albeit at a snail’s pace. Another sad thing was the relation Ramanujan shared with his wife, Janki (who was only nine years old when they got married). Since Ramanujan was so pre-occupied with his work and since Janki was still too young to be a wife, they never really had a traditional husband-wife relationship. Janki also did not accompany him to Cambridge. Neither was she interested in learning about his work and his research.This book is a must-read for anybody who feels passionately about Indians achieving something in their chosen field. It is about a person who is not afraid to spend time and attention on his passion even though it does not bear fruit initially; who is not afraid to go from door to door trying to make an honest living so that he gets the freedom to do what he wants and ultimately who is not afraid to leave the comforts of his home and family to go pursue a better career abroad (at a time when not many people would do so).This review first appeared on my blog www.pallosworld.blogspot.in."
10,0349104522,http://goodreads.com/user/show/41935794-v,2,"This book has many issues, and none other than Robert Kanigel is himself guilty. First and foremost, he has continuously maintained a racist undertone in the text. He digs 20 pages deep into inane topics such as exploring the possibility of Hardy being gay or about Carr's book which influenced Ramanujan in his formative years, but does not bat an eye on the racism faced by Ramanujan in 20th century England or the capitalist colonial British Raj in India which had amputated India's growth in all spheres of life. He seems ready to write eulogies for some odd White dude who has something to say about math or Ramanujan or his field of work, but never once does he mention by name the Indian biographers of Ramanujan who have written about the same or his life before Kanigal (whom he had referenced to as well!). Lines like ""one Indian biographer noted ..."" are scattered throughout the text, which makes the reader wonder why they are not mentioned in the main text or instead relegated to a meager annotation somewhere in the bibliography. I waited till the very last page of the book for Kanigel to condemn the colonial rule or the coloniser West in general, or their structural damages done in India or any other colonial states. He instead seems to be basking in the so-called glory of the Modernisation Theory of the West, which was deeply disheartening.The book is also very poorly written, sometimes even stooping to deliberately convoluting certain ideas expressed by some characters in order to disguise some uncomfortable facts. Unnecessary verbosity and third-grade crime thriller style of narration makes the reading experience massively painful at several junctures of the book. It is also written specifically for the average White American audience; the weather is noted in Fahrenheit, distance in miles, and references are made to American towns for comparisons in area and population. For the same reason, I, an Indian, had to toil myself through the first few chapters where he tries to explain my own culture to me. My primary complaint in this regard is that his sources of information regarding the same were also incompetent. Kanigel seems to have no idea of what being a Brahmin in a deeply caste-based society such as ours entails. The social capital that the Brahmin surname brings along also goes unnoticed in the narrative, and most, if not all, attention was given to how Ramanujan was almost lost into obscurity because of his economic stationing in the early 20th century British ruled Indian society. Kanigel seems to have an opinion on everything, barring racism, colonialism, and Brahminism in India. The silence is deafening. Finally, in my opinion, Kanigel has misnamed his book. The title of this book claims to present the story of Ramanujan; rather, it is more of a story of Hardy and Ramanujan together. This is not a romantic accident but a serious deviation from the said goal. It would have been a completely different book had it truly been Ramanujan's biography, ie, the story of his life. Instead, this book is deliberately written like a masala flick wherein Ramanujan, a poor Hindu, finds his way into the hallowed halls of Western Academia, recognition, and international fame. The rags-to-riches story of Ramanujan, a fantasy that Americans love to buy, is sold ostentatiously; it seems that it is this version of the narrative that fetched Kanigal's publisher's attention which subsequently motivated Kanigal to write the book in the way he has.Kanigal does not discount Ramanujan's efforts or his genius in this text. What he fails to do, however, is to build a holistic understanding of Ramanujan himself and his material reality, something that is expected from a biography that wishes to be deemed decent at least."
11,0349104522,http://goodreads.com/user/show/38772655-jeanette-lewis,4,"The movie based on the life of Ramanujan sheds some light on to the brilliance of this Indian mathematician, sadly however the producers weren't brave enough to depict him true to his image, rather they glamorised him when in fact Ramanujan was fat, short and had suffered from the effects of smallpox. The author has endeavoured to make the book readable for all with only occasionally heading off into a mathematical maze and for the most part creates an enjoyable account of these two famous men. Hardy is the typical English scholar, one best described as non-sexual, having no love interest other than mathematics, intellectual associations, cricket and journalism. Ramanujan was a single minded gifted man. His religious beliefs and vegetarianism whilst part of his everyday life in India made his life extremely difficult in cold wet England and stodgy diet. He was an only child and as like in many cultures (still today) was spoilt and waited on by his mother regardless of his tantrums. Because the tantrum child behaviour was never reigned in even as an adult this helped create his difficult and failed academic life in India refusing to tow the line of educational institutions' study and exam rules. Sadly, the English mathematician Hardy it seems didn't really ""see the man"" until the very end when Ramanujan was extremely ill with TB and it seems that if only some of the English academics had cared a little more for the well being of this brilliant man from India, sourcing his specialised food stuffs for him and orienteering him more to their lifestyles, his life at Cambridge would have been more positive. The weather alone would be enough to try anyone. His brilliance was from natural aptitude but it was Hardy and Littlewood who fashioned him and fought for his recognition amongst the English academia that attributed to his world fame."
12,0349104522,http://goodreads.com/user/show/24133187-usha,5,It takes a significant effort to read this biography but it is so worth it. 
13,0349104522,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1241024-joe,4,"This book is a biography of Ramanujan, the Indian genius mathematician.It's difficult to avoid finding Ramanujan fascinating, even if you have no interest in math. He was born poor in India in 1887, and showed an incredible natural talent for math -- including theoretical as well as arithmetical abilities -- but his poor academic talent in other areas prevented him from moving up in India's educational structure. While working a series of low-level bureaucratic jobs, he continually tried to get prominent mathematicians to recognize his ability -- some seemed unable to understand his work, others seemed to see potential but didn't know how to help Ramanujan. It didn't help that Ramanujan's only experience to theoretical math was very limited -- he had an outdated book of theorems that he started from, and he developed his own notation that was difficult to get used to.Eventually, a British mathematician (Hardy) responded to a letter asking for help. With Hardy's help, Ramanujan traveled to Cambridge and and began interacting with a larger circle of mathematicians. Ramanujan didn't find the transition easy, but he was successful, achieving the title of Fellow of the Royal Society.Every bit of Ramanujan's life is more interesting than the short description I've given here. This book does a good job of covering all of it, and there are really only two flaws I can think of. The first is simply a matter of organization. I get the feeling that the author collected a large amount of material, and felt the need to be completist in disclosing it all. Most of it fits fine, and tells the story well, but there are a few chapters, or sections of chapters, that feel tacked on.The larger issue with this book is always an issue of any book that targets a technical and non-technical audience at the same time. In this case, the author clearly wants to describe a bit of Ramanujan's mathematics, both to give the reader a feeling for the sorts of things he and others were working on, and to let people see a small amount of the order -- beauty? -- that can exist numbers and math. The basic problem is that it's almost impossible to describe technical material in a way that non-technical reads will care about, and at the same time keep it interesting to a technical reader. The worst examples fail on both accounts. This book doesn't fall to that level, but it doesn't exactly succeed, either.The best thing about this book, besides the good job it does in telling the very facts of the matter, is that it does a good job touching on larger issues that Ramanujan's story brings up, both on a personal level and a larger level. For Ramanujan himself, one is almost forced to ask what he would have accomplished if he had been born in a time or place where he had easier access to a greater range of mathematics in his early age. Would he have been far greater than he really ended up being? Or, perhaps, the barriers he overcame ended up causing only delays, not reductions, in his accomplishments. Or, maybe, he would have found an outlet that let him achieve an easy-enough normal life, and wouldn't have felt the strong force to push him to continue looking for other mathematicians with whom to connect.On a large scope, Ramanujan's story introduces questions about how societies treat people that have a lot to contribute in a non-traditional way. Ramanujan could have easily gotten frustrated with his initial inability to connect with someone that recognized and could foster his potential, and we would have lost all of his contributions. How much of that is due to where he was born? He eventually found success in England, but he had trouble in all of his non-math academics; I can easily imagine that most educational systems might have trouble dealing with that. And while Ramanujan did eventually find academic success in England, he encountered a huge number of other problems there. I'm sure that part of that was due to the time in which he lived, but I think that even now he wouldn't completely fit in, and would have problems.Anyone that finds Ramanujan interesting would enjoy reading this book."
14,0349104522,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11697349-a-tm,4,"The Man Who Knew Infinity: A Life of the Genius Ramanujan , is a heart wrenching, tragic life story of great Indian Mathematician. If you are an Indian student you must have seen him on many Math academic book cover pages. Had Ramanujan something extraordinary to offer the world? What was the nature and extent of his genius, if genius it was?  This book has answered all these questions well enough, only drawback I feel is, its pretty hard to follow the sequence of the events. He was so seduced by higher mathematics lost interest in everything, even failing in school. Poverty, conservative family, drawbacks of the poor education system and lack of access to modern books were some of the challenges he faced. It’s unfortunate that none of the India mathematicians properly understood him, that he’d not be able to find there the expertise and encouragement he needed, that he should instead write to Cambridge, or elsewhere in the West, for help.G.H. Hardy was the first mathematician to discover his talent, and while he collaborated extensively with Ramanujan who he “treated supremely well professionally” in Cambridge, he never quite grew to be a close friend or confidante of the young Indian mathematician.The day after Ramanujan died, his doctor Subramanian Chandrasekhar wrote in his diary: ""If he had been allowed to follow my instructions, this double tragedy need not have taken place. The neglect of Ramanujan during his early phase—perhaps partly due to the ignorance of his contemporaries, as well as his relatives’ (mother’s and wife’s) contributory (I almost feel like using the stronger word “criminal”) negligence have contributed to this double tragedy—a tragedy which is too deep for tears"" ."
15,0349104522,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7094406-rohan,3,"As someone who grew up in Southern part of India, I knew about Ramanujam and some his stories since childhood. The Author has definitely done his research and he is right about almost everything that he mentions in this book. I can clearly see that someone who has never heard about this Mathematician before would enjoy this book far more than I did since I vaguely knew his stories. Nevertheless, if you are interested in Maths, you should probably read this book."

It was a place where there was less, as it were, to distract you-just rice fields, temples, and hidden gods.This leaves no doubt about the fact that Ramanujan must be religious, however many of his friends did not think so but he was indeed a religious person who had inherited this tradition from his Mother mostly. Author has traveled to this part of the country to gather information about Ramanujan's early life, but it seems that what he was writing was more about Indian culture than about Ramanujan. It was good. Writing was excellent but he just overdid it. Many a times the book was not focused on the subject matter and it killed my mood. Srinivasa Ramanujan Iyengar received little encouragement in his growing obsession for mathematics--fueled particularly by his discovery of a forty-year-old math book written by an English tutor. Nevertheless, Ramanujan began compulsively filling his own notebooks with scribbled mathematical theorums, heedless of the fact that he was flunking out of one after another of the area's universities, all designed by the British to train native administrators rather than cultivate Indian genius. Ramanujan's life was filled with hardships and struggles and also with his poor financial conditions, he was not able to get proper guidance and motivation to fuel his mathematics interest. However, things got changed when he wrote to a Professor and a British mathematician, G. H. Hardy Greatly impressed, Hardy arranged for Ramajuran to join him in Cambridge, where the Indian enjoyed the joys of subsidized intellectual labor and international appreciation at the price of giving up the daily spiritual sustenance provided by his own culture. The trade-off proved too much. Prevented from returning to India once World War I commenced, cut off from the spiritual element he'd always integrated into his mathematical theories, and with only the ascetic atheist, Hardy, for company, Ramanujan went into a steep physical decline. Seven years after his arrival in England, at age 33, he was dead.Ramanujan's intimacy with numbers can be pointed out from an incident which is rather famous. 
One day, Hardy paid a call on Ramanujan and commented with typical brusqueness that the number of the cab he had taken, 1729, was ""rather a dull number,"" adding that he hoped it wasn't a bad omen. ""No, Hardy,"" Ramanujan replied without missing a beat. ""It is a very interesting number. It is the smallest number expressible as the sum of two cubes in two different ways."" (The two sums of cubes are 12 plus 1 and 10 plus 9 .) 
A good read but it lacked something which I was looking for, I am a bit disappointed but I still recommend it to anyone who is interested in reading about this great man. It is an inspiring account of a person who grew up from poverty to become one of the most celebrated mathematician of all time."
18,0349104522,http://goodreads.com/user/show/68316850-gavin,4,"One of the best biographies I've ever read. (The subtitle says it is about Ramanujan, but it is equally about Hardy, that perfect British intellect: more crystalline than Russell, more lofty than Moore, more self-critical than Hare, more fun than anyone, loveable atop it all.) Ramanujan's story is of course maximally moving to anyone with a shred of curiosity or pity. The most moving part of all is an absence, one of the darker thoughts among all thoughts: 

How many Ramanujans, his life begs us to ask, dwell in India today, unknown and unrecognized? And how many in America and Britain, locked away in racial or economic ghettos, scarcely aware of worlds outside their own?

His research is patent throughout: he decodes South Indian religion and cuisine, British upper-class slang, and even something of the impressiveness of higher mathematics, while using mere natural language:

Ramanujan's work grants direct pleasure to only a few - a few hundred mathematicians and physicists around the world, perhaps a few thousand. The rest of us must either sit on the sidelines, and, on the authority of the cognoscenti, cheer - or else rely on vague, metaphoric, and necessarily imprecise glimpses of his work.


...mathematics is not best learned passively; you don’t sop it up like a romance novel. You’ve got to go out to it, aggressive, and alert, like a chess master pursuing checkmate.
Ramanujan himself left a tiny dense literature that we are still decoding:

Ramanujan's notebooks formed a distinctly idiosyncratic record. In them even widely standardized terms sometimes acquired new meaning. Thus, an ""example"" — normally, as in everyday usage, an illustration of a general principle — was for Ramanujan often a wholly new theorem. A ""corollary"" — a theorem flowing naturally from another theorem and so requiring no separate proof — was for him sometimes a generalization, which did require its own proof. As for his mathematical notation, it sometimes bore scant resemblance to anyone else's.

Many passages raise goosebumps: Kanigel unites the abstract and the bodily, the true and the human all-too-human.You cannot say much about Ramanujan without resorting to the word self. He was self-willed, self-directed, self-made. Some might conceivably label him selfish for his preoccupation with doing the mathematics he loved without any great concern for the better of his family or his country...Hardy discovered Ramanujan? Not at all: a glance at the facts of 1912 shows that Ramanujan discovered Hardy.A life-giving book."
19,0349104522,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8325737-philipp,4,"Wonderful biography of Srinivasa Ramanujan, one of the most ""romantic"" figures of the history of mathematics and science - born relatively poor, no contact with universities, shut out due to an extremely rigid system, no training in mathematics, a pure autodidact who somehow managed to come up with novel and outstanding results but was seen as a bit of a crank, then was invited to the UK by Hardy to finally come in contact with the greats of mathematics, finally got recognition, published a slew of highly original mathematics, but then he caught TB and died at age 33.The book doesn't come close to his genius, but that's something that baffled even his contemporaries. Since Ramanujan died so young his great contemporary and benefactor G. H. Hardy takes up quite a lot of space in the book; I'd wager 40% of the book focuses more on Hardy than Ramanujan.The book itself is sometimes too American for my taste - Indian and British life explained with examples from baseball or horse-races. A rather uncomfortable 20 pages or so speculating about Hardy's sexual orientation (who cares?). It also concentrates on the absolute layman as the audience, so you may be bored when the author starts to explain (for example) factorials. Then again, this is a hard decision to make as the author - do you make it very simple and get a general audience or do you assume some knowledge and alienate many?Edit 2015-11-18: Looks like a movie based on this book is screening in cinemas now: IMDB page, Wikipedia."
20,0349104522,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3745086-jayesh-shah,5,"This book describes the life of Srinivasa Ramanujan. He was an Indian mathematician of early 20th century. The book is written beautifully. The author gives all the relevant information like local customs, religion, geography, and family dynamics at appropriate places while describing the life of Mr. Ramanujan. The friendship between two great mathematicians, G. H. Hardy and S. Ramanujan is narrated in great details and makes a very important part of this book. Those two men were as different as they can get. Hardy was an atheist, outgoing, loved cricket, tennis, and was methodical; Ramanujan was on the other hand an orthodox Brahmin, shy, introvert and his mathematics lacked proper systematic steps and was devoid of proofs. Yet, they became the best of friends and enriched each other’s lives. They completed each other. I am glad that the author has included some mathematics in the book. It is not so much that the reader may get distracted and lose the link in the story. Mr. Kanigel is very right when he says that in India, even decades after independence, many potential Ramanujans are ignored. Also, India recognizes the talent of her own people only after the west does. Time and again, people have witnessed this phenomenon. I believe this is a very nicely written biography of a very remarkable man. "

The way all threads are connected with such sumptuous details in chronological events-order ,perhaps it keeps your intrigue alive through-out ! The way Hardy's idiosyncrasies and peculiar thinking are portrayed , Trinity's legacy and its unique system is unleashed , the way Kumbhkonam's contour is designed in texts , and the way Ramanujan's beautiful mind and his work are explained, make your all senses flabbergasted ! The adversaries in which Ramanujan nourished his intellectual thirst and came up with such masterpiece theorems -in his own exposition *by treading on the grooves* - without solidifying them with *Rigor* makes him unique among all F.R.S of all times and probably ,the best fertile mathematician of his time..Thanks Robert for such a deep account ,which was not discovered in any other Biographies of such a genius..

Interested in mathematics from early on, Ramanujan overcame all barriers, including a complete lack of formal mathematical training, to become one of the greatest mathematicians of the 20th century. The book explores Ramanujan's mind, which worked very differently from an average 'great' mathematician. Focused on intuitive reasoning rather than rigorous proof, Ramanujan was often disregarded, only to be discovered later By Cambridge mathematician G.H.Hardy. Together until his very early demise, Ramanujan and Hardy performed some of the most exciting mathematics ever. If you're a fan of scientific biographies, you NEED this in your collection."

Inspite of being shrouded by circumstances involving British Rule, the World War I, illnesses, cultural obligations, his sheer willpower to pursue what he loved, is astounding. He possessed the rarest of the abilities - to imagine and invent mathematics, to be able to shine a light on paths that people never knew existed, and be able to enter into conclusions others would take years to prove.Though digressing on some counts from Ramanujan's life, the book provides a realistic picture about his life, and the monstrous amount of work that he could do & inspire for the years to come, in a very short life.

Through the relation between Ramanujan and Hardy, the book reveal a deep collision between intuition and deductive rigor in science, and moreover, between eastern and western way of thinking. I already love Hardy quite a bit, now Ramanujan-Hardy is going to be my most favorite scientific partnership of all time. For me, an Asian student on western soil for intellectual pursuit, Ramanujan's journey to the west also resonates on a personal level. Extra points go to the author for doing a great job at explaining number theoretical problems to lay readers, at least to give a taste of it, instead of avoiding the math all together or jargoning it through as in many science books nowadays. "
27,0349104522,http://goodreads.com/user/show/14867987-pradeep-t,5,"This is one of the fascinating books I've read in a long time. Though I am aware of Srinivasa Ramanujan and his achievements, this books takes us through an entirely different journey altogether. Author had researched every nook and corner to gather the much required materials to write about the man who knew infinity.Like all the regular biographies, even this book takes its steps in a chronological order, starting with the birth of Ramanujan and his upbringing in the small town of Kumbhakonam in Madras. The book goes on building the curiosity of its readers with the events unfolding slowly yet steadily. We will come to know about the various facets of Srinivasa Ramanujan and his family, especially his mother Komalattammal and his not so happening father Srinivasa. Like one would expect or rather surprising factor is the one where you would find a strong headed woman in the likes of Komalattammal, the mother of Srinivasa Ramanujan in those patriarchal days of 1880's. Her steadfast or rather stubborn behavior has shaped the life of Ramanujan in the most unusual way. Striving to uphold the religion beliefs despite the hardships of day to day life is something one would witness during those late 1880's.As the book progresses further, we will witness the prodigal Ramanujan slowly opening to mathematics. By the time Ramanujan had reached high school, it was almost decided that he is going to leave a mark in mathematics. During his college days, Ramanujan was so engrossed in mathematics that, he hardly gave a thought to other subjects and as expectedly he had failed every other subjects except maths. But that didn't made Ramanujan a week minded person, he got a job as a clerk in Madras port trust and in parallel worked on his mathematics discovery.Later events of his life is all known to the world. His letters to various British mathematicians and the rejections he faced at the beginning and finally it was G.H. Hardy who found the caliber in Ramanujan papers and asked him to accompany him in England for further exploration. Its a fascinating read from the book. Though Ramanujan had lived only 5 years in England and in Cambridge, he had achieved all that he could possibly imagine. A BA degree in Mathematics, The Fellowship of the Royal Society or popularly known as F.R.S and a fellowship of Trinity college and his numerous papers being published in London school of mathematics as an individual and also in collaboration with other mathematicians and especially with Hardy. What makes this book so distinct is the fact that, it goes deep inside the lives of Ramanujan as well as Hardy. After all they are also like any other human being and even they had shortcomings. This book documents those details in a respectful manner to say the least. Ramanujan, at the peak of his illness tried to commit suicide by jumping in-front of train or Hardy tried committing suicide by downing the pills in excess just shows how much these two might have suffered to excel in their respective career and was striving for success. Despite the soaring growth in Ramanujan's mathematical achievements, he had faced constant hardships from the family front. He didn't brought his wife Janaki to England to live with him that made the conditions worse back home. The relationship between Ramanujan's mother and wife was not at all good and Komalattammaal constantly tried to get rid of Janaki by constantly taunting her to get away from her home. This has tormented Ramanujan very much and he was trying all his might to bring matters to the close, which he succeeded partially after his return to India, but didn't live long enough to see those changes impact in any way.Overall, I would highly recommend this book to be read by everyone. The author has also made enough efforts to bring those little mathematical equations and tried to explain the readers in a better and simplistic manner. Its not a mere read, its a journey back in the late 1880's and early 1900's to witness the genius of Ramanujan who knew Infinity. "
28,0349104522,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4060448-sundarraj-kaushik,5,"What a brilliant man! This phrase keeps repeating in one's head as one reads the book. There is no place where this does not echo.While the world thinks that Indians are great at Mathematics, it needs to be admitted that the contribution of India to Mathematics after discovering zero in 5th Century AD is truly zero. Srinivas Ramanujan, one would say has been an oddity and his contribution to pure Mathematics is immense. Thanks to G. H. Hardy that his discoveries saw the light of the day. Had it not been for him, Ramanujan would have remained a clerk in any of the governmental departments and his discoveries would have disappeared along with him.His discoveries, or probably inspirations would probably be a better word still, impress the Mathematicians even after nearly a century of his having passed away. The book is about his journey to stardom from nothingness that he had to endure in India. He just wrote out equations out of thin air, no proof, not reasoning, just equations. Mathematicians after him, including Hardy and Littlewood have had to work hard to prove his equations and conclusions. A very minuscule of them have not stood the test of proof.The one reason he succeeded could be because he never got interested in that academics that the Britishers had imposed on the Indians. This education as Lord Macaulay had famously said was good enough to generate clerks for the British Empire to administer India. We have successfully continued this and continue to produce clerks. We will never get another Ramanujan unless we break out of it.That was beside the point. The book is the outcome of in depth research by the author about all aspects of Ramanujan's life. The author pieces together information from a multitude of sources (see the reference section, it is huge) and has built a coherent history of his life. The book covers the period from his birth to his death and a little beyond. The book also mentions the key discoveries like the equations in infinite series, the mock theta function, the partition formula etc.One sore cliche points that stands out is that, maybe things would have been different if Ramanujan's mother had not stopped his wife, Janaki, from going to England. If she had Ramanujan may have been better looked after and would have had more time generation equations instead of stirring vegetables and curry in pots and it is likely that he may not have fallen sick under the ministrations of his wife. Maybe we would have had a Ramanujan Junior to carry on the legacy as well.A fantastic read. Do not miss it."
29,0349104522,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4523693-andrew-mcmullen,0,"The Man Who Knew Infinity by Robert Kanigel explores the uprbining of legendary math genious Ramanujan. The book starts in his earliest upbrinings through childhood. He grew up in the small slums of Madras, where class and and religious segregation defined societys laws. A devout muslim, Ramanujan's wore traditional clothing, was a strict vegetarian, and reguarly attended the temple. His high school was rundown, and deprived in American standards, however for the rural area, where most teenagers didn't attend high school, his school was considered one of the highest standards. Ramanjuan quickly surpassed his classmates, and even teachers in mathematics. Craving more than the old textbooks could offer, he quickly ventured into self learning teaching himself complex proofs and higher mathematical concepts. From the book it is clear that presentation means everything to him; his family gravely pressures him into being the perfect son.While the setting of Ramanujan's life is certainly different than anything I've ever known. However, I can see much of the same culture through foreign kids at Great Valley even. While I'm not sure I agree with the stereotypes that Indians and Asians are the smartest kids in school, I can deffinitely see the basis of those stereotypes. They're parents deffinitely hold them to a high standard, pressuring them to do well in school and become young scholars. Something that I've noticed thats completely different than American culture is the caste system. Here in the United States we grew up with the belief that anyone can succeed if the work hard and really want it. This is deffinitley not so in Indian culture. You're born in a certain class, you can never escape that class, and you're children are then born into the class. Roles in Indian culture are static. "
30,0349104522,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4771416-elizabeth,4,"I believe there is a ""math world"" which I go into when I really get into a proof or equation or whatnot. For me, like many others I imagine, it is a foreign land wherein I don't speak the language fluently nor know the local customs. Ramanujan, however, seemed to be native to it and preferred being there.This book provides a decent portrait of the individual: he was a normal man who had his share of misfortunes, troubles, and difficulties but who also had joys and epiphanies - oh, and happened to be very, very good at math. Examined as well is Hardy and his relationship with Ramanujan. Pertinent parts of number theory are explained at a novice level but more greatly emphasized are the papers, discoveries, and practical innovations that blossomed as a result of Ramanujan's work.Anyone who has wondered about Ramanujan should read it."

He evoked the characters of Ramanujan and Hardy, and the feeling of India and England and their relationship at that time. He provided a sense of World War I, and some of the importance of Ramanujan for India and the rest of the world during his lifetime as well as after his death. The depth he achieved in this biography is an uncommon accomplishment. In addition, it is difficult to provide a sense of the mathematics involved without the reader being a mathematician, and yet again this was provided. Finally, Mr. Kanigel's analysis at the end was a step above most writers, if not several steps. Very nicely done. I highly recommend this work; it is a gem."

However, here are some problems I had with the book:1. Flowery descriptions that were in some places completely ridiculous and in some others just wrong2. Lots of irrelevant detail (I don't care about the author of the book that was read by Ramanujan, or the boat he traveled to England in)3. A lack of personal detail that would have made the people written about fully realised and fleshed outThere were some others, but in the end, my main problem was that I came away with a good idea of Ramanujan as a mathematician but very little idea of him as a man."

Wish we had a culture that treated its women better !!Writing wise, I wish the author didn't spend so many pages writing G.H. Hardy's biography. Would have helped me struggle less thru the first half of the book :)"
34,0349104522,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4763420-kaelan,3,"Talented biographers tend to be drawn towards one of two kinds of subject. First, there are the people whose lives hold some sort of intrinsic appeal—people like Gandhi, Shakespeare, et. al. But we also have subjects whose biographical-worthiness requires a writer's acumen to uncover (see, for instance, the tale of Henrietta Lacks). Crucially, each kind presents the biographer with a challenge, whether it involves saying something noteworthy or proving that the story's even worth telling in the first place.For better or for worse, Ramanujan's life lies somewhere between the two. Raised in poverty and nearly ruined by a rigid educational system, yet still ranked amongst history's most original minds, the Indian mathematician cuts quite the fascinating figure. But his story—at least in the Western world—has remained criminally under-told. Which means, in turn, that Robert Kanigel didn't have a whole lot of competition in the biography department whilst writing this book...Not that The Man Who Knew Infinity is a particularly shoddy work—not by any stretch. Among other things, I admire Kanigel's decision to touch upon some rather technical aspects of Ramanujan's work, as well as his willingness to probe the dichotomy between East and West. That being said, while this book lacks the rigour of the scholarly biography, Kanigel's prose style—clunky and baroque—evokes the dryer side of academic writing.All in all, a very interesting read. But one whose interest lies far more with the subject matter than with the author."
35,0349104522,http://goodreads.com/user/show/115196-colleen,4,"3.75 stars. The book tells the story of Ramanujan, a self-taught mathematical genius who grew up poor in southern India at the turn of the 20th century, without proper instruction in math (or anything else, because he was stubborn). You don’t have to be interested in math to enjoy this book. It’s about finding finding ways to nurture genius as best as possible, particularly when it’s found in places unsung for producing the cream of the crop. He had to struggle to come to the attention of the western world of academics. His story is fascinating, but this is also where the book fails a bit (probably through no fault of the author). We get detailed information about his life, but something still feels missing. I think it’s the lack of insight into Ramanujan’s experience of the world and his achievements. We know how he behaved sometimes and can make conjectures about how he felt, but that’s about it. We often get more insight into other people. There is a long section of the book devoted to his mentor, Hardy, that both gives us a better picture of the overall scene but also drags on too long. Given that Ramanujan died young though, the author likely had limited material to deal with. There are also a few places where the author describes many ways in which Ramanujan was mistaken, but then seems to provide less information on his revolutionary breakthroughs. Geniuses make mistakes of course, but I expected more focus on the genius parts. Finally, the book could have been shorter with the same impact. Nonetheless, I’m not a mathematician and I still enjoyed the book."

When n is 2 , the expression denotes Trinity, when n is 3 , the expression denotes 7 , the Saptha Rishis and so on.""This explains what he meant when he said: ""An equation for me has no meaning unless it expresses a thought of god"" If only he had been an occasional writer, one could have understood more about his metaphysical side. I had always thought that a detachment from god is of utmost importance to deal with science. This paragraph or the devotion he had completely breaks that notion I had so far. This biography was so different from ones that I have read previously. It dwells more on the scenery and the emotions of the characters and the landscape ( banks of Cauvery in Kumbakonam, Cambridge campus, Egmore railway station , etc ) . The biographer is amused by the Indian society, marriage system, and the quarreling between a newly wed wife and a mother -in - law ! Definitely a great read."

Can we understand an artist without a feeling for the works? A philosopher without a glimpse into the philosopher's beliefs? Well, this brilliant biography accepts the challenge and succeeds in giving the reader a tangible taste of the remarkable mathematical theorems of Ramanujan, as well as the mysterious origins of his creativity. It is meticulously researched, with a super bibliography. It cross-references other biographies and journal publications throughout the text. A profoundly moving, empathetic and enthralling work, that draws one close to the tragic, transient brilliance and the character of the man."

I'm obsessed with Ramanujan and have been since watching the movie, but my husband had the book way before that and so eventually I started reading it. I ended up getting the audiobook but would reference the book frequently when the math equations came up and they do. My only reason for the 4-star rating is that you will feel like you are also getting a biography on G.H. Hardy. Now I know he discovered and helped Ramanujan but the book goes into way more detail on his personal life both during the middle of the book (where you learn about Hardy's childhood etc etc) and in the epilogue. I found that to be excessive, and unnecessary to draw conclusions or assumptions about the nature of their relationship but whatever, I loved this story so much that I put up with a little too much Hardy to be able to get every ounce of Ramanujan.There is the story of Ramanujan himself, of course, sad, romantic, tragic, sublime, seductive, obsessive, and simply beautiful. But then there is more, the questions of how education structure can shun the young genius mind and how poverty and hardship can be the difference between world class contributions to a field of study and total obscurity.... And this book has after a long time rekindled my love of mathematics, so I cannot thank Ramanujan enough. A most beautiful story that will live with me for a long time. HIGHLY RECOMMEND, but you need the paper copy to reference the math in case you care to follow along ... at least to the minor extent that we can with our laymen and limited knowledge."

Fundamentally it's about two men: S. Ramanujan, the Indian math genius who almost literally sprang from ""nowhere"" with notebooks full of his own work; and George Hardy, an elite Cambridge Don who was known worldwide. In addition, the culture and lifestyle of SE India (Tamal speaking area) and the UK academic elite areas are described in vivid color. Apparently people still, to this day, are writing PhD theses based on proving and describing uniquely Ramanujan's work from his notebooks. Ramanujan was not able to complete successfully a basic ""bachelors"" degree in India, failing all subjects but math. Yet he was able, with mostly self-study, to ""do math"" almost intuitively, skipping (at least in his notebook) intermediate steps most of us have to take to maintain logic, and people still marvel on his almost superhuman grasp on reaching creative solutions. The font is a bit small and the book is lengthy at 375 pages, even excluding the extremely complete reference sections. I read and re-read several sections. Published in 1991, this book has been around for a while, but it's a wonderful discovery (thanks to my book club) and would be a terrific gift for an aspiring math student. "

No doubt that Kanigel was exhaustive and thorough, it’s clear he spent a lot of time in India and chasing down leads. The narrative was dragged down a lot by the detail, especially the chapter on Harold Hardy’s youth. There was a lot of overanalysis that I skimmed through, but overall I liked it and it was informative. Just a shame Ramanujan died at 32. Being of Indian descent a math/chemistry teacher myself, I have long wondered how much untapped STEM potential there might be in my home country and Ramanujan is most symbolic of that. His life has not only produced some great math but also led to scholarships and inspiration to many young minds since. "

What could have been a dry documentary of a genius so far advanced for normal mortals to understand is instead turned into a heart-moving account of Ramanujan's life. Those days light up in the ink of Kanigel and the reader gets to peek from behind the curtains of how the short life of this Indian genius unfolded in two continents. As an Indian, I feel the emotions even more deeply over his constant struggles in professional as well as personal life. And there we shall remain indebted to Kanigel for I would never have understood the hardships, the barriers and mighty disadvantages that Ramanujan had to overcome to get his share of recognition. I would not even have understood his genius if this book did not do such a good job at laying it open for the privileged generation of ours. This is the way to write non-fiction and I would hold this one in my to-refer library. P.S. I have not seen the movie. "
44,0349104522,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6624611-simon-yoong,4,"I had high expectations for this book, and by and large this is a good read. The writer does a well rounded effort to chronicle the life of India's greatest mathematician. But i withheld the final star because, in a sense, it was too detailed. Kanigel spends a lot of time detailing small little things instead of keeping the the bigger picture. And i felt the writing shows its age.Good biography, could do with an updated rewrite."
45,0349104522,http://goodreads.com/user/show/37332006-ganesh-sanal,4,"One of the most detailed, researched and structured biography that I've ever read. The author goes beyond the normal storytelling narrative by equally valuing​ the the great mathematician's character and motivations. He even succeeds a great deal in making the layman reader appreciate the complex mathematical topics and Ramanujan's contributions to those fields.He was a perfectionist but I felt that he went a bit overboard on several occasions. Since I am interested in reading about Ramanujan, I am curious about the people in his life. But when several chapters are devoted to explain the trivias in someone else's life, it gets irritating. They may be valuable as reference material to his fellow historians but to me they were boring. On the positive side, it was a good material to use my newly learned binge reading techniques. "
46,0349104522,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5838785-ivana,5,"It saddens me to no end that Ramanujan isn't as widely known as, say, Einstein or Newton. Certainly, this man contributed so, so, so much to the field of mathematics and beyond. Today, his equations are used to understand black holes and other aspects of the universe which, to him, were widely unknown and unfathomable.This biography is really dense and replete with details that may not add to the story of his life, but I applaud the author for being so meticulous, taking the reader on a biographical tour of such an extraordinary life. It is hard to summarize the genius that Ramanujan was. Here he was, this humble, poor man from southern India who was a mathematical genius, solving equations and problems that baffled the most brilliant minds of the western ivy league institutions. No one could ever explain how he knew what he knew; after all, he had no formal education, but had a keen sense of the mathematical language. He was a deeply spiritual man and had a sense of divine intervention; when asked how he knew what he knew, he would say that equations have been put on his tongue by his god, and that is how he knows it. As an atheist, this is a strange but nevertheless fascinating tidbit to me. The sad part about his life is the sheer discrimination he endured in Britain. India was still a colony, and being a southern Indian added another complexity to his already difficult life. He was denied fellowship only because he was Indian. His progress was stymied at every step by the ruling elite, and then there was the war which certainly didn't help. Yet, despite all that, he managed to make several breakthroughs in mathematics.His life was taken far too early; he died from tuberculosis when he was 32 years old. Much like with other great humans who have left this planet too early, I wonder what could he have achieved had he lived? What wonderful discoveries would he had found if just given a few more years, or perhaps decades? How different would the scientific landscape be today? How much farther would we have gone in our understanding of black holes, among other things, had he lived longer? After his death, one of his notebooks was found and it is now on display at Trinity College in Cambridge. This work was used by many people for the purposes of scientific advancements. Yet ,Ramanujan never quite achieved the glory he's owed. He was, by all accounts, as important and revolutionary as Newton, Einstein, or Jacobi, yet, he isn't a typical ""household name"" the way Einstein is. And it is sad. I hope that changes in the future (it does remind me of Nikola Tesla in a way; his glory stolen by crooked Edison, and his name fading into obscurity until five years ago when The Oatmeal's founder kickstarted a campaign to build a Tesla museum). Ramanujan deserves to be recognized widely for his achievements. He was an extraordinary man."
47,0349104522,http://goodreads.com/user/show/49404199-abbas,5,"Great book, in style and content. Exploring the background environment in a way that isn't boring or too little. I must admit that the first part of Ramanujan's story was a bit dull. I liked the part about Hardy quite a lot, and I think this book is more like on the two of them than just Ramanujan."
48,0349104522,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10817538-ward-muylaert,5,"Very approachable book. Worth a read regardless your background, but if you have a somewhat mathematical or science background, you probably ought to read this to learn about this mathematical genius. (or if you're feeling lazy, I hear they made a movie out of it too...)It is tragic to think what could have been had he been properly guided from a young age/not died way too young. Serves as a reminder that even now we are failing many smart kids and young adults by not giving them the chances they need."

He would inspire generations of mathematicians. And on the top of it, he was an Indian. From the age of 20 he was jobless cause of the tyrant British rule in India. But, this man as stated by Hardy, ""He invented himself"". This book is worth reading for all those thinking to build their career in the field of academics. The reason it took 1 year for me to complete this book because the book is 400+ pages which was quite tiring for me to complete. Last but not the least, this book may be tiring but it will be in the end that the reader will discover what diamond Ramanujan was."

Hardy); the maths content gets three stars. I was interested to know about the man Ramanajun, but I more so wanted to know about his maths. A quote from the books ultimate chapter reveals the difficulty in this, and why Kanigel should not be blamed:""Ramanajun's work grants direct pleasure to only a few- a few hundred mathematicians and physicists around the world, perhaps a few thousand. The rest of us must either sit on the sidelines and, on the authority of the cognoscenti, cheer, or else rely on vague, metaphoric, and necessarily imprecise glimpses of his work. ""Kanigel gives just that: mere glimpses into the work of the genius. It's enough for most people, I would assume. For those more math-inclined, the tastes Kanigel supplies of the type of work Mr. Ramanujan was doing will leave you wanting more. I would have loved to have seen more in this book, but I won't pretend like I would have been apt to understanding it."
53,0349104522,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7743254-michael-connolly,4,"Tamil Nadu:This book is a biography of an autodidact from India, and one of the deepest mathematicians of the twentieth century, with magical powers of intuition. Srinivasa Ramanujan was born in 1887 Tamil Nadu in Tamil Nadu in Southern India. He excelled at mathematics from an early age, but was unable to obtain a college degree, because he refused to study subjects that did not interest him. Some scholars in India helped foster his talent, but none could understand his results. Hinduism:Ramanujan was a Brahmin and took his Hindu religion very seriously. He was deeply religious, not just with respect to ritual and traditions, but also in the sense of Einstein. Mathematics was a way to understand the divine. Ramanujan also liked to intrepret his dreams. Voyage to England: Ramanujan wrote to several mathematicians in England. One of them, G. H. Hardy, recognized his talent, and invited Ramanujan to come to England to complete his education at Cambridge University. Traveling across the seas was forbidden to observant Hindus, but the Cambridge mathematicians were able to persuade Ramanujan to come. Culture Shock:The English reserve was strange to Ramanujan, who was use to people being more friendly. The weather was cold, unlike South India. The English loved sports, especially cricket, but Ramanujan had no interest in sports. At the time there were few Indians in London, and even fewer in Cambridge.G. H. Hardy and Trinity College, Cambride:Hardy was one of the best mathematicians in England, known for reforming the Tripos mathematics examination and for bringing more rigor into English mathematics. Ramanujan had intuition; Hardy had rigor. They complemented each other. Ramanujan would write down an equation and Hardy would prove that it was true. Mathematics:Ramanujan did work on:(a) quickly converging infinite series for pi,(b) a particular kind of infinite series called continued fractions, (c) the number of different ways to write an integer as a sum of smaller integers (called a partition), (d) the distribution of prime numbers, (e) the relationship between the calculus of complex numbers and number theory (the study of the integers), (f) generalizations of trigonometric functions called elliptic functions, (g) elliptic curves in complex projective space, (h) the foundations for the subject area of modular forms, which describe symmetry in algebraic geometry. Food:Fresh fruits and vegetables were in short supply during World War I. He could not obtain the food he was use to in India, such as mangos and bananas. Ramanujan was a strict vegetarian because of his religion. He could not eat anything fried in lard, so he avoided eating meals at the college, which diminished his social life. Unlike his youth in India, in England Ramanujan had to cook for himself, because his wife Janaki did not accompany him to England. Health:During the Spring of 1917, Ramanujan became ill, probably from tuberculosis, brought on by malnutrition, in particular, by a lack of Vitamin D. Not only was his diet low in vitamin D, he spent little time in the sunshine. The body manufactures vitamin D when ultraviolet light falls on the skin. Ramanujan became lonely and depressed, and he returned to India after the war. Back home, his wife Janaki nursed him, but it was too late. Ramanujan died in 1920 at age 32. "
54,0349104522,http://goodreads.com/user/show/33462912-rohit-goswami,1,"I really wanted to like this book. I really wanted to. It is however, a crass portrait. Much of what is written of Hardy is either lifted from his own ""A Mathematician's Apology"" (which is fantastic) or mostly drivel. I have not had the chance to read other books on Ramanujan, but undoubtedly will come to the same conclusion. The book should have ended with his death, the post scripts are pretty much meaningless. It is unfortunate, in many ways, that the book fails completely to touch upon the mathematics. It is strange to me today, that the Royal Society was once moved to request the election of a man based on his mental state. Academia nowadays is a harsher world. Many times the book touts that Ramanujan in a different setting would have done more; but that is simply not true. Hardy and Littlewood succumbed to the Tripos, and Ramanujan (for whatever reasons) refused to be flexible in terms of his own education. That he still fought to get a degree; that the mathematics was never enough for him is just sad and endemic of the Indian condition. Indeed, much of this book at least, reeks of privilege. In today's terms; in the intellectual climate of our present day; no one can or should care for things which are not proven; and that is indeed how academia must function. I also see nothing especially endearing about Ramanujan; and certainly his family life and culture do no credit to the country nor academia; especially in the wake of his death.To be fair, the book is pretty well written, and the reason for one star instead of two is simply that; I would not inflict this story upon anyone."
55,0349104522,http://goodreads.com/user/show/15293135-dhruv-bhandula,5,"This book is an brilliantly written account of one of few mathematical gems our country has produced. The flow of the book is really good and it keeps you bound throughout its length. I really liked the fact that the writer has tried to keep the unusual but extremely fulfilling friendship between S. Ramanujan and G.H. Hardy. It is in fact a biography of both of these great mathematicians with their interaction acting as the focal point of the whole book.Ramanujan was really an exceptional personality who dared to dream and had the courage to sacrifice his comforts to pursue his dream. The book captures his failures, successes and emotions brilliantly. His extreme shyness, high self-motivation and the unwavering belief in his abilities led him to where he eventually reached, the pinnacle of pure mathematics in his time. Who knows what would have happened had he just given up on his abilities and decided to live a normal adult life which was the norm of his days.Hardy on the other hand was someone who came from a somewhat privilege background but had similar motivation towards mathematics. Most importantly he had the vision and forethought to recognize the talents of a self-taught man with no formal degree living thousands of miles away and took the huge risk of backing his talents keeping his academic reputation at stake. As Hardy once said, ""One of my biggest contributions to the field of Mathematics is my discovery of Ramanujan.""Both these men were poles apart in their personalities. Ramanujan was a quiet, shy, self-made man who trusted his intuitions. He was an ardent devotee of Devi Namagiri and believed his mathematical talents were the gifts of God. Hardy on the other hand was an immaculate writer, had contacts across the mathematical world, always followed the well written rules of mathematical proofs and was an atheist with very strong feelings towards this topic. Ramanujan hated physical activity of any kind while Hardy was a huge cricket and tennis enthusiast. Yet these two remarkable and different personalities worked together and done so much for the field of Mathematics that many of their results still baffle mathematicians around the world. Both of these men had remarkable personalities and believe me you will enjoy this book even if you don't have any interest in the field of Mathematics."
56,0349104522,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9696180-indira,5,"Never read a biography where my admiration was divided equally between the protagonist and the author. If Ramanujan came to life, it was because there was a tremendous effort that went into understanding the nuances of culture, religion and spiritual fabric that must be so foreign to Kanigel. To translate this understanding to an audience that didn't have the benefit of his extensive research with such ease, what an author he is! Ramanujan's life course was sketched in such a tangibly heart rendering manner that I might as well be watching the scenes unfold in a movie. And yet, the book doesn't ignore the beauty of mathematics that made Ramanujan what he is. Quite the contrary, it makes you wonder why math books aren't written by people who can tell it this way. Perhaps a lot of math- loathing people would have not turned out this way had they been reading from authors like this?And of Ramunajan himself, what can I say except that my secret dreams and demons came alive. Oh to be so close to success and yet to know that it is more than what you will ever receive! To see the goddess and yet seek validation, oh the frailty of human situation! Couldn't sleep for days.Not an ""unputdownable"" one this book. On the contrary, one you would savor slowly one chapter at a time, taking slow trips to British India to watch an Indian's struggle of self discovery and need for validation battle all odds. And mull on fate, ingenuity and human capability. Perhaps above all, about the improbability of a man knowing about infinity."
57,0349104522,http://goodreads.com/user/show/20454189-al-maki,4,"Ramanujan was born around 1890 near Madras into a poor Brahmin family. By most accounts he had the sort of genius in mathematics that comes along once a century, the mathematical equivalent of a Mozart. The book tells his life story, his struggle to find a way to do mathematics in a time and place that didn't regard him as a likely candidate for mathematical genius, his short career at Cambridge where he didn't fit and his consequent early death. It's a sympathetic account of what life was like for the administrative class of Indians under the Raj. It's also a good view of that state of academic mathematics in England at the time, perhaps not everybody's cup of tea, but interesting to somebody who has studied this material. I read the book because it was recently mentioned by Freeman Dyson in an interview. Dyson is an excellent mathematician himself and he was asked if it were possible to write a book about mathematics that is comprehensible to a layperson. He said he thought not, that the closest you could get was writing about a mathematician and he gave this book as an example. The author is not a mathematician but he does a surprisingly good job of presenting the concerns of these people and some of the significance of it. It is a well written, intelligent and sympathetic account of a brilliant man. It's one of those non-fiction books that focuses on a relatively narrow subject but in the process illuminates an era."
58,0349104522,http://goodreads.com/user/show/76014-raghu,4,"This is a biography of the self-taught Indian mathematical genius Srinivasa Ramanujan. Ramanujan was a number theorist par excellence. Many of the results that he defined in his famous 'Ramanujan's notebook' were analyzed many decades after his death and proved by mathematicians interested in the subject.The book chronicles the extraoridinary fortune of Ramanujan when Prof.Hardy in England responds to a letter of his containing some mathematical results. Those were the days of colonial India and it is a credit to Hardy to take seriously a handwritten letter by a 'native' on mathematics. But so starts the journey of Ramanujan's life in England with Hardy and his eventual return to India and dying of tuberculosis at the young age of 32.Robert Kanigal shows great skill and sensitivity in understanding the poor, brahminical, vegetarian background of Ramanujan and bringing it to life in this book. He even exhibits great insights as he touches on the complexities of Tamil brahminical marriages and the persecutions that Ramanujan's wife had to endure from her mother-in-law.Kanigel also does justice to Hardy and his personality. Often, books/essays on Ramanujan simply overlook this aspect.Strongly recommended."
59,0349104522,http://goodreads.com/user/show/14972518-vijai,5,"Life is a wily merchant and in his shop everything is for sale for the right price. This book convinced me that Mr. Ramanujam paid that price and gave the merchant a healthy tip while at that. How else would you explain that when you find out that he worked on mathematics in the hospital bathroom when he was hospitalized for Tuberculosis only to be later awarded an FRS for the same? None better than nod your head and say that the two gentlemen; Life and Mr. Ramanujam made a fair deal. Mr. Kanigel has been an excellent commentator of the lifestyle that is reminiscent of South India. There were times when I had caught myself nodding subconsciously. I could cite examples but his effort has been so high in developing this picture for the reader that it would be gross injustice to him if I lay it out in this review. Instead, a heartfelt BRAVO! should do as an alternative. I liked how Mr. Hardy, Neville and various other players were given due attention and space in this book for the general reader to imagine an almost exact picture that the author envisioned. Last but not the least, I believe, a rudimentary knowledge of college level applied mathematics would make this book far more enjoyable."
60,0349104522,http://goodreads.com/user/show/50297885-joy-d,3,"Born in 1887, S. Ramanujan grew up in a small town in Southern India, his intellectual powers undiscovered due in part to a highly rigid educational structure. He persisted in the attempt to pursue his passion for mathematics, writing to various famous scholars in England. Eventually, he was noticed and invited to Trinity College by British professor G.H. Hardy. On one hand, it proved a fruitful collaboration between a man of intuition and one dedicated to the formality of proof, which advanced the field of mathematics. On the other hand, it proved disastrous in that Ramanujan’s cultural, religious, and emotional well-being atrophied, leading to a severe decline in his health. Overall, I liked this biography. It brought to my attention a genius who overcame significant barriers to become one of the most renowned mathematical scholars. I had a few issues with the book, including repetition and unnecessary levels of detail on matters not critical to the story. In addition, I thought some of the concepts covered in the book may be inaccessible to a person not well-versed in advanced mathematics. Recommended to those interested in the history of mathematics and biographies of geniuses. "
61,0349104522,http://goodreads.com/user/show/16852328-vincent-b,5,"A really good book which does justice to the genius of Ramanujan. One thing about the book that really struck me is the amount of detail the author went into researching Ramanujan. In this book, you can read customs Ramanujan followed as Tamil Brahmin which were relevant in early 1900s, extremely detailed introduction to his mentor G.H Hardy's life and their is even mention about the secret society which Hardy was part of. Though the beginning is slow but it catches pace as the book progresses. By reading this book you not only get the idea of Ramanujan's life but also whatever touched Ramanujan's life, from Indian Civil Services, English Mathematics to WWI etc. The writing is bland sometimes but interesting otherwise. This is not a very easy read like ""Steve Jobs by Walter Isaacson"" but anyone who is genuinely interested in Maths or Ramanujan should definitely read it. Others will also be enriched by the reading. "

But the enduring fascination of his life lies more in the fact that he was apparently a completely untutored genius. The fact that he almost went completely ignored and forgotten is a reminder of the talent which in fact does go ignored and forgotten; and that in turn is a rebuke. On the other hand, I do also think that pre-occupation with this does play to the fantasies of those who implausibly fancy themselves the next Ramanujan."

75,0349104522,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8734089-shanmuganathan,5,"What can one say about a man who defied all odds to become one of the best mathematicians of the world having done rigorous research for less than 5 years? That too, when you come know that such a man originated from India (in early twentieth century) which was then enslaved by the British, the achievement becomes even more special. He had to survive the period in England in the extreme conditions of the first world war, his own ill-health notwithstanding. The man, Ramanujan, is really a genius of extra-ordinary brilliance. His biography ""The Man Who Knew Infinity - A Life of the Genius Ramanujan"" by Robert Kanigel is about a small town guy, Ramanujan, from an authentic Brahmin Iyengar family of Tamilnadu who turns the world over through his intuitive contributions in number theory (primes and partitions, in particular).This book is an inspiring tale of the conviction of Ramanujan who wanted to show the world his works and earn a well deserved recognition from the very best mathematicians. This books describes how his mother and friends in India along with his collaborator in Trinity college at Cambridge, Prof. Hardy, helped him achieve his ambition but at the expense of the genius himself. This book is a treasure for the aspiring researchers in the world. Although Indians can appreciate and relate the life of Ramanujan much better than others, this book is a homage to a great mathematician who belonged to the elite mathematical community of the world. Ramanujan is a pride of India but it is indeed a pity that he could not live long enough to see his notebooks reach millions of mathematicians and his contributions getting realized as key tools in later scientific inventions.The book starts with his early life in south Indian town called Kumbakonam where Ramanujan was educated. A tripos exam guide by Carr filled with mathematical formulas inspired Ramanujan into exploring mathematics while neglecting his other subjects in the college. This created a situation wherein earning a basic degree, which is the bare minimum expected of every student in that era, proved elusive as he used to fail in subjects other than mathematics. His requests for funding towards his research were initially rejected in India as he did not earn even a basic degree. Having married at an early age, he was forced to take up a job in port trust while still carrying out his passion for mathematics at leisure.Ramanujan knew that his works was something special and wanted recognition for his work which he did not get in India under British Raj. He was forced to write three eminent mathematicians in England. While two of them discarded his request and replied in negative, Hardy and his student Littlewood could see the real potential of Ramanujan's work. The major part of the book is the effort they took to bring Ramanujan to Cambridge and how they were able to add rigor in otherwise intuitively stunning discoveries of Ramanujan. Ramanujan did not have proper mathematical training on proving different conjectures he had developed. Hardy extracted the best out of Ramanujan apart from playing a key role in making him one of the Fellows of Royal Society (FRS).Ramanujan used to prepare food for himself as he was a strict vegetarian. Over time, Ramanujan unfortunately contracted tuberculosis which along with his dislike for English food, irregular eating habits, and English weather worsened his health. He could still write some major papers with Hardy even when he was admitted to sanatorium. The ongoing first world war made the sea journey unsafe and prevented Ramanujan to reach India for better care. Ramanujan however returned to India once the world war ended, but the damage to his physical and mental health had become irreversible by then. Kanigel presents this moving tale of a real genius who could not be saved by a nation who still prides in his incredible mathematical proofs.Kanigel gives various instances of his life when Ramanujan, who even offered a part of Royal Society fellowship to help the needy students, could have been saved by others. His mother could have sent his wife Janaki to take care of him in England as requested by him. Hardy could have cared more about his health and monitored it over time apart from pushing him to deliver his best mathematical contributions. Even after returning to India after first world war, Ramanujan's mother and wife could have created a more pleasant atmosphere instead of fighting over petty things. Ramanujan's belief in astrology through which he predicted that he would not survive more than 35 years also might have played a role in his demise.It is almost a century since Ramanujan left us. India has been an independent nation over the past 70 years. The basic question which is still left unanswered, why independent India could not foster more such Ramanujans. The question can be answered partly by trying to understand the mental attitude of present day students. Those students who are interested in higher studies go abroad just for the sake of getting higher reputation once they are back in India instead of the love and desire to contribute to science and mathematics by doing so. This attitude, I feel points to the failure of our basic primary and secondary school education. The inclination of students to basic mathematics and basic sciences after school education is still viewed as inferior in India.The attitude of the majority of established Indian academicians, who treat those researchers from abroad and India differently, is evident even now. Students going to any arbitrary university abroad to just earn his reputation are made to think they are 'Ramanujans' in the making. But they do not realize the fact that Ramanujan grew up in British Raj and he was forced to go abroad to get recognition. We have a lot of opportunities for research even in India nowadays. On the contrary, most of the present Indian students do not have strong inclination towards fundamental research and want to go to any arbitrary university abroad just driven by the social constraints. Lack of motivation and adequate funding in independent India towards research might also be a certain contributing factor. This again begs us to answer any key question. What is the benefit of India getting independence when we still feel inferior to those educated abroad? Should India have been made to develop into a nation with more intellectual self pride over the past 65 years? No one can answer these questions in the affirmative to even a certain extent by citing any example.After liberalization, many foreign companies have been allowed to setup their manufacturing centers in India. Every Indian is aware that the IT industry also contributes more to the welfare of the other nations than India. Indian students, who are inherently bright, are lured by the amount of money they can earn in these multi-national companies and are even forced by the changing Indian societal norms. Even the Indian managers of the so called multi-national companies act as brokers who tap the talent of the Indian students towards doing menial jobs in order to benefit foreign economy more than that of India. Students are misguided and shown wrong path more in independent India than prior to independence when we could get at least one Ramanujan. These are some of the reasons I feel why India is unable to nurture intuitive scientific and mathematical thinking in the students and which have certainly played a key role to the decline in high quality research of modern India.Most of the people in Brahmin community, who were close to Ramanujan, neglected Ramanujan's funeral as he had crossed the ocean and did not take bath afterwards in Rameswaram. The descendants of the same Brahmin community have developed into somewhat of a slave race contributing more to the companies originating in countries other than India. Even now, Brahmin community often feels it a criminal offense to work in either companies not owned by a foreigner or those who do not serve people of other nations. Indians who serve other Indians are looked down as somewhat inferior than those who live abroad. In short, we lack self pride which has intruded into the whole society. With such a social setting at present, Ramanujan's life is a real motivating factor for every Indian student who wants to pursue his own interests in basic science and mathematics. This book is a must read treasure for anyone who wants to develop a motivation towards a high quality dedicated research and contribute to the pride of India. "
76,0349104522,http://goodreads.com/user/show/56104661-mark,5,"As pure biography, Robert Kanigel’s story about a genius Indian mathematician succeeds unquestionably. But The Man Who Knew Infinity is so much more than that: it is an engaging, multidimensional account of two countries, two cultures, vastly different ideologies, complex caste systems, societal expectations, and the fervor with which religion is practiced. Furthermore, it is the story about the most unlikely friendship between two brilliant mathematicians, who could scarcely be more different from one another in every way.Srinavasa Ramanujan is an original. He literally invented himself as a mathematician. As a boy, he stumbled onto a book, A Synopsis of Results in Pure and Applied Mathematics by G. S. Carr, which fanned his spark of interest in the subject into a roaring, irrepressible flame which lasted his whole life. But because his fanatical interest was only in math, he regularly flunked all other subjects, even though he undoubtedly had the intellectual horsepower to pass them. Though his talent was recognized, the “system” required him to learn subjects beyond math. Friends and relatives helped him stumble from low-paying job to low-paying job. He himself launched a search for patronage from anyone who would fund his focused attention on a single subject—math.Rejected by numerous people and organizations, a letter of his finally found its way to G. H. Hardy, a Fellow of Trinity College at Cambridge University. Recipient of many such letters from genius pretenders, Hardy initially paid Ramanujan’s letter only passing interest. But returning to it, he was stunned to discover the originality of the work and marshalled forces to bring Ramanujan to Cambridge. Kanigel notes that whereas Ramanujan was the “Prince of Intuition”—with the ability to collapse multiple, complex steps into one—Hardy was the immovable “Apostle of Proof”—who demanded solutions to be proved in simple, flawless logic.Across four hundred pages, Kanigel describes in fascinating detail how this unlikely partnership becomes a dynamic and fertile period for both men as they produced of some of the most remarkable mathematical advances of the twentieth century. Driven purely by mathematics, they were scarcely friends in the traditional sense: they didn’t socialize, share recreational activities, or just hang out. The work was the only driver and the only desired benefit.Such was the intensity of Ramanujan’s focus that living for five years in England proved to be his downfall. An unshakably devout Brahmin, he struggled to feed himself as a strict vegetarian in 1914 England, often skipping meals or eating insufficiently-prepared ones. Several years of that, in addition to the drastic difference between the Indian sun and English climate, left Ramanujan seriously ill with tuberculosis, causing much time spent in a variety of sanatoria. His return to India brought recognition, accolades, and of course, money. The latter was of little interest to him after meeting the modest needs for himself and his family, and he humbly turned downed or returned amounts in excess of that.Kanigel does an admirable job of capturing the character of both Hardy and Ramanujan, each eccentric in his own way. Their friendship, though robust, was never overly warm or personal, but filled with mutual respect. Though Ramanujan died in 1920 at age 32, Hardy lived on into the late 1940s. The work of both men still finds many applications in modern-day mathematics."
77,0349104522,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4885566-shashi,4,"To say that Robert Kanigal's book “The Man Who Knew Infinity” is about the life and times of Indian Mathematician extraordinaire Srinivasa Ramanujan is actually a huge disservice not just to the author but also to the muse. Packed in the pages of this book is so much information on the times that prevailed before and after Ramanujan that the author needs to take a bow for the colossal amount of research he has conducted on every critical aspect of the man's life. Be it examining G.H.Hardy's life before he heard of Ramanujan, or be it the vessel S.S.Nevasa that took Ramanujan from India to England – the book is a treasure trove of information for anyone wanting to genuinely want to know more about the man behind the genius. In writing this bird's eye review of the book I find myself debating what to do add and what not to given that almost every page of this fantastic biography is peppered with thousands of little details that go beyond the names of Ramanujan and Hardy. But first things first – what this book does quite well is demystifies the man we in India (and abroad) have to come know only from the tilted face view of his photograph. As it turns out that photograph was taken during the worse times of his life in England as he prepared to make his journey back home after several months of ill health. Known to be a rather portly fellow Ramanujan fell victim to a bizarre case of TB from which he never fully recovered. Other photographs of him during his early days in England perhaps do more justice to the generous extremities he was actually known for. It is said he looked like a male version of his mother and that is quite a good way to put it. But his journey into England and then his return to India to draw his final breathe is really the tip of the iceberg. There is so much more that I did not know about this man before reading this book. Like, for instance, the ineffective and almost merciless education system prevalent during those days which disallowed him from having a proper education given his natural affections only towards Mathematics. Or the extremely absurd yet rigid in its roots – the Tripos Mathematics examination – that every Cambridge scholar hoping to become a Wrangler had to take. Or the dozens of people – Indian and British alike – who moved heaven and earth to bypass regulations and rewrote rules to get Ramanujan to Cambridge, to Trinity. Hardy, obviously, played a big role in being the one person who came closest to perhaps knowing what Ramanujan was about (and there is abundant evidence in the book for the contrary) but so were people like EH Neville, a lecturer in Madras, Hanumantha Rao (a math professor at an engineering college), Narayan Iyer (Ramanujan's colleague) and many more such intellectuals who came together to find a way to prove to the West, and to the world really, that Ramanujan was no crank and his theories were no “products of a fake genius” but a talent so rare and powerful that it had to be nurtured, cared for and if at all possible, amplified for generations to come.The book looks at Kumbakonam of that time (which surprisingly – and refreshingly – even after a century has still retained a lot of its old world charm) which became home for a young Ramanujan. We get to meet his formidable mother, a rather prominent force in his life, Komalatammal – a woman of a strong personality bordering on the irrational. We get to look at young Janaki's life who married Ramanujan at the tender age of thirteen but it would take her six more years to really get to know her husband who spent most of his remaining life in absentia. Her becoming a widow at the young age of twenty and then her struggle for survival in a society that had no mercy for widows makes for a compelling read. We also get a close up look at Hardy who steps out of the one dimensional image of being “that Brit with whom Ramanujan collaborated” and gets a background, a human face and soul and is layered with various levels of style, charisma, precision and elegance both as a mathematician and as an Englishman. A man who was forced to come out of his social shell to accommodate the rare talent in Ramanujan. As the author at one point states - “Hardy did not discover Ramanujan. It was Ramanujan who had discovered Hardy.” This rings true throughout their journey as two perfect contradictions in every imaginable way brought together for the love of numbers and the beauty of infinity.The book is also loaded with a lot of interesting mathematics. It occurred to me while reading the book that had I been (and I speak for a lot of my generation) introduced to mathematics in a fun way which made the connections seem logical I would perhaps had a better appreciation (and who knows, even love!) for the subject. But the reason I feel maths is hated around the world as a popular opinion is the bizarre and unnecessarily complicated ways in which it is learnt and taught across the board. The book, through simple examples of theories like continued fractions or mock theta functions or the prime number series captures such fantastic patterns that for a brief fleeting moment I could not help but admire the fun aspect of mathematics. The book also spends considerable time on the Brahminical roots that Ramanujan was woefully tied to. Given his orthodox ways in the religion and an absolute refusal to adapt to Western diets despite his falling health and consistent appeals from physicians it makes for a frustrating read in some parts as we watch a true gift, a miracle, wither away because of lessons he had picked up as part of his life before England. Much of his belief in God and the infinite nature of the universe stemmed from his love for mathematics. This is perhaps why his famous statement on equations and god's thought is so prominently heralded to this day. For him there was truth in all gods and yet his obstinate attitude towards anything alien, his gradual disconnection from the realms of reality, his slow descent into depression towards his final days in England – all point to a mentally fragile individual who had the nerves for mathematics but little else. His erratic eating habits, lack of exercise, reluctance in being part of a culture that was so different from his own – all add up eventually to bring to him the lethal disease.The book ends, as expected, with Ramanujan's death at the age of thirty two resembling a “bag of bones” due to his abnormal weight loss. It then goes on to talk about the events that took place after that, leading up to the 1980s when a lot of his theories were found and examined by prominent mathematicians around the world. To this day a lot of his work remains a mystery as more talents try to figure out just how a semi-educated poor Brahmin from an almost nondescript town in Southern India had the vision to formulate such complex equations to begin with. I guess that will forever remain a fascinating story to tell indeed.After several years of knowing about Ramanujan and having seen only glimpses of his work in passing I am finally happy that through Kanigel's book I finally got a front row seat to not only his life but also those whom he touched and inspired. His collaborations from 1914 until 1920 are perhaps one of the most significant ones in the history of world mathematics. I only hope that more people (and not just Indians – although I do feel this book should be compulsory reading in all Indian schools) get to know the man behind the genius to fully appreciate and acknowledge what a rare talent had been born in what was supposed to be an extremely poor, immensely diseased and unashamedly uneducated part of the world. I can only hope that India continues to recognize and support millions of Ramanujans who, even as I write this, are struggling to get their ounce of recognition in a society that cares only for the shallow requirements of an equally shallow world outside. "
78,0349104522,http://goodreads.com/user/show/15785230-paulo-glez-ogando,4,"I liked this biography of Ramanajun, one of the most attractive mathematicians in history. Even though I found it a bit difficult to read, for being a non-native in English the author uses complex vocabulary and expressions.Kanigel documents his research with astounding accuracy. He begins explaining the context of South India: geography, traditions, religion, cuisine, etc. All of them pretty unknown to us the westerns. In fact, the book brings somehow a clash of cultures between India and the West. Ramanujan himself suffered the maddening reserve and the unfathomable distance of the ordinary Englishman living there.We know Ramanujan's family and his own life since he was born. His childhood, his youth, his marriage, his financial difficulties to support his family. And also his failures in official exams, his inability to fit properly in the indian universtiy world. And finally how he gets in touch with an English and famous mathematician who appreciate all his potential.This Englishman was G. H. Hardy, and this book is also about him. Kanigel tells us his entire life, since his birth to his death. Not only his academic performances, but also his hobbies or his political opinions. For the developement of this story was crucial that Hardy found Ramanujan, and Ramanujan found Hardy. A little quote from the book: «Ramanujan, Intuition Incarnate, had run smack into Hardy, the Apostle of Proof». Many pages of the book are his, but you can't know about Ramanujan without knowing Hardy.Ramanujan, under Hardy's guidance, done well in mathematics when he traveled to England and lived there five years, but he was not happy and finally he returned to India (other factors also influenced, like war or sickness). And, unfortunately, in a few years he died, young as he was.What attracts me most about Ramanujan is his great lack of a formal education and the enigma of his creative process. Sometimes he even said that the goddess Namagiri had told him the formulas in a dream. He was deeply religious, and his was one of the most romantic personalities than has moved accross the field of mathematics. He discovered so much, and yet he left so much more other people to discover. The book continues after his death treating his legacy, both personal and professional.So much that he conjectured was not just useful formulas but depth, richness, beauty and mystery. Mathematical tools Ramanujan used were sublte and powerful. He died young, but his mathematical discoveries and the story of his life will live forever."
79,0349104522,http://goodreads.com/user/show/98389835-mike-maher,4,"This is the story of two men who had a somewhat symbiotic relationship. One a poor, Indian mathematic genius who desparetly wanted to be recognized for his abilities and the other an Englishman who was a Fellow of the Royal Society and a professor at Trinity College in Cambridge. G H Hardy was able to provide Ramanajan the opportinity to be a man of leisure, that is to say, the ability to work all day (and most of the night) on mathematical problems without having to worry about making money for his family or himself. Hardy provided Ramanjan with a college degree and eventually his membership as a Fellow in the Royal Society as well as a Fellow of Trinity College. At the same time, Ramanajan's theories provided Hardy with lots of fodder to write numerous articles and give lectures on the proofs for these theories. Ramanajan's childhood and early adulthood did not provide him with much formal education in mathematics and his theories, while mostly correct, but he rarely bothered to provide proofs. Hardy provided that rigor. What Hardy did not provide was any assistance to Ramanajan's existance as a man, something Ramanajan also neglected. When Ramanajan was in England to produce new theories, he continued to follow his strict vegetarian diet which became harder to do as WWI caused food shortages. Eventually, he contracted tuberculosis and it was not long before he wasted away. This book is written for non mathematicians, yet sometimes I found it tedius. Admittedly, while algebra, geometry, trigonomitry and probabilty were fairly easy for me to understand, I had NO CLUE when it came to calculus. I did enjoy that the author did take the time to explain to me things about some subjects that I know little about, like the Hindu religion or cricket. I appreciate that it must have taken lots of research to write this book about two foreign cultures in a distant time. To me though, I just cannot fathom why it is interesting or important to be able to determine how many prime numbers are in the group before you reach 200 or how many factors make up a composite number so I was not enlightened. There was some mention of the practical applications of some of the theories and perhaps if there was more of this, I could understand more the impact that Ramanajan had on society."
80,0349104522,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4304479-iain,4,"The life of Indian mathematician Srinivasa Ramanujan was one of genius in obscurity. Though he had almost no formal training in pure mathematics, he made substantial contributions to mathematical analysis, number theory, infinite series, and continued fractions. Only being recognized as a pure mathematical talent by Cambridge University's Professor G. H. Hardy in 1914 did Ramanujan rise from the obscurity of Madras India to the heights of the mathematical world becoming a Cambridge scholar and a Fellow of the Royal Society, at only 31 he was one of the youngest inductees and the first Indian to do so. His contribution to mathematics was substantial with over 3,000 proofs and in particular the Ramanujan prime and the Ramanujan theta function, have inspired a vast amount of further research still ongoing to this day.Robert Kanigel's 1991 book covers Ramanujan's upbringing in India, his mathematical achievements, and his mathematical collaboration with English mathematician G. H. Hardy. The book also reviews the life of Hardy and the academic culture of Cambridge University during the early twentieth century. It offers deep insight into the relationship between the two men. ""Hardy almost immediately recognised Ramanujan's extraordinary albeit untutored brilliance, and Hardy and Ramanujan became close collaborators. In an interview by Paul Erdős, when Hardy was asked what his greatest contribution to mathematics was, Hardy unhesitatingly replied that it was the discovery of Ramanujan. He called their collaboration ""the one romantic incident in my life.""""An equation for me has no meaning, unless it expresses a thought of God.""~ Srinivasa Ramanujan""It is never worth a first class man's time to express a majority opinion. By definition, there are plenty of others to do that.""~ G. H. Hardy“Sometimes in studying Ramanujan's work, I have wondered how much Ramanujan could have done if he had had MACSYMA or SCRATCHPAD or some other symbolic algebra package.”~ George AndrewsAn interesting and informative read about two great minds, the mentor and the genius."
81,0349104522,http://goodreads.com/user/show/23105859-jasmine,4,"The life of Ramanujan is remarkable, truly incredible to read about. Kanigel's portrayal of him makes you feel awe beneath his genius (sometimes almost feeling as though the writer intends to present him less of a person, a human, and more of a god, something beyond reality) and yet also feel empathy for a man taken out of his natural environment and cast into cold England, with its stiff near-Victorian values. I felt at times Kanigel's descriptions of South India, although meant only to show (with that journalist's finesse) Ramanujan's earlier lifestyle and character in comparison to the life he was forced to lead at Cambridge, were a little detached - like with all the vividness of his description, the stark contrast of India vs Britain, he ended up instead alienating the culture he described, appearing more aloof, more distant. More like a white British man observing a foreign, exotic culture (let's not get me started on how the word exotic, used several times throughout the book, annoys me). However, you can hardly expect anything less from a journalist, and I think for most of the rest of the biography, he did Ramanujan's life and work justice. I also enjoyed how he went into G.H. Hardy's life in great detail, so we could understand about the background and character of the man who chose to bring him to Cambridge and out of obscurity. I actually found myself enjoying his section of the biography just as much as the rest of the book - he's such an interesting character that I wouldn't mind reading a book solely devoted to him! Finally another thing I liked was that Kanigel didn't shy away from the mathematics that was so integral to the story. Of course he wouldn't be able to 'explain' the maths that took 20th century mathematicians years to attempt to prove. But at least he didn't leave it as 'he was a genius, he did some very complicated maths things', and instead actually got some maths in there - as much as a layperson could easily follow. And that made you feel closer to the people you were reading about."
82,0349104522,http://goodreads.com/user/show/13245519-meha-jadhav,4,"An intimate chronicle of the life and the man that was Ramanujan; a mathematician of the highest order and whose work inspires mathematicians to this day. In addition to its main character the book also substantially talks about one other character who played a very important role in Ramanujan’s mathematical growth; and that is G.H. Hardy. The author has beautifully depicted the times, the culture and the thinking of the people back then in South India, thus giving a very real picture of the kind of atmosphere that Ramanujan was brought up in and lived in before he was ‘discovered’ by Hardy. It gives the reader an increased appreciation of the hardships that Ramanujan faced and makes his move to Cambridge and recognition by the world’s mathematical community even more astonishing. Even in Cambridge, though Ramanujan’s mathematics was nourished, he still faced cultural problems. Reading about his struggles, his illustrious but brief life, one realizes many profound truths, not only about him but about the Indian culture as well. That he is an inspiration to many- Indians and others, is no doubt, but he is also a lesson. Our strict educational system may have lost many other Ramanujans as I’m sure they do to this day; for in the end, on paper, he was just an Indian clerk with no degree. The book managed to capture me from the start. The language is fluid and very beautiful. Kanigel has researched well, both about Ramanujan and Hardy and has tried to give as honest a portrayal of their personalities as possible. Although I must warn, do not expect much mathematics. In fact it’s quite lacking on this end, the few mathematical ideas that are discussed are not clear enough. Overall, I thought that the book gives an impressive account of these two great mathematicians and I would highly recommend it to anyone even remotely curious about Ramanujan. "
83,0349104522,http://goodreads.com/user/show/64785708-suveer-gaur,3,"Touching but not moving.Reading this book has left me with mixed feelings. I know more about the two Mathematical legends of the 20th century, S. Ramanujan and G.H. Hardy ( both F.R.S.), but don't feel close to their actual personas.The book is content-heavy, it throws in a lot of names, numbers, theorems your way. After reading this book a person will know the names of more Mathematicians of great repute than one ever knew existed.While I do understand that creating a biographical account of a genius who lived for all of 32 brief years might be challenging, but it doesn't take away from the fact that as a reader I felt really distanced from the book's protagonist. It may partly be owing to the unusual life that Ramanajun lived.At the cost of repetition, this book meanders away from the core of the story/person in a lot of places, delving in too deep in all things British, colleges, universities, their history which wouldn't have much effect on the life of Ramanujan.The author shows signs of unintended bias towards topic he does know, the British way of life, the Englishmen talked about in the book.Ramanujan is somehow lost amidst all this background noise.We don't get much insight into the people around Ramanajun (apart from perhaps his mother, which in my opinion has been given a rather one-dimensional) and what impact they had on his life.In the end, this book ends up being exactly what Ramanajun's life was "" A genius whose English discoverers found more glory and fame talking about his discovery than he ever got in his own life"" An outsider's account of a desi genius. No wonder it feels alien to an Indian reader.One star for the brave attempt at breaking down complex mathematical theorems and formulae.An average read overall."
84,0349104522,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1793583-rochelle,4,"I watched the movie and was so inspired I bought the book. Kanigel, who by his own admission is no mathematician has rendered the life and accomplishments of Sri Ramanujan, who possessed one of the most brilliant and original mathematical minds of the 20th century, accessible to the lay reader and the more mathematically inclined alike. Not only that, his extensive and exhaustive research has enabled him to deftly draw a nuanced portrait of life in India and Great Britain, the privileges and limitations of the rigid societal and academic castes endemic to both countries at the 20th century's beginning. Also, he lays bare the historical British prejudice to all things other than British, as well as India's refusal to invest generously in the intellectual capital of her own people. There is no greater indictment of pre-Independence India than its own admittedly indifferent stance to one, whose genius, had it not been for Great Britain, would have been lost to obscurity. The genius of Ramanujan was Ramanujan's own despite India's rigid, inelastic educational system. The discovery, refinement, cultivation, and honoring of his genius was due to his persistence in seeking out like-minded colleagues amongst his fellow Brahmins, and to the likes of Hardy, Neville and others at Cambridge, who responded to his letters, reached out and took him in as of their own once they realized what a truly original and brilliant mind he possessed. Like a rare flower, Ramanujan blossomed in the most unlikely place-Cambridge. His theorems and his analyses continue to inspire and dazzle not only mathematicians but others across such diverse disciplines as Physics, Medicine, IT, and many others. A must read! His early death at the age of 32 was a true tragedy. "

With next to no formal training in Mathematics, child prodigy Ramanujan teaches himself enough of it to start writing to one of the most eminent mathematicians of the time at Cambridge. Genius or crank? Hardy cannot fully make out, but makes a punt upon this intriguing mathematician who writes to him from India. And together they revolutionize Mathematics.Ramanujam's mathematical journey is as much about his collaboration with Hardy as it is about anything else. The book throws up the gaping chasm between these two: Hardy who received the very best of British schooling, with his insistence upon mathematical rigour, and Ramanujam, whose entire mathematical universe was inspired by one book written by an otherwise obscure mathematician.Hanigel is a marvelous writer, who writes with a remarkable tenderness and empathy about a country when he could easily have resorted to the exoticizing of the 'orient'. This is a writer who seeks to know the man and his greatest love: maths. Through this book, I finally understood what the big deal about Ramanujam's genius was: just why the work he produced was so extraordinary.Superbly written memoir of both the man and his work. Next up: a Mathematician's apology. "
86,0349104522,http://goodreads.com/user/show/52034351-mahati,3,"The narrative of the mathematicians life is adequate and well articulated. In this respect the book serves its purpose. However the attempts to further contextualize and explain his early life are deeply orientalizing and littered with factual errors. The author should have either been more cursory or gone deeper to avoid this problematic presentation. Additionally was bothered by further orientalizing dichotomies set up between ramanujan’s relationship with faith vs. non Indic scholars. Shouldn’t the ways in which one speaks of Kant and Aquinas be applied to someone who happens to be brown? Disliked the heavy use of “mystical” to describe early 1900 south India and brahmanical life that framed ramanujans early life (and the extensions the author makes to his maths)- it’s the 21st century, enough context, analogies, studies and terminologies exist that an author does not need to sound like a 70 year old British man nostalgic for the days of the raj. Author also tended to use grand analogies that made huge observation error laden statements. (Example to made a grand sweeping statement about how ramanujan was Steeped in mystical mythologies and Hindu ritual - as if that is something of note for an insider within the culture- is as ridiculous as pointing how interesting and mystical and likely pointing to his deep faith it was that Da Vinci made a ton of madonna paintings and knew Greek myths forward and backward)"
87,0349104522,http://goodreads.com/user/show/913238-justin,5,"The final chapter, after section 6, was just atrocious; pock marked as it was with the standard biographical pitfalls of open-ended questions, cringe inducing metaphors, and fumbling attempts to discover morals and meanings in an otherwise straight-forward life story. If the author could have closed his word processor at the end of section 5, and foregone the ten page show of mock profundity, it may have almost been a perfect biography.And omitting this detail, the remainder of the book far outshines any biography I can casually recall reading. Possibly ever. The history and cultures surrounding the central characters are given almost as much coverage as the individuals themselves, making the scope of the book feel far fuller than a mundane recounting of names, dates, and life events.In overall interest, it approaches Gribbon's The Scientists, or Boorstein's Discoverers, limited only by what was, perforce, a more narrow focus. I also thought the book was lacking somewhat in Mathematical history and explanations. While I don't pretend I'd be able to follow the actual work of Ramanujan, I noticed the bits of math which I had studied previously were somewhat awkwardly explained, and not likely to give the reader a genuine idea of what was actually being done.A better story than it is science, but definitely one I never tired of reading. I am no particular fan of biography, and within that genre I think books of this caliber must be incredibly rare."

The only Limit to mathematics is your brain.
...and that is why they say he knew infinity. Ramanujan simply wanted to be someone. But wanting alone was not enough for him. He did something about it. Fortunately, that is not very difficult. However, what is difficult as Albert Camus once said is 'to stay that way'. Ramanujan was not a genius by accident. He was a genius by both character and hard work. Humility was also a rule in his life. With these virtues, Ramanujan was able to nail mathematics in its rightful place.Mathematics was his theme of themes. It was the only thing that counted. The dominant of all his thoughts. He was not only in a rush to pour out everything, but he was also eager to discover and unload its secrets. Everywhere he went, he went with a notebook. There, he wrote down his discoveries, formulas and many more. There he found his refuge. Through them he succeeded and has since been considered the high priest of mathematics.He was an Indian, though from the brahmins, which is the most privileged caste in India, he was still very poor materially. But with mathematics, his future was exceptionally bright. His brain was constantly at work. Unconsciously, his thoughts were continuously crystallizing into ideas. What has remained a puzzle to his biographers is his guiding principles? What directed his zeal and genius? We are told that he was a strict vegetarian. He was also fiercely controlled by a higher spiritual being who he always worshiped. While his contemporaries were running up against a wall of darkness, calling themselves 'atheists', he was sure of his ground. He found comfort in his own spiritual philosophy.He was in love with mathematics. His capacity for it was unlimited. His brain was quick for it, adventurous, and pioneering. That was his vocation, his only singular appeal in life. It was the richest field of knowledge available for his human brain. His brain knew no limits on the speculative side of it. "

Thankfully the author has included just enough of Ramanujan's math (with explanation!) to make the point of his genius without drawing attention to my sad lack in the field. Learning the backstory of Srinivasa Ramanujan, his family situation, his educational history and life in both India and England, his champions and colleagues in both countries and about his final days was all fascinating. The author did an admirable (if long winded) job of characterizing and explaining the person that was such an amazing mathematical genius. The amazing thing to realize is that more than 100 years after Ramanujan's birth (book was written in 1991) work on his theorems was still occurring and impacting fields of science which were unheard of at the time the theorems were developed. The sheer genius of Ramanujan and his contributions to mathematics in light of his educational history begs the question of what he would have been capable of if he had been exposed to advanced mathematics classes at age 16 rather than at age 26. This book highlights the importance of early education to allow full potential to develop in all students everywhere."
