0,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7961091-a-j-fitzwater,1,"I could not finish this book. I read 1/3 then skimmed the rest.The history is put in such a sexist framework, I felt I was reading creative non-fiction, a script for a movie, or a historical fiction retelling. The focus on the women's attractiveness, romantic affairs, and having babies was not at all appropriate to their scientific contribution and ground breaking achievements in a time when women were excluded from scientific endeavour and the work force. If the book had intended to interrogate the trials of juggling work and family life during political and scientific upheaval, it failed miserably as there was much hand waving towards women's political and legal justice shift. The book fell into a distracting repetition of talking about the women in very dramatic, emotional language for a paragraph or two, then spent pages on dry facts and lauding the men of JPL, often leaving the women out of the experiments. As this was a work place problem, the political implications should have been discussed, but they never were. Similarly, any work place sexual harassment was hand waved and laughed away, as well as being fired for pregnancy - the narrative put the burden upon the women instead of interrogating the problems within the system. What was of interest, the work and massive contribution the women scientists did, was rendered down into very pithy descriptions. The feminist contributions the women did undertake were presented in very ""Lean In"" style, putting no onus on the company itself (childcare? maternal care? community? All created by the women themselves, and did not seem supported by men or the company, yet this was never interrogated). The descriptions of the women, their figures, and clothes were incredibly distracting and sexist, and seemed framed to assure a more conservative reader that ""It's okay lads! They may have sent us into outer space, but they were sexy and popped out babies while they did it, never fear!""I'd give this a half star if I could. The author had no grounding in the feminist/political movements of the time or the hard political yards undertaken by women in these environments."

I did, however, discover it there. Which is still a win, in my book. Because it's one of THE most astonishingly AMAZING, compellingly ENTHRALLING, science/space/history works of non-fiction celebrating women of notoriety - on the PLANET! Before IBM built mainframes, before FORTRAN or BASIC or any other coding language, and long before women were awarded engineering degrees, the ""Rocket Girls"" were performing intricately complex mathematical equations, writing code, manipulating formulas - with pencil and paper, mind you!! - for the designing, constructing, testing, and the launching of rockets and missiles for military purposes and space exploration. Space exploration being their passion. Then when IBM came on the scene, these women were writing code, AND teaching it to their male counterparts - those guys with lambskin awarded engineering degrees. This is their story - the ""Rocket Girls"" of JPL - collectively and individually. And let me just say, Nathalia Holt knocked it out of the park - soaring well over the retaining wall into the outer reaches non-fiction excellence. The time and attention, not to mention care and fortitude, she (and her editing/publishing team) gave to researching, interviewing, exploring, designing, and penning of this unprecedentedly excellent book shows throughout, from cover to cover. In case you couldn't tell, I'm over the moon with this book. So much so, I'm going to buy a copy to send to one of my granddaughters. Though it isn't written for a young adult audience (much of the mathematical and scientific content might be a little heady for tweens, and maybe even for teens) I feel like it's important to expose girls and young women to stories celebrating women who excel in mathematics and science and other non-traditional careers. All the way around, whether or not your interests encompass women's studies, this is a highly recommendable book for anyone who enjoys exemplary works regaling unique history stories, memoirs, science and/or mathematics nuanced non-fiction, and/or space exploration.  FIVE ***** Superbly Amazing - to the NTH DEGREE - Women's History ***** STARS "

While I enjoyed the author's intentions and much of the history, Holt is a lackluster storyteller at best with a tendency to portray her ""rocket girls"" as giddy, impressionable preteens who are more concerned with ""correcting their wind-blown girlish hair"" than they are with representing themselves as agents of their own careers. Every shallow description of ""Barbara's slim A-line skirt"" belies the seriousness with which she hopes the readers will perceive the brilliance and determination of the first women rocket scientists. Why does the author spend so much time undermining her own intentions with superfluous physical descriptions, such as when she stupidly points out that Barbara was ""gaining a lot of weight"" because she was too busy at JPL to eat anything but croissants and milkshakes. Who gives a shit? I do give it 2.5 stars because I do appreciate her methodology and use of oral history as a primary source. Many of the stories were interesting, but she should have given her heroines more agency and respect."

Despite my interest in NASA and the history of space program, I didn't know much about JPL and was blown away by the stories of the women who were doing such important work at a time when women were not encouraged to have careers at all, much less careers in science. I also thought it was really interesting to learn about how things worked in the initial development of satellites and rockets. It's incredible that all the math was done by hand in those days, and amazing that it was primarily women who were doing the calculations considering the attitude society had about women in science at the time. Nathalia Holt does a wonderful job of weaving the individual women's stories with the details of JPL and the work they were doing there. It makes for a fascinating book that provides a lot of fun information with a human interest element as well. "

5,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3409532-april-does-feral-sometimes,5,"'Rise of the Rocket Girls' is an excellent read, as well as a well-researched and organized history of the involvement of women 'computers' working for the Jet Propulsion Lab. Nathalia Holt's book left me feeling happy.World War II ushered in a new desire from all combatants for improved weapons of war. All involved governments spent as much money as they could on stocking up on weapons. Missile development was in its infancy before the war had started, but of course, once the war began in earnest, everybody realized what a great weapon a missile would be, especially for the government that first solved the dual problems of launching them and of aiming them accurately at a target once launched. Private hobbyists, universities and governments were sporadically working on missile technology. Even after the war started they had not yet become a cohesive group. Separately at first, groups of scientists and engineers, sometimes simply friends who decided to work together, searched for abandoned warehouses, factories and airfields to do research into building missiles. As their work was literally explosive, they needed places far from human habitats. Some of the men - they were all men initially working more and more officially for the government and for the private companies who formed research laboratories - had girlfriends who also became interested in the work. Luckily for history, a few of the women had been born with the maths gene and so had studied math as a hobby. Not many universities allowed women to enroll in math classes, but a few did. Some women had had fathers who indulged their daughters' interest in math, too. In time, in these early days, a few of the women became accepted as auxiliary members of the teams working on missile development. As certain women rose to leadership roles in the newly formed math calculation department at the Jet Propulsion Lab - women were the best at the work - they began the work on the maths necessary to shoot rockets accurately. These women became known as the computers. Just as designing missiles was all by hand, so was figuring out trajectories. Eventually, machines would take over the work of solving mathematical equations, and these machines would take on the name by which the women's math department had been called - Computers. Eventually, the work changed from missile trajectories to working out how to fly rockets to Mars, Venus, Jupiter and Uranus. Later, the work became how to direct rockets to land a man on the Moon. None of these women hired as computers had engineering degrees (many colleges had rules forbidding women to study engineering), so they were left out a lot by upper management in certain meetings and in being respected. However, lower ranking departmental employees had to be much more involved together in consultation and in the work, so respect slowly grew. The women's salaries was a third to half of what the men earned, although they were doing either the same work or work which was essential to getting rockets off the ground and to landing where they needed to be. And like career women today, they struggled with the events of marriages and child care interfering with their jobs. However, unlike most women today, they were forced to resign after a baby was born, career over.Sigh.The story of the rocket girls is generally a happy one, though. The author explains how the women helped NASA put people and rovers and satellites into space, describing how women were involved from the 1940's to today. She does so through interesting biographies of the women and an easy to understand history of rocket development (no maths for the reader to struggle with). Some of the spectacular successes and failures of rocket history are explained, including information I did not know before. In the back of the book are extensive notes and an index.I highly recommend 'Rise of the Rocket Girls'!"

I was a little hesitant because it had the potential of being dry, since I'm so not a science geek. But I completely enjoyed this. It was a wonderful read. The women in this book were such great examples not only to all women, but also to the men in their world.This book covers a group of women who were hired by the Jet Propulsion Lab as number crunchers. IBM kept coming up with ginormous calculators to do the math, but they were never reliable, so these women led the way. Often times, they would have to leave their job when they were fired for being pregnant, but they would always come back. I thought the author did a great job and not bogging this down with the scientific details that would mean nothing to me. She kept her focus on the women and their lives, both personal and professional. The computer science details seemed a little to technical for me towards the end, but I was still fascinated with how much they have evolved into what we have today. "

Not that I haven't taken courses in those subjects. Although, I would have liked a few more diagrams, the author does a pretty good job of conveying what these ladies were doing, which was light years beyond my abilities. I'm very appreciative of what these exceptional young women had to deal with in the 40's, 50's, 60's, 70's and beyond, being more pioneers than radical rebels; they were outstanding in their field and deserve more recognition."
11,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/23100707-jean,5,"I have heard about these women at JPL for years and am so glad to have the opportunity to learn more about them. The Jet Propulsion Lab (JPL) started in the 1930s by a group of male rocket engineers on the campus of the California Institute of Technology (Caltech) in Pasadena. A group of woman called human computers was responsible for the math involved. The women had degrees in math, physics, chemistry and engineering but were having trouble finding a job after graduation until JPL hired them in the 1940 and 50s.Holt provides the reader a look into the lives of these remarkable women as well as the history of rocket science. Remember all the math was done by hand in the days before computers. The book is easy to read and full of fascinating details about discoveries that these women made. I noted that the women continued their education via Caltech courses going on to obtain advance degrees in engineering and computer science. They embraced the early IBM computers and learned to program them learning FORTRAN and other coding languages, they also participated as authors in the published scientific reports. When NASA started dissolving the human computers the women at JPL were just reclassified as engineers and continued working. Of course they did not receive the same pay.In 1958 JPL became part of the new agency called NASA. JPL is managed for NASA by Caltech since 1958 and all JPLers are Caltech employees. I noted Holt stated more women work today as scientist and engineers at JPL than any other NASA Center. Holt also said women have more opportunities in science and engineering at JPL than any other public or private facility, primarily due to the high standard of work by women in this story. Erin Bennett does a good job narrating the book."

I feel like the target audience is maybe teenagers who are generally in favour of science, but know very, very little about history or NASA. Hopefully some of them enjoy it.From my perspective, it was trying to cover too much ground in way too short a book, and ended up with a very superficial look at a bunch of stuff I already knew about. The stronger sections of the book were probably about JPL's missile days, which had a lot more detail about what the women were action doing. By the end, it just talked about what projects women worked on, with not much on their contributions, and kept getting sidetracked on unrelated NASA projects.There were also so many different women in play that I had a difficult time keeping track of them, and felt the book would have been better served by picking two or three who had long careers and sticking with them. Or picking a shorter era and focusing in more detail on what the work involved.The prose wasn't great, and the whole thing badly needed an editor."

(Mine mid-70s) Since I was working for a large corporation at the time, I even got to hear and meet the dynamic, Grace Hooper, twice. In full naval uniform. Anyway, back to the book, when the author is covering facts about the space program, etc. and the projects the women worked on, it was good to read. However, the was way too much info about their appearance, clothes, love life, etc. Why all this, and from a female author. Very disappointed that she felt compelled to add these details, especially in 2016."

JPL was founded in the early 1940's. The women were ""computers"", not ""engineers"". They did all the calculations for the early experiments in rocket design, moving on to work on designing missles, and then spacecraft. Initially they did all their work with paper, graph paper, and pencil. Then they used mechanical calculators, and slide rules. As the years passed they became software developers, working on the design of the missions and writing the code for Voyager, Galileo, Cassini, the Mars rovers, and many early pioneering spacecraft, and the Deep Space Network which is a network of tracking stations around the earth that pick up signals from spacecraft.This is an amazing story, a great story for everyone to know, but especially for those who, like me, were girls who dreamed of space.

Simplistic prose; choppy, erratic organization; lack of substance and an overall weak writing style all contribute to a lackluster portrayal of a very dynamic time in both American and women's history. The frequent brushing off of opportunities to discuss social issues of the time (e.g. going no further than, ""She was pregnant, so she knew she'd have to quit,"") and glossing over all but the most basic science would have left a mediocre impression regardless; the fact that there are more detailed descriptions of outfits than calculations just left a bad taste. Finishing was a struggle."

Which, given the subject, is incredibly disappointing. This is unlike any biography or history book I've ever read. There are no citations within the text to back up whatever the author is writing at the moment. There are literal fanfic-like scenes of the women picking out their dresses for the day. The writing is awkward and forced. Chapters are bookended by a fanfic interlude in the beginning, to set the mood I suppose, and an awkward transition at the end. Everything's done chronologically, without a very clear line of progress for the women themselves, only JPL. The only names I can recall are Barbara, Helen and Sue, probably because they featured most prominently at the end. Everything's jumbled up together with passing references to this girl and that, barely more than a paragraph all together for some. Interesting and important facts are glossed over, not the least of which being an actual Nazi working at JPL, which earned maybe two sentences and the rest of the book was about his great contributions. Really, none of the women had anything more to say on the subject than basically ""yeah, it was a little awkward""?The book is just a real disappointment. I don't recommend it.

The author throws in some fun anecdotes, like when a couple of the women decided it was acceptable to finally wear pant suits, along with the struggles many of these women had in the early days of getting married, getting pregnant, and facing the choice of leaving a job you loved or attempt the fine balancing act of being a working mother.

Among the names, she became intrigued with Eleanor Francis Helin, a scientist who had worked at NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory for over three decades, starting in the 1960s. Who was this woman and were there other women working at NASA during this time? Two births emerged: baby daughter Eleanor, and a research project about the women behind the rocket science that sent Americans into space.Today there are many innovations which are taken for granted: digitization, hand-held devices that contain chunks of our personal lives and are able to access the world, and more notably news of space stations where astronauts come and go, and the rockets that propel them are part of everyday life. Not that long ago, these were the dreams of science fiction and fantasy writers, but there were many engineers and scientists who had visions of making space travel a reality, and with rare exception almost all of these dreamers were men who worked on the actual projects. There were women, who were not engineers but had strong math skills and were hired as human calculators during the 1940s and 1950s at JPL. These women were not doing simple sums, but complex calculations which produced pages of measurements, and numerous calculation tables vital to, "". . . rocketed heavy bombers over the Pacific, launched America's first satellite, guided lunar missions and planetary exploration."" When rocket science and space travel became a reality, the human calculators were essential to all that took place before, during and after the launches. Holt covers the 1940s through the 1970s, beginning with a portrait of the Suicide Squad, a group of irrepressible scientists who would launch their own rockets from the relatively empty arroyo in Pasadena. There was Caltech and the nascent Jet Propulsion Lab developing the support and innovation for future space exploration. Portraits of the people who worked at JPL reveal their passion for the work which precluded and overshadowed any type of 9 to 5 job schedule. For the most part there was camaraderie, team spirit, and the interpersonal feelings and excitement which permeated all the projects, and created enthusiastic motivation for the staff working on earth-bound jobs to create successful space-projected missionsNot all U.S. engineers and scientists supported rocketry and there were schisms in the ether spheres of institutions such as Caltech and MIT. These two technical institutions had an east-coast-west-coast difference of opinion. There were MIT scientists who scoffed at exploring rocketry and dismissed it as science fiction nonsense, while the Caltech scientists were experimenting with designs and tests in order to fulfill the dream and prove the naysayers wrong.While she dealt with the problems of motherhood and a career, Holt often wondered about those rocket girls and how they managed their lives. She wanted her future daughter, and other young women, not to be hampered by any type of actual or inherent limitations, instead to be inspired by the accomplishments of other women. Holt’s curiosity and determination motivated her to research and write the forgotten history of women whose contributions made space travel possible, and as a reminder to young girls and young women to dream big to achieve big.Reviewed by Sheryn Morris, Librarian, Central Library"

Both these stories started with World War II, but with the end of that war, the efforts transitioned to scientific missions.In the beginning women could not be engineers, but they could be computers – women who manually performed the complex calculations required by male engineers. As bad as this discrimination might sound today, it was a great opportunity for women in the 40s and 50s when many engineering schools didn't even accept women anyway. These were rigorous technical jobs, sometimes given to women who showed only promise and interest, sometimes right out of high school. Their success was what we might expect today, but would have shocked the people of their generation who didn't expect women to work, and if they did, the career choices were nurse, teacher, and secretary, not planning interplanetary missions.Aside from all working on space exploration, the women were from different races, and some married, some divorced, some had children, some didn't. As today, this history shows that gender tells little about a person. This is a wonderful history of technical women and NASA.For more see: http://1book42day.blogspot.com/2016/0..."

I think any history buff would enjoy this one."

It could’ve been called the women of JPL. I feel like, as I continue to read more books about humanity’s odyssey beyond the earth, each one I read fills in more details. They are always compelling.This story focuses, of course on the female contribution to the space program, but it also tells much of the story of the work at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory. This is not so much about sending astronauts into space but on the probes sent out to explore the planets, including the Voyagers and the Galileo and Cassini probes as well as the various missions to Mars and Venus. It’s a magnificent story.I love the fact that it also focuses to on the lives of the various women chronicled here. Personal lives are often left out of other histories, but they are huge part of the story. Just because you’re watching a greater history unfold doesn’t minimize what’s happening in your everyday life. This is a much more complete picture.I felt as though I got to know these women and like them as people. An intimate history. I highly recommend it."
33,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/13239516-kara-of-bookishbytes,5,"The Rise of the Rocket Girls tells the story of a group of women who worked at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory (or JPL) as human computers beginning in the 1940s. At that time, of course, computers--even calculators--were yet to be invented, so people had to do all mathematical calculations with pencil and paper. As rocket technology was being invented at JPL, all of the human calculators were women. They were smart, they were involved in the design and launch of spacecraft and their work was completely trusted by the male engineering staff. (Unfortunately, for decades, none of the women at JPL were given the title ""engineer"" even if their work was comparable to what the male engineers were doing. While most of the women highlighted in this book were never given a work title other than ""computer"", JPL did eventually recognize their indispensability and give them all of the human computers the title ""engineer"" regardless of their educational qualifications.)These women were also at the forefront of computer programming. As IBM developed electronic computers, the Rocket Girls trained in how to use them and there was a period of time (that appeared to last for many years) during which it seemed that the only computer programmers at JPL were women. I was surprised at the attitude that the author recounted of some of the male engineers who said they didn't trust the electronic computer's calculations--they wouldn't be confident until the women confirmed the results with pencil and paper. I almost can't imagine thinking a person could do math better than a computer. But that's how good these women were. (And also how uncertain people were of computer technology in its infancy.)Interwoven with the stories of rocket tests and trajectories are the personal stories of several of these remarkable women. They came from a range of backgrounds and it was wonderful to read about how different they all were--but how they all shared the drive to be excellent in their cutting edge work. Lots of girl power here, and no back-biting or malicious melodrama. I read a library copy of this book, but I've bought my own copy to have because I want my kids to all read this and I want to be able to pass it around to friends."
34,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3809399-stormin,4,"It's really hard not to compare this book directly with the (more famous) Hidden Figures: The American Dream and the Untold Story of the Black Women Mathematicians Who Helped Win the Space Race, and the conclusion is simple: Rise of the Rocket Girls is a better book.There are two main reasons for this. First, the book has a more concentrated narrative. Hidden Figures is all over the place, with long, long tangents that don't really go anywhere and no central narrative. It's more of an exhaustive index of things that happened in the lives of female, black computers than a story of any kind. By contrast, Rise of the Rocket Girls has much more accessible themes--like the desire of the female (white and black) computers to be a part of inventing rockets to explore space instead of just to deliver warheads and kill people.Second, the book had really great scientific explanations. I'm not a physicist or aerospace engineer or anything like that, but I do have a quantitative background with degrees in math, systems engineering, and economics. So I do know a thing or two about math, and so I can recognize a really good mathematical explanation when I see one. You know, the kind of explanation where the meaning is clear to anyone (regardless of their mathematical background) but the meaning is also faithful to the actual, technical concept being explained. That's really hard to do, and Nathalia Hold makes it look effortless. This make the book more fun to read, because you felt like you were getting a real feel for the kinds of scientific problems that these women were solving.I can easily imagine that the material in Hidden Figures made for a better movie (I haven't seen it yet), but as far as books go, this is the one I'd read if I had to pick just one."

That's something that isn't on record anywhere, and that history, particularly various anecdotes they may have from that time period, is very intriguing.But, yeesh. The way it was put together and the items the author chose to highlight drove me insane. I gave it two stars only because there are, in fact, good bits of information to be found. I do have to applaud the author for getting these women together again. But most of it felt like such a waste of a golden opportunity.The author spends the majority of the book talking about whichever ""rocket girl"" is being focused on and her hair, her clothes, her boyfriend/husband, her children, her troubles at home, etc. I'm sure that plays a part, but I really would have liked that to take more of a backseat. The interesting info about JPL felt more like asterisks at the bottom of the page.I majored in engineering, and I've worked for NASA. I've been the only female in many situations. I support giving these ladies a spotlight. I just think this book is so busy hamming up their gender that it forgets to fully illuminate their accomplishments. The idea isn't to say, ""Look, we're girls!"" The idea is to say, ""Yeah. We're awesome.""(Another book released recently, The Glass Universe: How the Ladies of the Harvard Observatory Took the Measure of the Stars does a much better job of this, for anyone interested. Though I warn it hits the other extreme for any not really keen on the subject. It is quite information and background heavy.)"

However, I just could not finish this book. It read as if it were an outline of chronological events with a few verbs and adjectives thrown in there. There was not one character that I felt tied to enough to want to finish the book. The author jumped from person to person, not developing one single character. So many names were dropped that I could not keep track of who was who. This barrage of women was punctuated by an attempt to connect the reader to them by telling brief, campy quips of detailed information about dresses, beauty pageants, and personal relationships. By trying to cover so much, the author truly did these amazing women a disservice with her poor writing. Had she taken the time to tell one or two stories really well, the book would really be able to celebrate the work of all of these amazing women."

But throughout the book, I felt that she was writing at a young adult level instead of an adult non-fiction level. I even checked the spine label to see if our library had designated the book in that way. I know a lot of adults like to read young adult books, but I am not one of them, so I found the tone simplistic and somewhat demeaning. I mean, seriously, I used to OPERATE a key punch machine.

38,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7029980-katie-doing-dewey,4,"Review: This was a fun read and highlighted some important work, but I would have liked more depth on the technical side of the story.Long before 'computers' were calculating machines, they were mathematicians (primarily women) and eventually the first software developers. Working at the NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory, an elite group of female computers fought hard to balance personal lives with careers they loved at a time when that was still considered a highly unusual thing for a woman to do. Through their expertise and painstaking effort, these computers ""transformed rocket design, helped bring about the first American satellites, and made the exploration of the solar system possible"" (source).I was initially a bit disappointed by this book. The first story, focused on Barby Canright, spent a lot of time talking about her clothes, her makeup, and her relationships. That wouldn't bother me, except there were also very few technical details of her work and a lot of the story focused on one of the men she worked with. Fortunately, it got better from there. All of the other women's stories also talked about their relationships, but this was balanced by information about the work they did. I suspect that the bad beginning at least partially reflected the fact that earlier women computers were primarily doing math to implement other people's ideas. They weren't allowed to serve as engineers and were probably not often able to suggest experiments.Occasionally, I did still feel that the author was stereotyping the women, (for instance, an older women was put in charge of the group not because of her experience, but because she was 'a  mother hen') but overall the stories got better towards the end. I did really like that the author just told the women's stories, without digressing into discussions of stereotypes and the barriers they faced. She let their stories speak for themselves. And they were great stories! Like in 
Hidden Figures
, the author followed many women over decades, so we could see how many different women chose to balance their careers and how things changed over time. Many of the women worked on incredibly important space exploration efforts. The missions that gave us our first images of other planets were particularly awe-inspiring. Overall, I had a lot of fun reading this book. I just would have liked some more technical details to round it out!This review was originally posted on Doing Dewey"

Superb concept and research. Too bad the storytelling falls short. With so large a cast, Holt often fails to identify her frequent shifts of focus character. Even as an advocacy work, her biases bleed through too obviously. “As odd as it seems by today’s standards, the beauty contest was a result of JPL’s progressive hiring practices … unintentionally highlight the presence of educated young women working for JPL.”Even with its shortcomings this sets the record straight about the vital contributions of the “computers” as they were called before the advent of massive and micro-computers of the last fifty years. “She didn’t feel intimidated. Instead she felt invisible.” “Many saw the shuttle as competition.” It certainly contested budget dollars, if not official and public attention. JPL continued to plan and execute successful scientific missions while most of NASA’s attention and money was wasted on grandstanding with people. (In my opinion, JPL’s Deep Space Network continues to do more science that the International Space Station.)“There was no doubt in her mind or anyone else’s that if they’d gone ahead with their design and put a satellite at the helm and fuel in that final stage, their creation would be circling the earth at this very moment.” (September 2, 1956)See also Hidden Figures, the story behind the contemporary black women climbing an even steeper hill at NASA Langley Research Center (Hampton, Virginia). Don’t understand why neither were nominated for Hugo Awards as related works.“Proper paranoia.” Gentry Lee JPL’s frequent failures highlight the risk when pushing the envelope of the possible. Those now planning to send people to Mars should reflect on the low success rate of unmanned missions to the red planet. “We’re a sisterhood.”"

It takes the reader all the way back to when Malina, Parsons, and a young group of men were doing their own experiments in the foothills, all the way to the 1980's. Now, if you're looking to learn more about women's contribution to this industry, I suggest you read Hidden Figures For a book that is supposed to be about what women accomplished at JPL, it really sings the praises of the men. All I got from this book was that women were computers. It didn't go into any details though. But boy, did it tell us exactly what the men did. Plus for a book about science, I don't understand why women's fashion was a point that needed to be brought up. Yes, there was a female revolution going on, but what exactly does wearing pants have to do with sending a rocket into space? The book says their colleagues didn't care. So why bring up this inane topic in the first place?And don't get me started on the lady that felt sympathetic for a Nazi war criminal. I get that he contributed a lot to science. But.... let's not forget the 6 million people that died!! Their lives are more important to me than shooting metal hunks of debris into space. In conclusion, read Hidden Figures instead!!!!! It's superbly well-written and details the contributions of a handful of women in the space industry."
41,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/64510958-tayler-card,3,"The book The Rise of the Rocket Girls by Nathalia Holt was the stories of revolutionary women who helped pave the way in modern rocketry. The biography is a collection of stories of women who overcame adversities to pursue jobs, men typically had and women could normally not hold. These courageous women were know as computers. They were the mathematicians of the Jet Proportion Laboratory known as JPL. They came from around the United States and even other countries. They held positions of prestige, which had long hours, poor conditions, and many risks, where lives were on the line if you made a mistake. Despite the conditions, the laboratory was a tight group and had multiple outside events together. For the women, they found a second home, a place where they could thrive and not have to hide their brilliance.I personally enjoyed learning about the women's lives and there experiences, inside and out of JPL. The insight of the outside world and knowledge about history I found fascinating.I had a distaste for how much the book mentioned the mechanics instead of the people in the book. I also had an aversion for how quickly characters were introduced, abscond and mentioned much later in the book without any previous reference. I found the book quite intriguing, but a little bland. I did however enjoy the stories, especially the ironic ones. I found the writing style suitable for the content of the book, but it made it slightly difficult to follow. It doesn't really move the reader to activism, it makes you frustrated, but you feel that it's in the past. I think people who enjoy factual writing this book is for them."
42,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/12860715-librarycin,3,"This book follows some of the human calculators who worked for NASA (and the precursor to NASA), starting in the 1940s up to and including the 21st century. It follows both their work and their home lives. Of course, at their work early on, it was mostly women who were the calculators, while men were the engineers. As women of the time, they were expected to leave when/if they got married, then pregnant.I listened to the audio and my interest came and went. What I paid attention to was interesting. As we got closer to current times, with my (for a while) interest in astronomy, it was fun to read about some of those space missions that I remember. Well, the first one I really remember wasn’t a “fun” one, Challenger in 1986, but some of the later ones were: Hubble Space Telescope, Spirit and Opportunity (sent to Mars to take photos and explore; intended on only lasting 1 year on the planet, but lasted 5 and 10 years instead!), and more. Oh, I also enjoyed the one little tidbit of info about Jupiter’s moon Io (which I named my current oldest cat after) – apparently it is filled with volcanoes. "

I also learned A LOT about the space missions that I didn’t know. That being said, I got bogged down in the science at times and I was a scientist (albeit a geneticist, not a physicist or mathematician). I also found the story to jump around too much. I guess it was hard to tell all of these women’s stories without rehashing everything a million times but I kept getting lost. Maybe it is my corona brain.

47,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/67951314-phrodrick,3,"Mine is a review of the large print edition, hard back of Nathalia Holt's Rise of the Rocket Girls. This is important because I found the large print edition particularly well bound, easy to read and easy to handle. It is rare that I notice anything about the binding of a book, but this edition does honor to the printer's art. The text however was less than it should have been. This is the history of the women who were the original computers at The Jet Propulsion Laboratory. As a former computer instructor, it always amazed me that most of my students had no clue that the word computer derives from the process of doing math, that people were employed as computers before there were machines to do the math, and that the machine is so named because what it does is math. What I did not know, until reading here is that hand done math had been the preferred method well into the space age. Ms. Holt makes it clear that by-hand calculations were just losing out to the machine about the time America was sending Apollo missions to the moon.What is now JPL began in the 1940’s as three collage age kids operating at great physical risk and minimal permission at Cal Tech. Being young and unsupervised they called themselves, The Suicide Squad. Their lack of safety procedures ultimately forced the school to push them out doors and away from campus. There they reformed as a business the JPL, The Jet Propulsion Laboratory.Their first income derived from their work for the US Army Air Corps developing the rocket engines used in JATO, Jet Assisted Take Off. These were basic jet engines strapped to propeller aircraft for the purpose of helping them launch quickly from short runways. The technique developed in WW II was still in use into the 1960's. Among the things that made JPL different was its willingness to employ women. In fact, the Computer department at JPL became a place where women, later including African American women could find professional level employment as advanced mathematicians. It is rarely appreciated that even in the 1940's and1950's women were able, if they were better than enough men to get advanced university training in mathematics. Most often the only work for them was as primary school teachers. However, there were places in various parts of the emerging world of what we now call High tech for women. It is now emerging that women had leading, if underappreciated roles in the development of Computers (the machines), and computer codes. Thanks to Ms Holt we know by name some of the women in the hard work of doing the math for the development of rocket engines.Returning to this book. I found Ms Holt writing to be vaguely under written. As if she was writing to a younger audience. Clearly, she was avoiding any detailed discussion of the math. Rather like describing how to make a complex menu item and avoiding all mention of the ingredients. Yes, math can be dull, but a better author can help you to share the frustrations and pleasure to be derived by the ability to handle complex math, under pressure and routinely produce reliable results. This is after all, rocket science. To most people this sounds dull. If your goal is to honor these women- and Ms. Holt wants us to honor them- and to inspire girls to follow, a few pages that detail the tedium and make clear the absolute demand for people up to this specialized set of challenges should have been better documented.What is best about the Rise of the Rocket Girls is that Ms. Holt sought out and interviewed the women who were the calculators. We see JPL progress from small military applications to the Apollo Launch pad. These women adapted to and took leadership roles in adapting the original desk calculators, capable of only a few mathematical processes replaced the slide rule. Later we get a worker’s point of view when the first generations of huge computers made hesitant, and cranky appearances before becoming the miracle machines we now barely think of - laptops, and smart phones and etc. These two generation of women learned how to program and master these machines. They are among the first rank of computer engineers. As exciting and inspirational as are the facts, Ms. Holt under serves them. She is given to name dropping. German, in fact ex Nazi Scientist Wernher von Braun, barely deserves his several mentions. Why she has to mention Carl Sagan is an open question. That there is a great deal about clothes, changing styles and the success or failure of their romantic lives may be part of telling “Her-Story” rather than “His-story”. A case can be made for mentions made the pants suits in the work place. But do we need the unrelated history of the invention of panty hose?The Rise of the Rocket Girls is an easy read. History for the casual, even the beach reader. But their work was anything but easy. Maybe asking more of the reader would have made this a better book. "

50,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/14909704-ari-santillanes,4,"One of the main reasons I read is something called ""book fate."" I suppose I should expand the term to something like ""reading fate,"" but here's the general idea: I believe that I have been fated - predestined - to encounter certain reading material at exactly the right time in my life. I do not believe in coincidences.My latest encounter with book fate involves Nathalia Holt's book, Rise of the Rocket Girls: The Women Who Propelled Us, From Missles to the Moon to Mars. The writing style left something to be desired, but the content enthralled me. It is the story of the women who dedicated their lives - certainly their life's work - to the Jet Propulsion Lab (JPL) as computers and engineers from the 1940s to present. I don't read many histories, so how did this one find its way into my hands?My dad gave it to me. He confessed it was a title he hoped to read, but because it was at the end of a long queue, he thought maybe I could read it first. Right there, postponing his own date with the book enabled me to have it at the right moment! On the subject of dads, I started reading the book near Father's Day, and one of the unifying characteristics of many of the women is the early loss of their fathers. They recounted childhoods where their mothers, in a time when it certainly wasn't the norm, supported several children through pure determination and strong work ethic. Though not directly stated, I can infer that this produced a drive in the women of JPL to support themselves. Through realistic depictions of struggle (depression, divorce, raising children and families), Holt shows how many of the women are determined to maintain their independence through work. I feel deeply connected to the women in this respect. I've never considered being a stay-at-home mom, though I tremendously respect the work such mothers do. When I have children of my own, I anticipate that Mat and I will work hard to make our professional commitments manageable alongside our family priorities. That scares me, because professional and filial fulfillment are things that I value, things that often compete. I appreciated reading the stories of women who pioneered the concept of a ""working mom"" and remained intimidated by its implications. It was my goal to get this book returned/loaned to my dad before I left for Anaheim. It's a hardback and I didn't want to carry it with me on a plane. But failing to finish it and with so little to go, it was impossible to leave it behind. This is how fate works; it is not always convenient. Once I made it to Anaheim, all I could think about was its proximity to Pasadena. I stared to wonder: Does JPL offer tours? Would the women engineers working there be flattered or resentful if I geeked out and asked them, fangirlishly, to sign my book so that when I return it to my dad, it has some sacred weight to it? Am I really, in a town where celebrity sightings can happen anytime, fantasizing about meeting more down-to-earth people who just so happen to champion exploration among the stars?The final fated alignment was that Sue Finley's last project was about to culminate on July 4th, when Juno arrives at Jupiter. Though I learned this in the book's Epilogue, I first heard it from Mat when we were flying to Anaheim. As we were waiting to board the plane, literally minutes away, he stepped out of our boarding group to check one more newsstand for a ""good magazine."" He returned with a Scientific American which, in addition to containing many other compelling stories (we may have to subscribe) contained one detailing Juno's mission. Of all the magazines in all the world, he had to choose the one that added to my book! As I read over his shoulder, 30-40,000 feet in the air, I marveled at the constellation of connections between my reading material and my life. "

It isn't the story of getting a 'man' into space, like Hidden Figures and there is not 'civil rights' side to the story. This is the story of the smart women who worked in Pasadena at the Jet Propulsion Lab to build the rockets that would carry man to the moon and telescopes out to far away planets. It is also the story of the rise of the working woman who wanted a career and a family. These very bright women were gifted mathematicians and engineers in a time when girls weren't suppose to be good with numbers and most certainly not engineering. The author, Holt, focuses on a cluster of ladies who went to work at JPL just was WWII was winding down and stayed with the program until the turn of the century. The reader not only gets to know these precious ladies but gets a review of history from the rise of McCarthyism, to JFK's vision for our space program, to what we owe to it today. Women of a certain age will remember 'not being pregnant' at work and the debate over if 'we' could wear a pantsuit to work. For those who aren't up to keeping track of all the details about rocket propulsion, parts may be skimmed, but focus of these ladies and their wonderful friendships. The author does let you know what happened to each when their careers ended."

There is technical information that might be too much for the average reader and then, there were those who felt the author dealt too much with silly or sexist things about pageants and children or whatever made up these women's lives; (but isn’t that’s just it?), all the silly or sexist things made up the lives of our Rocket Girls. These women worked both outside the home in very demanding jobs and inside the home with husbands, children, family and society which is an all together different type of demanding yet extremely important job, and, at a time when women were considered an oddity if they worked apart from the home. I found this book captivating. There were moments when I wondered “why did the author put that there?” but then I realized those personal tidbits set apart from the highly technical and specialized positions spoken of were no less a part of these women and the times they were living in. This story tells about what the women went through to get to where we are today in engineering, space exploration, military weaponry and even our very own computer systems. These women adapted and struggled in order to make it in a man’s world but in my view and probably more important is the fact that each of these women enjoyed being women, and through it all were willing to sacrifice and strive for not only personal recognition and gain but also for the gain of future generations of women choosing to excel in mathematics and the sciences. This sisterhood remains strong in mutual respect and admiration because of their close knit working conditions and the friendships formed over time. Through the long hours endured and their strong, exacting work ethics they helped to achieve greatness and prosperity for our country first and foremost but also for a myriad of others who have taken what they started to the next levels.The author has written a fabulously warm-hearted and scientifically beautiful story of intelligent, witty and memorable first female engineers that deserves a top rank in your reading list. If you just couldn’t make it through the paper version I urge you to listen to the audiobook. Narrator Erin Bennett has provided a genuinely flawless production (well, there might have been a technical word or two she found difficult, but there’s not many who can say external disturbance-gravity gradient effect, magnetic-field torques, solar radiation and aerodynamic drag or radioisotope thermoelectric generator three times fast). Her voice was strong, easy to listen to and without excessive drama.

Hidden Figures: The American Dream and the Untold Story of the Black Women Mathematicians Who Helped Win the Space Race
, a book I desperately wanted to like because it is both so important and timely as well as the basis for an upcoming film which happens to look great ... but that other book, sadly, stumbled in several stylistic or organizational ways, which is not a problem here in Nathalia Holt's record of some different women who happened to be doing the same thing at the same time as their NASA counterparts as documented in Hidden Figures. But comparisons are doomed to fail; these books are attempting different things, and while Rise of the Rocket Girls doesn't pack the same punch in commentary on racism, it covers altogether different territory in its examination of the complex and ever-evolving relationship between motherhood (specifically) and work for these women computers. And it does so with clear organization, accessibility of language and thought, and a deft touch with the research. Complicated principles of orbital dynamics and so forth are woven in, yes, but always at the service of the narrative through-line, which tracks a slowly-changing group of women through the decades. Each section is organized around a handful of the larger group, and these women are highlighted gracefully and with care. The personal narrative voice breaks through occasionally, but not distractingly so. In short, stylistically, this is the book to read if you're looking for a primer on women computers in the space age; the content of other books like Hidden Figures may prove enlightening (and the jury's still out on the Junior edition of that book, which hasn't returned to my library yet) but they lack the energy and clarity of this book."

In telling us the story about the women of the Jet Propulsion Lab, Holt brings us a the bonus of another angle of the rise and development of the space exploration era. This one peers at the history from outside Cape Canaveral/Kennedy, and thus provides a fuller understanding of how widespread the industry has been - there is so much more than ""just"" NASA. This book will appeal to a broad spectrum - men and women, older and youthful. While containing trivial memoir-style annecdotes that infuse the more technical discussions with personal interest and keep the book from getting heavy, it's not a Chick Lit piece that would bore someone like my husband (in fact, he's reading it now). (And don't take my words to indicate that he's a chauvinist, because he's no such thing, and he loves strong female characters - just, living in a house of all women and girls, he sometimes feels that certain books or movies have ""too much estrogen for me right now"". This book definitely will not do that for him.) The writing is very engaging, so no yawning over Holt's work. Rise leaves me wanting to find recent books about the planets and their moons, and wanting to find out more from my father about his time working on the Space Shuttle programming. The only way this book could be better is if the title used ""Women"" instead of the diminuizing ""Girls,"" as these were all very much adults, and highly accomplished and respected ones at that.Oh yeah, and now I'm going to play the recordings from Voyager's gold record while I make some minestrone soup. . .

It jumps between detailed discussions of - if you will - rocket science, to low-level prose almost geared to a high school audience. It had the annoying habit of repeating how tired the women were while holding a demanding full-time job and trying to raise children. Mentioning it once or twice would have clinched the point.  The nomenclature of the time is interesting. These brilliant women who were at the cutting edge of rocket, military, and space technology going back to the late 30s and early 40s, were actually designated as "" computers."" This was obviously before that word had taken on strictly a mechanical, technological connotation.  The most striking parts of this account were the descriptions of the multiple failures as America was finding it footing in the increasingly intense competition with the Soviet Union in the Space Race. It is remarkable how many of the misfires were a product of pure carelessness; often with tragic effects. A topic with a great deal of potential but the themes did not get adequately developed and frequently got mangled in the delivery. A low 2 rating."

Not only did I learn a lot about rocket and planetary science, but I felt like the women in this book, though we are separated by two generations, got me. They were trailblazers as women in science and math. They broke social norms of being working mothers when only 20% of women with small children worked. They paved the way for my generation to have what we have today. Yes, they were paid less and weren't allowed (at first) to be engineers; but, they made it possible for the rest of us. Special shout-out to the women who discriminated against men and only hired women to act as ""computers"" at the Jet Propulsion Lab (JPL). I had serious PTSD flashbacks to Mrs. Semro's geometry and algebra II when the author talked about using carbon paper while making computations. Also, thank you, Suicide Squad, turned JPL, for hiring a bunch of women.Bottom-line, every young woman should read this book.

One, it's written like it's for middle schoolers, all short sentences and small words. Two, there's no analysis or commentary or insight. Some people might like their non-fiction this way, but since I've spent the past year reading sharp historical accounts of World War I, I found it deeply unsatisfying. Three, and possibly the most uncomfortable, is the intense focus on the traditionally feminine aspects of these women's lives and the obvious lack of familiarity with women's studies or feminism. Huge amounts of text are spent detailing the women's love lives, and their appearances and beauty are mentioned often. The few meager attempts to mention the effects of second wave feminism come off at best as uninterested and at worst as condescending. Not saying it's a book to avoid, but I don't think I'll be coming back to it even though it's on one of my favorite subjects."

For me, there was too much marriage, pregnancy and dating talk. Too much on wedding plans and in depth descriptions about clothing choices. I mean, if this book was written about their male peers, it would've focused more on their work and less on their private lives. At one point, I had to double check the sex of the author because it struck me more like a man trying to write a book about females in science. It was just irritating.

She was the beginning of the group that figured out the paths spacecraft needed to follow to explore the solar system, including landing man on the moon. It is a story of women helping women get ahead in math and science regardless of cultural norms. JPL's 'progressiveness' in hiring women for their scientific and mathematical skills is a bright spot in the otherwise dim practices of many companies. "

More cool science and gender busting breakthroughs, less about the JPL beauty pageants. "

To narrow down the information she received through interviews of the women, the articles and other materials she had to rifle through for this 337 page book is amazing. It was a lot to take in. A part of me wishes she expanded a little bit more with certain areas of the book, as there were times I had to re-read a paragraph to get the whole picture of what she was saying. It was like a condensed version on the bigger story of how women were involved with rocket making and space travel from decades ago until now. And it wasn't just about the women. It did talk about the men's role as well. My only wish is that this book had illustrations of the big projects they worked on, but I guess I could use an internet search engine for that. I appreciated how the women rose up in this field, from human ""computers"" to programmers to engineers. Their story goes along with the women's rights movement and several other movements along with some historical moments(JFK, Martin Luther King, etc.) It talked about the Space Race with the Russians (something that always fascinated me), and I particularly liked the story on how the first black woman was hired at JPL (Jet Propulsion Laboratory). How the women never gave up even with their failures. They went back to the ""drawing board"" so to speak to figure out what happened to make it better for next time. I admire these women! They did something extraordinary with their lives! I've read a few reviews of this book where readers couldn't get into the book. It took me about 20% into the book to really enjoy it and get into a rhythm, so don't give up as it only gets better. It even makes you emotional at times because here you have these hard working, career-oriented women who absolutely love and are passionate about their jobs and they don't have much of a social life other than being friends with their co-workers and forming bonds with them. These women had to deal with the juggling of having kids and needing to work. These women started out as human ""computers"" using math (pencil and paper), but learned technology as IBM rolled out their ginormous machines to the times advanced to include personal computers. Essentially, the women were programmers but were not really recognized as such until many years went by. Later on they became engineers by taking college courses and getting their degrees. I never knew how involved women were until reading this book. You take your American History class in high school and you don't learn about the behind the scenes history of how things came about. You see the man astronauts and you learn about man landing on the moon, but you don't read and learn about the behind the scenes history. This book does that for you. This book is definitely an eye opener, and what I would give to be a fly on the wall during the times these same women got to see the fruits of their labor when their projects were successful, and how they got to see the pictures of the planets with their programming in the machines that went through space. I think that's incredible when you really think about it! This is definitely worth the read. I'm pretty sure everyone could learn a thing or two from this book."
72,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/14128189-sandy-nawrot,3,"I'm always up for an inspirational true story, and this one came along as a book club choice. Specifically, stories about women succeeding in a man's world is all the rage these days...The Girls of Atomic City, Hidden Figues, Code Girls, D-Day Girls...you get the picture. I'm not sure I would have made it all the way through this book had it not been for the fact that I'll have to discuss my opinions next week. I absolutely loved the premise, but the delivery was rough. I'll explain.The story follows a group of young women, all extremely smart and adept at math but living in a man's world of the 1940's, 50's and 60's. One trailblazer, Macie Roberts, working at JPL (Jet Propulsion Laboratory) believed in the sisterhood and hired smart women who were trainable to become human ""computers"". In turn, these women developed a spirit of camaraderie, mentoring, and collaboration. In the early days, the lab was working on missiles for the war. These women made the calculations of propulsion, speed, trajectory and other elements needed for these projects to be successful. Once the war ended, they turned their attention to space, and began working on rockets that could reach the moon. Once machine computers appeared on the scene and threatened their jobs, they began writing code to help make shuttles, rovers and navigational systems a reality. While these women were busy being super heroes in the science world, they were also getting married, fighting pantyhose, having babies and struggling with balancing family and work. Some succeeded with the support of a spouse and family, some got divorced, some gave up and stayed home. I'm a huge advocate for nurturing and mentoring women in the workplace; it was one of my top priorities when I worked in the corporate world. And I so admire these women who were way before their time, contributing in these high octane jobs. It's inspiring and often overlooked, therefore important to give them their due credit. But the WAY the stories were told was a tough sell for me. The technical descriptions were so dense, my eyes glassed over. And there was A LOT of technical descriptions. I also felt the author's focus on the women's participation in beauty contests, their peep toe heels, their trim waistlines, their love life...it took away from what badasses these women were. The narrator for this audio was Erin Bennett. She's read quite a few Elin Hildenbrand books, as well as books similar to this one. I can't say that her work here helped me enjoy the listening experience. Her voice sounded like one of those women's voices you hear coming from a computer, in an elevator, or an answering machine...very modulated, with little emotion. I got used to it, but it might have added to my glassy eyes."
73,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1370632-mike,4,"An interesting look at an underreported aspect of the space program and American (not to mention women's) history in general. If you're looking for a feminist treatise putting the patriarchy on blast, you're not really going to get that here. But you won't get a rose-colored ""Everything was awesome"" story either. You will get an accurate accounting of these women's experiences as they tell it, which no doubt leaves a few things, good and bad, out. I did wonder about what may have been left out as far as day-to-day office culture in a male-dominated environment (you know, the casual attitudes/sexism/racism of the time, let alone overt actions, some of which are mentioned), but my overall feeling is that while JPL was no doubt a product of its time in many ways, it also was ahead of its time in others. For example, the brief section about the way the hiring process worked for a black woman, as it's outlined here, would shock and enrage many people had it happened today, but in context with the time, it reads more like a necessary means to the end of hiring someone who was well qualified to do the work that was needed. Unlike the computer programming chronicled in this book, social attitudes and change were not always a simple binary situation. But that is something more suited for a longer discussion and is difficult to boil down to a short internet review.Again, the women interviewed here may have left things out of their recollections, and, as may have been the case with The Astronaut Wives Club, the source material may not even exist since women's history is so underreported.A lot of ground and people are covered in this book, so listening to it takes a bit of thinking to keep everyone straight. There are some skips back and forth and sideways in time that sometimes make it hard to follow on audio, but again, that is more my problem for choosing to listen to it and my own limitations as a listener.Now, on to Hidden Figures. The comparison/contrast should be interesting. Some commenters on this book have mentioned that east coast space program was a different atmosphere than west coast space program. Hidden Figures also has the added racial element, which this book does not touch on as much here."
74,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/33296806-dara,4,"I also read Hidden Figures recently and it is hard to review this without some comparing of the two. I picked up Rocket Girls but was unsure it could offer anything new to the story. There are some parallels to the stories and obvious overlap in theme. However, is not an alternate telling of the same story. It is an original story in a different place with a fresh feel and focus. I enjoyed both!One of the things I liked most about this book was the equal balance between the characters personal lives and their technical work in contributing to the scientific advancements within the space program. Before I started, I saw some reviews that felt this book was very sexist and portrayed these smart, capable women as frivolous and concerned with their images. Especially related to the expectation to look beautiful, get married, have a family, quit work, and always appear happy and satisfied with that. I feel a need to speak to that and defend the author. The fact is, this stereotype was the expectation. If you were a female math or science major at this time, you were likely the only woman in any of your classes. But this is what they were up against. So I see it that these women lived in this world, but despite that, they were able to push through that barrier until others could see that there was much more to them. One example that stood out to me, was the Miss Guided Missile Contest. By today's standards it seems not only sexist but ridiculous to think that the women competed in what was essentially a beauty contest at their workplace. But this isn't a ""viewpoint "" of the author. Readers need to realize that it really happened! It's just history! And in fact, it shows the progressive hiring practice that JPL had because it meant that there were actually enough women working there to even hold a contest. In other workplaces that would never be the case because they only hired (mostly white) men to do those jobs. I think the fact that the author left all of these tidbits in just helped illustrate exactly what these women overcame to succeed in their roles. It amazes me how far we've come in such a relatively short period of time. "

It was inspirating and truly amazing...“In this job you need to look like a girl, act like a lady, think like a man, and work like a dog.” In the four parts mapping almost half a century challenging, we can say ""guy"" work, we recognize the women who fully devote themselves to science. Barbara Paulson, Helen Ling, Sue Finley, Melba Nead, Barby Canright, or Macie Roberts, just a fraction of women for whom the numbers meant the whole world. They worked in the JPL as so-called computing engineers. The results of test trials depend on their calculations as well as the lives of colleagues. It was a bad sum, a sign change, a swap of numbers, and work could end up tragically. Forget the conveniences of today's modern times. No computers, just your own brain, pencil, paper and special calculator.The author managed to breathe life into the heroine. They are not just soulless figures on the chessboard of science and technology, they are human beings from flesh and bone. They experience joy and sorrow, they are masters in logistics and planning family and working life. The big plus is a beautiful cover, in which I was interested not only because of the title image, but also because of the prints of pre-titles showing mathematical calculations. This is a publication between the novel and the documentary. Although it is full of technical terms, these are provided in a comprehensible form. For example I received detailed information about a work in scientific research. I also learned interesting information, perhaps that in mathematics there is a Fibonacci sequence in which each number is the sum of the two previous ones. (1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, etc.). Or that the first IBM computer contained eleven components that together weighed nearly ten tons!!!Really recommend this book, it will motivate you through your life journey !"

It makes me smile broadly and want to high-five the invisible hand of our old friend Irony, while thinking about the laboratory, where since 50's the policy was to hire only female.As much as I found the American space exploration and female computers that played significant part in the process fascinating, I am rather mildly interested in JPL's ladies giggles, outfits, love stories etc... I understand though, that there are still people out there in XXI century that require explanation and proof that being a female/wife/mother and scientist/mathematician is not mutually exclusive. Moreover, it is physically and mentally possible to want to pursue the role of both and succeed in it. I know, how wild is that. And there happened to be man (rare, exceptional cases, but still), husbands to be precise, who supported that - in 50's and 60's!So, even though I really didn't need all those ""girly stories"" in between, I appreciate where the author is coming from and I see her point in documenting the lives of women, who were not only pioneers in their profession, but also in their personal lives. The “rocket girls” worked outside of the home when only 20 percent of women did so, had children and returned to work, went through divorce when it was first becoming socially accepted, and witnessed the first wave of feminism, not to mention other social revolutions in the decades that spanned their careers.So yes, we need more stories like that, the stories about the real ""girl power""."

I appreciated getting to know more about JPL at the start and how they hired women computers basically from the get-go, at a time when that was extremely uncommon.Also, unlike others, I didn't mind learning about the women's personal lives and other challenges, which I felt helped highlight the time period and the struggles they had to contend with. However, I think either this book tried to cover too many of the women, or Holt's writing just didn't quite bring it to life for me, or the structure of the book just didn't quite work. The book dragged for me even though I found it interesting, and I had trouble keeping all the names of the women straight. I almost wish it had been more of a narrow focus on maybe three or four of the women rather than the entire team over several decades; it just made it too hard to follow but also too scattered for me to get invested in the story of any of the particular women.It's a hard call to make, though, because I certainly see the benefit of making sure all these women are mentioned and included. Each of them made a crucial contribution to JPL and the space program as we know it today. I respect and value that, so focusing on just a handful of them would in some ways have been unfair. But the way the book is now, it also rushes through some of those important contributions and moments because it tries to cover so much in such a relatively short book."

At the same time, there were aspects that frustrated me. For example, the choice to place a great deal of emphasis on the women's romantic lives, appearances, and childrearing felt unnecessary and cast these brilliant women in a bit of a silly light. I was also left a bit unsettled by the conclusion. It sort of drew attention to the ways in which women were pushed out of their roles as engineers, forgotten in celebrations of achievements, and otherwise marginalized (including the fact that the numbers of women working as programmers has decreased, not increased), but it did so incredibly briefly and largely tried to end on a forcibly cheery note. I would have loved for the book to conclude with a more thoughtful interrogation of the ways in which the story of the women working for JPL disrupts the idea that our society is constantly moving forward in terms of equality for women. All that said, I still think it's worth a read, if only for the introduction to some amazing women. "

I was wondering if they would be too similar, but they both stand strong on their own. JPL (Jet Propulsion Laboratories) is a character in this book on its own. From its small beginnings, to decades of advancements, I enjoyed reading how they were on the cutting edge of both technology and woman's jobs. From the beginning, they respected intelligent women, sought them out, gave them the pay and respect they deserved, and were leaders in allowing married women, then mothers, to continue to work for them because they were indispensable. I enjoyed hearing about all the Computers, the women who ran the math for the engineers, and their husbands who supported their work outside the home at a time when that wasn't the norm. I respected these brilliant people and their contribution to the company. Besides the characters, I was fascinated by the space program. JPL started off with missiles, then went to satellites, then in coordination with the military, the government and NASA was brought into the space program. I had no idea how many launches of satellites there were, and the amount of valuable pictures and research they have sent back. I am also amazing by the amount of space junk I had no idea was floating around out there! The process was so intriguing, both getting something launched, but also how the information (and length of time it takes!) is sent back. I also really enjoyed hearing about developments in the technology and computers, how mathematicians evolved into computer programers. The plot line was great, the characters were great, I was absorbed by every detail. I listened to the audio format of this book, and the reader was pleasant to listen to- good pace, emphasis, and also respect in her voice. Very nice to have a woman reading about pioneering, smart, women. Highly recommended, 4.5 stars."

These women defied the sexist stereotypes of their times to play pivotal roles in sending the first rockets beyond Earth, acting as computers, programmers, and finally engineers. This book tells their story as they changed the course of history, focusing especially on Barbara (Lewis) Paulson and Helen Ling, who were each with JPL for nearly fifty years. The women featured in this book are inspiring, and the book also serves as a history of JPL's accomplishments, from its initial work in weapons development for the U.S. army up to its space exploration missions. With each mission and project, the book focuses on how the women were involved and what the experience was like for them watching the success of their work, with the Voyager program especially exciting to read about."

This feels a bit like it's riding the coattails of Hidden Figures, yet JPL is very, very different than any other NASA center. It's older, for one thing. It's co-run and staffed by Caltech, giving it a college campus vibe. And there were women there from the beginning, women who hired and trained women, who hired and trained more women.

It was a bit technical at times especially when describing the rocketry so, I got a little bit lost there( biology nerd here). I feel like I learned a lot of historical facts about types of rockets and what nose cone shape is the best but, at times it was a bit too dry for me. I liked reading about the women's stories even though at times it was a bit painful( had to quit when pregnant, not named on papers). Unfortunately, I had to rush to finish it so, I could return it to the library in time( I had to renew it a couple times because it was taking me a lot of time to get through). I am not giving up on space books though, the topic fascinates me. This may be a re-read later down the road."

There was a lot of sciency/math stuff that went over my head, and sometimes I got a little bored with it, but once I started to get into the heart of the book where they are starting to send probes and satellites to explore other planets it got super interesting. I am amazed by these women and all they did, especially juggling children and families in a period of time where fewer than 25% of mothers worked. The author has clearly done a done of research (although the actual timeline felt a bit jumpy in places), and I'm glad this story is being told and glad to have read this! Space stuff blows my mind a little bit, and thinking about women being some of the major brains behind the calculations used for these projects is pretty cool."
84,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6533816-editorialeyes,4,"I enjoyed this a lot. It's interesting that the negative reviews focus on Holt including information about the women's romances, families, fashion choices, general excitement and passion for their projects, etc., saying that this takes away from an understanding of their serious work. There's an underlying sexism to such a view, dismissing ""women's"" interests as frivolous and therefore less deserving of part of the narrative. Holt does a good job of showing these women's full lives, in and out of the lab, and showing how they operated within the patriarchal framework across the second half of the twentieth century. I learned a lot about JPL, the politics that influenced it, and its many projects and contributions to our understanding of space."

These women were extremely intelligent and had so much working against them. They needed to pay attention to everything including how they were dressed, unlike the male counterparts who were known for their relaxed style. Even working in the outdoors with dirt flying around they would still show up in a dress. These women had their hand in every major space program there was, from the Moon, to Venus, to Mars and to Voyager which has left the solar system. It is truly incredible what these women were able to do during a time when pregnancy could get them fired. This book makes me want to work at JPL. "

They were all so capable and just needed an outlet to harness their skills. The work they did paved the way for space exploration and I didn’t even know about it until a year ago.

It's incredible to think of a time when women had to quit working when they became pregnant because it caused an ""insurance risk"" or that getting married essentially meant that women were assumed to be leaving the workforce. Every woman in a STEM field today owes a debt to the ladies who paved the way for us. As a working mom, I loved reading about how these ladies were able to make home life work and still do what they loved. "

Sometimes, the juxtaposition between the science, math, and wardrobes and of all things a beauty contest were distracting. Later on, the book focuses more on space missions, which I found more interesting than the missile work."

But where Hidden Figures leaned into describing the racial and gender inequality and the barriers women had to face, this book glosses over them, striking a factual tone that has the effect of downplaying the struggles and inequality likely facing these women. Instead, the author talked at length about the women's appearance, clothing, and romantic choices. In this way, it is a good book for those who want to learn about women's role in space exploration without confronting the racism and sexism of our country's past, to glide on the surface rather than crossing through the atmosphere, as it were."

123,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5616469-mark-hiser,4,"I have long been fascinated by the future, creative possibilities, gadgets, and technology. Reading a new car manual is fun as is watching a science fiction movie for the technology. As a child, I watched every televised space flight, drew pictures of rocket ships, shot off rockets, and stared in awe of the heavens when a major new satellite was sent into orbit.However, I despise math; it scares me. So, in the interest of full disclosure, I read this book but did skim those sections that became technical. However, for me, the most interesting aspect of the book is the light it sheds on the role of women in spaceflight. Holt’s history shows a country just beginning to imagine a society that accepts women as equal to men. It shows where we have been in our views of women and their roles in society, how far we have come, and how much farther we have yet to go. Author Nathalia Holt comes to this book as a science writer and microbiologist whose area of expertise is the study of HIV. In 2015, she wrote her first—and critically praised--book, Cured: The People Who Defeated HIV. Holt is (was?) a research fellow at the Ragon Institute—a joint project of Massacuhsetts General Hospital, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, and Harvard University.Holt came upon her story while searching for a name for the first-born child of she and her husband. Each had a favorite name (Elizabeth and Francis) so they combined them. Then Holt “Googled” the name Elizabeth Francis. She writes that she “was surprised to find, buried in history, an Eleanor Francis Helin, born November 12, 1932. She was a scientist at NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory, in charge of the program that tracked asteroids nearing Earth. Like the scientists we so often see personified in movies such as Armageddon, she hunted the asteroids that get a little too close to home. During her time at NASA, she discovered an impressive number of asteroids and comets— more than eight hundred. This was the kind of woman I wanted my daughter to share her name with. My search came up with an old black-and-white photo of her, blond bouffant hair curling at her shoulders, a timid smile as she held up an astronomy award for her asteroid discoveries.” Soon Holt found herself in the archives of JPL and making treks across country to interview the women of JPL.Though the women of JPL were not astronauts, they were the computers who made the work of engineers possible. They are the mathematical wizards who made it possible to send satellites outside our solar system and into deep space. And they did this work when society limited most women to being a mother, nurse, secretary, or teacher. It is their story that makes this book important and fascinating. Not only did they break the boundary of the atmosphere, they broke the boundary between the genders in the careers of what we now call STEM (science, technology, engineering, mathematics).Rise of the Rocket Girls begins in the early 1940s during the founding of what became JPL (Jet Propulsion Laboratory) a research facility connected to Caltech near Pasadena, California. Founded before NASA, JPL researched how rockets and high-speed aircraft might be created to wage war. The story continues into the 1960s and JPL’s later connection with NASA and the satellite missions of Voyager, Explorer, and others. But the thread of this history is the women. Before being able to make these missiles and aircraft, intricate and complex mathematical work had to be done…and continued…as engineers created the machines. It was women with an aptitude for math who became the human computers of JPL. What mattered to the woman who hired them, Macie Roberts, was that they could, “look like a girl, act like a lady, think like a man and work like a dog.”Today, there are more women studying or working in engineering than during the time of ""the computers,"" but that means little when, according to Holt in an interview, “in 1984, 37 percent of all bachelor's degrees in computer science were awarded to women, and today that number has dropped to 18 percent.”Numbers like these make it even more important that this extensively researched and largely ignored history of the women at JPL be shared. For women, these are still difficult and limiting days."

125,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/840708-melissa,5,"This book can be seen as West Coast version of Hidden Figures - women who had exceptional abilities in math and science going to work (starting in the 1930s) at the Jet Propulsion Lab (which was mentioned in Hidden Figures). During the 1940s, a lot of their funding came from the military, a fact not lost on the women nor made it easy to work on projects that may end up being used for war. In the 1950s and 1960s, the shift went from military to the newly created NASA and their own company's space exploration - which made the woman much happier and excited for their company's future projects. There was the first African-American woman along with the first Chinese-American profiled in the book, although Jim Crow was not a factor in the workplace and both women worked their way up the ladder to be supervisors and then heads of the department. The work-life balance (or like thereof) was more of a tie that bound the women together, who became a sisterhood of sorts, even the ""new girls"". Births, deaths, marriages, divorces ran alongside the missions to Venus, Mercury, and Earth's moon. Some of the women went into engineering, some took sabbitcals from the work but usually returned a few years later. All the while, their stories were integrated into post-WWII American history through Holt's writing, showing how the second wave feminism and technological advancement met the workplace (pantsuits! panty hose! computers) while also dealing with age-old problems like division of work on the home front.  A great companion book to Hidden Figures and great reading for the upcoming 50th anniversary of the moon landing coming up this month. Check out the pictures that come with the book, as Holt began writing the book after meeting the women at a company reunion. The women were by then in their late 80s and early 90s, so having their stories (and others who have already passed away) written down is a gift. Highly recommend."
126,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5891560-christina-mitchell,4,"I have a saying I often include as a prelude to a forwarded social media posting boasting of the historical accomplishments of a woman: ""Women never did anything but support their history-making husbands."" The prelude is sarcastic and a biting response to a history professor (male) who replied to my question, 'Where were the women?' with the statement, 'They were busy taking care of their husbands and families and didn't have time to contribute to the advances chronicled in history.' Since that response by an obviously ignorant and uncreative individual who nevertheless held a PhD, I made it a point to discover women's contributions. Today, many wonderful authors share my fever for an answer to my question, 'Where were the women?', with a dogged determination that impresses me beyond words. I consider the mother of my women's history movement to be historian Laurel Thatcher Ulrich. Ulrich gave us the immensely reproduced quote, ""Well-behaved women seldom make history."" Ulrich is also the author of A Midwife's Tale taking diaries of a c1800 New England midwife...diaries no historian before Ulrich had thought of as important...to piece together an intricately detailed and much celebrated history of a small New England town. Now we know the answer to my question. Women were making history. Their accomplishments simply were not chronicled beyond their own hands. Add Rise of the Rocket Girls as a tribute to the history-making women whose contributions to our space exploration history are only recorded among the stars and not the history books. Literally, among the stars, as their lines of intricate mathematical programming continue to work within the technology of such advances as the Hubble Telescope and Voyager craft of the Juno mission that orbited Jupiter in June 2016. Why have we never heard of these women? Because they were hired to serve as mathematical work horses. These women were hired to do the difficult, intricate, painstakingly precise equations, by hand, of rocket designs, rocket thrust, module trajectories, control systems, landing systems, and numerous other details that allowed men to walk on the moon and a rover to explore Mars. Eventually, these women became the engineers who wrote the copious amounts of computer code that were used to engineer the International Space Station and the Space Shuttle. These women worked alongside the men who were recognized for their efforts, though the women rarely received any public acclaim. So much were these tremendous women obscured from history, JPL, the company they helped start, demoted one of its long-time, long-admired, brilliant women engineers to an hourly wage (because she didn't hold an advanced degree) and none of the women were even invited to celebrate the fiftieth anniversary of Explorer I honoring esteemed male guests. These women...these fantastic, phenomenal, genius women...were simply left off the invitation list to celebrate the satellite they helped successfully create. When will we learn? Women are not part of history because they are deliberately written out of it.I am grateful Holt brought these women out of obscurity. This is a book that MUST be read. The stories of these women must be recognized and remembered. It is proof that women made history, though to find their contributions one may have to let go of biases in order to look in different and unique spaces."

The stories of the women at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) needed to be told, as they were an integral part of the Space Program in the United States.I had some issues with the book, however. I believe that the last section (1970s-today) was rushed compared to the sections on the 1950s and 1960s. There was too much information packed into that chapter, and her transitions from the 1970s to 1980s were not clear, and she did not explain the end of the Cold War and how if affected the Space Program in sufficient detail. This may be due to Holt's lack of background in the humanities.I would recommend this book to anyone who wants to learn more about women in science!Note: This book was read as part of Book Riot's Read Harder Challenge for the ""nonfiction book about technology"" category."

I love the science writing in particular: it's simple enough for a non-STEM person like me to wrap my head around, without losing the sense of wonder at ~*~SPACE~*~ and the incredible hard work of the women involved. I did start out agreeing with this review, in that the book was way too focused on individual stories at the expense of the bigger picture of systemic bias against women. I found as it went on, though, that those individual stories added up to a bigger, better one. All those details about clothes and marriages and social interactions in the workplace gradually turned into fifty years of women's history, in which the heroes aren't the leaders of big social movements but the ones quietly and competently carrying them out. Helen Ling's story alone was an awesome case study of a woman going from the only girl in her math classes, certain her real career lies elsewhere, to a retiree with a long legacy of women engineers whose careers she helped make possible. That history of women succeeding and intentionally lifting each other up, creating an environment in which they could thrive, was fascinating and well told bit by bit.Still, I did wish it had pushed harder on some of those social issues - often, it was just biography where I wanted to read more history. Early in the book, a lot of the women talk about being alone in their field in college, unusual among their peers for pursuing science, or weighing their options of marriage and kids (and? or?) career...but it doesn't say much about the context for these things. Or the moment when a male engineer refers to not wanting to hire women because they just get pregnant and leave, and this is described as ""tactless comments"" rather than a prevailing attitude that determined workplace practices at the time and still hangs around today. The author reported a lot of anecdotes about (male) engineer / (female) computer tension, women pursuing incredibly male-dominated higher education, and partners who were more or less supportive, but that remained at the anecdote rather than the deeper analysis level. Especially knowing that a lot of those 1950s attitudes aren't exactly eradicated from today's work culture, I wanted a more critical look.I realize what I'm saying here is I loved the way she described the hard science in limited, condensed ways but not the way she did the same to the social science! I suppose that's my bias as more of a social-science person, or just as someone born a little too late to fill in the ""what it was like to be a professional woman in the 50s-70s"" context on my own. It sounds like Hidden Figures: The American Dream and the Untold Story of the Black Women Mathematicians Who Helped Win the Space Race might be the story I was hoping this one was, telling more of the social history on top of the biographies of the women and the history of NASA. This one packs a lot of details in, but also simplifies a lot in order to do that in a manageable number of pages - for better or for worse!"

Author Nathalia Holt describes the women's contributions to rocketry, space flight, and planetary missions, from before WW II until today. The story covers their changing roles from ""computers"", who did complex engineering calculations by hand, to computer programmers, doing the same thing. The women's personal lives are interspersed throughout the narrative, illustrating the immense difficulties of balancing work and home and women's changing roles in society. Holt's research is meticulous, including not only personal interviews with the women but also a wide range of resources on JPL history and aeronautical engineering.

Holt follows a few of the women throughout long careers as well as including quite a number who worked only a short time for the Jet Propulsion Lab near Los Angeles. The JPL initially had an older woman who was tasked with supervising a small group of women who were hired as ""computers."" The term dates back to the 1600s referring to people who ""compute."" The supervisor, Macie Roberts, continued hiring only women for her department thinking it would build teamwork and keep the group working closely with each other. The result was that JPL, over the course of 50 years, continues to have more women as scientists than any other of the entities that eventually came to be part of NASA. The women literally did what computers as machines do now; they filled notebook after notebook of computations and equations working closely with the engineers. In the 40s and 50s everything was hand computed. But, JPL was unique in that they began sending their female employees to trainings so they could use the early computers. They continued on becoming proficient in programming using a variety of languages eventually earning the title of ""engineer."" Some women who started as computers transferred to other departments depending on their skills and interests. There are certainly struggles. Often the women came from backgrounds where they took math and other sciences in high school and college but were never encouraged to pursue using this knowledge in a career since opportunities were limited to teacher, nurse or secretary. Often, it was only by chance that the women heard about the jobs at JPL. There were other challenges. If a woman became pregnant, she usually quit working. Barbara Paulson had two children, quitting each time, but eventually after each child JPL asked her to come back. She had a career spanning 45 years. Some of the women had difficulties in their marriages perhaps in part because of their dedication to their jobs and thus the long hours they put in. They were sometimes exhausted with balancing work and family especially if they received no support at home. Early on the women received little recognition at work and they typically were not paid as well as the men, but the job did pay considerably more than other jobs typically held by women. Holt also mentions how thrilled the women were when gradually, their names began to appear on scientific papers. right alongside those of the engineers. I liked the book and learned a lot. Holt covers the science very well. She also did interviews with the surviving early women pioneers. Although she follows just a small number, it almost feels like too many; we only get a fleeting look at their personal lives. On the other hand, the focus had to be on the women's careers. That's the story she wanted to tell. "

Throughout the years, I've continued this interest, reading practically every book I could get my hands on about the early days of the US space program.SO WHY HAVE I NEVER HEARD ABOUT THESE WOMEN UNTIL NOW??????This book tells the story of the young women (some just out of high school) who were hired by the Jet Propulsion Laboratory to perform the mathematical calculations necessary to launch a rocket, to send a payload into earth orbit, to fly to another planet and (in the case of the Voyager space probes), to fly to multiple planets. They were known as ""computors"", and they were as vital to the exploration of space as the scientists who dreamed up the rockets, engineers who designed the rockets or the machinists who physically built the rockets.SO WHY HAVE I NEVER HEARD ABOUT THESE WOMEN UNTIL NOW??????Early mechanical computers were limited in their function, and were prone to breaking down. When a JPL engineer needed a calculation, he (the engineers were almost always male) wouldn't trust a machine -- he wanted an answer from one of the ""computors"", who actually knew what was going on. As time went on, and mechanical computers became more reliable, JPL paid Caltech to retrain their ""computors"" as computer programmers. The first FORTRAN geeks of the space age were a bunch of young women, many with children, who were literally inventing the methods to travel from planet to planet.SO WHY HAVE I NEVER HEARD ABOUT THESE WOMEN UNTIL NOW??????I used to think I knew all the salient facts about the early days of US space exploration. It is disturbing to learn that there was an entire saga I knew nothing about. My only regret is that toward the end, the book breaks down into a series of vignettes that speed up as the pages move by. Whereas the start of the book might spend 20 pages just in the fall of 1957, the end compresses the years 1977 to 1997 in the same space."

After all, “Rocket Boys” explores the growing passion a small group of boys growing up in a small town- their triumphs and successes. I was hoping to get some of that here, more biography or solid story. I lose track of all the people in this book. Some of them seem to be included just because they were female but “she didn’t have a degree and just needed to pay the bills and this job sounded neat then she got married and wanted a baby more and quit” is not someone I felt I could invest in. It feels like most of these women were just kind of there as stuff happened around them. I know there has to be more to it than that! Great detail goes into the some of the technical and historical aspects of this book, but most of the real complex stuff is still reserved for the men. When it comes time to talk about the “girls” (and they are called girls through the whole freaking book), it’s about their dating life (so many weddings), their manicured hands (how ironic they are doing MATH with those fingers haha), their hair getting messed up in the wind, their marriages, their pregnancies. Don’t get me wrong, all of this was certainly a big part of their lives, and at the time all of those details were probably important, but I didn’t feel this really gets to the contribution these women made to their field- it was so out of balance. It doesn’t develop them as characters or make them particularly compelling people to read about. This is DEFINITELY NOT Hidden Figures!Not only that, but this book can’t seem to decided if it is non-fiction or some quasi romance novel sort of thing. The historical and technical stuff is all very fascinating, but again, it turns to the “girls” and their lives and we are going on the fifth date with a dude (who gets described in almost more detail than the woman- even if he has nothing to do with the story) and the sun is now setting “languidly” beneath the ocean or the smell of orchids is filling a wedding reception- odd prose fluff that the author just throws in there that does not match the feel of a real biography or non-fiction work. How does she know this woman bit her lip nervously while the interviewer stared at her with indifference? It was kind of making me crazy. Either write a “based on a true story” novel with a few characters we can love or write non-fiction, but the switching back and forth was really odd to me and added nothing to the story (in fact, it distracted from it a great deal).As a woman in STEM, I was kind of bummed by this. Would have been a great book for my grandma to assure her that “girls can have jobs in technology too,” but a younger girl or woman with aspirations would be left wanting."

And those programs were first written by hand on pencil and paper, by this extraordinary group of women "" Those programs ... soaring amid the space dust. They are the legacy of women written in the stars."" This is an incredibly inspiring book. In an age when women were not allowed to have engineering degrees JPL's MISSION DESIGN team were exclusively female. Mission design. seriously. Everything that successfully got off the ground in that era from B-52's to the moon landing and beyond was because of women- doing massively complex mathematical calculations - with a paper and pencil.Neil Armstrong may have taken one giant step for mankind. But he was only able to take it and return safely because a bunch of women manually (and accurately) calculated every step of his journey. I also hope JPL remains half as awesome an employer as it used to be. Having entire departments comprised of and managed by women, practicing desegregation before it became legal, and facilitating the flexi-time work model LONG before anyone ever considered that women should be able to achieve (or even require) a work-life balance. I've seen some reviewers complaining about the superfluity of the descriptions of these women's style decisions, their romances, their children. But to me they were a very necessary part of this book. Because it portrayed the women as individuals,human and female- not heroic, asexual, science goddesses - but real people, who had to struggle with real issues most women, even now deal with- how to manage an enormously demanding job they love, while also rushing home to make dinner and spend time with the family they love. And if they were also pretty and stylish good for them!? just because you love calculus doesn't mean you can't also love couture and curlers. For me the struggles these women went through professionally and personally to achieve what they did also underscored a very important point. That success is largely dependent on a fantastic support network- on having a sisterhood of women who encourage and foster each other, on having parents and partners who recognise, respect and encourage independence and the need for professional fullfilment. This book is a wonderful celebration of the lives and achievements of these women. "

It tells the story of the Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) in Pasadena, California beginning in the 1940s. The focus is on the women who were the human computers and later often were allowed to be called engineers. There is a good bit of information about the rockets and satellites, but what I loved were the stories of the women and the picture of the changing way women viewed themselves and were viewed by the professional world. This was my era – having to wear skirts and heels and nylons, accepting as a given that women had certain roles and earning power. It was a beautiful trip through my own memory – my first job out of library school was at Boeing. During my brief tenure, women were allowed for the first time to wear pants – but only as matching pantsuits. We were required to wear nylons and generally the proof of that was a seam! I worked in a typical female role and have no idea of the role of women in the science world of Boeing, but what a wonderful story that would be – I wonder if anyone is thinking about oral histories and collecting information from women at Boeing from 1940s through today.I would have liked even more oral history and more information about the women at JPL, but Holt has done a wonderful job extracting the stories before this information disappeared forever."
137,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7889174-janet,2,"My goal for this year is to read a lot of lady-scientist books to help understand and learn about the women who helped pave the way for me and my career. This book covers the women who were computers and later engineers at the Jet Propulsion Lab in California. I just really struggled with this book. The author clearly had to have spent a lot of time with these women, because the book is written in a lot of details about specific events that if did not come from these women's mouths directly, would have to be made up. But I think my issues comes down to the choice of adjectives and verbs used in the book. There is a lot of swooning, giggling, gossiping, and many other terms that make the women seem like they are silly and frivolous first, and happen to also be hard working computers. I think the book strongly plays up the insecurities and limitations of these women, without balancing it with how brilliant they had to have been to be able to have these positions.There's also some editing choices that I found rather glaring. There's a lot of discussion about how pregnancy and motherhood affected these women's careers, which is absolutely something that is worth covering in this book. However, a character gets married, and the book states how concerned the women are that their coworker is catholic and married and therefore likely to have a baby and quit, and try to figure out how to keep her interested in staying. This is followed less than 2 pages later by a man saying that all the women just get married, pregnant, and quit, and then comment on how unfair that women had to endure these comments. It IS unfair that the women had to endure these comments, but it's a poor choice to have the women saying the exact same comment 2 pages earlier. This is juxtaposed with women who had children and decided to stay (sometimes being re-hired after being fired when they were pregnant), but I think that the stories of these women were told so breezily through, that it was hard to really say, these women were able to be successful due to XYZ, depsite the pressures around them.I think at the end of the day, that is where my issues lie. I want to be inspired by these brilliant, hardworking women who broke boundaries in their field, and I didn't feel this book did enough to show those characteristics."

Potential because this story/concept had the POTENTIAL to be an amazing story about the women who worked the math and gave the US the advantage to win the space race. Boring because it was just flowery, wishy-washy, and weak. The author wants to give is a picture of the era, but this was cluttered with people, too many people that were literally just footnotes. Imagine someone writes about your work history and includes every insipid coworker who ever said good-morning to you. Then the organization of the story was problematic. It was grouped together by era which is helpful to keep track of time, but this also makes it hard to pull the stories of the women across decades. Some people were mentioned once in the 40's and then they pop-up in 50's like 30 pages down. By which point I have forgotten. Some people do go across time like Barbara Paulson and Helen Chan and those women should have been the center of this story, their biographies should have been better documented, more details of their lives and careers. Of course, it does go into detail about the beauty contests that went on at JPL and how everyone wanted to win. Never mind that is atrociously sexists, but really it was quite modern of JPL to even employ so many women as to host a beauty contest. These women were calculating extremely complicated math, but they all got giddy at the prospect of a coronation like it was the freaking high school prom (kill me, this nearly made my head implode). The author writes too much about this subject and it was all so flowery and insipid. The story focused on the women from far away through a gauzy lens, I would have preferred more in depth focus on key women. I started reading this when the Harvey Weinstein/Pervert Bingo stories started coming out, and because of that I would've like to see more on how these women dealt with harassment and misogyny in the work place. These women were pioneers, they were bold, and amazing, and I wish this story could reflect how remarkable it was. Instead I had to read 300 unremarkable pages on how they were planning weddings in between sending Voyager to space. I wanted hard science and stories not this wishy-washy weak sauce. The only reason this has two starts instead of one is because of the women.I mean read it but also watch Hidden Figures. "

During the Second World War and the years following, this included doing the computation for missile development. When the Jet Propulsion Laboratory was created, computers were in great demand there.And at JPL, something special happened.Many of the early computers hired there were women.They were working closely with the engineers, who were all men; women were simply not hired as engineers, no matter what their qualifications. The woman who became head of the computer department decided she would only hire women.This was not an era of gender equality. Women expected, and were expected, to marry and become mothers. There was no maternity leave, so a married working woman who became pregnant had no alternative but to quit.But the women working at JPL became a bonded group, as much a family as a group of coworkers. And over the years, they worked to professionalize themselves, and to professionalize their image in the minds of their male coworkers. As the first machine computers were developed and brought in, it was the women computers who learned to use and program them. Both before and after the arrival of the machines, it was the women writing the programs that made both missiles and rockets fly.This book follows the lives, professional and personal, of the women who first were JPL's computers, and later became the programmers of computers, and finally were recognized as engineers in their own right. They were a major component of the growth of NASA, and the development of the space program. We get to see the tensions between their personal lives and their professional lives, as well as the role they played in pushing the robot-based exploration of the solar system--missions to Venus, Mars, and beyond. It's a complex and stirring tale, and an important piece of both social and scientific history. The early parts especially, for younger readers (and by that I mean readers in their thirties, not kids) is likely to read like an account of an alien, or at the very least foreign, society.So much progress has happened in my lifetime. I'd hate to see us go backward.Highly recommended.I bought this book."

I'd almost forgotten was it was like to read a thought-provoking book.This novel covers a lot, and it's amazing to see the changes wrought as it travels through time. It starts out with the computers (that's compute-ers, as in, actual people who do math) only having their scratch paper and pencils along with, of course, their brains to do the calculations. It was fantastic to read about these women, who no one really expects to have jobs beyond getting married and having babies, who are so capable and had so much confidence and responsibility placed on them with so many missions into space.While the novel goes through the projects the women worked on mission by mission, those space exploration moments are only a small part of the story. Its stretch through history allows it to explore the treatment of women and the changing times, times before maternity leave where women were fired for getting pregnant and weren't expected to return after giving birth. It hits the time of the no-fault divorce, and culminates in finally allowing women to take on the same title granted to men doing similar work, that of ""Engineer."" But there were a lot of struggles before they could reach that point, in their homes as well as at work with funding and canceled missions.I sometimes wonder if we've become less now that we're so dependent upon technology, but I suppose it has allowed us to use tech merely as a stair-step onto greater things. But these women calculated complex gravity assist trajectories with only the help of a little graph paper and a pencil, and something as simple as forgetting to take the square root could and did cause huge explosions. A really interesting time to explore through the narrow lens of these smart and capable women who did so much for the space program, back from when they were more reliable than technology to do the math.Not five stars because parts of it were a little slow -- it's not in the gripping nonfiction style, but interesting enough."

Even those limited jobs were only to be pursued until they obtained the ultimate women role of motherhood. This novel highlights the women who defied those stereotypes and pursued their passion for math and science in addition to family life. I refuse to believe that in order to be a true feminist one has to completely ignore things like fashion or historical context. If I ever have a daughter this novel will be on her recommended reading list. Even today women continue to struggle with balancing perusing a career in science with raising a family. Although employers now offer assistance in the form of maternity leave, nursing mother stations at work, medical insurance, and fertility assistance programs, it is still difficult for women to raise children and compete in one of the world’s most competitive work environments. In order to support themselves scientist must continuously work to secure funding, improve their publication record, and meet often unrealistic deadlines. This work environment is not conducive to taking leave of absences or even changing ones last name. If you are not familiar with these struggles I highly recommend speaking to a scientist (male or female) or reading Lab Girl by Hope Jahren.By not just focusing on their careers the author was able to address the fact that even in a time when it was highly discouraged these women managed to successfully have their cake and eat it too! What's also noteworthy is that they didn't do it by screaming or busting down doors, they did it with hard work and being very good at their jobs. It’s incredible what they were able to accomplish both in their professional and personal lives. The point of this novel was not to evoke some false pity-party for female oppression but to celebrate the success of these women and the programs that they devoted a large portion of their lives to. I bet that the women whose lives are on display in this novel are proud of it. "

Rise of the Rocket Girls describes the development of JPL (Cal-Tech's Jet Propulsion Laboratory) and runs through the development of the American space program. Covering fifty-plus years of of history, this book necessarily moves very quickly, but it periodically reviews where it's been, making it easy, at least for me, to follow. One of the most interesting parts for me was the underlying theme of women's contributions to the space program. JPL started out by hiring women, before the advent of computers, to do mathematical computations using raw data generated by scientific experiments. The output of their work helped determine design parameters for rocket engines, helped develop different types of rocket fuels, determined orbital trajectories for satellites. JPL was taking women with a penchant for math and science and grooming them to be engineers at a time when engineering schools were predominantly inhabited by men. As the advent of computers gradually made the computational jobs obsolete, JPL was training women to be pioneers in computer programming and promoting them to managerial positions. I only skimmed the footnotes at the end, but was struck by the huge number of sources listed.

I wanted to give this book four stars, but was constrained from doing so by the error-riddled text. The author praises her editor for finding repetitions and errors, but clearly an editor with some technical knowledge could have helped achieve a much more accurate narrative.

Interesting story about these women and the projects they worked on including ballistic missile development, early satellites, and NASA's unmanned planetary missions. The book itself takes a while to get into; the timeline is muddled and confusing in the first few chapters with people dropping in and out rapidly. The most compelling sections are set during the late 50s and 60s during the space race. The details of the work is interesting but any time attention is turned to the women's personal stories, everything felt stilted and flat, with marriage, divorce, births of babies, loss of a baby all reported with the exact same awkward prose. The book would have benefited from using the women's own words more and capturing the individual voices, at least of those that were still alive and were interviewed. And while it sounds like JPL was indeed a progressive employer and work environment for its times, all the rough edges have been sanded out - no stories of overt sexual harassment, no torrid affairs. Clearly the desire was to keep it clean and simple for younger readers, and this would indeed be appropriate for young teens looking for female role models in the STEM fields."

Back then they could not aspire to become full-fledged engineers so having them as human computers ""mathematical geniuses"" worked out for them. The program out of necessity continued. The ""computers"" did their work way better then anyone ever expected. They won the Space race back in the 60's. They were instrumental in the Space exploration started by the Mariner program. Ongoing missions Mariner, Pioneer, Viking, Voyager, Magellan, Galileo, Mars Global Surveyor, Mars Climate Orbiter, Cassini–Huygens, the Mars Rovers.

Like an inflight magazine article stretched to book length, full of cliches, and strained and clumsy segues between developments in space exploration and the developments in the lives of the ""computers,"" the women who worked at JPL from the very beginning to help plot trajectories, program flight plans, and much more. The saving graces are (1) the light that the book shines on the crucial role that the female computers--some of whom later became recognized as engineers--played at JPL and (2) the useful general overview of the development of American space exploration--though the overview will not be all that interesting or illuminating for anyone with a passing knowledge of American space exploration, or anyone who's been to a planetarium or the National Air and Space Museum. Though the book is meant to be about the women who worked at JPL, Holt fails to make these women memorable for the reader: the various women Holt chooses to highlight are each too superficially drawn and end up blending into each other.

Having said that, I found the narrative difficult to follow at times. The author generally takes a chronological approach, but within a topic, she may jump back in time and then launch forward in time before coming back to the time period she started in. Often I found myself flipping pages as I tried to figure out when something happened. The latter half of the book is more about JPL's role in spaceflight and less about the the women who contributed to those programs. I found the frequent mentions of love and marriage strange. While obviously important in the lives of the women themselves, the emphasis placed on their intimate relationships feels out of a place in a book about the work that they did. By comparison, if this were a book about the male engineers at JPL, how much would we read about who they were dating and marrying? Having said all of that, I'm still grateful to the author for telling their stories before their history faded away."

Without their hand computing, man never would have made it to the moon, let alone even put a satellite into orbit. Just imagining these women in a room frantically calculating in their paper notebooks to figure out if the data coming in from the rockets and probes would mean that their projects would clear Earth's atmosphere. What an exciting job.And how awesome that there was such camaraderie between the women, even as they propped up the male engineers next door and became experts in early programming. Also an example that some women truly are fulfilled by their careers, whether they have children or not. Definitely a great read if you want some light, girl-power non-fiction."

Who knew how many women struggled as part of all our early missile and space missions? That their work as ""computers"" in a world prior to hardware computers was invaluable? I picked this up for the local connection. A lot of people up here in Santa Clarita work for JPL and NASA. I continued because I found this full of information I didn't know about the eras involved and the complexity of how the missions were put together. (Though I had some clue since my mom, as a secretary, worked for space communications at Western Union when they put together the system for the first Shuttle). Worthwhile for shedding light on the way these women contributed greatly to the space program, and the way their love of science and math made them singular (and great role models)."

Also, the scope is so broad, incorporating the stories of so many women from the 1930s until present day, that when you started to get invested in one woman's story, it flipped to another. That said, I would recommend reading this for its fascinating forgotten history as well as some great insider insight into the space program itself. It's great to see these women finally getting their due in books like this and Hidden Figures."

The contributions of these women (the computers) are so profound and so unsung that I was excited for a book that would celebrate them. Instead, there were a few paragraphs in each chapter dedicated to one or more woman with the remainder being about JPL's experiments. The beginning of JPL is fascinating and worthy of its own story, but the author tried to do too much in this book. Instead of focusing on the very real and very amazing successes of these women, especially as they were doing what they did in a very different social context than we have now, Nathalia Holt would mention that someone came back to work after being fired for being pregnant. And oh yes, it was difficult. And oh yes, she got divorced. The pages and pages devoted to the minute detail of how the rockets were built would have been better served exploring the brains and backbones of these amazing women."

A compelling read about the beginnings of NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory & its ""computers"" -- the women who used slide rules, equations, & mathematical tables to calculate the thrust of the rocket engines that propelled U.S. satellites & later plotted the path of planetary probes to Mercury, Venus, Mars & the outer planets. As electronic computers took over these calculations, the women learned how to program them. Most of the (male) engineers trusted the human computers' calculations more than those done by the first electronic computers & they didn't bother learning how to program them. A thoroughly enjoyable read about a little-known group who had a major part in the U.S. exploration of space. One woman worked for JPL for 58 years & just retired in July -- two months ago."

What irked me was the descriptions of the personal lives, not that they were there, but many times made the women out to be rather, well, vapid. The details of their dates and all of the descriptions of their clothes just turned me off - here is a book celebrating the ability and determination of women in a field, and at a time, where to shine was ignored by the surrounding culture and we're reading passages about beauty pageants. I can understand showing how the women weren't taken seriously in their abilities but the way these passages were written looses the effect. The material is good, the execution was a miss."

However, the author is not up to the task of clearly describing what her research has shown. Frequently, more questions were needlessly raised because she failed to be clear about what was going on. It seems she wasn't clear about the kind of history she wanted to tell -- a story about how tough it was for women in the male-oriented rocket programs, or about the excitement of the development of those programs. The last third of the book was the best when she described with increasing enthusiasm the satellite launches, the moon landing programs, and the explorations to Mars, Jupiter, and Saturn. I think a closer focus, not 1950-1980, would have served her better. "

I loved it for the history of the space program from the JPL perspective, which was way more about scientific exploration that about getting humans into space (JPL thought the moon was kinda boring), and as a story of women supporting each other in a unique workplace and dealing with work-life balance when there was no societal support for such a thing. The most compelling non-fiction book I've read in ages. I didn't want it to end. "

As time went on they were learning FORTRAN about the same time I was taking FORTRAN classes at the University of Kansas on an IBM650 vacuum tube computer. As they graduated to an IBM1620 computer I was at a research lab connected to Syracuse University using the lab's IBM1620.

And the fact that not a one of these women's names is common knowledge is downright criminal. With today's push for females to enter computer science fields, it's surprising to learn about the original computers, and how they were nearly all women supporting and promoting other women. And that these women were highly respected and valued by their male colleagues is a lesson we should all be carrying forward. "

I almost stopped reading after hearing about one women's pregnancy cravings for donuts. Good thing I kept reading to learn how one engineer's busy schedule made her gain weight from too much junk food.

201,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/66703498-bubbyy,2,"Short review: What I got out of it. There were a lot of blood, sweat, tears and money -- gobs of money -- invested in launching the first and famous rockets, telescopes, etc. we take for granted in our grade school science books. And some of those invested and impassioned people were women.I knew that the women being there and succeeding in these jobs was impressive; this book did not make me feel that. If I were still into rockets and space I would have enjoyed this more, but I'm certain there are better books to read for a tech, space, physics or engineering enthusiast. I read this more for the ""girls"" than the ""rocket"", and I was disappointed.Original-ish review:Pretty sure my review would be completely different had I read -- and reviewed -- Rocket Girls before reading  Hidden Figures -- but I didn't. It was mentioned in some review of Hidden Figures, and through some series of events I acquired a copy and read it.I was compelled to read Hidden Figures after seeing the movie. The movie was good enough and moving enough to make me curious about the ""real"" story. I wondered what didn't make it to the screen. I wanted more of the story of the (black) women at that time.I think my expectations were misplaced. I was hoping to get a continuation of the building of a detailed, portrait of a number of remarkable women and some of their accomplishments; I was hoping to be moved by the narrative (not just the subject), but that's not what Rocket Girls offered.Rocket Girls was (relatively) slow read for me, owing to these mismatched expectations, but objectively it is a more accessible, lighter read. From a historical/archiving perspective, it covers a lot more ground -- at least in terms of time -- and is more focused on space exploration. The presence of ""rocket"" in the title is fitting. I'd even say the ""sciency"" parts (e.g., mention of formulas and rocket structure, etc.) are more accessible. Given that most of my enthusiasm for space faded before I graduated college, these were respectable but not winning ingredients.The ""girls"" were presented from the get go, and I developed only the weakest interest in most of them. This stood in stark contrast to the deep respect cultivated in me over the course of Hidden Figures. If it's not obvious, diversity is what pulled me toward Hidden Figures and Rocket Girls; so the ""girls"" I remember most -- can rattle off the top of my head for this review -- are the Chinese woman, the black lady and the one (white) woman who hired most of the girls. --They presented potentially novel individual narratives, and I did not get to learn enough about them. The rest of the girls' stories were already familiar to me or simply uninteresting. The interspersed stories about XX wanting to find a husband --or not wanting to find a husband -- made me want to put down the book.The most compelling drama was around the various rocket launches. Would ""rocket X"" being developed in secret be launched before the project was shutdown?! Dun dun dun...Maybe the author was trying bring rocket science to a female audience in a fun-serious way and it just fell somewhere awkwardly in the middle for me. I appreciate it for exposure for future science girls though."

I thought it was well written and super well researched and I was BLOWN AWAY by the scope of the book — from the 1940s to the present!! Super cool. I love how this book came into being, too, with the author googling her child’s baby name and then finding an Eleanor Francis who worked at NASA back in the day. I love that so much. A couple of the passages and anecdotes really stuck out to me and I’m going to nerd out about them here lol“The engineers marveled at Helen’s ability. She worked quickly and accurately. Her knowledge of mathematics was exceptional, and if she had been a man applying for the job, she likely would have been hired as an engineer. This was true for many of the computers, whose education, frequently consisting of a bachelor of science degree, was identical to that of the young men being hired in engineering.” Page 118 — THAT. LAST. SENTENCE. THOUGH. GAAAAHHHHH. I feel like I’m that Anger gif from Inside Out, like for real. So many things in this book made me MAD, all of the goddamn sexism and firing a woman because she was pregnant/might get pregnant, and just...all of the bullshit that women still have to deal with in 2019. It makes me tired. We’ve come a long way but DAMN 🙃The story on page 274 about not wanting to do a launch in 1989 because there were no peanuts and they were all superstitious without their snack food because the peanuts had been handed out for NEARLY EVERY SINGLE LAUNCH SINCE 1964 (!!!!)AND THEN T minus 31 seconds, the launch was canceled because of an electrical issue, and everyone was not-so-secretly like “thank GOD” and then this bit cracked me up — “This time Wallace had made peanuts a top priority. Barbara and the other engineers, now fortified, watched the rocket blast off successfully” That made me laugh so much. I loved it!I ABSOLUTELY LOVED the bottom of page 281: “The cohort hired and trained by Helen, Barbara, and Sue had spread out around the campus and, in turn, hired women of their own. The proportion of female engineers at the lab increased from 9 percent in 1984 to 15 percent in 1994. Today more women are employed at JPL, in all positions, than at any other NASA center. It’s an achievement made possible by Macie [Roberts, who worked at JPL for decades before retiring] and Helen and their tireless campaigns to hire women over the course of fifty years.” I LOVED LOVED LOVED the sisterhood at the JPL and the layers of camaraderie and support from all the new hires, the working mothers, the single girls, the older women, and I will forever be in awe of their amazing, formidable, incredible brains and skill with math and science DONE BASICALLY ALL BY HAND up until a couple decades ago. I bow down. Last bit I want to rant about. On page 287, I LAUGHED SO MUCH when Sue was still at NASA and they tried to be stupid and nitpick-y because of her lack of degree. How absolutely idiotic and disrespectful of all of her years of service, and I’m glad NASA corrected their obvious mistake. “In 2008, the fiftieth anniversary of her starting at the lab, JPL changed the rules and dictated that all engineers were required to hold advanced degrees. Because Sue (Finley) never finished college, they took away her salaries position and switched her over to an hourly rate. However, once administrators saw how much overtime she was getting, they made an exception and switched her back. Sue is NASA’s longest-serving woman.” Page 287"

That said, it was an educational journey about the genesis of the space program from the very beginnings of the first experiments of creating fuel recipes to launch rockets out of the atmosphere to the present day Space Station. The science and technology that evolved over the decades was epic which now, we almost take for granted. However, I was fascinated and proud that these special women even as early as the 1940's when the women's role was to be in the home barefoot and pregnant or if employed, the professional choices were as a nurse, teacher or secretary, were making such a tremendous contribution to what we now think of as the space program as ""computers"" at the JPL labs (Jet Propulsion Laboratory) in California. Computers were women who used pad and paper to do complicated calculations to help with designs of rockets, satellites, and finally NASA sanctioned programs. These women were instrumental in computing the complex and integral math necessary to allow rockets to fly into space and to follow them as they reached into the solar system where no person could have imagined humankind could go. They designed landing vehicles that explored the moon, Mars and travelled to take pictures of Saturn, Venus and Uranus and beyond. It was really amazing to think that early on, in a profession typically dominated by men, an entire department of math and science geniuses were made up of only women and it stayed that way into the present day. JPL still exists today but instead of pencil and paper to do this minutia, calculations are left to computers and programmers who do this painstaking work. Interestingly, as the decades passed, the original group of women became early programmers learning how to code their calculations into massive computers which were early cousins to the fast, light weight and more complex computers we have today. The contributions to math and science and later computer programming, opened up these careers as choices to the women who followed them. They knew how unique their situation was and because of this, became as close as sisters. But their work was not without sacrifices. Marriages failed and choices to not have families were outcomes to their devotion to their work for JPL. Traditional family roles were sometimes reversed as the women with children sometimes turned the child rearing over to their husbands or babysitters to do because of the long hours spent at the lab. The book portrayed the timeline of women's rights over the decades and even how something like the Pill changed decisions of reproduction for women in the workplace. Up until then, if one of the women got married, pregnancy was a definite cause for having to give up the work they loved. But, even if they left, often they would be called back, even 6 years later because their work was so vital to the success and safety of the men and rockets. The Epilogue was especially heartwarming as the author travels back to JPL with the women who started it all and captures their thoughts as they stroll down memory lane."

The focus of the book is the first two or three decades with the establishment of the lab and the birth and growth of the American space program and the labs vital role in all this (the space program up to the triumphant success of Apollo), the period from 1970-present is given a more cursory examination. It is a look at the lives and struggles of these women as they worked on some the complicated science and engineering of the space program. The struggles include personal tragedy, societal pressures that held back women from technical work and some sense of the technical challenges involved in the work. As years progress women went from doing calculations to programming the computers to do the calculation. The book is based primarily on interviews with the surviving subjects between 2011-2015 backed by confirmation with archival sources and existing histories. The author clearly also did some research into the history of the space program and computers.The book does a little work to place the women's lives and work in context of both NASA history and to a lesser extent computer history, but if you crave such broader context you do not find a great deal here. It is likewise light on details about space science and engineering, the exact kinds of equations they are solving or even arithmetic they are doing is obscure but some outline is given such as the importance in the early days of the mechanical desk calculators to perform multiplication or find square roots. The book is clearly aimed at a popular audience. It is not an academic history filled with technical asides, footnotes and context, but I find it a credible and interesting source for an academic history from the role of women in science and engineering to the issues of trust in machine versus human computation and many other issues.I actually listened to the audio book version of this. Included with my access to the audio file, was a pdf of the front matter (which uses the hardcover ISBN apparently) and notes of the book (it is not exactly a bibliography and more a running discussion of sources broken down by chapter). The audio is in general fine but I have to notes, first the narrator pronounces the word ""shone"" as shown which I find odd but perhaps is standard in some dialects of English, more serious the narrator pronounces the name Euler as ""You-ler"" whereas we all had drilled into us in high school math classes to pronounce the name ""Oil-ler."" I note this so the faint of heart may steel themselves against the assault. ;)"

The women that were shown as being integral to the labs work were called ""computers"" and the hardships they faced being women some of whom could do logarithmic math and complex calculus better than some of the men who had the actual engineering degrees. As the tech progresses we see them migrate from doing it by had and with slide rules and log table books into early computer programming and later using things like BASIC, FORTRAN, and HAL. Even at times by the early computer revolution when the first Intel 4040 started the PC eras, some of these women went back to hand plots because of the reliability of their own notebooks of previous years. If this was only about these women and the hard work of getting into space, with JPL being primarily concerned with space probes. The challenges of them at doing the plots and the dangers of the early work at JPL doing the rocket testing and building. This would have been an interesting book. Heck, even issues these women had trying to juggle both a home life, stressful work life and the challenges of being woman in an engineering program when most of them were not letter as engineers from a school. This would have been at least a 4 star book. Instead what the take away for me is that author dives into minutia about social issues at times. For example we spend almost a third of a chapter talking of the development of pantyhose in the 60s. I am sure that is important but to what should have been the scope of this book, I would consider it minutia and trivia that isn't important when discussing what might have been more important things such as trying to observe these launches and make it to swim meets or help with recital costumes. Similarly, the author has a core set of women discussed in the book. Yet, for a few of the early chapters and the ""founders"" of the department discussed, she leaves us with ""and had babies and left JPL"" no follow on, no epilogue, no other accomplishments. Rather it's like these earlier women were shades that help to frame the office, but were not important to the later successful operations.Still this is an interesting book and worth your time. I just wonder if someone could really do good justice to the ""computers"" of JPL and focus more on the tech vs social life aspects."
206,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/612636-beth,4,"After watching the movie Hidden Figures, I was ready to plunge into some reading about women and space -- and having heard that Hidden Figures (the book) was a little dry (though I still think I'll give it a shot), I reached for this one instead.I really enjoyed the broad scope and clear writing of this book. I learned a LOT. The author began this book with the very earliest days of rocketry -- a bunch of Caltech college boys dubbed the Suicide Squad, based on their explosive hobby. Soon, the group got more funding and a real name: JPL (Jet Propulsion Laboratory). In a little canyon in Pasadena, the lab first developed and tested rockets used for military might; then, the rockets exploded into space. I'm fascinated by the exponential rate in which the technology developed: it took years for the rockets to break through earth's atmosphere, but only a few more years before they were circling other planets. Computing power was the same: after cranking out calculations for years and then having monstrous-sized computers filling entire rooms, microprocessors made of silicon made computing by hand a thing of the past.I find space exploration particularly fascinating, so I loved getting a whole run-down in one book. I finally have a basic understanding and timeline for all the missions I'd heard about (Apollo, yes, but also Mariner and Viking and Voyager and Magellan and Spirit and Opportunity). It was interesting to read about both their failures and successes.Central to the author's story are the women who were instrumental in getting these rockets into space. If you've seen Hidden Figures, you know part of the story: these women were hired as computers (people who compute) before machines could do that work. They plugged in the math, calculating the trajectories, and then became the first programmers, as well. Many of these women became engineers, critical to 21st century space exploration. I really enjoyed learning about them, though admittedly it was a little tricky to keep track of who was who -- there were so many of them! (That's a good thing!)This was just a little bit slow-going for me in places (possibly more indicative of my own life than the merits of this book, though admittedly I didn't care much for the military section ... probably much like the JPL engineers themselves). And since this book was so broad in its scope, covering 50+ years of history, I was left with a lot of questions. Overall, though, I really enjoyed this book for all I learned, and I'm eager to find more well-written space-y books!"
207,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1722508-gordon,4,"I listened to this audio book in a few days and enjoyed it. It is an unabashedly opinionated story of the women of JPL in the small town of Pasadena contributing to the invention of rocketry and space exploration as we know it today.The reviews on this book are pretty mixed, and probably reveals a lot about both the reader and the expectations on the story.We do have a primarily female oriented view of the world, the trials and tribulations of the main characters are set in the harsh world or unfair rights and expectations, and the male and corporate view of them at various times (titles, attitudes, maternity leave etc) are true to form and not something that would leap out in any other story of the same situation.However the author does no favors in a number of ways - everyone is pretty, there is a lot of focus on dress, and apart from an early mention of the first African-American hire there is no racial byline in a wholly gender focused story. This threw me, as I felt there is more there, and like many I found this book via  Hidden Figures. In some ways it emphasizes the rarity of the Hidden Figures as a minority within a minority. As an audio book it was also pretty difficult to follow the various story arcs of the main women in the story - due to some time leaps and interweaving it was sometimes configuring when someone left to have a baby and returned to work later after two, for instance.The whole arc of JPL is fascinating, and the the contributions of the computers and engineers who made it happen are detailed in just the right level of abstraction (description of computer languages seem a little dated, but the treatment of FORTRAN etc is excellent). I don’t know if there is rosy twist on the move away from weaponry development to space, or if it was the true feeling of the lab, and the change in narrative tone on von Braun was a little disappointing, but the pacing - with more focus on 50’s and early 60’s and then a light coverage of the 70’s through (almost) present day meant that a lot of ground was covered.The epilogue ties off the book nicely."
208,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/62219503-jenny,3,"I almost didn't finish this book, and had already started writing a scathing review because of the amount of time spent on the appearance of these incredibly intelligent, groundbreaking women was ridiculous and off putting. The beginning of the book does what much of society already does, and instead of judging them on their contributions to rocket science, mathematics and other scientific fields, focuses on their looks and family life to a bizarre degree.If you look specifically at the beginning of the book and the Bechdel test of two women talking about something other than men, then sure, this passes. But spending an entire chapter on the JPL beauty contest, and spinning it as a sign of advancement because there were enough women to have it, instead of an outdated and demeaning part of being a woman in the sciences in the 1950s is normalizing the behavior, and that is a no go. It would be like, oh, my IT department has enough women in it now to have a contest to see who's the hottest, and being told that it's an advancement because there is enough diversity now to do it. No. Hard Pass. I wanted to read this book for the contributions of these phenomenal women to the sciences, not for their style or what damn dress they wore to work that day. The title of this book and the blurb on the back espouse the groundbreaking nature of these women and their work, why is it necessary to bury that in details of appearance? The book moves past this, finally, in later chapters and focuses on the contributions to STEM and the space program.Though attempting to follow the real time line, there really isn't a rhyme or reason to how the women are introduced to the book. The background information on each woman is scattered, and frequently difficult to follow. Though the beginning of the book irritated me immensely, I am glad that I finished the book for two reasons. First, I feel almost duty bound now to go back to get my masters in software engineering and cybersecurity. Second, the last paragraph of the last chapter, but especially the last line, will stick with me for a very long time. ""They [programs on Voyager 1] are the legacy of women written in the stars."""
209,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4781225-lucid-beatnik,3,"""Rise of the Rocket Girls"" tells the story of women working at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL), following them from the days of JPL's founding when women were relegated to the ranks of the ""human computers"" who crunched numbers all the way through the modern days, where women lead teams responsible for JPL's involvement in interplanetary probes and landers like Curiosity. On the whole, I liked the book. I learned a lot about the history of JPL and about women's contributions to space exploration. I will say, though, that this book desperately needed a technical editor, and if it had one it needed an additional one. There were a lot of times where the author used inappropriate analogies and in some cases blatantly incorrect numbers in describing missions. The author is herself a biologist, so I found it surprising that a scientifically literate person would get so many of the descriptions wrong. Technical nitty-gritty aside, I would rather have read a version of this book twice as long but with more detail. The author talks in the acknowledgments about meeting and interviewing the women featured in this book, but unfortunately, a lot of the details of that interview were either somewhat superficial or were cut for length. Instead of reading a few sentences that told me that a certain marriage ended, I would much rather have read pages telling me more about the challenges that the couple faced and how the decision was ultimately reached. There's not as much of a human element in this as there is in ""Rocket Girl,"" written about Mary Sherman Morgan by her son. Ms. Holt is a much better writer than Morgan's son, but I feel like he was more willing to record and speculate about his subject's thoughts, hopes, anxieties, and struggles. My issues aside, this is a good book, and I would highly recommend it to anyone who wants to learn more about JPL and women's involvement in the golden age of space exploration. This would also be a perfect book for middle- and high-schoolers who have an interest in science and math--it is an inspiring call to action against the still all-too-common cultural and institutional barriers against women in those fields.

210,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4579658-rob-kitchin,3,"In the late-1930s a trio of young scientists were playing around with rockets on the Caltech campus in Pasadena. As the Second World War began in Europe, they received funding to explore the military uses of rockets, setting up the Jet Propulsion Laboratory. One of their first recruits was their friend, Barby Canright, a gifted mathematician. Her role was a computer, calculating the trajectories of missiles with varying characteristics (speed, weight, etc). She was joined by a handful of other women and over time the computing department became an all-female domain. Over time, the work shifted from hand-calculation to using a digital computer to computer programming. While the women conducted vital work, and they often contributed key ideas rather than simply undertaking calculations, their role was generally under-valued, though by the 1960s they were starting to break through the glass ceiling and taking on the role of engineers.Nathalia Holt tells the story of the role played by women calculators/engineers in JPL from the 1930s through to the present, including their contributions to missile research and to space exploration. In particular, she follows the lives and contributions to a selection of these women, with the narrative being based on a series of personal interviews, as well as documentary sources. While the topic is fascinating, the telling is somewhat weak. Holt opts for a style that is almost purely descriptive and a voice that seems aimed at young adults. The result is a narrative that provides a potted history of the women’s lives and the development of JPL, but pretty much outside of any social or political framing. And the extended timespan thins the description. As a consequence, while revealing the important work of the women, the telling lacked depth, analysis and critical commentary on institutional and gender politics and the wider social and political climate, and women in scientific careers in the second half of the twentieth century. Which was a shame, as JPL is clearly a very interesting site of basic and applied scientific activity, where women have and continue to play a vital role."

This book draws comparisons to Hidden Figures for obvious reasons, but Rise of the Rocket Girls is less coherently written, and the narrative jumps from character to character and anecdote to anecdote, which makes it choppy to read. I understand that Holt was trying to humanize the characters, but I felt like her constant fixation on the women's clothes and romantic drama undermined their presentation as incredibly smart mathematicians and engineers in their own right, not to mention their roles as groundbreaking figures as women working in science. I also wish she had further interrogated prevailing social mores of the various decades (sexism, racism, etc.) and gone deeper into the cultural context.As for the actual work at the Jet Propulsion Lab, this book gave me a much better appreciation for how difficult it was difficult to get literally anything (even a small probe) into space, and it helped put the later accomplishments of space exploration into perspective. Some diagrams would have helped make sense of the various trajectories the women were trying to calculate, but I mostly followed along with the descriptions. Holt clearly did her research and interviews, as the notes at the end showed, but the writing style could come across as a little simplistic, especially in contrast to the serious scientific work she was recalling.In some ways, I felt like this book was written to appeal to teenagers (especially girls) who may not have a lot of interest in science but are open to reading about it. Which is certainly not a bad thing (I emphasize!) but as someone who reads 50% nonfiction and a good number of popular science books, I felt like I was a little bit outside the target audience of this book. If you don't normally read a lot of nonfiction or science books, don't be afraid to pick this up — but if you do, set your expectations accordingly, especially if you really loved Hidden Figures."

The expansion of women's roles at JPL stand in sharp contrast to trends in the rest of the country. In 1984, 37 percent of computer-science graduates were women; today that number is at 18 percent.
Sad when you think about the gains in some areas, but the struggles we still face for employment in the science and math fields. My daughter was discouraged after inquiring about work in one IT/Computer department because she was told by the man in charge of the computer lab that he did not believe women should work in the computer field. She did find an IT/Computer job elsewhere after leaving the aforementioned company.Well researched with primary resources, I feel this book is a must read.

213,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10835551-david,5,"In the early days of rocketry heavy duty mathematical calculations were required for thrust, trajectory, and other critical data. One of the early methods used before and during WWII were computers, the term referred to talented math-savvy women who would get the input data from project engineers and then do the calculations all day, every day. Whenever there was a disastrous result after launch, the search for causes always included a check of all the calculations done by the computers to make corrections and improvements for future launches. As primative hardware computers began to show up they were mostly operated by their human counterparts. These women formed the core of programs that went from war products to space exploration including men into space and moon landings. By that time some of the women had moved up and became project managers. Some went back to school and earned engineering degrees and advanced degrees in fields of science. This is an incredible true story of critical participation and contribution to our successful space program. Starting from the origins of what became JPL (Jet Propulsion Lab) to war programs to moon, mars, interplanetary exploration, this book details the stories of the women from their start as math wizards to taking on more and more responsibilities. JPL and other organizations eventually added requirements for advanced degrees and women stepped up their game to claim places in these highly technical and well paying jobs and, for the most part, earned the respect of the engineers and managers they worked with. Great read that takes you from early hand calculations to modern supercomputers and the women who were central to it all. Highly recommended."

I feel that is well researched and had basic language that I was able to understand so 2 stars. One of problems of this book is the title. It should be called JPL and how it got us to the moon and beyond. The author mentioned JPL in every other sentence. Which was nauseating. When it did mention the women the author mentioned their looks; what they wore and how they want to get married. I felt disappointed because I thought she should of attempted to write about Eleanor Francis Helin. Which I thought this is what it was going to be about. Why did she mention her connection between her daughter and Helin. I know she died but I’m sure someone was alive that knew Helin. Another problem was it did not talk about the struggles these women went through. I’m sure it was not all roses. She made it seem that everyone got along and no problems. These amazing women of different backgrounds and ethnicity worked along side white males that were educated and I’m sure there was prejudices and problems. How did they solve the problems. Also some of the women didn’t have college education but young women who were exceptional at math. Are you telling me no problems between the women. When problems or issues were mentioned divorce, pregnancy, low pay author just skimmed over. How did these women feel when they had to participate in beauty pageants. What??? If someone wants a simple explanation of rockets are connected space this is a book you should read. Forget about this book as about a group of women who changed the world using their brain.

Rather than choose one of the occupations most commonly pursued by women of their time (teacher, nurse, or secretary), these women put their math and science skills to work in order to generate equations and complete the calculations that were essential in building rockets, missiles, and satellites. It explores the challenges they faced as women in the workplace of the 1940s-1960s, where maternity leave was non-existent and the idea of working mothers (particularly those with young children) ran counter to societal expectations. This book draws attention to the contributions of women to space exploration efforts and provides a complex portrait of their professional and personal lives. Unlike the segregated facilities at the Langley Research Center (which is familiar to readers/viewers of Hidden Figures), the computer division at JPL was integrated and included women of color among its ranks. Readers interested in the history of the space program and/or women’s history as well as fans of Hidden Figures are sure to enjoy this engaging book.

I always dreamed of working for the space program and I had no idea so many women were involved from the get-go. Books like this are so important because they highlight the contributions women have made to science and America's space program from the very beginning. It's so easy to fall into the narrative that women ""don't like math"" or ""aren't good at math"" just because we never see any women in the field. I loved learning about how a woman helped found the Jet Propulsion Lab and so many female mathematicians were responsible for computing the Apollo mission trajectories. In essence, our space program was only possible because of the hard work of dedicated female mathematicians and computer programmers- something I never learned about in school.The reason I give this book four stars is because the writing doesn't quite flow. The book skips about form person to person and nothing seems to come to a conclusion. In part this isn't the author's fault- a lot of these women's stories end with ""and then she got married and her husband made her quit"" or ""and then she got pregnant and they fired her."" But I feel like there's no overarching concept tying chapters together and the writing could have been a bit more engaging. Overall I'd definitely recommend this book to anyone interested in how NASA got its start. I'd definitely say it's suitable for middle school and up. There's nothing age-inappropriate but the writing can get a little technical. "

I really enjoyed learning about the progression of the space race, and all the experiments and work that went into the Jet Propulsion Laboratory. The lives of these women who contributed so much are interesting and I enjoyed reading about them, and how they contributed to space exploration. I listened to this on audio, and the narrator did a great job making these women seem real and relatable. I understand why the author put in a lot of personal details about these women, but I found there was quite a big focus on their romantic relationships, and getting married and having children. I totally understand that in the time when these women were working, they were not the status quo, and juggling expectations would have been difficult, but their work was so much more fascinating.Closer to the end of the book, I did find things a little repetitive, and it got a little boring. There wasn't as much detail about the launches, and the disappointments and tragedy that happened didn't seem as tragic because of how it was presented - even though reading about these events in other articles made me feel that loss. Overall, I'm glad this exists and it sheds some light on some wonderful, intelligent women who contributed so much to space exploration., but I wish it hadn't focused so much on their romantic relationships. I would have preferred to read more about the sisterhood they created, and not just hear about it...it felt more tell than show for that portion."

It was like reading about a circle of friends who happened to be really smart and know about engineering/math before women were considered capable of doing such things.

The author is trying to tell the story of the women who worked at JPL as the early computers behind all of the early space exploration work. However, in trying to make it a human-interest-style biography about the personal lives of the woman *and* a historical account of the technical work of the computers *and* a anthropological examination of the changing times and changing role of women in the second half of the 20th century, the author succeeds in doing none of them well, and instead writes a garbled and erratic narrative that leaves the reader a little lost and confused. This seems to be an all-to-common fate for writers tackling this kind of historical account, and one that seems easily remedied with a more cohesive chronological line, a bit more devotion to explaining the science and tech, and a bit less of the ""color commentary"" on the subjects' personal lives. The latter seems especially egregious in books about the important and underappreciated role women have played in history, because it undermines the subjects by reinforcing gender stereotypes that held these women in the shadows to begin with - Did Rise of the Rocket Girls really need a page long tangent about Barbara Paulson's new pantyhose? It was an interesting book, but it left me with far more questions that now have me reaching for answers from more talented writers. "

It starts out a little pedantic and dry, but by the time one is a third of the way through with it, the reader is invested in the essential accomplishments of these women who started out as human computers as in Hidden Figures but ended up being designated as engineers. Their calculations were essential to the rockets being tested in the '50's and the space program after that. They worked at the Jet Propulsion Lab where they were treated as partners by the male engineers. JPL also has had the highest percentage of women computer experts of any major entity. It was fascinating to learn of all the problems and successes of the rocket and space program. One reason I was a little at sea is because, although I have a mathematician daughter, I have a very limited background in math. The highest I've gone is Plane Geometry and Algebra II. However, when the problems they were trying to solve were described, it reminded me of some of the problems my daughter thought interesting. One other slight problem with the book is that it takes up one woman, leaves her, takes up others, and then gets back to her so that it was a little difficult for me to get a complete sense of who each woman was. However, the events were quite sequential, so the book was organized enough to be readable. Women need to know about these pioneers!"

But prior to IBM taking over the calculations, math was considered to be “women’s work”.Amidst all the gossip about these women, one thing really didn’t hold true for me at all. None of them were ever propositioned or pressured for sexual favors by their male coworkers. That is not reality. In that era, it was a constant problem for working women. Especially attractive single women, which we were told, all of these women were. Even in the 70s & 80s it was a problem. Granted by then, we could legally do something about it, but what we got for our trouble, was to get our jobs back, where the man was still working. But you had to take that job, because once it got around that you’d tried to legally defend yourself, you just never got hired again. Most of us, just did our best to deal with it & kept quiet about it. For me, the most interesting part of the book was the effect of McCarthyism on JPL. Force out some of the founding members & then turn to a Nazi war criminal instead. Nothing against Von Braun, it’s just the irony of the situation. If that happened in a work of fiction, it would come across as unbelievable."

Rise of the Rocket Girls tells the story of how woman played an integral role in shaping space exploration. It was empowering to see their stories - these women took on challenges as early as the 1940's that were well beyond what most people are capable of doing today even with a computer. At times the talk of the math and physics was a bit beyond the average reader, but it was written in a way that was still fairly easy to understand. In addition to learning about the challenges - some at times were challenges that seemed insurmountable - the story told the history of the women at JPL. These women who came from all walks of life are an inspiration to all. The men who worked at JPL in its early days were also very forward thinking.I had no idea just how many challenges and near misses the space program had had. If it weren't for these amazing mathematicians and engineers, who knows what would have happened. This book left me feeling inspired. It shows just how much can be accomplished when people from different backgrounds come together and work as a team. Each person was valued for their individual and unique talents. Just think of the good that can be done! I hope we are all luck enough to work in that kind of environment. "

I should love this book, it's women pioneering space science, but I don't. The rhythm felt off. In my opinion there was a disproportionate focus on the women's personal lives. The whole first third to half of the book was all about ""the girls"" and how they dressed up for work and their dating lives. And I get that the personal relationships they formed is important for the story, but I would've liked more about the work and the science. In the last third of the book the story finally takes off. We see more and more about the space projects and the long lasting impact these women have had on space exploration. Until this book I didn't know that all the pictures we saw of the planets when we were in elementary school were from space craft these women programmed. The Mars rover that just went silent last year was programmed by these women. Space craft they programmed in the late 80s are still heading deeper into outer space. It's incredible! And that's why I thought this book would be more interesting. I feel like this is an okay book, but if you want to learn the history of JPL and different NASA programs there are probably more interesting and better written options out there."

Fun trip down memory lane about missile programs and space missions JPL was associated with. Mind boggling the computations these women did by hand. The pride in their work comes through the story telling. Sounds like most of them transitioned to computer programming when the machines started showing up (which didn't happen everywhere). Painful the choices women had to make between having a job or having a family. No such thing as maternity leave until the 70's. Nathalia Holt did a fine job telling their history without making it dry.Hardback library book. Heard good reviews.==================The riveting true story of the women who launched America into space.In the 1940s and 50s, when the newly minted Jet Propulsion Laboratory needed quick-thinking mathematicians to calculate velocities and plot trajectories, they didn't turn to male graduates. Rather, they recruited an elite group of young women who, with only pencil, paper, and mathematical prowess, transformed rocket design, helped bring about the first American satellites, and made the exploration of the solar system possible. For the first time, Rise of the Rocket Girls tells the stories of these women--known as ""human computers""--who broke the boundaries of both gender and science. Based on extensive research and interviews with all the living members of the team, Rise of the Rocket Girls offers a unique perspective on the role of women in science: both where we've been, and the far reaches of space to which we're heading."

They were calculators when machines to calculate hard barely been invented. With slide rule and log tables these women used their brains to work out the formulas needed to fly a rocket or missile.Having faced the same problem as these women did: where do bright girls go if they don't want to be a teacher a nurse or a secretary? I chuckled at the book group's younger members asking 'Did that really happen? Even if you had been to university?' Yes it did, and women are still restricted in how far they can get career wise. These women wanted to use their mathematical and scientific skills and were able to by luck and being in the right place at the right time. How many women missed opportunities to fulfill their abilities because of those entrenched attitudes?Well worth a read, and a good book for young women who might just grow up to be scientists and mathematicians."

It's very appropriate - it's the history of the ""Rocket Girls"" who were an essential part of the creation of JPL (Jet Propulsion Laboratory) here in Pasadena.When they first started, they were called ""computers"". They charted and mapped, calculated and computed the trajectories and such for rockets and then, as JPL and NASA moved into space, of satellites and space probes. The went from the creation of ICBMs to Voyage & Cassini.The primary requirement, at the beginning, was that the women had to be very good at math. They were. Much of the work they did was really writing software, for computers that hadn't been invented. One of the nicest parts of the story is that JPL didn't replace these women with male computer programmers or software developers. Instead, they kept these women educated, trained and up to date on all the changes, mostly at Cal Tech. (For anyone who's worked with old computers, the fact these were the people who started programming with something called SHORT CODE, went to FORTRAN, then BASIC and then on and on....)If you're interested in this part of history, this book falls into the ""Wow!"" category.."

It reminded me of the times I had to write essays in school and I gathered all the information and kind of threw it together without any flow. Anyway, these women amazed and captivated me. They were so ahead of their time. They worked full time, took kids to the babysitter and most of them made more money than their husbands. They were called computers which sounded funny at first but that is what they were. They computed numbers (without calculators!) to project the trajectory of the rockets. All of the data needed to put the rockets in the correct position for maneuvering around the planets was done by hand on paper before launch and during flight. They would get the data coming from the rocket and calculate the numbers so they could tell the engineers if it was on the right path. I learned some things about the city I am from, Huntsville, AL and Wehrner Von Braun who was instrumental in the space program (but, in my opinion, a bad person since he was a SS in Hitler's army and committed Nazi war crimes).

228,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1716755-christine,5,"4.5 stars.when picking up this book I was a little worried, because I read Hidden Figures earlier this year and thought they might be too similar. Not the case. While about a group of women computers, this book was much better written and had a better flow. I think it really helped that the author of this book has a science background. Her explanations of the science were easy to understand and sometimes included graphs (always a plus in my book!). You could tell the technical aspects if this book were things she understood.This book spans from WWII to practically present day. It is about the evolution of space exploration, juxtaposed with the women who were an integral part of it at the Jet Propulsion Lab. As a child I wanted to be an astronaut and this book brought back all that wonder.The author did a great job of weaving the problems they faced in the job ( both from a technical point, as it is a very challenging field, and because they were women in a man's world), with their daily struggles trying to balance work and family. Some of them made it work, for others it didn't. It gave a very real picture of their lives though. I would highly recommend this book."
229,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7114603-crystal,3,"I enjoyed this book, but was distracted by the narrative style, which seemed to bounce around a lot, and not always in a logical way. While I certainly appreciated learning about the personal and professional challenges these women faced, the writing surrounding the women's family lives and bodies was sometimes awkward. There were a lot of descriptions of dresses clinging to curves and fingers running along pantyhose, for example. I think this was done to highlight the fact they were still feminine (a common stereotype about women in the sciences is that we aren't feminine and don't take care of our looks), which I appreciate in theory. In execution, however, it just came across as unnecessary. I would have rather read more about the science, their friendships, or how they actually navigated what we now call ""work life balance"" than what lipstick color someone wore or how their diet made them gain weight.All in all, worth the read, but don't expect it to be life changing. Consider it an introduction to the lives of the women who changed our universe and the way we see it for the better."

I loved learning all about these amazing women ""computers"" who transformed rocket design and made our exploration of the solar system possible. Of course they were Star Wars fans too! I love that I found myself constantly on Google images to get a better idea of what certain things looked like. It bounced back and forth between work and their home lives- which really struggled because of the rigorous work they did at JPL/NASA. Their husbands were the ones who had to pick of the slack at home. I also enjoyed some of the parallels the author made. For example in the Matt Damon movie, The Martian, there was a rocket fuel and explosive fireball scene. When matt Damon tries burning rocket fuel to make water which he uses to grow food... shortly before this scene, Damon claimed NASA's Jet Propulsion Lab came into existence after some Caltech students lit part of their dorm on fire with a rocket test gone wrong. So it was neat to read about the history of all that."

It was similar in some ways to Hidden Figures, which I also read recently, but I didn't enjoy this one quite as much. I think part of my struggle with this was that I read it as an ebook and had a harder time keeping track of all of the people than I might have if I were reading it in paper form (generally my preference). But I also felt like it would have been stronger if it hadn't covered such a long span of time. If it had focused on just the earlier years, or even the earlier decades - or if it had covered fewer of the women's stories in depth - it would have been better in my opinion. I also found some passages describing the women's clothing choices and love lives really awkward. Presumably the idea was to portray the characters more completely, showing them as women of their time and not solely as computers and engineers, but I doubt that their male peers would have been described similarly, so it grated a bit.That said, I did enjoy this window into that time and place and the people involved, and I'm glad I read it."

However, their mathematical lives did not necessarily make for gripping reading for non-math types, and I got a little bored before the end.I wish the author had better described the sacrifices some of these women made in choosing careers over families. The only way their work was possible in most cases is because of the ""support staff"" back home who helped raise the kids. But not many details are included about the husbands, parents, or others who helped at home, or the difficulties of the balancing act. Sometimes the stress and guilt these women faced in trying to do both is glossed over. Reading about the cultural norms of the day is both fascinating and stupefying (e.g., the workplace beauty pageant!). I'm glad we've progressed as a society. It gives some nice perspective to know where we're coming from in the recent past.There are a lot of women in this book, and it can get a little tricky to keep track of each of them. It would have been helpful to have some identifiers sprinkled throughout to help jog the memory."

I️ wish there was more detail either on the orbital mechanics they were studying, or the early computers they took on. Most interesting was the Ranger program, which were the US’s unmanned lunar missions that collected data for the Apollo program.It’s frustrating to read about how limited women’s roles and opportunities were in the workforce back then. There is so much more progress that could have been possible.Some cool stats:* the aerospace industry in SoCal grew from 1k employees in 1933 to 300k in 1943* By the end of WWII, American aircraft manufacture constituted the largest single industry in the world* Back in the 30s and 40s, chemistry scientists frequently blew their own glass for their beakers* The army (which ran JPL before NASA) had the capability to launch a satellite a year before Sputnik, but Eisenhower didn’t let them, as he didn’t want the first satellite to come from our military, In case the space race turned into a space war* In 1960, only 20% of mothers with dependent children were in the workforce"

This book answered some of my questions, although it was at JPL in California and the women were mostly white.I learned that ""computers"" first meant people who computed. Women who showed aptitude for math and could calculate quickly were hired to do the grunt work of calculations (pretty complicated higher level math, actually) necessary to analyze data from rocket engine development. Mechanical computers (early IBM and Burroughs machines) eventually made their way into the lab, and the women became the experts at programming them for their work. (It's kind of ironic that so many women made up the ranks of computer programmers back then when you consider how male-dominated the field is today.) Many of these women, starting in lowly ""computer"" jobs, made vital contributions to space exploration with their work on Voyager, Apollo, Mariner and other projects at JPL."

This almost feels like a companion piece to Hidden Figures which focused on female math and science geniuses at NASA who happened to be women of color. These stories revolve around the women working at JPL in Pasadena and in addition to the remarkable camaraderie and friendship shared by these “computers” as the human job description these women worked under, we are given a history of the evolution of women in the workplace from a time where there was no maternity leave and a woman was forced to resign when her pregnancy was announced to a gradual recognition of the value of her knowledge and experience, leading to many of them being called back to work when their babies were small. As a child of the 60s I have always been fascinated with outer space and have felt that our country’s commitment to its exploration reflected the best within us. When we have realized that our planet contains the only life in our solar system it seems shortsighted, at best, that we seem to be doing our best to destroy it. "

This covers another group of women, ""computers"" working for the Jet Propulsion Labs in southern California. This picks up in the 40's when rockets were needed to provide rapid launch velocity for aircraft on carriers. It traces the computers through challenges as diverse as calculating military rocket trajectories, geometries for maximizing thrust, stabilization, orbital velocity, and all the way to gravitational slingshots to reach the outer planets in the 80s. These computational challenges are presented so even a mathematical numbskull can understand.As fascinating as this history of our aerospace progress is, what makes this book is the portraits of the women, their teamwork, achievements, and balancing work and personal lives. For far too long these female heroes of our aerospace program, like the codebreakers of Bletchley Park and spies collecting Nazi secrets went unrecognized.I feel obligated to fill in the gender hole in my understanding of history but that's not my reason for reading about these women. Their stories are fascinating."

It amazes me that these women have been so overlooked in books about space now. Their fingerprints are all over our space program. The women in Rise of the Rocket Girls contributed in large ways to our understanding of the solar system. Much of the credit is given to men in situations like these, but women had as much of a hand in it as they did. To look on JPL's website and see the bio blurb for Sue Finley is extraordinary. These women's work is still impacting the world, though most go through their day without realizing how much these women contributed. Finley, in particular, caught my attention because she's still working for JPL. I think this book also gives proof that the US didn't just suddenly develop the ability to send a man to the moon. As someone who didn't do so well in math in school, I am envious of these women and their contribution to science. Because of that, I know how important it is that girls are encouraged in the STEM programs."

The women computers were doing the work engineers thought beneath them, but its that work that ultimately got us to the moon and beyond. Helen, in particular, is a hero for how she found ways to work the system to create career advantages for women. A few stars were knocked off because Holt's writing style wasn't to my taste. The timeline was messy, descriptions could feel felt forced, and thoughts were expressed too simply. Not all of the personal details bothered me because it helped to put them firmly in their time-period. Having done historical interpretation, I know clothing is an important (overlooked) detail for how it affected people in the past. The problem was so much of these personal details interrupted the narrative flow. Ultimately the goal of this book was to show us how the groundbreaking work of the first modern career women affected them professionally and personally.

At times the narrative was a bit technical but not so much to where it could be considered overwhelming. The author did a wonderful job of keeping even the most scientific explanation simplistic. The women the author chose to highlight were extraordinary! They were pioneers both in and out of the home. The complexity of their mathematical calculations and their contributions to modern computer programming is staggering. The book is largely chronological but does have moments where it deviates from that and highlights an event from an already covered year/decade. There was a massive amount of data that had to be condensed in order to make this book a reality. It read largely like a fictional tale so I believe most anyone could pick this up and enjoy it. This is not a book to be overlooked but one to be embraced with an appreciation of all the women who came before us. "

It was not an easy career by any means, as society still frowned on married women with full-time jobs and expected them to stop working and raise families. Many of these women did manage to balance work and family (although a few of the marriages did fail). As computing started to be done by machines, these women went right along with the changes, becoming programmers and later engineers.Holt covers the many missions these women worked on, the failures as well as the successes. I had not remembered that the Voyager launches had come very close to failing. It was also interesting to see how these women programmed alternative flight trajectories when necessary due to accidents or budget cuts.I only give this three stars, though, because I found the writing style rather drab.

Both are about the beginning of the space program but in different locations and different populations. While the books are far more that just the continent apart, they also had many similarities. Each also mentioned activities that are described in detail in the other book. Both books were excellent and written from perspectives that I was unfamiliar with. I grew up with space in my life. My father was an engineer at a satellite tracking station and later a satellite telecommunications consultant. I know many of the results of what happened but not why. Most of my knowledge also comes from a white male engineer point of view of my father and his colleagues. I told my father, who is now 81, of the books. He asked for the full publishing information so he can get them. He is blind so this takes a little more than just the title and author as he needs books for the blind.

It's an account of the women (human computers) who did so much to make the Jet Propulsion Lab what it is. Holt interviewed many of the women and members of their families, and does a good job intertwining the stories of their professional and personal lives. It was almost happenstance that women played a key role from the beginning of rocket development and space exploration, just before World War II. JPL began as a college club with a small handful of members, but they were close friends with a young married couple, Richard and Barbara Canright. When the club got a research grant and developed into a business, the Canrights were their first two employees. Barbara, a math whiz, worked as a ""computer"", doing all of the mathematical computations by hand.It was not happenstance that women came to dominate the computing department at JPL as the company grew. It was some of the best paying work available for bright, math-oriented young women. The pioneers in the department made sure to seek out other women, mentoring them and finding ways to make their job work for them, even with the birth of babies (something that usually ended a woman's career back in the day.) JPL was groundbreaking as well in integrating the workforce. Janez Lawson was the first African American woman hired in the department and one of the first to learn to program what we now think of as computers. Helen Ling, a Chinese American, rose to head the department for many years and made great efforts to scout and mentor promising women, sending them for training as engineers. A quote from the book: ""While protesters were demanding equal rights for women across the country, the women at JPL had created their own equality."" By the 1990s, a woman, Sylvia Miller, was in charge of the Mars program.Things I didn't know until I read this book: In the 1940's an interest in rocketry was considered quack science in a lot of circles. The first Mars images made it back to earth only days after Neil Armstrong walked on the moon. The Voyager was secretly programmed and built to do a much larger mission than had been approved by Congress, just in case..and the planning paid off, as its early success led them to approve the plans that had already been made behind their backs anyway.A fascinating and inspiring read."

Rocket Girls is hands down the best non-fiction book of the year for me. The interweaving of the technical aspects with the personal lives of the women was well-balanced, and the science written simply enough that it was comprehensible to us every day folk. To think that so many women played such a large role at JPL and yet the history books rarely, if ever, mention them is a complete crime.

It was fascinating to learn about this fabulous group of women, throughout the decades, that I too have lived. Being an early baby boomer, I remember these times and also, having loved math too, wished I had been able to play the part these women did in our space exploration. The criticisms of mentioning the clothes they wore, or the private lives and how they intersected their work lives, are important to the story. Today, when we are still fighting for equality in our country, we must remember every hard won victory and be sure we do not lose any gains we have made. I was most impressed by how the older women fought for the younger ones and their inclusion, instead of how we hear so many stories about women not supporting other women in higher positions. The only way we will win the ""war of the sexes"" is by sticking together, not tearing each other apart."

When there's no infrastructure, it's mighty difficult to make change happen -- but they did, and they helped grow the infrastructure along the way. Huge changes along the way: they adapted to the changes that came, and they helped shape the changes.It was intriguing to see how the science and exploration grew: competing (valid) philosophies on what it was all supposed to be for, important questions about who/what was in charge, and why, and to what end.It was also fun to just see these regular people going to work (which just happened to deal with sending rockets to the moon and back).

Those women were pioneers in computing and science, also they were ahead of their time socially. I was very impressed that JPL upper management allowed the then supervisor to only hire females in that group. The group made waves in hiring women over more than 50 years. Now JPL is the leading NASA institute in women employees in all positions. Another tidbit: Rose parade was moved to North Carolina in 1942, in preemptive effort to spare it from attacks in west coast. "

TBH it is not the most well written book I've encountered, but the story itself is so fascinating that I didn't much care. The author is a bit clumsy in the telling, you can clearly see that the author is more scientist than author. For example, she tries (admirably) to tell the factual history as well as to intersperse qualitative anecdotes within that show the personal lives of the women. While both the professional and personal lives of these women computers are fascinating, especially given the historical context, the author doesn't quite manage to weave the two together seamlessly, so the transitions between what was happening scientifically, with what was going on in the women's personal lives is a bit clumsy. Nevertheless, this was a fascinating, and easy to digest (for a very non-scientifically minded person such as myself) look at such an important, and lesser known aspect of the space race. A great, and easy read!"

Several folks in my book group didn't like the writing style, but that doesn't usually bother me with nonfiction. I'm reading for the story more than anything. I had heard of JPL in the space of strategic planning - they certainly do long-term planning at this organization - always have. They are planning missions to take advantage of planet alignment that only occurs every three decades, for example. JPL is part of NASA but more focused in space exploration than on human space flight. The book is about female computers at JPL who performed complex mathematical calculations for testing and launches, before electronic computers existed. As times changed, the women migrated into programming and other areas of the organization. Employing women in this capacity was virtually unheard of in the 1940s, when this book begins."

These women were true pioneers, using their superb mathematical prowess to hand calculate key data needed for the development of jet engines and later rockets and space missions. Later, they were the experts in the machinery and the early mechanical computers. These women broke many barriers, moving towards gender equality and working after marriage and children. The stories of these women are based on extensive interviews and research and provide a novel insight into the early aerospace industry and the unique culture at JPL. These women’s work made the advances of the American space program possible and continued to provide key guidance to the programs that led to some of the major achievements of the unmanned space program."

While I did think the story tended to jump around a bit which made it a little difficult to follow, I disagree with the other reviews saying that this was written in a sexist way; discussing what the women wore or their families does not detract from the amazing feats they accomplished and it also helps the reader to understand what was going on in their minds. They had to worry about what they wore, about their husbands, about their kids and their family responsibilities, and yet they STILL maintained these amazing careers and got us to space and beyond. Though their title was ""computer,"" they were not simply robots who came to work and had no life outside of that and I think this book does a great job of emphasizing that. As a woman in the aerospace industry I thoroughly enjoyed reading the stories of the women who paved the way for me and all other women in my generation going into STEM fields."

There are moments of fascinating details and peeks at personality of the many women whose lives and work this details, but above all it reads like a freshman book report. There are strange detours, such as the multi-page history of computer processing chips and the founding of Microsoft, that distract from the story. The largest disservice, although I think it was intended to be kind, was the way the challenges these women faced were mostly glossed over. While mentioning the stats that at the time only 25% (later quoted at 20%) of mothers were working outside of the home, the author explores very little of how truly difficult this must have been for multiple JPL computers. The constant whip-lash between the personal lives of these women and the multitudes of technical details of their work, left me wanting to know more about both. Overall, this book lacked focus and a clear story arch. I do not recommend."

A really fascinating look at the history of space exploration from an unusual point of view, but not terribly well written. Lots of loose ends of narrative, and it relies on dates far too much. One doesn't, or at least I don't, remember the date of everything that's happening in a book, I like to have the passage of time demonstrated by something more like ""after five years"", or ""just three months later"". I was forever skipping back to see how much time had passed since the last mention of a date.Weirdly sexist too. I don't have a problem with talk of weddings and clothes, I'm sure women (even highly intelligent ones) were interested in these things, as they are today, and it does help to put the history in context. What I find odd is the ""women only"" hiring practices. Seems strange. "

Overall, the book was informative.However, this book took an incredibly long time for me to read. There were so many names, and I kept finding myself having to go back and figure out who people were or which mission was being discussed. The topics also seemed to go into different directions. One moment I would be reading about testing rockets and the next moment the author was describing one of the women's outfits. Other times a great deal of description went into one event and another was discussed in a few sentences. Many times I wondered if the book had been written by multiple authors because of the different styles I encountered throughout it."

What really made it exciting was reading about the experiences of the women who played a pivotal role in space exploration. Women were respected and valued for their mathematical abilities and work ethic as the first ""computers"" yet, as time went on, the struggles and dilemmas they faced increased as they advanced in their careers. As they married and raised families in an era when few women worked outside of the home, they faced obstacles that are important for us to acknowledge. It is revealing, however, that by comparison, there are fewer women today entering computer science and engineering fields despite no longer facing the obstacles on a level that these women had faced."

A combination of history (in chronological order), politics (including race, gender, war, and international), science (with plenty of excellent explanations and analogies), and biography (written in such a way to make you tear up when appropriate). This is how I wish Hidden Figures had been written. I think Hidden Figures contained all those things (but without the extra in the parentheses), and had the benefit of being about women who had even more obstacles to overcome by being black in the south (and emphasizing this well), but was just so dry and did not have the great scientific explanations. I read these (well, listened) back to back which is why this review contains the comparison.

They told about exploring the closest planets but only revealed the plan to explore the further planets once they found early success. Kind of reminds me of some of our finagling to do what we want rather than let politicians get involved in design decisions!I couldn't help but feel a little surprised at the reverse discrimination of hiring only women in the computing room.Not much is changed for working women since the 1950s. No maternity leave, having to use up sick and vacation time for childbirth. I am surprised and not surprised all at the same time that times really aren't very different at all for working women. Key to success is a supportive spouse. "

The book covers a period of 30 years during which the US space program grew in competition with the USSR, which had launched the first manned satellite. The whole country was riveted by the sight of our astronauts setting foot on the moon and other firsts. Meanwhile social changes were shaking up women's relation to work and family. A good and inspiring book, though I found it hard to keep track of all the women and various individual space programs and ended up skimming the last 20% or more. There was something of a reticence about showing any depth of character that might have made the women more interesting as individuals. "

There is a good mix of mostly professional, but touching upon personal, lives of the women who calculated trajectories. The book shows how important this work was. It also shows how far women's rights and perceptions about women's abilities have progressed since the 1950s.I was well into this book before I saw the movie ""Hidden Figures"" (which takes place at NASA proper and focuses upon the African-American lady computers), so that I was much more familiar with and interested in what was going on, including recognizing FORTRAN.

Covering everything from complex mathematics done by hand to mastering the first computer programs, maternity leave (or the lack thereof) and the strains on relationships from “trying to have it all,” this book was a joy to read and a wonderful lesson in forgotten history. The women at JPL and NASA have so strongly shaped the course of human history and space exploration, and I will be forever grateful for the work they’ve done, and to Nathalia Holt for sharing their stories!"

I did find it a little hard to get through at times. There was a lot mentioned about the women’s marriages and children and I felt like the book struggled with its identity. (Though I understand this approach because of the historical context). Is it a nonfiction book about the scientific contributions of JPL’s women or a sappy montage of marital struggles and babies between excerpts of NASA missions? It seemed a little messy organizationally. Regardless it was a nice read- I just think either tell the entire story (home life and work contributions) of one or two women biography style, or keep it about their careers."

It is a history of the Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California and the women who worked there. These women were first hired as computers for the missiles JPL was creating for the Air Force. But JPL wanted to explore space. The women first worked with pencil and paper to personal computers. These women helped plot trajectories for rockets and satellites. They were part of a team that sent spacecrafts to Venus, Mars, Jupiter and Saturn on multiply occasions. These women were the first computer programmers as well as the first women engineers. They also were often working mothers at a time when it was quite uncommon. This is quite the fascinating book about the role of women in the exploration of space. I highly recommend this book!"

She obviously researched each woman heavily, but adds details of what they were thinking or feeling that feel contrived. She also spends a disproportionate amount of time talking about their appearances, without ever getting in depth enough with any single woman to make it seem more than superficial. The book was also badly organized, with a slow start and rapid finish that glossed over some of the more recent NASA achievements. For example, the Mars Rovers barely got any time, while the very early days of JPL got multiple chapters, before NASA existed. Overall an interesting and informative story, but could have been better organized and more detailed."

And it highlights far more than three women, JPL had the highest number of female employees of any group within NASA's orbit. The changing workplace dynamic over the decades was well drawn. The key point throughout is still the same today, pregnancy is career killer #1. As electronic computers began to challenge their sisterhood, many opted to become programmers.

The only fault I could find was an omission in Holt's explanation of the Challenger shuttle launch disaster. While schedule issues certainly played a part in the decision to proceed with the launch despite the cold temperatures in Florida that day, the fear that the Russians would conclude that American missiles would not be an effective deterrent in cold weather because they used the same O-rings was more likely the proximate cause. Overall this is a significant book that highlights the role women played in the development of the space program and gives us a good account of the preparation that was required to get hired and the quality of the work and dedication of these women.

I learned the central role that women played in the early early history of the use of computers in Science. The story covers the founding of the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, where the earliest experiments with rockets and rocket fuels were done in the USA. The original meaning of the word ""Computer"" was of a person (and in JBLs case, always a woman) who did the calculations needed for the design of rockets, rocket engines, rocket fuels, rocket trajectories, and on and on. And they weren't just adding and subtracting! No, they were advanced in math and calculus and literally solving equations needed to make these rockets work. A great book for anyone in the field."

Rather than telling the story strictly chronologically I wonder if the story and its importance might have been conveyed more effectively if it looked at some of the topics in separate chapters. Some examples could be the math involved, the transition to computers and how that affected women, changing attitudes about women working after marriage and pregnancy, race (whatever happened to Janez Lawson?) gender discrimination and how that changed over time in the space program.

It (sometimes awkwardly) flips back and forth between descriptions of the day to day lives of a few individual women, and long scientific explanations of the technology itself and the historical context of the space race.

I also greatly appreciated the details on the way these women worked out family and career. I wouldn't have thought it all possible for the timeframe before I started reading more women's stories. Overall, the story and narration held my attention but there was something a little off about it.

But JPL is where so much of the space exploration and the math and science with it began. It is a great companion read if you are a fan of Hidden Figures, as well. The skills and drive of those women are utterly inspiring."

Possibly interesting for those interested in the history of JPL. Some of the worst non-fiction prose I've read in years: full of cliches and generalizations. ""Margie sighed and wondered how much more she could take. She knew something had to give.""""Sue pointed out the moon, glowing an ethereal white against the darkening sky...its glow was like a beacon, challenging them to come closer, to uncover its mysteries. Sue and Margie were ready to accept the challenge."" Would have been better as a 90-minute documentary. These women deserve a better send off. "

I'm glad I read about these. However, I found the book far too chatty, a bit murky chronology-wise, and a bit short on deeper context. I'd have enjoyed more on the applied science involved, the actual mathematical problems worked, and the greater cultural context of the times. This was more like diary entries than it was a book like ""The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks,"" and I suppose my expectations were for the latter. Still worthwhile a read, if lightweight."

The ones covered are the women who worked on calculating things, from trajectories to fuel flows.The weakness of the book is that it doesn't cover women who worked in other departments at JPL, or fully put the women actually covered into the context of the work itself, with a few exceptions. It's nice to know that a couple of them married badly, but those same pages could have been put to other uses.Still, it's very informative and interesting. I just wish that some of the stories had been followed through in a bit more detail."

It's an incredibly well researched piece of fascinating history. The problem, I think, is that Ms. Holt is trying to do too much. If she had focused on one or two of the women and really given us their characters or focused on JPL through the women, without giving us the personal stories of marriages and kids, then I think the book would have been much stronger. As it was, we get an amazing amount of detail, but nothing to really anchor it to anything. Some important things felt like they got short shrift while seemingly inconsequential minutiae was dwelt on in agonizing detail. "

I was surprised to learn about the early interest in interplanetary travel (not just travel to the moon). Sometimes I got bogged down in the information about the rocket industry. The best parts for me were those that focused on women’s issues: the effect of pregnancy on careers, the changes brought about by birth control and policies like maternity leave, the total disparity between men’s and women’s careers and the general lack of support for women, etc. "

It is fascinating how the women were treated. They worked as computers, before the machines took over. The women then learned to program and operate the machine computers. The computer industry today is very male dominated. I appreciated the history of the space program told in this book. I never really understood how many failed space missions there were. The fact that we figured it out at all still blows me away. TLDR: I enjoyed the book. Read it, if you are interested in the history of the space program, or women in computing."
295,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/38881115-donna-charlevoix,4,A good read - complimentary to the movie Hidden Figures. This story is based in So Cal and chronicles the history and legacy of women working at JPL. It weaves the story of the women and JPL with the space race. The first half of the book was more engaging with an emphasis of how the lab focused on hiring women to do the mathematical computations needed. The second half seemed to focus more on space missions and the role of these women. I skimmed through much of the second half. I’m a scientist by training and found the story of the origin of JPL as well as the story of how women played such a key role there equally fascinating and interesting.

I genuinely enjoyed learning about the roles of women in the growth of JPL, NASA, computer science, and space technology. There were several instances in the book where I did get frustrated due to how women were treated in the workplace (fired due to pregnancy, not promoted despite being more qualified, blatant disrespect by male colleagues due to their gender, etc.), but I was also frustrated by the ""that's just the way it was"" mentality that the author seems to adopt throughout the book. There are several redeeming moments but overall I only enjoyed the book for the facts of it and not the writing voice."

The women who worked the numbers for the Jet Propulsion Lab in California were the mental muscle behind the early efforts of space exploration. “In this job you need to look like a girl, act like a lady, think like a man, and work like a dog.” The inequality they dealt with is maddening. The icing on the cake was them being forgotten when Caltech celebrated 50 years of JPL. Not even invited. But the tone of the book is upbeat and not stuck on the feminist perspective. I appreciated the simple explanations of complex theories. The writing was ok, the reader of the audiobook was good. I alternated between listening and reading."

Their jobs changed over the years, from computing all math manually, to using primitive computing machines, then primitive computers, and finally they were programming the computers. The women computers in this book were highly intelligent, talented mathematicians. The Jet Propulsion Laboratory worked along with NASA producing rockets to explore space. So it was a fun look back in time at the space race too."

The women began working as ""computers"" writing out all the equations themselves, but they continued to prove relevant when they also learned how to write computer code. The women supervisors hired women almost exclusively and encouraged them to get advanced degrees. In a time when many women stopped working when they got married or pregnant, many of these women came back after their children were born, and several worked there for 30 plus years. There's a lot of technical information here and a lot of characters, but if you can see past that it's a great story. "
