He's a Platonist and a positivist. He's worried that Schrödinger's cat is in a quantum state, where it is held alive and held dead. He feels that can't correspond to reality. But that doesn't bother me. I don't demand that a theory correspond to reality because I don't know what it is. Reality is not a quality you can test with litmus pap. All I'm concerned with is that the theory should predict the results of measurements. Quantum theory does this very successfully. It predicts that the result of an observation is either that the cat is alive or that it is dead. It is like you can't be slightly pregnant: you either are or you aren't.""In “The Nature of Space and Time"" by Stephen Hawking and Roger Penrose by Stephen Hawking in the lecture ""The Debate""Can I write a review on such a book? Hawking and Penrose... It's staggering...I don't even know what day the mailman comes...After having re-read this oldie after Hawking's passing, I'd say it depends on where you are in the universe, whether you're on/near some sizeable object (of mass), its rotation, distance from other masses, or whether you live in my neck of the woods...If you're into Physics, and Quantum Mechanics in particular, read on."
1,0691050848,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7206839-jenny,3,"Hawking promised that his and Penrose's lectures and debate would be technical, and he delivered on that promise. I liked the book because it's always entertaining to read two great minds bicker a little bit, and I did learn some information about black and white holes, singularities, and the origins of the universe, but I didn't understand most of the book. The jargon is real. There are tons of equations I couldn't possibly understand. What I did appreciate, though, is that Hawking summarized his lectures at the end, and Hawking was a master at making complex ideas seem simple for people like me. In the debate, I couldn't tell you who won. Penrose seems to say that Hawking wins by comparing their debate to one between Einstein and Bohr, one that people at the time claimed Bohr won. Penrose says he's like Einstein in this debate and Hawking like Bohr, which seems to indicate he felt Hawking won.Overall, the book is short and a quick read if you're not really trying to understand everything in it. If you want to do that and really make a study of it, you could. But if you just want to get a little out of it and be entertained and challenged, this could work for you too. It helped me, during an off month from work, to keep my brain in motion, at least. "

3,0691050848,http://goodreads.com/user/show/831864-ryan,4,"Considerably more technical than either Hawking or Penrose's lay material (A Brief History of Time etc.) If you're seeking an introduction to the controversy behind Hawking's quantum gravity speculations (Hawking radiation, the no-hair theorem) then this is a good start. Is quantum information lost in black hole evaporation? There are still no solid answers to the questions posed here."
4,0691050848,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6539564-lance-schonberg,3,"Up front: this book is not for everyone. I’m actually not certain it was for me. I haven’t really studied physics since the courses I took in the early 1990s in university. This was originally written a few years later, but assumes more than merely a rough knowledge of Relativity and Quantum mechanics – you actually need something more than just a basic introduction to really grasp what’s going on here.But, armed with the internet, I persevered, more or less.The science may be a bit dated, but since the book is 20 years old, that shouldn’t be too surprising. It’s also hard to tell without more physics, and more recent physics, than I have.As a result, this is going to be a rather shorter review than I often write.Hawking and Penrose are having a friendly conflict about the nature and structure of the universe. This is not a book for generalists or people with a passing interest in relativity and quantum mechanics. While the authors assume you have a basic familiarity with the relevant mathematics and quantum mechanics, I might suggest that basic familiarity is more along the lines of post-graduate.Overall rating: 3 stars, but I should probably actually go with 2. What I understood was interesting, but what I understood wasn’t enough of the book. This isn’t a popular science book. Penrose and Hawking are talking much closer to the level the operate at. If you’re close to that level, the book is probably a lot more enjoyable."
5,0691050848,http://goodreads.com/user/show/16873425-caitee-nigro,4,"This book was recommended to me by a good friend a while back, who insisted I purchase my own copy because he couldn't stand to part - even temporarily - with his. So I did. Maybe a month later, co-author Sir Roger Penrose spoke at a local university and I was fortunate enough to see him, as well as have my very untouched copy of The Nature of Space and Time signed by him. Only recently did I read it, and I'd be lying if I said I could comprehend more than half on my own.Reading this book, more a collection of expository scientific essays than anything else, worked itself out into a research project for me; every chapter was organized by subtopics or sub-processes that required a considerable deal of Wikipedia look-ups on my end to keep up with the content (which, by the way, must, must, must be read in order). The back-and-forthness of it, however, did pay off in the end in that if someone asked me, ""What the hell is 'spacetime' anyway?"" I could explain to them (though not nearly as eloquently as Hawking or Penrose--it's a start, right?) the relationship between theoretical ""space,"" physical space and the effect that they have on time and its perception. The Nature of Space and Time sparked in my interest in reading more on theoretical physics, and I'd quickly recommend the book to anyone with a shared interest who 1) has a PhD or 2) doesn't mind three hours plus of research per fifty lines of text."
6,0691050848,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5329741-tanya,2,"Some of this information is dated, which is to be expected reading it so long after it was written. I could follow most of the math, but was disappointed by the lack of variable definition. Penrose's writing was much more clear than Hawkings and I believe I'll search out some of his writing on the topic the next time I approach this subject."
7,0691050848,http://goodreads.com/user/show/45647627-sarah-khalida,3,And all those mathematical equations and terms like Lagrangian and Eulers numbers which I learned in calculus back in undergrad emerged. A very technical read - I skimmed through most of it and highlighted the 'absorbable parts'. More Stephen Hawking in the future for me! 
8,0691050848,http://goodreads.com/user/show/16212136-peter-pete-mcloughlin,4,"A seminal collection of papers from Hawking and Penrose from the 1970s. Both Physicists worked or are working in the field of General Relativity and the papers are stabs at Quantum Gravity, Black Hole, Physics, The early big bang and whether or not it is a spacetime singularity and Black Hole Entropy and Hawking Radiation. These ideas show up all over the place in popularizations of theoretical physics and cosmology. I looked at the papers. They are admittedly above my level of expertise. I didn't study General Relativity as an undergrad in Physics but I got bits and pieces of the argument. Worth a look but someone who did grad level Physics would get more out of it."

Delmore Schwartz""...time is a companion who goes with us on the journey and reminds us to cherish every moment, because it will never come again."" Jean-Luc PicardI found the information in this set of 3 lectures to be somewhat interesting but because I am not a student (or practitioner) of science I found it to be a bit too specific to the field of physics/quantum mechanics/advanced maths/etc. for my general interest.That said, one big problem I have with this is that he mentions god several times, and given there is no proof of god, why is he continually referring to a scientific ""nothing"" in his lectures? Even though I am not a scientist, the fact he mentions god tells me his science is not completely rooted in reality but rather at least in some part is rooted in mythology, and that tells me he lives in a world in which I do not live."
10,0691050848,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4819959-wanyoung-kim,4,"Lots of diagrams. Has a lot of loaded philosophical statements that were useful when writing a thesis. Helps to explain singularity, cosmic censorship, etc. "
11,0691050848,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1769635-derek,1,"I gave it a good college try, but was immediately swamped by the intense theoretical physics and deep mathematics involved. As a series of lectures between the two physicists as they voice disagreements about the nature of the universe, it was interesting to be a sort of fly on the wall, to see what these big brains talk about when the rest of us aren't around. On the other hand, they're discussing these things at their own level and not the level of a layman, so one might as well be a fly on the wall for the comprehension of the subject is concerned.I gave up after failing to understand even the nature of the disagreement."
12,0691050848,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1823794-jeff,3,"This is collection of essays is an argument between Hawking and Penrose about the origin and ultimate fate of the universe, plus some entropy notions about black holes. I will say this: Hawking throws equations out there like you flat out know what he's talking about. His disclaimer is that he assumes you know some math and quantum mechanics. The QM arguments were easy enough, and while I've seen some topology before, I wasn't hugely familiar with GR, so his essays were sometimes hard to follow. I thought Penrose's essays were a lot more accessible."
13,0691050848,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4870905-hayley,3,"As much as I enjoyed the concepts that were meticulously laid out in this book; it hurt to read.

The illustrations are poor, formulas given without any explanation of the symbols used in it, etc. etc. I felt really stupid while reading and trying to understand.
