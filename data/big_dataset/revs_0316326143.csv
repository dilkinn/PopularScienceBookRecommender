The focus is unsurprisingly on the quest for unification, after an initial puzzling proliferation of discoveries series of particles. This short book provides the necessary background to appreciate the significance of what is being investigated in supercolliders, including CERN and the ATLAS project, looking for the important Higgs boson and possible supersymmetric partners."

2,0316326143,http://goodreads.com/user/show/264832-julie,4,"I like how Gribbin ties history and theory together to give the reader an anchor in time and personality. Very helpful for these abstract concepts. This is a short, dense book that covers a lot of ground in a very readable way."
3,0316326143,http://goodreads.com/user/show/23136825-jim-bowering,3,A good summary of the search.
4,0316326143,http://goodreads.com/user/show/49196-kevin,4,"This is a more serious science book for layman, e.g., not an easy read. The latter comment does not imply it is hard to follow though. The framework is laid out very nicely explaining how the physicists came up with concepts one after another, eventually leading to quantum physics, and from there start discovering atomic/subatomic-level particles and building up mathematical relationships and validating their mathematics with particle accelerators, with the ultimate aim of explaining the unifying theory of physics of multiple forces. The only problem is that you need to grapple with terms like borons, fermions, leptons, hadrons, etc., which are only explained once when they were first mentioned. Having said that, the complicated mathematics is dealt with at a very high-level that does not slow down the story development. "
5,0316326143,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4675628-priscilla,4,"Great interweaving of the historical framework of physics research with more ""technical"" details/information. Great introduction to individual particles and subparticles, the evolution of how they are defined, and how they are thought to be constructed. Got a little too fast, for me, when the book got to field theory - would have liked the chapters on larger theories to be as complete in description as were the sections on the ""objects"" of the quantum world. One of the best science books I've read by someone who wasn't actively involved in his discipline (Gribben has a PhD in physics, but writes instead of working as a particle physicist). I'll definitely read more from him.Couldn't put it down. Kept me up night after night."
6,0316326143,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11165908-cathy,4,"This is the 2nd physics book I ever read, and I just finished up my re-read of it. I know its old material now, but I wanted to ease my way back into physics. Gribbin does a good job of brushing through a brief history of particle physics, from its beginning with wave-particle duality up through the surge of string theory in the 90s. Im not sure how it reads to a non-science person... But I have a love/hate feeling with the lack of math. He touches on the major points and what they ultimately ended up meaning for physics without getting bogged down with details."
7,0316326143,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4408725-catherine,4,"This is a great book for anyone who wants to get a cursory but good overview of quantum mechanics, its relationship to classic Newtonian physics, and its implications for how we understand the universe. Gribbin writes in an informal but erudite style, and he inserts the difficult equations only when necessary and to prove a point. I usually find that books written for non-physicists like me tend to be patronizing and long-winded, so this book was refreshing. Also, it's short enough and has enough short chapters for those of you who read on your commute! "
8,0316326143,http://goodreads.com/user/show/649925-sheena-d,4,"Gribbin does an awesome job making physics heartbreaking, relevant and accessible for all of us who just can't get it. And he's not even that mathy or impossible about the whole ordeal! After reading this, could I explain super-symmetry to a nine year old? No. But maybe you would be able to. And for what's worth, the historical snippets of the lives of various physicists who who were hungry for some unified theory are fascinating. "
9,0316326143,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2648205-white,5,I got this book when the news of superstrings made its way into the commons. This one is bordering on a mathematical appeal but it is still easy enough to understand. The famous split experiment of particles and waves is referred to in here and the connection to superstrings being at the foundation of everything that exists takes center stage in this book. I loved this book. It goes a bit further than some in half the pages.
10,0316326143,http://goodreads.com/user/show/16401727-doug-barg,4,"This is the second book by Gribbin I've read. While avoiding overstatement or manufactured emotion, he has a talent for eliciting the drama from the trajectory of scientific exploration. At the same time he simplifies extremely advanced concepts into accessible explanations without becoming either patronizing or didactic. After completing the book, I re-visited the CERN LHC website, and was delighted to find I had a much more profound understanding of the research there."
11,0316326143,http://goodreads.com/user/show/21592691-jeff,3,"Don't think I ever read it entirely. Got this in August 2001 at the Discovery Store in Baltimore after the Blue Stars season ended, parting with Davonna, and before heading to the airport with mom & dad. "
12,0316326143,http://goodreads.com/user/show/22920876-diddier-gil,5,"I love science books. This one talks about quantum particles, but does it in a language that any mortal can understand. One of my favorite books."
13,0316326143,http://goodreads.com/user/show/231006-yohanes-nugroho,4,"About half of the book is easy to read, but the rest is just too complex for me (Physics is not my major). Very interesting book."
14,0316326143,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2116888-sadia-maqsood,4,"Anyone who is into quantum mechanics, this book gives you a time line of advancements in the field. was totally engrossed in it. "
15,0316326143,http://goodreads.com/user/show/81114-laura,3,"some popsci is absolute crap. this, however, is not. also, the cover is totally beautiful."
16,0316326143,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4633930-aina,5,"Great particle physics book, loving it! Wow, such a well written book, difficult subjects of particle physics and attempts to build a grand unified theory are explained so well."
17,0316326143,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1632189-matt,3,Fairly accessible for the lay-physicist-wannabes in all of us. 
18,0316326143,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11073574-elio-nakouzi,3,One of the more accessible books on this matter.
19,0316326143,http://goodreads.com/user/show/24709912-luke,4,Intense book... Kind of like going down the rabbit hole. Blew my mind!
20,0316326143,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2484957-diane,3,fascinating read.
