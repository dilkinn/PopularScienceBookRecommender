0,0307264785,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1613125-craig,3,"I really wanted to like this book. I have long held a fascination with traffic -- probably because of all hours I've spent stuck in it wondering why it behaves the way it does. I remember having weird traffic discussions with co-workers about traffic like: pretend you left the office to go home at 5:00 and it took you 1 hour to arrive in your driveway. Leaving at 5:30 on the other hand, because of the lighter traffic, you would roll into your driveway in only half an hour. If you and your housemate left at these times is it possible that you'd arrive at home at the same instant, despite having left work a half hour apart. Yes, a clinically strange thing to talk about on coffee break but, like I said, traffic fascinates me.When I saw this book, and especially when I started to read it, I thought I was in Heaven. A book that spoke to this bizarre side of me that I never knew was shared by anyone else. As I made my way through the book a lot of that hope and promise vanished however. Aside from the fact that about a third of the book is taken up with acknowledgments and references (seriously!) I never really felt that it used all that research all that effectively. The conclusions that were drawn never really clicked with me. For example, the author goes on at length about why it's a good idea to be a ""late merger"" on the highway when there's an upcoming lane drop. He prattles on about late mergers just being economical about the road -- using as much as there is instead of choking up another lane by merging early. I never really understood that and the argument fell short of being convincing. Another example was that the courtesy wave -- letting someone pass, turn ahead of you, or merge into the lane -- was some evolutionary carryover from caveman days that has roots in being nice to people for reasons of not wanting to be wonked over the head with a club. In other words, it's an instinct that bears no relevance in today's world but is merely an echo of a time and has no bearing on present situations like, you know, just being nice or something. These are merely two examples in pretty long line of unconvincing and poorly supported conclusions.By the end my worst fears about the book were realized when I had to admit that it was really not much more than an extended magazine article. Like the immortal Ambrose Bierce said: ""The covers of this book are too far apart""."

TRAFFIC is a compelling, curious read that makes you feel like you shouldn't be sitting in a car, much less driving one. You'll learn that there's such a thing as a ""traffic archeologist,"" find out what was killing all the pedestrians in New York before cars, learn about the illusions that plague you as a driver, and hopefully a few things that will change your driving style. Most importantly, you'll learn who is right: the late merger or the early one."
2,0307264785,http://goodreads.com/user/show/85897-ken,4,"I live in Los Angeles, and my daily commute subjects me to this city's infamous traffic. So why in the world would I want to read a book about traffic? After all, I live it every day. Well, whether you live in a crowded city or a small town off the interstate, Traffic turns out to be an interesting, worthwhile look at humans and their machines, what happens on the road, and why.Traffic hooked me right off the bat with its provocative starting point: you're on the freeway in the right hand lane. A sign indicates that the lane is ending and you should merge left. Do you merge at the first safe opportunity and get mad at the drivers who keep zooming past on the right until the last possible merge point? Or are you one of the drivers who waits until that endpoint, where you have to stop and wait for your turn to merge? Tom Vanderbilt used to be an early merger, but then he changed his ways. Once you read the facts behind his decision, maybe you'll change your ways too.Vanderbilt explores this and other conventional wisdom of the road. He also looks at traffic from an engineering point of view. For instance, how much good do all those speed limit, caution and warning signs actually do? What would happen in a busy, urban environment if we just took those signs away and let people figure things out for themselves? (It's been tried and the results surprised me.) Have we collectively done the right thing by widening our roads, adding bike lanes, crosswalks and protected turn arrows?By the time I reached the end of this book, I had plenty of food for thought. It's quite possible that all the traffic planning and road engineering in our major cities has been misguided in some major ways, resulting in the disruption of neighborhoods and increased danger to driver and pedestrian alike. How do we make traffic flow more quickly on our crowded roads – or is ""faster"" the wrong goal in the first place?Although Traffic may leave the reader with more questions than answers, fascinating studies and tidbits are scattered throughout the book, and Vanderbilt writes in an easygoing, humorous style. If he occasionally dwells too long on a particular point (I found some of his writing about safety a little plodding), he can be forgiven this minor sin in a book otherwise packed with information that speaks to our everyday lives.One final note: although it was not the author's intent, reading Traffic actually had an impact on the way I drive. I had become an angry driver, and after reading this book, I find myself much more philosophical behind the wheel, and I've cut way back on the pointless aggression. I will try and make that a lasting change."
3,0307264785,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3540225-nathaniel,2,"I had high hopes for this book after it sat unpurchased on my Amazon wishlist for three years...and once I finally got around to buying it, boy was I disappointed. To start with, Vanderbilt is the worst kind of modern nonfiction writer: the know-nothing cherrypicker who did some research on the internet and thinks he's an expert now, despite a total lack of objectivity which comes through on every page of his text. Vanderbilt smugly grabs research - any research - to justify his own pre-existing view of how things are, only bothering to evaluate the studies he's read that HE doesn't personally agree with. Most of the data in this book is just that: data, and while some of the data are interesting, the key to writing a book like this is not just data but what you do with them. Vanderbilt clearly has no background in interpreting data (as so few people who write these kinds of books actually do nowadays - I blame America), so to him, a study from New Zealand is as valid as a study from New Jersey, despite vastly different methodologies, confidence intervals, and populations, and the two can be freely combined if it justifies a conclusion that HE has already drawn. For anyone who has actually taken a class in research methods, it's as lazy as it is amateurish. Worse, however, is Vanderbilt's habit of pushing his own assumptions upon the reader in a way that is simply irritating. The more than occasional ""you have done this while driving"" or ""you were/weren't thinking that while driving"" is almost comically presumptuous and moves him from merely being a hack to being an offensive one - the best one, for me, was ""you have encountered a traffic light that was stuck on red"". Well, um, no, actually. I've been driving for 10 years, have lived in six states in three time zones, including three major metropolitan areas and two minor ones. I've driven in 30 other states in addition to those and stopped at many, MANY traffic lights. None was EVER stuck on red. This is what makes Vanderbilt's book so disappointing - his failure to take the vastly, vastly different regional experiences of drivers into consideration as anything other than a justification for his own stereotyped New York worldview. Someday someone will write a great book about traffic in the United States that takes regional identity into consideration. Unfortunately, this is not it. "
4,0307264785,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1574263-nicholas-karpuk,4,"You suck at driving.That's the message I walked away from with this book. And it was a message that made me sit up and pay attention. Non-fiction is something I read sparingly. Something about long spans of data makes my mind drift off, so I'll realize I've read an entire page without actually absorbing anything. The fact that this book hooked me was rather surprising. A big part of it is the fact that Vanderbilt keeps the topics so pertinent to the nature of how we actually drive. It's an entire novel that seems to be addressing how you, yes YOU drive.The entire thing is chocked full of data indicating that safe, efficient vehicular transportation involves reasoning counter-intuitive to how most people handle their time spent on the road.It points out that roundabouts are statistically vastly safer than intersections, which is annoying to anyone whose dealt with the wacky things. It indicates that safety features and excessive street signs are either worthless or lull us into dangerous over confidence. It observes that driving is a massively complex act with an amazing number of points of failure that we treat as a casual, forgettable part of our day.There were so many interesting facts in this book that I felt like I should be taking notes. At some point I'll probably have to reread this book just to pick up on the finer points I missed.My only complaint is that Vanderbilt often points out a name given to a phenomenon, then never references it again. He'll say something like ""This is what we call the 'Black Swan' effect."" The ""Black Swan"" effect was never brought back into the conversation. Don't try to make me remember specialized terms if it's not relevant to the rest of the discussion! It seems more like he mentions the terms because they amuse him.Otherwise, a highly readable book with a value that can't be overlooked in our vehicularly choked age."
5,0307264785,http://goodreads.com/user/show/724453-matt,3,"I read mostly nonfiction and tend to have a taste for the abstruse, so I was surprised to find myself getting annoyed at the length of this book. Upon further reflection, I realize that this feeling results from my perception that the author provides a lot of details and cites a lot of studies but does not shape them into an interpretive paradigm or offer cogent conclusions. Thus it's just a mass of details--though often very interesting details!A couple of salient points, for me, are the ideas that we are not evolutionarily adapted to travel at high speeds in cars, and thus road engineers have to ""fool"" us into making us think we're moving slower, for instance, by painting the dashed, white traffic lines 10' long and including 30' gaps. Second, a major difficulty in traffic is that it removes the ""sociality"" from human interactions. We cannot see each others' faces and we're not making eye contact as we relate in a very dense environment. Further, an overpollution of traffic signs can cause people to disengage from the social world around them (e.g., that they are driving through a neighborhood where kids play) and only pay attention to the artificial world of traffic laws and signs. In other words, we stop paying attention to the unanticipated and instead assume that if we just follow the posted signs, we'll be fine no matter what, not recognizing that we are social actors interacting with other social actors with potentially lethal consequences.There are some great nuggets in this book, but you've got to dig for them through a lot of dross!"
6,0307264785,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2447803-jason,4,"Tom Vanderbilt has written an original, enlightening, and--considering the current political and financial maelstrom around automakers--a timely study of human driving characteristics and the universal factors influencing vehicle operation. The book is 286 pages with a remarkable addition of 100 pages of notes. There isn't a page in the book without a reference, a majority coming from national government studies and automobile industry safety reports. Overall, the content is highly-researched, international, and leaves the reader feeling he just read a book sui generis on why we drive the way we do.I drive a light, compact, 2-door commuter car and use it primarily on large interstates. I know people who will not ride in my car for fear of being in a crash. They view my car as a 'tin can of death,' as if its size automatically portends substandard driver skills and inferior automobile performance. Vanderbilt's book tears apart, argument by argument, prejudice by prejudice, these kinds of unfounded social myths. Physics can tell you that my compact car will crumple in an accident, but by sheer rate, compact cars are less likely to be in accidents, and much less likely to result in fatalities! The factors are too numerous to list here, but, in highlight, Vanderbilt's analysis explores reasons of culture, physics, anthropology, urban planning, psychology, civil & mechanical engineering, sociology, transportation policy, government corruption, human nature, optics, and much, much more. Each has a unique story to tell. And each, ironically, goes against the prevailing conventions in their societies. The reader (like I did) will learn that they nurture incorrect views of vehicle operation. Despite a preponderance of evidence around the world and from history, there are still mysteries of traffic behavior. Most interesting are sections on the trouble with traffic signs, the psychology of commuting, and the fatal flaws of traffic engineering. Traffic: Why We Drive the Way We Do will undoubtedly be the go-to book for journal and paper articles about traffic in the near-term.4 stars for being comprehensive, easy to read, and informative on a topic that invisibly touches every person's life, daily. Could have had 5 stars, but there was so much information within each chapter that the author should have had a summary page highlighting the main points. I fear that, despite being such a good book, I will forget many conclusions since they weren't underscored time and again throughout the book."
7,0307264785,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1219345-derek-wolfgram,2,"I expected to enjoy Traffic quite a bit - as a person with a psychology degree who loves to drive, I really looked forward to some interesting insights into human behavior behind the wheel. However, I only read about 60 pages into the book before I put it down. One element I disliked was the narrative voice. Much of the book is written in the first person plural, and many of the sentence structures are awkward. To wit: ""So whether we're cocky, compensating for feeling fearful, or just plain clueless, the roads are filled with a majority of above-average drivers (particularly men), each of whom seems intent on maintaining their sense of above-averageness.""While I do like the evidence provided for some twists on conventional wisdom (for example, that cell phone use while driving is not significantly worse than any of a hundred other ways drivers distract themselves), I was left unsatisifed by the explanations in the chapter ""Why Does the Other Lane Always Seem Faster?"" While the book is clearly carefully researched and the author enjoys the material, Traffic just doesn't ever get up to speed."
8,0307264785,http://goodreads.com/user/show/605461-mrm,4,"Well-written and entertaining look at the psychology of drivers (i.e. most of us). I would have preferred more about urban streets and cyclists (as I am a bike commuter), especially since Vanderbilt lives in my own borough of Brooklyn. But of course Traffic is wide-ranging, as it should be -- always good to learn about what's happening in other countries, particularly China and India.The most depressing chapters for me were in the first part of the book, when Vanderbilt describes the various unavoidable ways that people engage in self-defeating behavior on the road. ""Vehicles are moving at velocities for which we hvae no evolutionary training -- for most of the life of the species we did not try to make interpersonal decisions at speed."" (p. 37) The distraction, the cellphones, the falling asleep at the wheel...And we're not getting any better. And every close call reinforces our idea that we're a good driver because we avoided getting in an accident.Speaking of which, I wanted to cheer Vanderbilt in the passage about the word ""accident"" (which he points out that the British Medical Journal stopped using seven years ago because it implies, falsely, that such an incident is both unpredictable and unpreventable). ""The word accident[...:]has been sent skittering down a slippery slope, to the point where it seems to provide protective cover for the worst and most negligent driving behaviors. This in turn suggests that so much of the everyday carnage on the road is mysteriously out of our hands and can be stopped or lessened only by adding more air bags (pedestrians, unfortunately, lack this safety feature)."" (p. 66)Similarly, the most inspiring chapter for me was ""When Dangerous Roads Are Safer,"" which discusses the ways that traditional traffic-calming measures (speed bumps, lots of signs, etc.) aren't the best ways to improve driver behavior and reduce crashes. I made a list of the people and concepts I want to research further -- Joost Vahl, Hans Monderman, the Shared Space movement...I loved how anarchism (not ""anarchy"" as it's misused, as a synonym for chaos) reigned in the Laweiplein crossing in Drachten, the Netherlands, after traffic engineer Hans Monderman redesigned it without signs or lights. ""The responsibility for getting through the intersection was now up to the users, and they responded by communicating among themselves. The result was that the system was safer, even though the majority of users[...:]felt that the system was more dangerous!"" (p. 200)"
9,0307264785,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5006423-william-cline,4,"Well researched and engaging. Distracted driving is a hobbyhorse of mine, along with motoring in general, so I’m pre-disposed to enjoy a book like this. Still, I think everyone who drives a car would take something away from this and ought to read it.Driving enthusiasts, among whom I count myself, will find some challenging ideas in here. For instance, regarding the oft-repeated notion that speed variance, not speed itself, is a greater source of highway crashes, Vanderbilt supplies the missing context showing that this doesn’t mean exactly what we think it means. On the other hand, Traffic isn't full of the knee-jerk anti-car disparagement often found in writings about street safety. (I'm looking at you, Streetsblog.) Nor does Vanderbilt claim that the answer is to rely on technology to absolve us from responsibility for our own behavior:“Whether advanced driver training helps drivers in the long term is one of those controversial and unresolved mysteries of the road, but my eye-opening experience at Bondurant raises the curious idea that we buy cars—for most people one of the most costly things they will ever own—with an underdeveloped sense of how to use them. This is true for many things, arguably, but not knowing what the F9 key does in Microsoft Word is less life-threatening than not knowing how to properly operate antilock brakes.”"
10,0307264785,http://goodreads.com/user/show/34218336-donna-mccaul-thibodeau,2,I read this for my in person book club. The blurb made it sound much more interesting than it actually was. I wouldn't recommend it.
11,0307264785,http://goodreads.com/user/show/20336166-coleman,3,"I am glad I read this book (or more accurately, listened to it while sitting in traffic, which was indeed a strange, almost out-of-body experience as the reader called out mistakes and assumptions I make as a driver while I was making them. I highly recommend reading the book this way). Despite the large amount of freedom riders driving across the seemingly empty pages of this great nation, Vanderbilt indicates that many a driver is a stranger to himself, acting and reacting in ways that may seem normal or safe, but actually cause the ills and congestion of traffic. And every mother's son, (including John Barleycorn), is a victim of traffic.The book is filled to the brim with interesting statistics and factoids, so let me just provide a smattering of the ideas that I found most interesting:-Parking spots are too cheap and too plentiful in U.S. cities, and thus encouraging more people to drive instead of walking or biking or using transit, causing more traffic.-As cities expand outward into suburbs, public transit has trouble reaching people, thus causing people to drive more often, thus causing fewer people to use public transit, thus driving up public transit prices, thus causing even fewer people to use public transit, thus causing more traffic.-Bicyclists are actually safer riding on the street than on the sidewalk, even though sidewalks feel safer.-Men are almost twice as likely to get into fatal car crashes, but women are more likely than men to get into nonfatal car crashes.-Truck and SUV drivers speed and drive more aggressively for a multitude of reasons. They feel safer within their vehicles, and their positions high above the road make it look (to their eyes) like they are moving more slowly.-Roundabouts are far safer than traffic light intersections.I could go on and on, which is actually one of the weaknesses of this book. It's so dense with information, and its thesis is so broad that it is hard to synthesize all these statistics after having listened to it. What should I take away from it? Is there more I could be doing to change laws and regulations to make traffic safer and less congested? Or should I just stop driving altogether? Still, the tidbits I picked up and some of the statistics expanded upon have made me more cautious and more aware of my surroundings as a driver. If nothing else, this book will make you safer and more observant on the road, and there is certainly nothing wrong with that."
12,0307264785,http://goodreads.com/user/show/963692-bill-keefe,1,"Confession: I couldn't take more than three chapters.Tom Vanderbilt should sue his editor. Mr. Vanderbilt obviously has voluminous knowledge on this subject but this is an endless ramble of facts, studies, insights and observations that not once; really, not one single time; is boiled up to a conclusion, an important trend or even a clear summary.Believe me; I was eager to read this book. I drive ALL THE TIME and am very interested in why and how we perceive things on the road and what motivates me to make the good - and often the extremely embarrassing - judgments I make. But this was a ramble, a directionless stroll through everything there is to know which, unfortunately, leads the reader nowhere.For a comparison, take a reading of ""The Flamingo's Smile,"" by Stephen Jay Gould, where you wade through very detailed scientific explanations and descriptions of biological phenomena. This stuff inundated me with details on subjects about which I knew very few generalities. But, it was great reading (and great writing). All along the way, Professor Gould tells you why what you are reading is important and how it all ties together at a higher level.No, not everyone is a writer of the caliber of Mr. Gould but Mr. Vanderbilt doesn't even come close - and doesn't seem to try. He just goes on and on, slipping from one potentially interesting topic to another, from one isolated study to another.I couldn't take it. I got off the first exit and headed to a more rewarding reading experience."
13,0307264785,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1159787-valerie,4,This book sparked many interesting math thoughts. And I really do love interesting math thoughts that make me want to break out a pencil and the back of an envelope.
14,0307264785,http://goodreads.com/user/show/501971-jeff,4,"This is the perfect example of 4.5 stars for me. I don't want to say it was AMAZING but it was significantly better than ""really liked it."" The writing's not especially wonderful, but the information is great. It's my kind of topic. It's delivered in a non-preachy tone though the author's ""bias"" is apparent at times. It's not trying to be too clever (as i usually feel when reading Oliver Sacks or David Sedaris) nor is it afraid of being interesting (as seems to be the case with most Important Biographies i've tried to read).Not many people THINK deeply about traffic. We have strong feelings about it and it can ruin our day, but considering it in the abstract or viewing it as an index of culture (as telling as one's language or religion) probably doesn't even occur to most of us as something worth trying. This book covers the topic incredibly thoroughly. Sometimes redundant, but i suspect that's because the author wasn't so arrogant as to expect every reader to start on p.1 and plow through to the last page of the index without stopping.The first chapter or two had me thinking it should be mandatory reading for student drivers. The majority of the book, though, is really about sociology and psychology, so it's not worthwhile to students. The final chapters and the epilogue return to appropriate topics. Of course, i don't expect many young teens would dig this stuff much: non-fiction books ain't typical American Cool.This should make it onto the syllabi of undergrad courses across the country. I hope the students appreciate it. And i really hope the blurb in Entertainment Weekly about it helps get a few thousand more people to read the damned thing (rather than just buying it, a la Oprah's magic).Extensive notes (i didn't read them; normally would, but it's a 14-day loaner from the lieberry) in the backmatter are probably very useful and informative. I didn't need the index, but i love me a non-fiction book with a good index: indispensable for somebody who needs to study it.Finally, i'd like to thank the smarties at Powell's Bookstore in Portland, OR, for their excellent newsletter and its oft-terrific recommendations. I have not given them credit before now, but they consistently have good ideas for what to read next."
15,0307264785,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1806073-alicia,3,"It's a behemoth all right. There is so much going on in the book that Vanderbilt builds skillfully but it is a lot to take in, especially if one is sitting on the couch drinking tea on a very cold day for the entire day. My eyes went a little sideways every now and then with the amount of data he pulls in, scientific studies, comparisons and visits to other countries, and just plain explaining traffic. Yes-- ""traffic was as much an emotional problem as it was a physical and mechanical one"".And I can see myself in ""yet still we get visibly mad, to an audience of no one. Katz argues that we are engaging in a kind of theatrical storytelling, inside of our cars, angrily 'constructing moral dramas' in which we are the wronged victims- and the 'avenging hero'- in some traffic epic of larger importance."" He uses explanations about traffic and the increase for it ultimately being more women in the workforce. And how building more roads just makes them busier. He shares a hatred for parking lots and how a roundabout is a fabulous transportation invention but does not work in the gridded-out metropolitan areas. He dives in to moving objects and our brain. How many decisions are made per minute while driving. And he doesn't even really get in to cell phones because they were just starting to become fashionable appendages when he published the book in 2008 though he does reference iPods/music playing in cars. He talks about the increases in deaths and attributions. He talks about types of cars and engineering. There is literally no stone unturned in this tome because ""traffic is like a language. It generally works best if everyone knows and obeys the rules of grammar though slang can be brutally effective."" Stirling Moss (racer) is quoted as saying ""there are two things no man will admit he cannot do well: drive and make love."""
16,0307264785,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6117832-mirkat,3,"You are not stuck in traffic. You are traffic.Most drivers are not nearly as proficient as they think they are. Many drivers, based on their inflated sense of their own skills, think they can drive just as well, even if they divide their attention between their driving and their phones. But they are (at times catastrophically) wrong.Measures designed to make driving safer can actually make it more dangerous, since they facilitate faster driving and less attention to surroundings.Individual drivers make choices based on their own self-interest, but those choices are often detrimental to the entire driving system, with the cumulative effect of slowing down traffic flow.I found this book, overall, interesting and informative. Certain facts were downright counter-intuitive. At times, I felt I was being bogged down somewhat with the density of some of the data, but I think it's a worthwhile read/listen.Still skeptical that roundabouts are safer for pedestrians. My own personal example is a roundabout at an intersection that is part of one of my favorite running routes. Several years back, the roundabout replaced traffic lights. In my experience, the traffic lights provided a clarity that has been removed. The road that I have to cross now has a crosswalk meant to stop westbound drivers entering the roundabout and another for eastbound drivers who have just exited it. There is signage indicating that drivers must stop to allow pedestrians to cross. I can't even tell you how often drivers roll right through, apparently not even considering the possibility of stopping for lowly on-foot travelers. Usually, my only hope of crossing is if no drivers are close enough to be a problem."
17,0307264785,http://goodreads.com/user/show/970632-mitchell,5,A fascinating and hopefully useful look at driving and parking and roads. Now to get all the other drivers in the world to read this. Certainly will add to my continuing to teach my youngest to drive - I wish I had read it before I taught my oldest. Lots to think about. Definitely worth owning a copy.
18,0307264785,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3972816-tammy,4,Interesting thoughts about how we drive. Now I don't feel guilty merging at the last minute!
19,0307264785,http://goodreads.com/user/show/63362342-robyn,4,"Please take this 4 star rating with a grain of salt! Glad to have found this book for 2 bucks at the Saskatoon Symphony book sale or it would likely have never crossed my radar.I hate driving. I hate cars. I own a car and I drive it, but I consider it not much more than a necessary evil in order to conduct my life in the place I choose to live (but oh, how I fantasize about living in a city where cars aren't the primary form of transportation). I walk/bike/bus when I can to avoid driving, because I find it mentally draining and am aware of how unsafe cars and driving are. This realization that I hated driving was one thing that led me into an interest in active transportation and more generally, urban design for livability, and the info in Traffic fit in nicely with what I've been learning so far. This book is over a decade old so I was a bit worried that it might be out of date. I read the chapter about how hard it is to design self-driving cars because of the human factors involved, wondered if technology had solved the problems since, and literally the next day saw a headline about a self-driving car killing a pedestrian for exactly the reasons described in the book. This happened again after reading the chapter on whether realtime congestion data will be able to solve congestion; the next day (again! It was getting spooky at this point) I saw an article on CityLab about how realtime congestion data is actually making things worse. So, this book has not aged poorly by any stretch; if anything it shows us that it is very, very difficult to separate out the human side of traffic. As a human factors nerd and armchair urbanist I find this all VERY VERY INTERESTING! Also, confirmed that I am right to feel the way about driving that I do - driving is absolutely dangerous, and absolutely a major mental strain. (If you think it's not, maybe you need to read at least a couple chapters of this book.) So I am giving this book 4 stars because this topic is my jam and I learned a lot. That said, unless this topic is also your jam, you probably will feel differently. I did not find the writing especially entertaining, and absolutely loathed the citation style, which was essentially a repetition of the phrase ""studies have shown"" over and over and having to flip to the back of the book to find the reference. What is it with pop sci books not using footnotes? I find this citation style endlessly frustrating. Some chapters were more interesting than others in terms of the writing, I thought. Overall most chapters were about 25 pages which is a doable length for an evening (I couldn't imagine reading more than a chapter a day since the information was so dense), but a couple were slightly longer. I wasn't ""excited"" to pick up this book and read it; it borderline felt like a chore but at the same time I knew it was information I wanted to know. Does that even make sense?I'm very glad to have read this book. It was very well-researched, but not quite as well-written, and thus I can't recommend it to just anyone. If you are very interested in the topics it covers you will probably enjoy it, but if you only feel a passing interest, I would maybe just recommend reading some longer-form reviews of this book to get the general summary."

21,0307264785,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2467151-elizabeth-k,5,"Holy cow, this book was awesome. Pop science in which the author puts together a lot of studies about how driving actually works (like the physics and technology of how cars move) and ways this gets translated by people driving cars. It was the kind of book where every single paragraph contained at least one amazing fact. Like so amazing that everyone I know is really lucky that I wasn't calling you at 2 AM on a Wednesday to tell you that up to 20% of the earth's surface can be covered in insect swarms in a given moment. TWENTY PERCENT, PEOPLE. If you're wondering how that relates to traffic, apparently it came up in a conversation he was having with someone who was comparing information about insect swarming behaviors to traffic congestion models. I should point out that most of the amazing facts were more directly about driving, but the fact that the author was compelled to wedge this one in there makes me feel like he's a kindred spirit. This is also the kind of book that makes me wish I had a better guidance counselor in high school, in terms of career planning. Or I don't know, maybe the guidance counselor wouldn't even have had a chance, given that a basic description of how engineers can use systems analysis to make recommendations about public policy sounds like a terrible job. It sounds like the most boring thing ever, until you get to the actual examples of engineers and other scientists playing around with traffic flow and then it sounds like the best job ever. Of course this was a winner with me right out of the gate, because the very first section is an explanation of why the zipper merge is more efficient for everyone than the early merge. THE ZIPPER. Be still my heart."
22,0307264785,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1314125-roger-pharr,5,"I've complained in the past about how some full length books could have been accomplished in a single chapter. Some have one big idea that's introduced in the first chapter and then nothing. This is a great example of a book that used every page well. There was so much content that I had to stop reading at every chapter or section of the chapter to process what I had read.But I may be a little biased toward liking anything about driving. I've always been a fan of the complexity in the subject, maybe because of my years as an industrial engineer grappling with other types of queueing problems. So this book may have been a ringer for me.Also I was struck at how difficult it must be to write a book that is well done in the way that he does it well. Each page is filled with three or four sources organized together to make a conclusion that may not have been obvious but now suddenly is. To gather and organize that much information and then write the words that are at once plain and complicated takes work of a magnitude that I can't fathom.I liked it, did I say that?"
23,0307264785,http://goodreads.com/user/show/121530-gwen,4,"I actually listened to the audiobook in the car, which made ""reading"" this quite ironic. Half of the time, I was in the process of doing exactly what the author was talking about. Overall, I found this book pretty fascinating -- the statistics and logic surrounding safety and danger in the car and on the road seemed so backward (like how freeways and open roadways that appear safe are actually more dangerous than busy city streets with lots of action) -- until they were explained. One of the most interesting parts for me was that there are more pedestrians in NYC, but the streets are still designed for the driver. The last chapter summarized a lot of everything else in the book, and started to get kindof dull -- since it didn't pack the same punch without all the stats and dramatic information."

Amazing stuff. Basically, unless you're a brain surgeon, driving is the most mentally complex thing you will ever do. And of course most of the issues that make traffic so insane are psychological. We're just not designed to go that fast. Also, lots of little nuggets of wisdom to save for future conversations. I hope our governor and state/local transportation folks read this book!"

There weren’t as many concepts or statistics that blew my mind as I’d expected. There were a handful of really interesting tidbits, and it helped to have a reminder of the fundamentals of traffic that we never think about, but it really dragged for me. I didn’t look forward to listening to it. This continues my several month stretch of finding it hard to get all the way through books. 😏"

The author isn't very curious/knowledgable, and ignores a lot of the traffic adjacent topics. I can't imagine that there's any audience that I would recommend this book to."
28,0307264785,http://goodreads.com/user/show/241691-kay,4,"The insights in this book have much broader societal implications than how we behave on the road -- or perhaps how we behave on the road merely reflects our species' failings?""We have met the enemy and he is us,"" Walt Kelly once famously penned, but on the road, it seems we fancy ourselves much better drivers than all those people we wish would go away -- the tailgaters or those who leave too much space between cars; the lane-changers or those who stubbornly sit in one lane; those who merge too late or too early; drivers who are going too fast or too slow; and particularly all those S.O.B.S who drive (insert favorite hated type of car here). Yet, as Tom Vanderbilt notes, but we are contributors to whatever traffic jam we're stuck in and by default fall into someone else's notion of a bad driver. We are the enemy. Vanderbilt begins his straightforward yet complex book with an analysis of traffic jams and their contributing factors, but he soon ranges much further afield, citing studies from a wide range of disciplines. I found much information in this book surprising, not the least of which was learning that the road and car safety features that we rely so heavily upon -- lines on the road, signage, anti-lock brakes, seat belts, driving bigger cars -- can be contributing factors to a false sense of security. I was intrigued to learn that removing road signs could actually lead to fewer collisions in many places. Other things I was surprised to learn were that drivers tend to pass closer to cyclists wearing helmets than those who are not (perhaps assuming the helmet-wearing cyclists are more ""serious"" and will not veer in front of them), that cars rather than trucks are the cause of most truck-car collisions, that a surprising amount of the traffic on city streets consists of people looking for parking, and that suburbs can be riskier places to drive than cities. Much of this has to do with the way we seem to be hard-wired, while some has to do with social conditioning. In one of the chapters that most intrigued me, Vanderbilt analyzes traffic in other parts of the world such as China and India (two places I have been a passenger but not a driver, thankfully) as well as the much safer Scandinavian countries. I've driven in places that felt completely chaotic (Croatia springs to mind) and counted myself lucky to emerge unscathed, and also driven in places that are supposedly difficult to drive such as Italy, the U.K. and other ""wrong side of the road"" countries, Mexico, and the German autobahn. In these cases, I realize, my perception of being in danger kept me in a continual state of high alert and was probably the main reason I emerged unscathed. One important dictum I took away from this book is that drivers are in more peril when they assume they're safe than when they are on the alert for danger. It is, ultimately, our own inattentiveness that is the greatest threat to our safety on the road. Toward the end of the book, Vanderbilt mentions that after September 11, 2001, there was a marked increase in traffic fatalities. The obvious reason, of course, was that those too skittish to fly were driving instead, and so put themselves at greater risk. This was the springboard for Vanderbilt's trenchant analysis of real vs. perceived risk, which I found quite illuminating. Why do we, as a society, tolerate the great number of traffic deaths per year (approximately 40,000) yet remain on constant alert for terrorists, who, all told, have caused some 5,000 deaths 
since 1960
 in the U.S.? A lot of the reasons we don't recoil in horror at these grim traffic statistics, it seems, have to do with our ideas of what is acceptable: it is more acceptable to die doing something with a perceived benefit (getting where we want to go) and under our own autonomy (e.g. we are the drivers, not someone else) than to have little or no autonomy or perceived benefit. When we are in ""control,"" it seems, we feel that it's not such a bad thing if, for example, we have a beer or two before getting behind the wheel or talk on our cell phones or text while driving, which, studies have shown, put us at much greater risk. We might even feel quite indignant when we see other drivers holding cellphones to their ears or coming out of a bar and getting into a car. And it is speed, above all factors, that kills, yet we stubbornly resist lowering speed limits and regard it as our god-given right to proceed at a ""fair"" speed: e.g. ten miles over the posted limit. Thus Vanderbilt leaves us with the undeniable conclusion that regardless of how sophisticated our machines become or how deftly we engineer our roads, it is ultimately our own psychological limitations that bedevil and endanger us. We have met the enemy. He is us. A note on the reader, Marc Cashman: Mr. Cashman was, I thought, the ideal reader for this book. I'm a picky listener but not a single feature of his voice, phrasing, timing, or emphasis bothered me; on the contrary, I felt he greatly added to my enjoyment and understanding of the book. I'll be seeking out other books read by him. "

30,0307264785,http://goodreads.com/user/show/877389-james,5,"I hope, at the very least, that this book makes me slow down a little when I drive. Traffic is the second excellent book I've read in the last year by Tom Vanderbilt, and like You May Also Like, it comprises a trove of potentially dry science rendered vividly and persuasively for the lay reader. I marked this book to read years ago, when I was still making a 600-mile round trip every other week to visit the woman who became my wife, and I think, if I'd gotten to it then, I would have spent fewer rage-filled Sunday afternoons on I-95 in Virginia, fuming at the traffic engineers who, as it turns out, were less responsible for my predicament than I presumed. Who's to blame? Traffic congestion is a complex problem to be certain, one that a lot of people have thought a lot about, but the answer may lie in a German billboard that Vanderbilt quotes several times. Do you feel like you're stuck IN the traffic jam? the billboard asked drivers. Look at from the other guy's point of view and you'll see that you ARE the traffic jam. Bottom line? Too many drivers, and it's only going to get worse. Building new roads attracts new traffic, in most cases almost instantaneously offsetting the dearly-bought increase in capacity.Traffic is about more than congestion, though. Vanderbilt examines the psychology and engineering of many aspects of our complicated relationship with the automobile. One apparently intractable difficulty in that fraught connection is the seeming impossibility of making driving safer. The technology, of course, is always improving. The interior of a passenger car today is like a padded room if compared with the car interiors of my own youth, which were all stylish sharp angles and shiny, durable surfaces - massive head injuries waiting to happen, in other words. Despite the accretion of shoulder belts and airbags and rounded, cushioned dashboards and side panels, the anti-lock braking systems and expanded crumple-zones though, the rate of injury and death stays fairly constant. As Vanderbilt relates it, the science indicates that safer vehicles and roadways only seem to encourage riskier human behavior. To give just one of Vanderbilt's numerous examples of this technological/behavioral paradox, more pedestrians are killed or injured crossing at crosswalks than in the middle of the block. This is partly because more pedestrians cross at crosswalks - skewing the sample - but the greater danger of crosswalks remains true even after you adjust the numbers. The reason for this is most likely, Vanderbilt posits, because the jaywalkers are being more careful. His theory is supported by the fact that more pedestrians are killed or injured in marked crosswalks than unmarked. Similarly, when drivers are insulated from risk, they engage in increasingly questionable behavior. Vanderbilt titles an entire chapter ""When Dangerous Roads Are Safer."" To return to the wish hope which I began this review, excessive speed, even more than drugs and alcohol or distracted driving, is the risky driver behavior responsible for more damage and suffering than any other. As speed increases arithmetically, the associated risks increase geometrically. Slight reductions in speed, hardly noticeable to the driver, can result in dramatic mitigation of harm.I can't really recommend Traffic enough. The research is thoroughgoing, the analysis is thoughtful, the prose is lucid (for which I was rather pathetically grateful after spending weeks finishing an impenetrably vague and pretentiously middlebrow novel) and the subject, I would imagine, is of compelling interest to just about anyone who's ever driven (or ridden in, for that matter) a car."

Every chapter is filled with interesting facts and things to think about. Much of what you would think would be common sense simply isn't true. And many of the things we do to make roads safer, such as widen them, actually make them less safe. One of my favorite lines in the book is a little throwaway line about a sign the author saw in Britain: Changing Priorities Ahead. What the heck does that mean? The author also talks a bit about different driving cultures in different countries. One person posits that the more authoritarian the government, the worse the drivers are because it is one of the few ways they can express rebellion. Scarily, I was listening to the last part of the book, about traffic accidents, when I was on a long drive on the Massachusetts Turnpike The author states that more people die in traffic accidents every day than died on 9/11. Yet we are willing to give up many of our civil liberties to combat terrorism, but we won't accept inconveniences, such as lower speed limits or banning cell phone use in cars, that will reduce accidents. As the book says, ""Risk analysis isn't rocket science. It's harder!"""
33,0307264785,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4811396-kay,5,"I first thought the author, Tom Vanderbilt, was stuck in everyday traffic and bored. He then began to write this book to pass the time away. He probably used a tape recorder, so he could continue to drive at 5 mph. As I read further, I realized how much research he did for the book. The ultimate conclusion I walked away with, after completing this book, is that there is little we can do to improve the safety of the roads. We make roads safer by widening the lanes, removing hazards and straightening the roads; and the people drive faster. This would increase the number of deaths on the improved road. The road improvement might lower the number of accidents, but make the accidents more hazardous by the increased speed. There seems nothing can be done about the driver, who drives when he is too tired, or intoxicated. Reading this book has made me more aware of the hazards we ignore while driving. I hope this book has improved my driving ability."

It is written almost like an academic journal at times, with a huge emphasis on research over opinion. It is dry, disengaging and lacks humour. There are over one hundred pages of acknowledgements and citations, demonstrating this is basically a list of research studies linked in some way to driving. I was bombarded with a series of stats and facts, but I doubt I will remember a single one in a few days' time because they are delivered in such a flat way with little narrative to tie them together. The whole book is basically: ""We have all been in the situation when something dangerous happens on a road. One study revealed this thing happens more when we get distracted, and this occurs because we are human, or it might be because you are a man, inexperienced, or young and stupid."""

It’s not all serious; there are a lot of things we unconscious do on the road that are quite ridiculous, and the author had me laughing hysterically at times as I saw my silly self in the rear view mirror. But I will also drive away from this book a safer, more aware operator of motor vehicles. Interestingly, the author uses some behavioral economics concepts, which serves as a very useful analytical tool, adding explanatory power and state-of-the-art intelligence to this treatise.

39,0307264785,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2914150-keely,4,"In Traffic, Tom Vanderbilt explores how our driving reflects who we are and where we're heading as a society. He takes an extensive look at driving issues, from the wisdom of late merging, to divergence in parking strategies, to the ways safer roads and vehicles sometimes lull us into more dangerous driving behaviors. His analysis also includes consideration of the intractable problem of traffic congestion and why there are no easy or cost-effective solutions. He only hints at the massive environmental impact of all our driving, yet it still comes through--for instance when he laments that Wal-Marts maintain parking lots that can accommodate Black Friday traffic...then sit half empty for the remainder of the year. Vanderbilt also gives a nod to the city of Copenhagen and the stealthy way it phased automobile traffic out of the central city over a number of years.This book was published in 2008, when things like self-driving cars were barely more than sci-fi, and electric and hybrid vehicles were fairly new, too. So, in 2019, it's already a bit dated. However, its analysis is still fascinating. I'd never thought before about how perfectly all our human foibles show up in our driving, but it's true. And it's not particularly encouraging. Good book, but yikes."

I really did enjoy reading about the experimentally-proven efficiency of zipper merges and roundabouts. (Obviously, I'm a nerd.) And I liked the author's discussion of how political systems and traffic law obedience are correlated. For example, in countries where the government is corrupt and unreliable (think Russia or Italy), the drivers flaunt traffic laws and the roads are more likely to be chaotic. In contrast, in countries where the rule of law is held in high regard (think Japan or the US), drivers follow traffic rules, even if the rules aren't strictly required for immediate safety. We all (Americans) stop at red lights on deserted streets in the middle of the night, don't we?This book had several good nuggets like these, but the writing style was awkward and it was a bit of a slog to push through to the end."

While I found it interesting enough to read, it failed to flesh out what I was looking for, information on the psychology of drivers. In other words, why do some people obnoxiously deep the second lights turn green, why do some have road rage while others don’t? The book picks up and is most interesting in its final chapter wherein the author looksj at things such as why safety improvements in cars can actually make us less safe. In sum, this is more a book on the mechanics of driving and the the engineering of roads than a look at what lies behind the behaviors of drivers.

Some of the ideas:-	Much of the problem with road design is not the concrete or the cars – it is the people-	Merging – Late merger is more effective for throughput. Use both lanes and then zipper merge. Helps the whole system and you individually. Even if it seems unfair.-	Differential speed limits – i.e. h trucks are given a lower speed – do not work – the variation in speed causes more accidents-	“We spend more on driving than on food or health care”-	For the Oscar awards show, LA uses all the systems (cameras, manual traffic light control) to manage traffic flow to help the Limousines in/out of town.-	Queuing in traffic seems longer because there is little information about how long you will be there (i.e. the cause and where).-	Lane changing in a traffic jam – There are two lanes that always move in different rates. When you are stopped, you notice the other lane moving (causing envy) faster as you are stopped. When your lane moves, you don’t notice the effect as much because 1. You are moving faster so do not notice the number of cars you are passing in the other lane 2. You are driving and not paying attention to the other lane like when you having nothing to do when you are stopped.-	And 10% of accidents are due to lane changes-	Work zones – “slow down my daddy works here” – really the danger is not to the construction worker, but to yourself. But thinking of an individual worker with a family makes people think about the danger to an “individual” that they do not think about for themselves. -	There is a flaw to human perception of risk – Where we have some control on the risk – like driving – we underestimate the risk. Whereas, uncontrollable risk – terrorism – gets much higher attention. -	Are you a bad driver? Accidents are rare, so little feedback. There is no “near miss” tracking like a industrial safety program, but the same theories apply – 300 near misses is equivalent to one minor accident, and 29 minor accidents happen for every major fatality. -	DriveCam – camera system installed in the rearview mirror – one forward on the road and one on the driver – great for teenagers. Immediate feedback on their driving.-	The safer cars and roads are designed, the risker the human behavior. This is why safety improvements almost never reach the expected outcome.-	Traffic signs – most people have no memory of them – you read them quickly and if not relevant – immediately forget. Some -	Most people are looking for other cars because that is what they are in – this is why motorcycles get hit – SMIDSY – “Sorry, Mate, I Didn’t See You” is common in England and the bumper stickers – “see motorcycles” and loud pipes save lives. Even Emergency vehicles with their lights on are hit because it is a rare event and people just don’t see them.-	Roundabouts – Work better than traffic lights – from a system perspective – more throughput at all levels of congestion and safety. But America’s perceive them as slower because we judge based on a Green light traffic signal where we do not slow at all half the time versus having to slow down every time -	Urban Planning – Most people want to commute? As our means of travel increases speed (walking, horse) we are still roughly 30 minutes to our place of work. But now with interstate highways, Cities that were 5 miles in diameter are now 20-30 miles. Interesting point, not sure I agree.-	Why more traffic? Women. Women entering the workforce and commuting and taking the kids to/from organized sports (instead of kids walking/biking or just playing in their own neighborhood). -	Another point on women – women get in more accidents than men- Ha! But their accidents are far less likely to be deadly. Men drive more often drunk and without seatbelts. -	-	Congestion taxes – London city center tax has been very successful in cutting traffic. Copenhagen just quietly pulled parking spots to have the same effect. Donald Shoup- The high cost of free parking – raise cost of parking to the point of 85% utilization and then no circling for parking. -	Latent Demand – If you build it, they will come. More roads gets more people driving. LA has a ton of experience. They have closed major highways and told people to stay home. They do. But as soon as people find out it is not as bad, they start driving. -	Unsafest day for driving – Super Bowl Sundy. 20x beer consumed. "

46,0307264785,http://goodreads.com/user/show/23802045-vinit-nayak,4,"4.6 starsThis book was far more fun to read than I thought it would be. Picked it up on a whim because it was cheap at a book faire. Some highlights below:There’s an entire first section about how humans have not evolved and therefore aren’t equipped to deal w/ driving, like many other modern advances of civilization. We weren’t built to move at the speeds we do. After around 20mph, we stop being able to accurately discern and distinguish objects. There’re interesting statistics in how absolutely garbage we are at judging distance and speed of objects, and we are more inaccurate the larger the object is, even with marked guidelines to provide relative positioning. We are used to communicating face to face, we need eye contact. Driving gives none of that, very little communication besides blinkers, which no one is forced to use. Your car becomes a symbol of your identity and every time you’re cut off it’s like someone just walked right where you were about to walk except you have no way to empathize with the person since all you see is a boxy piece of steel.30 minute is the limit for commutes before we start getting cranky. (Though a handful of people in the Bay Area think it's around an hour and 30 minutes, based one the 1 person I asked). In 30 min, we can cover about ~5K, which is the distance of and between most ancient greek and roman towns. 30 min was just enough to walk into the center of town from the edge of town where you lived. Back in the cave days, we’d have to balance the time we’d spend inside in the safety of our homes (caves) and outside (in search of food/mates/other delicious things). When technology began advancing and faster means of transportation developed (horse, carriage), cities grew to maintain the distance from home to “resources” at a consistent 30 minutes.The way roads are constructed are terrible. They provide us with a false sense of security and remove the dangers from us realizing we’re traveling as fast as we actually are.The way to help control traffic is to provide the right context and use social communication instead of only setting up rules and laws. If a driver sees there are more people on the street, they will slow down and be forced to be more alert.NYC, despite its high density of pedestrians has fewer traffic fatalitiesNote that it has more traffic “conflicts” with people, but the book focused specifically on fatal accidentsRoads that are more dangerous - fewer road signs, tight corners, not paved - have fewer fatalities than roads perceived as more safeRural roads are the worstCorruption and traffic are linked, if people don’t believe that the government is effective then they will disregard any laws (especially easy to break laws such as traffic). The people meant to enforce traffic laws will also be corrupt and not actually cite people for breaking the law, this feeding the feedback loop for the driver.In Finland (which is ranked by some international committee as one of the least corrupt governments), the fines of the traffic violations are based on income tax. One rich dude once had to pay ~$70K for going 34 in a 25mph zone.In Mexico (2007), all male traffic cops were replaced with women as it’s shown that they are less corrupt. Interestingly enough, the countries that are deemed to have less corrupt governments (as determined by that same committee) have more women holding office at higher levels of governmentThere is also a slight correlation between traffic fatalities and GDPAs safety features on cars increase, they never reach the numbers they suspect they will reach in how many more lives saved. Ultimately, despite all the safety features we put on cars, humans will increase their risk factor to counter those measures. We have an appetite for risk, or perhaps it’s a cultural issue of always wanting to get some place faster or multitask when we think it’s “safe enough” to do so. Whatever it is, it’s hard to quantify because it starts bleeding into human nature and it’s hard to enforce any real safety measures around that. The best way to avoid traffic fatalities: remove the driver.Waymo lessgoooo!!!"

Add to that correlations with hundreds of things you'd never stop to think had a relationship at all - a country's GDP, a country's corruption rating, etc. I learned more information in this single read than I have learned from a book in a long while.I love Vanderbilt's writing style - lots of snark and lots of irony. He reminds me a lot of Simon Garfield - lots of information, but it feels fun to read. I laughed aloud in several places:""Americans seem similarly (and particularly) predisposed to putting cheap bumper stickers on their expensive cars - announcing the academic wizardry of their progeny, jocularly advising that their ""other car is a Porsche,"" or giving subtle hints (""MV"") of their exclusive vacation haunts. One never sees a German blazing down the Autobahn with a PROUD TO BE GERMAN sticker."" Hahahahahahahha""Mexico City's speed bumps may be the largest in the world, and in their sheer size they are bluntly effective at curbing the worst impulses of chilango (as the capital's residents are known) motorists. Woe to the driver who hits one at anything but the most glacial creep. Older cars have been known to stall out at a bump's crest and be turned into a roadside food stand.""Awesome. What's not to love?There were some particularly interesting bits of information too:Psychologists who examined a survey called the Narcissistic Personality Inventory, which as for the past few decades gauged narcissistic indicators in society (measuring reactions to statements like ""If I ruled the world, it would be a better place""), found that in 2006, two-thirds of survey respondents scored higher than in 1982. More people than ever, it seems have a ""positive and inflated view of the self."" And over that same period that narcissism was growing, the road, if surveys can be believed, was becoming a less pleasant environment. Traffic, a system that requires conformity and cooperation to function best, was filling with people sharing a common thought: ""If I ruled the road, it would be a better place.""Sounds like Paul was right on the money when he described our day to Timothy: ""Men shall be lovers of their own selves...boasters, proud, etc.""Vanderbilt's concluding paragraph does a fabulous job of summing up the gist:On the road, we make our judgments about what's risky and what's safe using our own imperfect human calculus. We think large trucks are dangerous but then we drive unsafely around them. We think roundabouts are more dangerous than intersections, although they're more safe. We think the sidewalk is a safer place to ride a bike, even though it's not. We worry about getting into a crash on ""dangerous"" holiday weekends but stop worrying during the week. We do not let children walk to school even though driving in a car presents a greater hazard. We use hands-free cell phones to avoid risky dialing and then spend more time on risky calls (among other things). We carefully stop at red lights when there are no other cars, but exceed the speed limit during the rest of trips. We buy SUVs because we think they're safe and then drive them in more dangerous ways. We drive at a minuscule following distance to the car ahead, exceeding our ability to avoid a crash, with a blind faith that the driver ahead will never have a reason to suddenly stop. We have gotten to the point where cars are safer than ever, yet traffic fatalities cling to stubbornly high levels. We know all this, and act as if we don't.Other than the misplaced and/or missing commas and the ""more safe,"" I thought this a brilliant paragraph."

As in 1960s when car deaths were topping 50k a year.If the # of deaths on the road were held to the acceptable-risk standards that the US Occupational Health Standard Administration maintains for service-industry fatalities, it has been estimated, there would be just under 4,000 deaths a year; instead, the # is 11 times that.On average not like clockwork every 15 minutes someones dies in an alcohol related crash & every 13 minutes, someone dies in a fatal car crash.Massive # of fatalities on the weekend mornings with so few people on the roads, & so many-estimates are as high as 25% have been drinking.Legally drunk drivers between the hours of 8pm & 5am are 13 times more likely than sober drivers to cause a fatal crash & those with legally acceptable amounts of alcohol are 7 times more likely.Of the 11,000 drunk-driver fatalities in the period they studied, the majority-8,000-were the drivers & passengers, while 3,000 were other drivers (the vast majority of whom were sober). Levitt & Porter argue that the appropriate fine for drunk driving in the US, tallying up the externalities that it causes, should be about $8,000.For every 100 million miles driven in vehicles in the US, there are 1.3 deaths. If you drive an average of 15,500 miles per year, as many Americans do, there is roughly 1 in 100 chance you'll die in a fatal crash over a lifetime of 50 years driving.The number of fatal crashes involving large trucks in the United States increased by 42% between 2009 & 2017.The caricature that we have that the highways are thronged with fatigued, drug-addled truck drivers is just wrong. Certainly there are aggressive truck drivers & truckers jacked up on methamphetamine, but the more pressing problem, evidence tells us, seems to be that car drivers do not fully understand the risk of heavy trucks as they drive in their presence.""The truck driver is the only one that survives these 85% of the time,"" Daniel Blower explained. ""He's the only one who gets to tell the story. That's what's reflected in the police report."" Blower found that in 70% of the cases, the driver of the car had the sole contributing responsibility in the crash.This is not something we are necessarily taught when we learn to drive. ""In a light vehicle you are correct to be afraid of them, but it's not because the drivers are disproportionately aggressive or bad drivers,"" Blower said. ""It's because of physics, truck design, the different performance characteristics. You can make a mistake around a Geo Metro & live to tell about it. You make the same mistake around a truck & you could easily be dead.The places that rank the least corrupt-are the safest to drive. Finland, Norway, New Zealand, Sweden, & Singapore.Sweden passed :Vision Zero"" even after it had the world's lowest traffic death rate.Finland, which has one of the lowest crash rates, drivers are given fines based on complicated calculus primarily involving their after tax income. The law intended to counter the regressive nature of speeding tickets. (they take a larger part of a poor person's income than a rich person's), has led to some very high-profile speeding tickets, such as Internet entrepreneur Jaakko Rytsola's $71,400 tab for going 43 mph in a 25 mph zone.New Zealand, which is 1 of the 5 least corrupt countries in the world, is below countries like Austria & Spain in GDP but has safer roads, as measured by fatalities per 10,000 vehicles. Russia, on the other hand, is ranked as more corrupt than other countries at similar development levels, & its roads reflect that fact; Moscow is filled with notoriously corrupt traffic cops & cars blazing through traffic jams with ersatz blue sirens. Russia itself reportedly accounts for 2/3rds of Europe's road fatalities.Miles driven usually increase in stronger economic times. ""Bad"" traffic can be seen as just an outcome of that success. But corruption itself can cause traffic problems, the sort that represent a drain on economic growth, not an outcome. Take, for example, the myriad roadblocks that are a daily fact of life in many developing countries. The process has little to do with vehicle inspection safety & a lot to do with police or soldiers trying to extract something ""for the boys."" Corruption does not speed a driver's way through some bureaucratic tangle: rather, the tangle is formed because of the corruption.A study of the bribes that Indonesian truckers had to pay the military checkpoints showed that the closer the truckers got to their destination, the higher the bribe. (The officials also charged more for newer trucks & trucks carrying valuable cargo.) When the # of checkpoints dropped after the military scaled back its forces, the average bribe checkpoint increased, leaving the researchers to conclude that fewer traffic officials may be better (although their absence may invite criminals to take their place).Economist Tom Harford observed after a visit to Cameroon, corruption in traffic is tremendously unfair & inefficient. Protracted ""inspections"" & bartering over small amounts slows the flow of goods & people. The $ goes into the pockets of underpaid officials, not to fixing roads or making them safer. Robert Guest, once accompanied the driver of a Guinness beer truck on a 300-mile journey in Cameroon. The trip, which might have taken 20 hours elsewhere, took 4 days. The reason was in part the crumbling roads, but also the 47 checkpoints at which they were forced to stop for dubious safety inspections & petty bribes. Guest's suggestion; ""Lift those road blocks & put police to work repairing potholes.""In Mexico City, the traffic czar, 2007 the last of the city's male traffic officers had been phased out, replaced entirely by women (known as cisnes, or ""swans""). Why? ""Because women are less likely to be corrupted,"" Mexico City traffic cops were famous for soliciting refrescos or ""soft drinks""-that is, bribes in lieu of a ticket. According to Garcia, the cisnes have increased the # of tickets written on the order of 300%-drivers can use credit cards they have been issued handheld units to issue tickets & ensure payment.Finland, ranked the least corrupt country in the world US 12th, set a record 2007 for having the gov. with the most women in cabinet-level positions.If you take an Israel driver & transplant him to Savannah, Georgia, I guarantee that within 2 months he will be driving like the people there, like everyone around him. & if you transplant someone from the US Midwest to Tel Aviv, within days he will be driving like an Israeli-because if he doesn't he'll get nowhere. & so, like a visitor to England who begins to appreciate lukewarm beer, astute drivers will echo local infractions like the ""Pittsburgh left,"" that act of driving practiced primarily in the Steel City (but also Beijing) in which the change of a traffic light to green is an ""unofficial"" signal for a left-turning driver to quickly bolt across the oncoming traffic. New arrivals in LA soon become versed in the ""California roll,"" aka the ""sushi stop,"" which involves never quite coming to a complete halt at a stop sign. Cows, in effect, act as the ""mental speed bumps"" they provide ""intrigue & uncertainly,"" the average Delhi driver would certainly rather be late for work than hit a cow. Delhi drivers have a chronic tendency to stray between lines, most alarmingly those flowing in the opposite direct. The only signal used with regularity is the horn.There are nearly 110 million traffic violations per day in Delhi. One reason the # of violations is so high is that many drivers are forced to violate the rules in reaction to another driver violating the rules. An estimated 100,000 people die each year-one out of 10 road deaths in the world.A Delhi taxi driver says he copes with Delhi traffic with good brakes, good horn, good luck.Delhi pack's five times the people into the same space as New York City & has 48 modes of transport compared to roughly 5 in New York cars, trucks, bicycles, pedestrians, and motorcycles or scooters.Hormones change over the course of a man's life over a woman's too. Testosterone levels in men rise until their mid-twenties, then go into a slow decline that accelerates after the age of 50. At the same time, cortisone levels drift upward. as they age, men may therefore become less and less susceptible to the testosterone feedback loops that I have argued can morph risk-taking into risky Behavior.Women, for their part, have very different biology's for men. They produce on average 10 to 20% of the amount of testosterone as men, and they have not been exposed to the same organizing effects prenatal androgens, so that you may be less prone to the winner effect than young men. Women's stress response also differs substantial commence. A woman will indeed experience fight or flight if faced by a grizzly bear, just as a man will; a woman's natural reaction to threat, at least within the social situations that are today are normal environment, is what she calls the ""tend and befriend"" reaction, an urge to affiliation. She reasons that if you have children to care for, tend and befriend makes more sense than launching into a fist fight or run away which is more Man-Thing.Older people's may suffer a more serious decline in the growth index because they may stop producing testosterone and growth hormone all together, while producing ever-increasing amounts of cortisol; as a result they come to suffer what is called a ""failure to thrive,"" there high cholesterol levels draining them of muscle in vitality. the simple ratio of testosterone to cortisol, easily accessed through either a saliva or blood sample, can serve as a sensitive measure of our immunity to daily stress in our state of preparedness for competition.When mourning levels of testosterone in male traders were higher than average, the traders went on to make an above-average profit later that day.In the future we might even be able to articulate the specific messages carried by our interoceptive pathways. Someday we will be able to listen to our bodies & the subconscious regions or our brains & heed their warnings.""Starbucks effect"" the prime demo is middle-aged men they were making stops in the mourning. [He wants] to get up & leave the house & go to Starbucks, where, by golly, there's somebody there who greets him by name, knows his favorite drink is. It's like his time to prepare for the office environment. I don't think the psychology of that has been explored very well.Starbucks will go so far as to open stores on opposing corners to captures different traffic flows & spare drivers the agony of the left turn during rush hour.Ben Hamilton-Baillie suggest that there is something crucial in the fact that above 20 mph, humans begin to lose eye contact.Movement known as Shared Space, Dutch mother on a bike, carrying a child, merges in front of a big truck with little more than the smallest flicker of eye contact & the slightest lift of the finger.The faster we drive, the less we see. He suggest that it is more than coincidental that as drivers get above 20 mph, we lose eye contact with pedestrians, while our chances of dying as pedestrians if hit by a car also begin to soar dramatically. As humans with a evolutionary history, we are presumably not meant to move faster than we can run, which tops out at around 20 mph which explains in the modern world being struck by a car becomes so much more exponentially deadly above that speed.The ""squareabout,"" the # of crashes, according to a preliminary study by the local technical college, has dropped. In 2005, there were none at all. Since the time of the conversion, the average time to cross the intersection has dropped bu 40%, even as traffic has increased. The time the bus had to wait to get through has been cut by as much a half. All traffic, the college found, seems to move at a constant rate, & even at peak hours, the movement is steady. if slow-& any traffic engineer will tell you how important it is for drivers to be able to sense progress.Driving is what psychologist call an ""overlearned"" activity. The more overlearned activity becomes, less cognitive workload it imposes. 2 little workload has its own problems. We get bored. We get tired. We lapse into highway hypnosis.The mere act of ""switching"" task-like moving from solely driving to talking on the phone while driving or, say, to change whom we're speaking to within the same cell phone call via call waiting-takes a toll on our mental workload.On ramps & off ramps have the most crashes but in terms of fatalities the highest # is single-vehicle run-off roads. You've got long stretches, a lot of nighttime driving, people falling asleep. Drivers should not drive more than a minute without having a bit of curve. 1980 engineers began to turn to roadside rumble strips on the Pennsylvania Turnpike, run-off-road crashes dropped 70% in the period studied. It is estimated that 1/5 or our viewing time is interrupted by blinks & what are known as saccades, or our eyes' rapid movements, during which we are, as one expert puts it, ""effectively blind.""Parking spaces outnumber drivers 3 to 1. Parking lots are not only the handmaidens of traffic congestion, they're temperature-boosting heat islands, as well as festering urban & suburban floodplains whose rapid storm-water runoff dumps motor oil & carcinogenic toxins like polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (from shiny black seal coat) into the surrounding environment & overwhelmed sewer systems. They represent a depletion of energy & a shocking inefficient use of land.The average American woman 20 years old and up weighs 170.6 pounds.

49,0307264785,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5547564-david,3,"3.5 stars.Pros: This book was fascinating. It's a comprehensive look at the study of traffic, what circumstances causes more accidents, what causes accidents to be more fatal, what precautions work and don't, how does that relate socially, and how does this work even off the road. Not all answers are intuitive, but make perfect sense when you hear the explanations.Cons: It's hard to say the book was too long because there wasn't a lot of repetition, but it sure seems a bit too long. I don't know what could have made it more concise short of maybe not talking about certain things that may have been more trivial. The other thing is that it's now 2019 as of this review and the book was published in 2008, which was a surprise to me; I don't think there is a statistic quoted past 2002. You'll hear about iPods and texting on Blackberries more than a few times. The general information is still quite good, but the specific information is dated at several points."
50,0307264785,http://goodreads.com/user/show/15371641-pixie-dust,3,"A quirky book, humorously written, with lots of anecdotes that drivers will identify with. The book was also filled with impressive research on the traffic situations in different countries, and how various rules implemented worked or did not. Reading the book, I arrived at the depressing conclusion that traffic jams will never – seriously, never – go away, no matter how many lane-widening projects the government undertakes, or new expressways are built. Every new lane/road will just encourage more drivers to get on the road. Drivers who may have opted to take public transport or travel at a different time, or forgo that extra shopping trip, now happily cruise down the extra lane/road, and after a short time, the jams will be back. Traffic warnings don’t work either. People might avoid a road that reportedly has a jam, and end up jamming the alternative route instead. People are also constantly adjusting their behaviour, e.g. drivers may decide to try Route 1 because Route 2 always jams. But then Route 1 jams because many drivers did the same, and so the next day, more drivers go back to Route 2 – jamming that route. On the third day, a number of drivers resort to Route 1 again. An equilibrium is never reached, and so a familiar route may one day be jammed and on another be cruise-happy, even if there has not been any ‘incident’ like a breakdown or an accident. There’s just no point in speculating. I’ve decided to stick to just one route from now on, and save my brain cells for making other more meaningful decisions. Quotable quotes:  “…the slow deadening of your psyche caused by the ritual of leaving home forty-five minutes sooner than you would like so you can arrive at work ten minutes later than your boss would like.” True, true. “ And yet, in spite of all this mental and physical anguish, there’s at least the small consolation awaiting you at the end of your daily slog: Your fellow commuters did not try to eat you.”  Apparently the Mormon cricket, caught in a traffic jam, would eat its neighbours. The fear of being eaten encouraged all to move faster, hence, no jam.   “Surely you have had the experience of listening in vain to a rapidly spoken traffic report, hoping against hope to get the details on the jam you’re sitting in (and by some law, you never can).” The ‘rapidly’ is right. Before I can figure out what direction and expressway exit the DJ meant, it’s gone with the wind. And yes, I almost never get the details I want. A DJ once showed me the panel on his screen displaying the traffic updates – there’re tons of them – impossible to announce them all, and so apparently the DJ himself chooses which ones to announce. I guess the one affecting me never gets chosen.“…a driver has a lower chance of being in a fatal crash if there’s a passenger… especially when the passenger is a woman and the driver is a man. (Whether this stems from men looking out for women or women telling men to drive more safely is open to debate.)” See? Women do make the world a better place."
51,0307264785,http://goodreads.com/user/show/88489-viola,3,"Let me start by saying that I find traffic quite interesting. I think of traffic as a social engineering problem that combines some elements of economics (you have self-interested individuals acting non-cooperatively) and some elements of mathematical physics (I know nothing about that). Given my casual interest on the topic, I was excited to read this book, but in the end, I was sorely disappointed.The book as a whole has no coherent theme, no overall message, no driving purpose. It is a collection of interesting facts and thoughts about traffic, but with no central theme to tie everything together. I think that the sub-chapters of the book would work well individually as short articles for a magazine, an online news site, or a blog. The sub-chapters do contain interesting tidbits of information and insight. Individually, they are not bad. Collectively, they do not work. After I finished the book, I walked away from it wondering what I really learned. Unfortunately, not much.Despite the fact that the book may have been well-researched (one-fourth of the book is endnotes), the research is not necessarily presented in a way that makes for a compelling argument or convincing message. Many thoughts were superficial and underdeveloped. The book is full of curiosity-inducing hooks with lackluster answers. For example, ""Why women cause more congestion than men"" is a very intriguing chapter title. Yet the answer falls flat. It is because more women have entered the workforce in the past 40 years, so they have added to the volume of cars on the streets.Additionally, the author's arguments are often incomplete and the logic is not well-thought out. For instance, in Chapter 7, he argues in favor of getting rid of traffic signs. To make his point, the author cites the traffic engineer Hans Monderman who eliminated street signs in a Dutch village called Oudehaske. The idea is that drivers would drive slower and more safely without any street signs because cyclists and pedestrians also shared the road. Drivers would be more cautious as they are brought into a ""social world"" and taken out of the ""traffic world."" The drivers would be more aware of themselves interacting with other people rather than feeling socially disconnected within their cars. However, in the very next chapter, the author criticized the lack of street signs in New Delhi, India. He cites an illegible, handwritten ""No U-Turn"" sign in place of a standard street sign as an example of one of the traffic problems in New Delhi. Wouldn't New Delhi be the perfect example of a place of a ""social world""? All the numerous modes of transportation are mixed into one space. Why doesn't the theory of no street signs work in New Delhi? The logic and arguments from Chapter 7 does not follow into Chapter 8, and the author does not elaborate to reconcile the differences.Overall, I can't recommend this book. Bits and pieces of it aren't bad, but as a whole, it simply doesn't hold together. "
52,0307264785,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9790047-jeff-kelleher,4,"Your are rolling along in the left lane when ""Lane Closed Ahead"" appears. Do you merge early or late? The socially-optimal strategy is to merge late, at or near the actual end of the lane. By doing so, you exploit now-scarce lane space that otherwise might be under-used. Everyone benefits (notwithstanding the self-righteous irritation of the drivers you pass). The same doesn't apply to the line at an offramp, though. Late cutters-in are not conserving lane space, but merely cheating.Scores of similarly-intriguing insights are scattered throughout this book. The title and cover make it seem like whimsy. It is actually serious and rather dense, filled with engineering, physics, psychology, statistics, and sociology.More insights. SUV drivers are more dangerous than sedan drivers. Not, as one might think, because they are arrogant yuppies, but because the high perch induces under-estimation of speed, and larger size induces casual driving habits. Men have fewer crashes than women per mile driven, but more fatalities (yes, it is largely testosterone and alcohol). Having a male passenger makes men even more dangerous, but a female passenger calms them. New cars crash at a higher rate than older cars. Pickup truck drivers are the most dangerous of all. Read the book to learn why.If there is an overarching lesson from this study, it is the near-futility of social regulation. Traffic is a microcosm of society--vast, teeming, and intractable. Most measures to reduce congestion or improve safety cause a counter-reaction that largely defeats the measure.Seat belts, airbags, rollover protection, and ABS brakes simply allow drivers to press the limits of the now-wider envelope. Our consciousness gets numb to warning signs (""Falling Rocks""). There ARE a lot fewer fatalities than in the past, but more crashes and worse congestion. More roads, more lanes, more signals, more sensors, produce diminishing returns.It turns out that both safety and flow are best served by LESS, not more, regulation. The model is an intersection in the middle of the Dutch town of Drachten where once two main streets intersected, governed by traffic lights. Twenty thousand cars a day pass through, plus countless bikes and pedestrians. An innovative traffic engineer named Hans Monderman eliminated all signals and signs and crosswalks and zebra poles, and replaced them with a town square dominated by sidewalks and fountains, with a roundabout in the middle. No one stops, everyone gives way voluntarily. Time to cross the intersection has been cut by 40%, accidents by 90%. We should take heed.RE: editing. The writing style is plain enough, but a skilled editor could have cut the length by a third without loss. Worse, there are 100 pages of textual footnotes. This is the worst kind of editorial laziness. I wish all the style manuals would say, ""NO TEXTUAL FOOTNOTES, EVER. Text belongs in the main body, or it doesn't belong. Period."" "
53,0307264785,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3749410-aaron-arnold,4,"Traffic as a phenomenon is full of irritating paradoxes. Driving faster can mean everyone drives slower. Building roads to relieve congestion creates even more congestion. Redesigning roads to make them safer can cause more accidents. Putting up more warning signs means fewer of them get read. Trying to keep pedestrians protected from cars makes them less safe. Tailgating the car in front of you in a traffic jam does nothing to let you escape it. Traffic the book is an excellent in-depth study on driving and its effects on society that manages to both confirm a lot of my own driving prejudices and offer a lot of good insights into traffic congestion and a host of other related subjects. Vanderbilt talks about the history of traffic jams going back to the Romans and how modern technology is trying to stay one step ahead of the monster jams that modern technology helps create in the first place. Very readable and full of fun info. Quick takeaways, some of which should be obvious yet somehow aren't for a lot of people:- Don't tailgate, it's really unsafe and often causes people to actually slow down- Driving and texting/eating/anything in the car makes you way more likely to get into a wreck- In a traffic jam, drive a slow but consistent speed instead of stopping and going; you won't get out of the jam any more quickly but you will both save on gas and help out the people behind you- Late merging is the way to go, as it maximizes the use of space; don't get pissed off at people who zoom ahead of you, you didn't ""own"" a place in line- Support toll roads/congestion pricing/higher street parking fees; recognizing that the precious resources of road and parking space aren't free will help everyone in the long run even if it hurts your wallet up front- Stop thinking of roads as car transport devices only, there are lots of other types of transportation like bikes and pedestrians that have just as much of a right to be there as cars- Suburban sprawl is ruining cities and in very real ways making us poorer as a nation, encourage any and every policy to spur density and alternatives to driving you seeIf you're like me, you hate driving and try to do as little of it as possible, yet you still find the subject very interesting. Vanderbilt goes through a great tour of the many ways in which the rise of mega-commuting has warped our culture (e.g. we spend so much time in our cars that radio stations time their broadcasts to give you ""driveway moments"" that get you to stay in your car even after your trip has ended to hear the end of the segment) and the superhuman efforts of traffic engineers to shave even seconds off our journeys. Highly recommended."
54,0307264785,http://goodreads.com/user/show/91438-edwin-arnaudin,2,"An excellent concept, but unfortunately one that Vanderbilt is never sure how to handle. I was instantly drawn to the book because I find the psychology of driving fascinating and want to know if the way I behave behind the wheel (which likely exhibits multiple behavioral disorders) has deeper ripples in my life and society in general than I'd imagined.Looks like I'll have to do my own research. While Vanderbilt somewhat succeeds at relaying the history of traffic and how certain esoteric driving situations may be altered for the betterment of society, these moments of clarity are merely happy blips in a giant mess of a book. Vanderbilt explores a wide wide range of related topics (1/4 of the text is devoted to explanatory notes), but he is incapable of developing a concept to completion. His first chapter, about the benefits of becoming a ""late merger,"" sounds like life-saving advice, but he never fully explains how to carry out said suggestion. It's the literary equivalent of a film with a missing reel. As a result, I'm still convinced that merging in the early-to-middle zone from a lane that's about to end is safer than doing what Vanderbilt suggests and driving to the tail end of the lane and then somehow magically being able to merge. I could see that if all drivers were aware that all merging drivers were to adapt this behavior that it would work, but Vanderbilt doesn't even suggest that. He just says that it WILL work, but I'm pretty sure that I'll end up hung out to dry if I attempt his style of driving. It's hard to take this New Yorker's driving advice seriously.Whereas ""The Tipping Point"" employs fantastic examples to which a majority of readers can relate in order for his points to connect, Vanderbilt picks poor examples and increasingly confuses readers throughout the text. I was ready to quit after every other page, when suddenly an appealing kernal would emerge and I'd read on, confident that Vanderbilt would finally say something meaningful. Instead, I remained in a see-saw battle that left me feeling broken and cheated by the end.Essentially, Vanderbilt never answers his titular questions: Why do humans drive the way we do and what does that say about us? By failing to do so, the work exists as a dull research paper that would get a C-/D+ from any teacher I've had in higher education. Not so good."
55,0307264785,http://goodreads.com/user/show/14603772-ellen,3,"Full of facts, this was a book cooked medium-rare. I've filed away a few tidbits for coffee conversations, but fear I'll forget the rest."
56,0307264785,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5708640-warren-benton,4,"Rating:4.25Are you an early merger or late merger? Do you text and drive? Do you think you are a better driver than most (I know I certainly do)? This book takes you through many intersections of traffic , safety, and human reasoning. The majority of accidents happen at intersections. also more accidents happen when people try to stop for a light, but more fatalities happen when lights are fun.We get an insight into LA traffic controls on Oscar night. Also, how one traffic controller takes to the air in his Cessna to analyze traffic from above. We also get an in-depth conversation with the Danish road architect who is designing roads for bikers, pedestrians, and cars.Overall this book gives lots of little bits of information that you probably know but do not often think about. Like did you know that in work zones the workers are actually safer than the drivers? Often times people are rubbernecking and run into the back of the car in front of them. Or how about roundabouts eliminate lots of accidents that happen at normal intersections. Another interesting fact I came across in this book was safer roads tend to be more dangerous than what would be considered a dangerous road. Like a tight mountain road that feels so dangerous but is actually safer because we focus a lot more than normal on our driving. Or how about when there is a bike lane we sometimes pay less attention to the bikers because we assume they will stay in the lane, when if we have to share the road we actually give them more space.An estimated 110 million traffic violations happen daily in Dehli. More trucks are in accidents than any other vehicle. Cars are equipped with more safety features than they have ever been, but is their safety making us more careless? One final quote ""Is cars being safer making us less aware of our driving ability or is car availability allowing more inexperience on the road?""This book was very eye opening to a few thing that I need to work on in my own driving abilities. It also showed me how cars, bicycles, and pedestrians need to find a way to cohabitate in traffic. "
57,0307264785,http://goodreads.com/user/show/14468-joyce,5,"A fantastic read -- well written and full of fascinating and thought-provoking relevations about the pyschology of driving, traffic engineering, traffic safety, etc.His first mission is to convince you to become a 'late merger', even if your spouse cringes as you fly along in the left lane passing all the other chumps obediently taking their turn at a lane drop. 'Late merging' increases the traffic throughtput by as much as 15% because it uses the full volume of the roadway. So indulge your Type A self!My favorite chapter talks about traffic safety and some of the surprising discoveries about traffic signage. If you want to get drivers' attention, you're better off putting up an inscrutable sculpture than an instructive sign: drivers see so much roadside instruction, they tune it out. In the Netherlands (of course) they've experimented with traffic-sign free zones -- and learned that without signs, drivers focus more on their actual surroundings and safety increases.A Dutch traffic engineer is also responsible for pioneering 'traffic calming' not through speed bumps, but by putting heavy traffic and pedestrians closer together. It has to do with putting drivers back in the 'village'; promoting eye contact and softening the barrier between auto and human. This is probably where NYC got the idea of putting little pedestrian oases in the middle of Broadway.In Los Angeles, code H25-As -- ""traffic hazard animal"" -- peak on July 5, presumeably because all the dogs freaked out by the previous night's fireworks are hitting the freeway.This is psychology, engineering, sociology (an interesting chapter on how corruption affects traffic) wrapped up in an enjoyable read, with chapter headings like ""Why You Shouldn't Drive with a Beer-Drinking Divorced Doctor Named Fred on Super Bowl Sunday in a Pickup Truck in Rural Montana"". Should be required reading for all new drivers and their parents.My only regret is that it's rather long and I didn't quite finish it before I had to return to the library."
58,0307264785,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5461709-mero,3,"The interesting:* The white dotted divider lines on freeway lanes are 10-15 feet in length. They look shorter because of an optical illusion caused by the speed of the car.* We judge speed by the rate at which objects appear to increase in size and the distance at which we can make judgements about speed becomes shorter and shorter as speeds increase.* The more dangerous a road *feels* the more safe it is in almost every instance.* ""risk homeostasis"" - after making any aspect of driving safer, drivers tend to respond by driving in a more dangerous fashion. After a safety device is implemented by car manufacturers or road builders accidents dip down and then slowly rise back to their previous levels.* making eye contact with cross traffic is more likely to get you hit by a car as a pedestrian.* purposely driving at slow speeds in stop/go traffic will eliminate the stop/go effect for the entire lane.* most congestion is caused by people following at the wrong distance. Having two cars per ten with automatic cruise control systems (which adjust speed to account for the vehicle in front) would eliminate almost all traffic jams.* Adding additional highways and more lanes for traffic tends to increase traffic and erode most of the gains that the extra space would provide.The awful:* Almost a third of the book is spent bringing up evidence and research that supports a conclusion and then introducing confounding factors to problematize that conclusion. There is never any discussion of how significant a problematizing factor might be and no discussion as to the range of effect that any un-accounted for factor might affect a conclusion. The result is that the book has the feeling of listening to an old man hem and haw for 200 pages without resolution. * Lots of generic opening lines that openly make assumptions about the reader: ""Many of us have probably..."", ""we all..."", ""It's a common occurrence..."", ""you're probably wondering..."", etc*The end notes shouldn't take the place of the bibliography."
59,0307264785,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1257630-janet,3,"This book came along at just the right time for me; I'm easing my way back into driving after more than fifteen largely car-free years, and I've been thinking a lot about cars and people and how they interact. It was a fascinating read in parts and I wish I could give copies of it (or at least substantial excerpts) to every person in Seattle who is involved with traffic systems. Some very interesting ideas and phenomena are discussed and documented, ranging from the obvious (speed kills; drinking and driving don't mix) to the counter-intuitive yet demonstrably true (more roads create more traffic, not less; roundabouts are safer than intersections; fewer, not more, crashes happen on roads where there's foot, bike or other traffic in addition to cars) to the undeniable-yet-unlikely-to-be-welcome (it really is dangerous to talk on a cell phone while driving, even with a hands-free headset--it's about attention, not hands; near misses are a more accurate gauge of driving skill than accidents; even though we complain about the traffic, we *are* the traffic). Vanderbilt did extensive research and reports it perhaps a touch too exhaustively (three-quarters of the way in all the studies cited started to blur together for me; there's also a fair amount of jargon that isn't clarified for the reader), but there's a lot of food for thought here about how people behave when they're in cars, and I will no doubt be irritating my friends with fascinating facts gleaned from the book for months to come. A minor quibble (and not the author's fault): the fact that there are extensive notes to the text isn't apparent unless you flip to the back of the book. Oh, and full disclosure: the author and I were once co-workers, almost twenty years ago, but haven't been in touch since then. "
60,0307264785,http://goodreads.com/user/show/375767-joanna,4,"People are fascinating. This tightly written treatise on Traffic is all about boiling us down to a statistical conformity, but the author delights in the myriad individual choices that make up the traffic stream and the idiosyncratic ways that we are all different, and yet all the same. It is crammed full of statistics and studies and there is a hefty ""Notes"" section that I emphatically did not read, but it flows merrily along despite all that. I was ""done"" perhaps 15 pages before I hit the notes section, so that's pretty good I think. I walk away from the book with a few core concepts. Primary: driving is so dangerous. Secondary: we think we are good drivers because we are lucky. I also expect to remember these three numbers: 3 seconds, 15 seconds, and 30 seconds. 3 seconds: the danger zone of inattention. 2 seconds, probably ok, statistically speaking. The three second mark is why it's not a good idea to dial a cell phone while driving, or search for a particular song on the Ipod. 15 seconds: the danger zone of divided attention. This is when you are chatting on the phone, or trying to calm a youngster, or eating something messy. (Yeah. Chips and salsa--not a great idea.) 30 seconds: the point at which we get tired of waiting to get our way and engage in riskier mergers. The most important thing to remember---the driving that feels the safest is actually the most dangerous. We get complacent, we speed up, our attention wanders. We crash. My favorite part of the book, though, was not about traffic safety at all. The first chapter was jam packed with traffic behaviors. Things like, how long does the second driver in a row of cars wait to honk when the light turns green? Who gets the right of way when 4 cars arrive at a four way stop without a clear leader? These questions, and about a million more, answered!I really enjoyed this book. "
61,0307264785,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1492258-jan,4,"A fun book, in the vein of Malcolm Gladwell hits like ""The Tipping Point"" and ""Outliers."" In trying to paint a portrait of traffic throughout our society, Tom Vanderbilt goes for breadth rather than depth, which has its pluses and minuses. Instead of anchoring to one or two sweeping conclusions (like Gladwell) and pressing into their service some interesting anecdotes, Vanderbilt goes into a dizzying array of factoids and stories about traffic without necessary trying to tie them all together. If there are any overarching conclusions, they are ""individual actions often lead to unexpected collective outcomes"" and ""road safety is scary."" Having more of a point would be nice, but is there one to made from the sheer amount of material? This book is best considered a -- riveting -- tour of the world of traffic, and it consistently raises questions about what we really want when we design policy for roads. Do we want convenience? Do we want safety? Do we want to express our national character in a specific fashion (like with the mystifying US reluctance to build roundabouts)?There are some unsatisfying anecdotes all well, but, partnered with the extraordinary amount of research, they consistently serve as a jumping off point for further exploration. While the author never really makes an argument for being a ""late merger"", I now know where to look, and my interest in these issues has been piqued. Similarly, this book does a really good job of giving the reader an awareness of the day-to-day life of people whose work we take for granted: traffic engineers, road safety experts, and all those minor figures who have made traffic their passion."
62,0307264785,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7429014-southernmyst,4,"This book challenged much of what I ""knew"" about driving, and so I read it very slowly, dipping in and out. It's well-supported, with 90 pages of end notes, and cites a library full of research. Some really interesting phenomena and ideas in these pages. "
63,0307264785,http://goodreads.com/user/show/334225-steve,3,"Really, this is more of a 3.5 stars book.If you curse at other drivers or think that traffic flows are interesting and not just something to grind your teeth through, this book is for you. On the downside, this book is an encapsulation of all the stories you've probably read before: 1. People overestimate their abilities and underestimate risk; 2. The downsides of signs; 3. Traffic jams ""for no reason;"" 4. The dubious benefits of safety equipment; 5. Which sex really are less-safe drivers; 6. The downsides of talking on your cell phone ('hands-free' doesn't help) 7. Why roundabouts are better... so you might not learn much new from it. (But you probably will.)My most interesting (and galling) response to the book is how often I find myself seeing and/or practicing the cognitive mistakes outlined in the book (for example: the longer you wait for an opening in traffic, the less safe your left turn becomes... oops.)This isn't a 5-star book because I can't say -- even with its safety advice -- that it changed my life. It's not a 4-star book because I found that it doesn't flow very well together; each chapter feels more like an individual (interesting) magazine article and they've all been stitched together with only the slightest common thesis of ""traffic."" It's not bad by any stretch, it just doesn't feel like a coherent whole -- more of a smorgasbord of interesting, terrifying, and fascinating tidbits about how we drive.But it's great fun."
64,0307264785,http://goodreads.com/user/show/321673-jamie-collins,3,"A fun book. I particularly enjoyed the early chapters.There's an examination of how difficult it is to perform social interactions with other drivers, when we can't see their faces or read their body language. The author explains why the other lane always seems to be moving faster, and why it's so hard to keep our minds on our driving. (If you pay attention to yourself, something you will do the first time you drive after reading this book, you'll be shocked at how often and how long you take your eyes off the road.)The author claims that we have a poor idea of our own driving ability because of a lack of feedback - the number of accidents you have is not necessarily good indicator. I wish I could get one of those DriveCams for my son when he starts to drive. (It's terrifying how soon that will be.)I enjoyed the discussion of the mysterious phenomenon of ""build it and they will come"" - why adding roads does not decrease traffic congestion any more than closing roads increases it. I was also intrigued by the idea that making a road technically safer actually causes more accidents, while making it more dangerous has the opposite effect.I read the trade paperback edition of this book, and I thought the text seemed crowded and that the book was in general poorly formatted. There were 100 pages of numbered notes, but these notes were not referenced in the text, so I kept forgetting to flip back and read them along with the narrative. They were much less meaningful when I tried to read them later."
65,0307264785,http://goodreads.com/user/show/19834-becky,4,"Ladies and gentleman, this is a THICK book. It has nearly one hundred pages of notes and references! Sort of like a textbook, but with lots more humor. It took me weeks and weeks to get through it, and I read possibly a dozen other books start to finish in the meanwhile. But I'm glad I persevered. It is a mix of pop science and psychology, like a Freakonomics of everything to do with driving (excepting environmental issues). And it gave me serious food for thought every time I'm on the road. Did you know that most drivers would rate themselves to be above average drivers? The author delves deep into these sorts of contradictory conundrums - how safety measures can cause us to drive more dangerously and take more risks. How road systems work best as a collaborative system - yet each driver makes choices that are in his or her own best interest, which slows everyone down. And lots, lots, lots more. Fascinating stuff.Before I read this book, I thought people who text while driving were really really bad, but talking on a cellphone was ok once in a while (especially when it was me doing it and not someone else). Now I know that any distraction at all is dangerous. It's not that most of us are good drivers. It's that most of the time we are all just very lucky.On a side note, how did this author have the time and money to write this book??? He traveled to Mexico, India, China, and all over Europe and the United States, meeting with hundreds of researchers, government officials, and industry insiders and analysts. Maybe he is a Vanderbilt from *the* Vanderbilt family?"
66,0307264785,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7394473-jamie,5,"The author covers lots of bases, including human physiology, psychology, economics, physics, urban planning, traffic engineering, history, and case studies of various places around the world as they relate to traffic. I think the depth and breadth of the information was appropriate, crucially important for a book of this type. The writing style was matter of fact but not dry, and was peppered with humorous anecdotes without coming across as desperate.I was happy to see that the author gave attention to 'big picture' traffic issues, such as induced demand, subsidization of driving, and bias in public policy towards drivers. He covered both sides of the ongoing traffic engineer vs. urban planner debate. The material was obviously extensively researched. I was surprised at the sheer amount of information presented, and that the author had traveled to many of the various places he discusses.Any time I mentioned to someone that I was reading a book about traffic, I always got a sarcastic reply such as ""Wow, that sounds interesting..."". But it actually was! I think anyone would enjoy this book, not just people who are into urban policy or transportation policy. It's rare to see a book that gets the balancing act right on so many levels, but this one does it."
67,0307264785,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1127336-maria,2,"I started reading this one for a new book club and was very excited about it because I have a long commute in the DC area and I heard the interview with the author on Fresh Air recently. My excitement ended at about page 5. I found reading this to be kind of laborious. My mind kept drifting even as my eyes were still reading the words and all I really wanted to do is read any other book on earth. I think in the end I am not a non-fiction kind of girl unless it is about a person or people or a juicy story. The style of this book just brought back flashbacks of reading text book after text book in college. After reading about half the book, I gave myself leave to finish it up with the abridged audio version (just in case I missed anything in the second half that might come up in discussion at the meeting). Well... I wasn't missing much and found myself wanting to concentrate more on my driving then on the audio book. It is quite ironic that if you want people to pay attention more behind the wheel (the main lesson of this book) you just need to bore them senseless with the book itself and suddenly driving is so riveting."
68,0307264785,http://goodreads.com/user/show/144125-tim,5,"This book is beyond fascinating, and one of the most interesting things I have *ever* read. (And no, I don't think it's just because I recently had a nearly life-ending car accident.) Every chapter, every page, discusses some research or insight into how people drive, how traffic works (or doesn't work), how when where and why accidents happen, etc. The most interesting chapters for me were: ""How Our Eyes and Mind Betray Us on the Road,"" about the limits of what we see, or think we see, and how we process it while driving; ""When Dangerous Roads Are Safer,"" about the seemingly paradoxical relationship between a road's perceived and actual safety; and ""Driving with a Local Accent,"" on the differences in traffic as reflections of culture. (From this last chapter, for example, it turns out that a country's rate of corruption is directly proportional to its rate of accident violations and fatalities.) I'd recommend this book to everyone who drives, because driving is such a large, yet still largely mysterious, part of our lives."
69,0307264785,http://goodreads.com/user/show/13333616-jolynne-dougherty,3,"This was an interesting book. I shared it with my sister who finished reading it before me. It was slow going for me at the beginning, but with her encouragement, I continued. We had some very interesting discussions about driving. Her husband has a very long commute is congested traffic. My husband and I live very close to where we work and do not spend much time in traffic at all. I am glad that I do not have to commute in congestion. As I was reading, I kept thinking, ""if people would just be kind and let people merge or change lanes when they put their signal on, things would be so much nicer."" Because I am not a commuter and do not deal with traffic on a regular basis, the beginning of the book dragged as it didn't really relate to my experiences. I did find the end interesting about how roads are engineered to keep people engaged and awake and aware. Also, about how when we start to feel too safe, we make mistakes. It was a good read if you enjoy a non fiction read."
70,0307264785,http://goodreads.com/user/show/236382-darrick,4,"A pretty interesting read, much of which was kind of obvious. A few things that I learned were a.) Late merging is more efficient. I always hate the people that stay in the lane that is ending until the last second (budging) and then merge in, but, if you think about it this is more efficient as it is using up all available open road. Therefore, it makes perfect sense to do so even if you really annoy the people you are budging in front of.b.) Just because cars get safer doesn't mean it's safer to drive. This is mainly because humans tend to live (prefer) with a certain, constant amount of risk. So, the enhancements in car safety merely cause us to drive faster, and more reckless to maintain that level of risk. When you perceive that a certain driving environment is more risky you tend to drive more safely (slower/more alert). This explains why SUVs aren't more safe than mid-size cars because the drivers feel more safe they tend to drive more recklessly. "
71,0307264785,http://goodreads.com/user/show/900325-mike,3,"This is a good book to get from the library: informative, interesting (but not intriguing), and a few quirky items. Spoiler alert: the answer to the subtitle's question is that we're irrational. More information that everyone knows but few follow: slow down (or have your municipality reduce the speed limit), buckle up, don't tailgate, don't talk on the cellphone, get rid of signage (that was a pretty cool idea), change intersections to roundabouts without traffic lights, and don't blame truckers for accidents - chances are, it's the little cars zipping in and out of truck traffic that cause most of the carnage. And the ultimate: be like Finland and create a traffic violation system whereby fines are based on one's income - the higher your income, the higher your fine. Maybe even put a dagger on your steering wheel pointed directly at your chest instead of an air bag and watch the incredibly fast reduction of traffic accidents. "

When I first saw this book I giggled but was fearful of reading it, for my blood pressure has always been good and I didn't want to risk it. However, after a return home brought back the traffic nostalgia (and ire) I decided to give it a go...I went in expecting an explanation for why back ups that seemingly have no cause occur...I think you get that plus a whole lot more in this book. It essentially takes a behavioral economics approach, bringing various disciplines to bear on understanding the complexity behind driving that results largely from the fact that we are human beings. I'm a sucker for anything that quotes a psychologist and an economist on the same page so it was a no brainer for me! "

This is a one-off from the series he is best known for featuring New Orleans PI Lew Griffin (""Moth"", ""The Long-Legged Fly"" etc.) Sometimes when you read dust jacket quotes they seem predictably trite, bought and paid for by the publishers marketing dept. but this quote from ""The Long-Legged Fly"" nails the essence of Sallis' writing: ""An enemy said that James Sallis recalled Doc Holliday. All of us knew what he meant: the fever and the cold, deadly precision: the sense of menace made dauntless by a superior terror. When you have read ""The Long-Legged Fly"", you, too, will understand.

I've had bad commutes, and I often found my mind filling the numbing gaps getting to and from work by thinking about the dynamics of my unpleasant situation. I had questions. I developed theories. I created fanciful solutions. It just kind of happened, and by the time I got home, or maybe even to work, I had always found something better to think about, or at least something else to distract me.Tom Vanderbilt, though, wrote a book about the types of questions, theories, and solutions I daydreamed about. Traffic is relevant to all of us, and this book is a fascinating investigation combining the disciplines of engineering, psychology, and economics. I found that it was not a particularly fast read, but that was because I wanted to take the time to make sure I was understanding what I was reading."
75,0307264785,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1718191-jillaire,4,"Anyone who has ever driven a car (or maybe even just ridden in one) should read this book. I found Vanderbilt's scope and analysis fascinating. This book is full of statistics and studies from around the world that look at the way people drive. It addressed road design, driver mentality, vehicle safety and so many other facets of driving that I'd never even considered.I can tell you: be a late merger (use up more of the available space), stay off the roads after the Superbowl (drunk driving fatalities are significantly higher than all other Sundays at the same time of day), and roundabouts should be used WAY more (efficiency and safety are HUGELY improved over 4-way intersections.So many more excellent points to consider in this book. I think it would be a great book club book just because there's so much to talk about. My poor husband had to keep hearing me cite statistics and explain why certain traffic interchanges were better than others. I needed a discussion group!"
76,0307264785,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8153789-jenny,2,"The content is moderately interesting, but the author doesn't present it well. Little of his analysis gets any deeper than ""humans are weird, engineers don't know everything."" To be fair, I didn't follow along with the notes, which may go into better detail. In the main text, he describes results strangely, often using absolute numbers in places where rates would be more appropriate. At one point, he describes a study that links low but non-zero BAC levels to safer driving, then follows up by explaining that the study in question didn't control for age. This meant the zero-BAC numbers were skewed because the non-drinkers were disproportionately the underage and the elderly, both groups with below-average safety records. This obliterates the original ""fact"" - it's no longer an interesting counterintuitive tidbit about traffic, it's a vaguely interesting lesson in poor study design and doesn't belong in the book. This kind of padding leaves the book feeling bloated."

I checked out this book with the intention of just skimming over it a bit and returning it to the library, but every single section I skimmed was riveting. Psychology, economics, urban planning, engineering, business - every page is filled with all of these topics and more, all tied to traffic issues and our automotive culture and history. I even copied chapter 3 to use in teaching my psych classes. I was especially impressed with the ""Drivecam"" company that basically Tivos your dangerous driving behaviors. I would recommend this book to everyone, especially if you are interested in psychology. It is well written and provides tons of anecdotes/ facts that you can't help but share with everyone you know."
78,0307264785,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1854534-jordan,4,"Excellent book. Very insightful on traffic conditions caused by both people, road conditions, and the relation these have on each other. My only complaint is that I would have liked Vanderbilt to have a focus on mass transit section (he is from NYC/ Brooklyn...), especially rails, subways, light rails, etc, where traffic is required to flow along a single track; a focus on how one deals with that traffic congestion. Regardless, my boyfriend gave me this book, both because he knew I would really enjoy the subject, and because he said it may help me understand the way he drives. If anything, it helped me see how my boyfriend, and all of us, become that person on the road that is not driving safely. A wonderful book! "

This is an interesting if not gripping book about driving psychology, as well as some history about traffic, and discussions of modern ways of dealing with traffic problems. There are cites from a lot of different little studies, and stories about driving schools and ways pedestrians are handled in certain countries - lots of snippets of good stuff. However, it really might have been better as a robust article, or series of articles, in a good magazine - there's really not enough to hold your attention for the long haul. I mean, yes, I get it that if drivers are told their vehicles are safer, they may well then drive more aggressively - I'm not sure I need a whole chapter on it."

I enjoyed reading it and learned a lot about traffic, and why it behaves the way it does. For instance, when two lanes merge, it is actually more efficient to ""zipper"" at the merge point rather than to move over when you see the signs alerting you of a an upcoming merge.One thing he did not address was one of my major frustrations from my commuting days, ""left lane bandits."" These are the folks who drive slowly in the left lane, those blocking others from passing. I have been in bumper to bumper traffic with clear road ahead of me that no one could reach because of these people. I would love to understand why.Anyway, if you drive, and especially if you have a major commute, you will enjoy this book."
81,0307264785,http://goodreads.com/user/show/16041437-steven,5,"I love a lot of the questions this book asks, like, “How are drivers supposed to respond to ‘Caution Falling Rocks’ signs?” Do they slow down, or speed up, or take their eyes off the road to watch for rocks? What is point of those signs? I love all the examples of traffic from other countries, and throughout history all the way back to Pompeii. This book came out in 2008, but Vanderbilt was already anticipating the effect of self-driving cars. The book didn’t discuss the environmental impact of traffic, but the author left it out intentionally. I would have liked to see a few tables and graphs or visual representations of some of the information in the book. Vanderbilt’s prose was quite clear, lucid, and critical though, so I didn’t miss those inserts much at all. Lots of great things to think about. Very good book."
82,0307264785,http://goodreads.com/user/show/16172397-leo-jr,5,"I never thought a book about how we drive would be so interesting. It really got me thinking about our cultural reasons for behaving the way we do behind the wheel, connections to our legal systems and business practices, and social expectations. One way I can judge how good a book is for me is by the amount of times I simply must share the latest thing I read in it with my friends/family. All I can say is that my wife was definitely glad I finished this book after all the times I brought up another new thing I had learned from Tom's book. This book changed the way I drive my car and my bike. How many books impact us on that level?There are some writing techniques that I believe Tom could use help in, but the book is so darned good, I'll just keep them to myself. If you're someone who loves to keep learning, this is a great book to add to your reading list."
83,0307264785,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5649720-rebecca,4,"I think there's a downside to big media campaigns--by the time I read this book, I feel like I'd already read most of the interesting parts.There's actually a lot here that's really quite interesting--from factoids about how roads designed to make cars safer make drivers more aggressive and therefore increase the damage when cars do crash to comparisons between different countries' driving cultures, there's a lot to unpack. I think part of why I was less impressed than I expected is just that Vanderbilt's tour of guest columns when this book came out turned out to be kind of spoiler-filled. So I already knew how long the white dashed lines on the highway are. (I'm not going to spoil it, but let's just say they're shockingly longer than you think they are.) If you didn't catch the promotional campaign, you'll probably enjoy the book more."
84,0307264785,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2148308-shawn-thrasher,3,"This book is sort of like a long road trip, like driving from California to someplace back east on I-40. There are some sights and sites along the way, but there are also some incredibly long stretches of sand. I will admit that within a day or so of starting the book, I was taking a closer look at my driving and the driving of others, as well as the signs, intersections, bicycle paths, pedestrians and other mind boggling distractions and temptations along any given route.Vanderbilt strives for the Gladwellian standard of pop nonfiction, I think, but falls just short of the connectivity and re-connectivity of Gladwell's works. The book has an episodic quality to it that makes some individual chapters far better than others, without making them meet."
85,0307264785,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1060231-todd,4,"This was a great book. It could have been a bit shorter and would work just as well (if not better), but it fits in nicely with the Freakanomics/Outliers/Kluge/How We Decide genre that seems to get bigger and bigger each year (ok, that was a dumb statement but you know what I mean). What makes this book stand out is that it's a topic that just about everyone has experience with and it's well documented. Like all the books in this area, it's got a nice mix of expected and counter-intuitive arguments and the author employs both effectively to make a well-paced book that is surprisingly interesting given the subject matter. "
86,0307264785,http://goodreads.com/user/show/31433-dan,2,"I was sooooo excited to read this book, now that I've become one of the driving masses and constantly pondering why there are so many damn people commuting into Oakland at 615 in the morning. Unfortunately, the NY Times Magzaine excerpt was better. I guess if you like Malcolm Gladwell books you'll enjoy this. Personally, I found it overstuffed, not convincing, repetitive, and frankly, skimmable (not a word, I know). There are interesting tidbits to learn here, but unfortunately, they are buried beneath pages and pages of citing other peoples studies. Stick to magazine writing, it's a better format for this kind of writing. "
87,0307264785,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5205285-jennifer-stringer,4,"Kinda bizarre listening to a book about traffic while driving in traffic. I added this to my to-read list when Malcolm Gladwell suggested it in his podcast. I can so totally see Malcolm Gladwell getting into this book. At the time it was the only book available on Overdrive. It is a very thorough examination of traffic and the psychology behind it. I get that late merging is the best use of traffic lanes, but it still seams rude to me. Also, I still really dislike roundabouts, but they far and away outperform intersections. Also, I don't think I'll ever put a self-identifying bumper sticker or decal on my car again and I'm currently chockablock full of traffic trivia!"
88,0307264785,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1586947-katie,2,"I really, really wanted to like this book. Traffic and transportation fascinate me. Unfortunately, this book didn't. Maybe it was because my expectations were too high. Maybe it was because I'd heard a bunch of this before. Maybe it was because some of the structure drove me nuts. (No need to remind me that you covered a topic in a previous chapter -- I remember. No need to tell me tell me you'll get to the topic later -- just get there.) Some of the specific stats are interesting and the anecdotes are compelling, but it was disappointing between those nuggets."
89,0307264785,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1058994-ryan-mishap,4," A multi-disciplinary look at driving, traffic engineering, and human interaction with traffic that will leave you afraid to venture out onto the streets in any vehicle or even on foot. Filled with statistics, mention of various studies, evolution of humans, speculation, and examples, this book covers a lot of ground with a complex topic. The writing is clear, but so much information is hard to assemble in the brain--mostly I remember interesting tidbits that make me wonder why there aren't more accidents and deaths. Anyone would benefit from reading this."
90,0307264785,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2379815-dustin-tatman,4,"I loved the multidisciplinary approach. It jumps around from stuff that's going on inside our brains, to the differences between various commuting cultures, to the nuts and bolts of civil engineering. It confirmed a lot of my suspicions about traffic while teaching me new stuff at the same time.I'm usually pretty conservative with my ratings, but I had to give it the 5th star because of its applicability. It's something that most of us do every day, but there aren't many books on the subject."
91,0307264785,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5891662-max-wilson,3,"A well researched, well written essay which was expanded to a novel length book. This is great support for the old saying:""if something can be abridged, it should be."" The significat current (thesis?) of this work is that much of we might hope to help improve traffic only hurts it. Narrow roads force people to slow down, lack of signage causes people to pay attention, painted lines in bike lanes don't project bikers from falling onto the road, jaywalking pedistrians are normally on the alert, etc. I guess they don't pay well for articles these days."
92,0307264785,http://goodreads.com/user/show/23428788-john-kaufmann,3,"Each chapter dealt with a different subject about traffic. Some chapters I found really interesting, some less so. One reason I rated it 3-stars, however, was that a lot of it seemed anecdotal, based on interviews and anecdotes, peppered with a few statistics (i.e., ""scientism"" but not necessarily science) - interesting and, in many cases, thought-inducing, but I am not convinced there is a lot of sound scientific or statistical evidence behind some of his conclusions. But still a decent read that got me thinking. "
93,0307264785,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1606852-bonnie-irwin,5,"I loved this book! Even though it is a bit dated now, having been written before GPS was ubiquitous and driverless cars were becoming more of a reality, the way in which Vanderbilt presents traffic from several perspectives is fascinating.From the engineering and architecture of roads to the economics and psychology of driver behavior, the author covers seemingly every aspect of traffic: what causes traffic jams and crashes, how other countries compare to the US, and what we could do to change it, if we had the will. Fascinating stuff."
94,0307264785,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1757741-kevin,4,"Excellent book. Sometimes I was not sure whether it was a tough or easy read. I think it was smart and very cerebral while still being culturally relevant and fun. Some eye opening statistics. Who knew there was this much data on traffic. This is the kind of book that makes you wonder why things still are they are with this much data out there. Def recommend this book but don't think you are going to sit back for a nice, relaxing journey. This is a textbook that is fun."
95,0307264785,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1058004-kathleen,3,"Everything you ever wanted to know about traffic, but were afraid to ask. Even though I don't drive that much, the psychology of it has always fascinated me. With an international perspective, Vanderbilt doesn't leave a stone unturned. Who drives better, men or women? What about roundabouts? Who fares better on the roads, single, divorced or married? What about late mergers? The only trouble is, now I'm afraid to get behind the wheeel, with all those trucks out there!"
96,0307264785,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1246248-jane-dugger,4,"This book was super fascinating. I tried reading it a few times but realized it would be better (for me) on audio. I highly recommend it. Please be advised there are a few duller parts but overall I was riveted. It really made me think about driving in general and how I drive. As well, it helped in explaining why roads are the way they are (round-abouts). In fact, I've added traffic engineer to my list of occupations if I wasn't a librarian.Good stuff."
97,0307264785,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7203169-bruce,5,"Encyclopedic coverage of this topic, but engaging style makes for easy pleasurable reading. Presents a multitude of research on the human psychology of driving, and the physics of interacting drivers that produces traffic situations. Chapter 6 on induced demand, and chapter 7 on the futility of over-engineering trafficways, challenge conventional/intuitive wisdom in ways important to thinking about our future."
98,0307264785,http://goodreads.com/user/show/398286-scott,2,"Not much insight and not presented in a very interesting manner. Mah, some good basic information but barely worth the time. Ironically, I listened to this audiobook during my 1 hour one-way commute, but never stuck in traffic because I was in the carpool lane in my Prius hybrid with HOV stickers. The book barely mentions carpool lanes and hybrid/EV options... sigh."
99,0307264785,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7401382-don-libes,1,"I tried to like Traffic but it was just too poorly written. For example, some of the descriptions of road situations were very difficult to understand. Hasn't the author heard of diagrams? Would've been a much easier read with diagrams. The author also failed to address some basic issues and instead suggested some very questionable ideas with only anecdotal support."
100,0307264785,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5724916-william,3,"The author's social biases come through loud and clear, and he is obviously not a driving enthusiast. He does present a lot of data and information which should be of interest to anyone who thinks about traffic and human behavior.A decent read, but I admit to speeding my way, ahem, through a number of passages. "
101,0307264785,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4258910-melissa,3,"I don't know why, but I picked this up and strangely enjoyed it. Full of interesting facts and studies about how we drive. I was particularly interested in the sections about signage. Most are pretty unnecessary and we know what to do without them! (Think about Kohls. No signs that say ""no spitting"" yet - most - people know not to spit in Kohls. Duhhhh)"
102,0307264785,http://goodreads.com/user/show/92919938-dan-albert,3,"I write about cars and drive. I liked listening to the experts quoted, but it doesn't add up to much more than an extended Wired article: cool stuff to know and things you thought you knew but were wrong about.The citations, bibliography, and acknowledgements imply a greater level of research than the text might support."
103,0307264785,http://goodreads.com/user/show/19965979-elizabeth,2,"Finalllllly finished this book after two attempts. It’s interesting but not particularly engaging. While I thought I was going to enjoy it and that there would be more critique of driving and cars, I felt more like I was entering the world of the enemy, like driving is inevitable and we just better accept it. More than anything else, I’m just glad I’m done with it and can move on to other things."
104,0307264785,http://goodreads.com/user/show/590852-anne,5,Highly recommend to anyone who has sat in traffic and marveled at human nature's tendency to pick the path of most resistance while believing to be on the path of least. Fascinating insights. Among my favorite reads of 2009.
105,0307264785,http://goodreads.com/user/show/153756-jeffrey,4,"A fascinating look at traffic and road culture...could've used more on 'road rage' and swearing at other drivers. Also makes me want to live in Europe, or at least spearhead an effort to have roundabouts in America..."
106,0307264785,http://goodreads.com/user/show/204691-ryan,4,"Interesting synthesis of sociology, cognitive psychology and social psychology studies on traffic and vehicles. Pretty fun and it zips along for bits, but gets bogged down in some repetitive traffic safety sections. Very interesting especially when listened to as an audiobook in the car!"
107,0307264785,http://goodreads.com/user/show/179668-liz-b,2,"Not for me. While parts were moderately interesting, overall it was too boring to finish.I probably would have enjoyed it a lot if it had been much shorter--say the length of an extended article in a magazine like National Geographic."
108,0307264785,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5202429-matthew-philips,2,"Many interesting facts and I appreciate the number of studies the author must have read and number of experts he must have interviewed, however, the book eventually feels like a list of this study said but this study found but this person thinks. No conclusions, just statements."
109,0307264785,http://goodreads.com/user/show/14170317-witek,4,"An interesting insight into the psychological aspects of driving. It does a great job of explaining, how different street designs, additional distractions and even different types of cars affect the way we drive and our tendency to make mistakes. I would make it a compulsory read for every driver."
110,0307264785,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6102247-william,4,"Good and interesting insight into some of the important ways people interact and conduct their lives. Some chapters are more interesting than others, and some are rather statistics-heavy. Definitely a cut above most of the books kind of like this."
111,0307264785,http://goodreads.com/user/show/602205-stephanie,3,It's always interesting to read a nonfiction book years after it was published and make note of what companies still exist or what technology has changed. Waze was but a glimmer in the internet's eye when this was published.

118,0307264785,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3647903-carrie,4,I think this should be required reading for EVERYONE who drives a car. The data is eye opening.
119,0307264785,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5856357-timothy,3,Vanderbilt writes with flourish as he selves into the psychology of driving. The book is a cautionary tale of how what we think drives how we act on the road.
