I'm sure I've read similar things in the other New Scientist book, but it's a fun collection anyway. My favourite thing was learning that you can separate out the iron from iron-fortified cereals using a magnet. Veeeery tempted to try that, though I'm not sure I have any strong enough magnets."

Bütün edilən təcrübələri ev şəraitində təkrarlamaq olar ( ilk bölüm başdan ayağa alkoqollu təcrübələrdir ;) ). Bond kokteylini niyə qarışdırmır? sambukaya su əlavə edəndə niyə rəngi dəyişir? niyə spagetti kənarlarından əyəndə iki deyil üç yerə bölünür? (sonuncu barədə araşdırma İqnobel mükafatı alıb, lakin insan sümüklərinin öyrənilməsində alimlərə köməklik də edib) və daha nələr, nələr. Həm əyləndirən, həm də məlumatlandıran bir seriya alınıb #birnəfəsə"
2,1846680441,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10887793-julie,4,"To be honest, tagging this one as a 'self-help book' in my reading challenge proved more accurate than initially expected. So far, I've learned useful life skills, such as how to make a martini (and why shaken and stirred ones do taste differently), how to fossilize a dead pet (200,000 years and an empty sea-bed are essential for this) and how to make green eggs and ham.It's a adorable read for anybody who's ever wondered what's the explanation behind daily phenomena. "

Some of their experiments are doable, some seem like they'd get costly with the alcohol bill. Nothing that translates well to group use. Very sad they show pictures of an improved paper plan but not how to make it :p"

6,1846680441,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5989098-hannah,5,Very interesting. Covered a few everyday phenomenon that have intrigued me before. And given me some great ideas for experiments to do with the kids :)
7,1846680441,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5992644-mg-mason,3,"This, the third in the collection of New Scientist books, focuses not so much on responding to letters sent into the magazine of those odd scientific queries and compiling them into a volume with comprehensive answers, but on the more practical aspects of what you can learn for yourself. It is a book of experiments based on queries they magazine has received.The experiments are of course straightforward and encourage you to recreate every day phenomena. Because of this, it is not so much a book to read cover to cover but one to dip into from time to time in case they are able to answer a particular query. One for the shelf then.Each premise follows a standard format:* Question* List of objects required to recreate the experiment* What you do with them* What you will see* What it all meansAs well as practical demonstrations of provable phenomena, the book also has several “mythbusting” example experiments to try out. The format doesn’t work quite as well as Why don’t penguins feet freeze? (the other volume I have read) because it is difficult to read without wanting to try the experiments amd if you do that it will take you a long time and could in theory cost you a bit of money, especially those that involve alcohol! Either way, this is an interesting book that tries to make science fun and that can only be a good thing. It didn’t quite work for me but for those with the time and the inclination to see experiments in action, it could be a fun Christmas stocking filler.I’m still hoping that the next volume is a blow-by-blow critique of The Daily Mail‘s non-existent science reporting.See more book reviews at my blog"
8,1846680441,http://goodreads.com/user/show/14500450-kalle-wescott,5,"This book is brilliant! Or at least it appears to be from reading the experiments. New Scientist magazine published the book, and it contains 78 experiments the armchair scientist can try at home with mostly easily available materials, to demonstrate scientific principles in action, the laws of physics, and in some cases, phenomena that are still not fully understood. Here are videos of five of the experiments: http://www.youtube.com/course?list=EC...I've picked out my first eleven experiments to try, out of the seventy-eight.Though many of the experiments can be done by children and/or with children, there is some serious science here.Pasta Puzzle (why spaghetti breaks in to 3 or more pieces) is something Richard Feynman struggled with... and it took 11 years after publishing a challenge for scientists to come up with a good theory to explain the behavior.Cream On involves putting cream on Tia Maria to create undulating patterns that scientists could not explain... and only recently did published papers come out from physicists researching the issue, which explained the patterns.Whoever titles the experiments must be a fan of rock and roll, not only do we have Cream On (Dream On?), and we also have Hot Stuff and Iron Man in the mix.Alright, that's enough idle discussion... I'm off to measure the speed of light using a chocolate bar and a microwave... "
9,1846680441,http://goodreads.com/user/show/684825-eric,3,"This is a fun little book full of easy experiments to try to prove different science related questions. Some of the questions include things like ""How do you suck an egg into a bottle"" or ""Why does that mentos/diet coke thing work?"" or ""How to make science volcanoes"" and more. The book if very easy to read and light-hearted with humor thrown in. I found it informative and easy to read end to end without doing any of the experiments. I do plan to keep the book and do some of the experiments with my kids though.. Most are safe to do with your kids and seem like they would be quite fun. Also all the experiments seem real easy to perform and 95% of the ingredients needed you already have in your home.I recommend this book for anyone who has kids and likes to learn fun interesting science trivia."
10,1846680441,http://goodreads.com/user/show/921981-ria,5,"A wonderful book written in the same vein as the other titles in the New scientist series. But this is done with a difference, this volume is aimed at encouraging readers to actually try out the theories and experiments at home so in a lot of cases some of the things put forward HAS been covered in some of the other books but have been slightly adapted for people to try in their own homes.Broken down into handy sections of the kitchen, the study, things to do in the garden etc this book has something for everyone and is just as enjoyable as the other titles available and through these with a minimal knowledge of science and its associated branches I really do feel that I have learned a little more than I knew before reading them.Well worth a read and there is something for everyone and as stated this book has a lot of practical things for kids and adults to try out."
11,1846680441,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5482899-reds-reads,4,"This book is from the same team that produced 'Does Anything Eat Wasps' and others, collections of readers questions featured in New Scientist magazine together with answers. It describes various experiments that can be done at home that answer some of these questions, or just illustrate them in an amusing or ingenious way. An awful lot of them seem to feature alcohol and/or fizzy drinks.It was an entertaining read - informative and humorous - and has left me with a real desire to see just what happens when you add Mentos to a bottle of coke."
12,1846680441,http://goodreads.com/user/show/17358486-rachel,3,Although some of the experiments were interesting I didn’t really feel myself wanting to rush out and try them. The back ground information associated with each of the different experiments and how they turn out and why is the part I found more interesting. It definitely didn’t hold my interest in the same way other New Scientist books like ‘Why Don’t Penguins Feet Freeze’ and ‘Do Polar Bears Ever Get Lonely’. The main redeeming feature was the shortness of each of the sections meaning it could be picked up and put down quickly and easily without losing the flow of reading.
13,1846680441,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6192290-shahrun,4,"This book is brilliant! It had me amazed, laughing and educated my little brain. Pretty winning combination if you ask me! Next step is to try out some of the experiments! Oh and buy another copy of this book for my uncle (it was supposed to be his birthday present), because I need to keep this copy for future reference. Note to Readers of Does Anything Eat Wasps & Why Don't Penguin's Feet Freeze - there is some repetition of subject matter (I just skimmed over those bits), so it may get boring to read them all consecutively. "
14,1846680441,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2255429-beth,3,"I bought this book mostly for the title experiment, but it's not so much an experiment as just finding the right conditions to prevent the dead hamster from being disturbed/eaten/destroyed and letting it sit for a long time. I thought there might be more to it than that. However, this book does tell you how to culture your own DNA using items commonly found in the household and how to measure the speed of light using chocolate. "
15,1846680441,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5009370-saurio-saurio,4,"Un libro interesante y con experimentos divertidos. Lástima que la traducción al castellano tiene algunas palabras de uso común en España pero extrañas en Argentina y uno tiene que deducir qué corno necesita para hacer la experiencia, pero, bue, es lo de menos.Ideal para enchastrar la cocina y desordenar el garage un sábado lluvioso con el hijo (o la hija o los plurales de ambos) de uno."
16,1846680441,http://goodreads.com/user/show/194779-ginnz,5,Excellent. Loved every second of this book and it gives you experiements to do (as well as explains what happens and why) so I cant wait to try some of thses out.Fossilising a hamster will take some organising tho!
17,1846680441,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5070433-laura-gilfillan,0,"Somewhat witty, somewhat interesting experiments, some of which could be done at home. Except for fossilizing your hamster, which would take more time than most of us have. Experiments followed by explanations for why things are the way they are."
18,1846680441,http://goodreads.com/user/show/19440745-steve-clark,4,"A book of experiments you can do at home. I haven't tried many of them yet, but some look like fun to do with the kids. They explain the science, but in some cases the phenomena have not been fully understood by science yet. Enjoyable to just read too"
19,1846680441,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1390321-kate,4,Great read! Many hands-on science experiments about every day things. My favorite experiment: measuring the speed of light using a chocolate bar and your microwave. Awesome! 
20,1846680441,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2711209-nikos-skantzos,5,It's about how much fun science can be. It doesn't take sophisticated devices to see the most spectacular phenomena.

25,1846680441,http://goodreads.com/user/show/17712551-maddie,4,There are some great experiments here that are well worth trying. Has the same sense of fun that Horrible History/ Horrible Science had but for grown ups.

28,1846680441,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5966790-xanthi,2,A book about home science experiments. I found myself slogging through parts of this book. Not quite as entertaining as I was hoping it would be.
