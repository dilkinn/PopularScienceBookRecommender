0,067973337X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/81564-sarah,5,"Wow.When I joined Goodreads a few months back, I set two rules for myself: first, to review books as I read or re-read them, and second, to be sparing with my ratings. I've not given any book five stars this summer. This is the first.Weiner won the Pulitzer for general non-fiction with this book in 1995. He utterly deserves it. While it's not difficult to find an interesting non-fiction book, and not too hard to find a truly gifted writer (the market's competitive like that), finding someone who discusses science with such evocative, expressive language is a rarity. Neither too dry nor too familiar, Weiner's writing is as wonderful as his subject matter.Rosemary and Peter Grant are two evolutionary biologists who did what no one had attempted to do before: beginning in the early 70's, they studied, measured, and documented every detail of the finches on Daphne Major, one of the Galapagos islands, in an effort to determine if evolutionary changes could be observed over a span of decades instead of eons. Amazingly, they succeeded far beyond their expectations: selection does not occur at the glacial pace Darwin envisioned, but at a flickering rate measurable over years, seasons, and days. The smallest differences -- so small that no one had thought them worthy of study prior to the Grants -- have an effect so profound on a population that it's literally visible to the naked eye.A fabulous description of the dedication, tedium, and sheer amount of number-crunching involved in field research, Weiner talks to many of the biologists inspired by the Grants: those studying fish, insects, and viruses -- those gathering data that Darwin never thought possible to observe in the span of a single human lifetime."

Having read them before, you know what is in-store.The book is about evolution, and so about Darwin, natural selection and survival of the fittest. Its central focus is a study of finches on Daphne Major, an island of the Galapagos archipelago. Ancestors of the finches studied were collected by Darwin on the HMS Beagle journey to the islands in September and October 1835. The study was led by Peter and Rosemary Grant, began in 1973 and had been in progress for almost two decades when the book came out, in 1994. Thirteen species of finches have been studied, studied meticulously. Body measurements, food and water availability, weather conditions, breeding habits and their song—all were noted. Every bird is measured and tagged. Every bird is recognizable by Peter and Rosemary, and there are a lot of birds these two have kept track of! The study is large! The statistics have been crunched and analyzed in sophisticated computer programs at Princeton. The effort and time and work devoted is impressive, yet the author’s manner of excessively praising the Grants is out of place. Other field studies are spoken of too. Studies of sticklebacks and guppies are two which I found interesting. I would have appreciated more such studies. They are concisely handled. The book emphasizes the speed with which natural selection  can take place. Five times our biosphere has been in a period of such rapid change as that we are experiencing now.The book needs a better layout and organization. I prefer the rigor of scientific analysis. I am not looking for lyricism in a book such as this. The book is repetitive. Had it been properly edited and tightened it would be half its length.The book ends on a philosophical note warning of the consequences of increased gas emissions and global warming. Victor Bevine narrates the audiobook. He is not hard to understand but I could have done without his dramatization. His impersonation of Darwin was ridiculous. I have given the narration two stars. The basic problem is that there is really nothing new or outstanding presented. I would have preferred simply a clear, concise presentation of the field studies and what each showed, without excessive padding and repetition."
2,067973337X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1257629-karl-o,4,"I'm ashamed to say that I didn’t know until recently (after reading Dawkins’ magnificent book The Ancestor’s Tale) that evolution can in fact be observed happening in real time and not only in as short a time as centuries, but also in decades and even years. In that book, Dawkins spoke about Rosemary and Peter Grant in relation to their work on the Galapagos Islands on Darwin’s finches and how they showed the role of evolution in explaining the immense diversity of life. I tried to find a book on the subject and came across this one, which was also mentioned in the Bibliography of The Ancestor’s Tale. First, there is a thing that I didn’t appreciate much in this book, and that is the style in which it was written. Scientific books with journalistic and literary tones annoy and distract me a lot and if it were not for that, this book would have easily earned a perfect 5 star. It is unique and intelligent, written sometimes with beautiful Dawkinsesque prose about the elegance and magnificence of evolution with beautiful allusion to the Judeo-Christian myths in a manner that didn’t suggest supernatural elements which can sometimes be imprudently used in scientific books. I actually quite liked that since I happen to find the Judeo-Christian myths of creation beautiful. The Beak of the Finch had some very interesting ideas about the different paths evolution follows under different circumstances, such as when a species is being subjected to opposing selection forces by both sexual and natural selections, or when droughts and floods occur in successions. Also, one of the most interesting ideas was the fact that when zooming-in on the evolutionary history, the transition is often jagged and goes back and forth on the same or different paths. Another powerful idea was speciation and how it occurs without necessarily being always caused by geographical isolation. It only suffices that certain members of a species adapt to a different lifestyle from that of the others while living in the same environment, and given enough time the two groups can diverge to form different species following different lifestyles. And finally, demonstrating the role of hybridization in speciation was really interesting and informative.The Beak of the Finch is not as much focused on finches as its title suggests. In fact, the author believes that the finch's beak can be used to symbolize evolution itself, given the powerful insights it gave the scientists who studied it since decades, and most importantly its historical significance because of Darwins' visit to the Galapagos. It is a delightful idea and symbol.Evolution is indeed a fascinating and important topic and this book clearly shows how it is happening all around us. We like to think that it happened a long time ago and long stretches of time are needed for its latest effects to surface. Weiner shows how this is not always the case and how evolution can proceed with varying speeds under different conditions. He shows the extent of the effects of our actions on the evolution of almost all the species around us including of course our own. It is nice to remember that Heraclitus was right in saying that everything flows, which is not only true as regards the atoms of our bodies which are being replaced as I write these words, but also in relation to the changes that our species undergo as long as we have enough time, wisdom, and chance to be here."

5,067973337X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10770371-dan,5,"A woodpecker finch becomes possible only on an island without a woodpecker, a warbler finch only without a warbler. A flower-browsing finch becomes possible where there are no bees and hummingbirds—and on islands where bees have now invaded, many of Darwin’s finches have given back the flowers.The Beak of the Finch by Jonathan Weiner won the Pulitzer Prize for Non Fiction in 1995. This book gets high marks as an homage to Darwin. it follows a husband and wife’s two decade long biological survey of finches beginning in the 1970s on a remote and tiny volcanic island, Daphne Major, in the Galapagos. The study on Daphne Major was a first as it tracked natural selection in near real time by measuring every finch’s beak and other physical characteristics. The living laboratory was in effect a closed system. There are only a handful of plants and seeds so the scientists knew which seeds each species of finch ate. They saw which species of finch were more likely to survive during droughts and which finches thrived during the wet years. They used a lot of data to exploit the minute differences of beak length and width from one generation to the next. This was all possible because the finches have no fear of humans and have no predators or competition other than finches.There is discussion of cross species breeding which is more common than scientists once realized, of adaptive radiation where a single species diverges into two species, competition between birds and bees and a whole host of evolutionary topics.The scientific content in this book is a full five stars. The writing style is breezy, for a science book, and at least four stars. The big picture focus and interpretability is a full five stars. The organization could have been a little better and the book is a little too long for its message, my only criticisms. 4.5 stars. There aren’t that many science books written for a general audience that are this thought provoking and well researched and interpreted. Some of the credit should go to the Grants of course — the couple who ran this first study of its kind. "
6,067973337X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/16092014-paul,4,"As Jonathan Weiner points out in this classic of science writing, the word ""evolution"" comes from the Latin word for unfolding, rolling out like a scroll.That's an appropriate concept for this book, which unfurls before the reader an impressive array of late-20th-century scientific research into natural selection, sexual selection and speciation – all of it hammering home again and again: Not only was Darwin right, he was righter than he knew.As the book's title implies, Weiner focuses on Darwin's finches, the baker's dozen of Galapagos species whose beaks so aptly tell the tale of adaptation and selection. But he doesn't stop there. Weiner shows us sticklebacks in British Columbia, fruit flies in labs all over the world, guppies in Venezuela, moth DNA in Ontario, and numerous other animals in numerous other places where scientists are observing evolution occur in front of their faces – a process much faster and more powerful than Darwin could have dreamed.What is most remarkable, however, is that this book was published in 1994, yet it remains deeply relevant. Weiner was arguably 15 years ahead of his time in describing the threat of bacteria that evolve resistance to antibiotics, and his description of evolution sparked by global warming and other human-caused processes now seems almost quaint in its cautious notes of alarm. He describes cactus finches that mutilate and sterilize the very plants on which they rely for their existence, imperiling themselves and their species so they can get at the cactus nectar a few hours earlier than the others. The tragedy of the commons is not just a human one; as it turns out, the individual selfishness that makes evolution (and capitalism, not to put too fine a point on it) work collectively can backfire on birds, too.Weiner's main argument is that evolution for more than a century was criticized by advocates and opponents alike for being mainly theoretical or logical; it couldn't be observed, couldn't be tested, couldn't be proven. Therefore, it wasn't ""real science."" Peter and Rosemary Grant's 30-plus years of work with the Galapagos finches have put to rest that argument once and for all, Weiner argues. Evolution by variation and natural selection can be observed, and it has been. It can be successfully tested, and it has been. Not only a logical extrapolation of the fossil record and the selection imposed on pigeons and dogs by breeders, Darwinian evolution is in fact scientifically sound and much stronger a force than even its proponents realized. Evolution is a not a river of sludge, moving so slowly you can't notice except through conjecture. Rather, it is a swift-moving current, a series of waves battering a coastline, and we – humans, other animals, plants –are pulled and pushed by the water moving in and out.That said, Weiner seems to want to make an additional argument. He sprinkles the book with quotes from and allusions to the Bible. He sets up some prominent creationists as foils for the Grants' work. He gets some comments from the scientists he interviews about their interactions with creationists. Several chapters reference creation, metaphysics and God. But in the end, Weiner can't seem to get onto the page whatever it is he wants to say about the perceived conflict between science and faith. He worries at it like a dog with a bone, but he never sinks his teeth into it. The string is left untied, like a line of data with the final numbers erased.Nevertheless, Weiner has written a monumentally helpful book, one that could easily be considered a sequel to Darwin's classic On the Origin of Species, so well does Weiner explicate and demonstrate Darwin's theory. I'll be recommending this to anyone interested in learning more about what evolution is and whether it's real."
7,067973337X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1762558-amanda,4,"This was a really interesting look into the constant evolution of finches in the Galapagos. Parts of it were a little slow (and I definitely got bogged down by the constant repetition of ""beak"" and ""finch,"" though that probably couldn't be helped, given the subject), but other parts were very interesting. The writing was also very good. My least favorite part was the last few chapters when the author got away from finches and switched to humans. I can see why he would do it because it's interesting to think about human evolution through the lens of finches, but it seemed like a weird transition to me. Overall, this was pretty quick and interesting to read, even if I probably won't ever need to know anything about finches again."
8,067973337X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/25371127-rossdavidh,4,"The finches of the Galapogos Islands rank right up there with Newton's apple and Galileo's telescope in the iconography of science, and like them, are as much fiction now as fact. There is a great deal of accumulated storytelling around the nugget of truth about Darwin's finches. While they did influence Darwin's thinking, they were just one of many, many species (or groups of species) to do so, and his notes do not reveal them to have been any sort of trigger for a Eureka moment. To give just one example, Darwin's long association with pigeon fanciers was at least as influential on his thinking. The Galapogos finches are, however, a great illustration of how evolution does and doesn't work, and in recent decades they have come in for almost unparalleled scrutiny. The primary reason why, is a married couple named Peter and Rosemary Grant.The Grants, and their many colleagues and especially graduate students over the decades, have studied the several related finch species of the Galapogos Islands, down to the individual bird. They measure beak dimensions, reproductive success, parentage, wing length, coloration, etc. etc. They repeat this for bird after bird, on a particular islet (small even by Galapogos standards), until they have measured (and banded) virtually every single bird. They repeat this year after year. It was already, in the early 1990's when this book was written, enough to show something that most scholars of evolution in the decades after Darwin had assumed could not be seen: evolution in progress.Because they are relatively new to the islands (in evolutionary terms), and because periodic El Nino and La Nina events shove the islands' climate from dry to wet and back again over the years, the finches of the Galapogos are by no means evidence of the much-cited ""delicate balance of nature"". They are, in a sense, perpetually unbalanced, and traits like beak length (which impacts what kind of food they are able to eat, and how efficiently they can do it) show trends visible over the course of a decade or less.Well, visible if you study it in as much detail as the Grants do; the changes are sometimes measured in tenths of millimeters over the course of a year.But, how can we know that these changes have anything to do with natural selection? What if it is simply a difference in diet (owing to differences in how much rain falls), causing the birds to grow either larger or smaller beaks? To know that, you would need to keep a ridiculously vast and detailed family tree of all the finches of the tiny islet that the Grants have made their particular object of study. Fortunately, that is just what the Grants did. They know what birds had great reproductive success, and what birds did not, and how many offspring they all left behind, and how much reproductive success those offspring have had.The book has several dozen illustrations, some taken from Darwin's original books, and some by the Grants' daughter, Thalia, who appears to be a quite talented artist. I especially liked the ones by Thalia Grant of a finch taking a ride on a Galapogos tortoise, and a finch hunting flies on an iguana. The tortoise and iguana, both much larger than the respective finches which perch atop them, appear to take little notice of it, as if bird and reptile are living in entirely different timescales.Jonathan Weiner does a great job of showing us both the day-to-day efforts required to collect this data, and the year-to-year and decade-to-decade progress of the Grants in collecting it. He can effectively communicate something as abstract as an evolutionary fitness landscape, and how drought and flood can push the species of Galapogos finches around it. It was a fascinating, yet oddly effortless read, as concepts that were mind-bending to 19th century scientists can get communicated to someone like me, who has no professional background in the field. This kind of thing doesn't just happen accidentally; Weiner must have worked hard at making it that easy for us. Rarely has learning been so thoughtfully and skillfully provided to the reader, it would be a shame to pass it up."
9,067973337X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/13298726-michael-perkins,5,nice little film to go with this book....https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcM23...
10,067973337X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7816541-john,2,"A cripplingly tedious account of cripplingly tedious field work that tends to confirm things that you thought were totally obvious. For most people with a high school education, natural selection, at the level depicted in the book, is pure common sense. Environmental pressures favor the survival/fecundity of certain phenotypes that then tend to displace others. Sexual preference, adaptive behaviors, and cross-breeding affect this in several ways and, if the pressures are extreme, the changes can come fast. The selective process can move in many directions and can recede altogether with the arrival and departure of such pressures. You can write the whole substance of it on the back of an index card. However, the book invites you experience every trial and tribulation of the marooned Galapagian finches and of the pathetic scientists who waste their lives watching and measuring them. Predictable things happen in predictable ways. You are along for the ride. You could have read something else, but the reviews were so good you convince yourself that the book just HAS to get better soon. There are efforts made to spice up the narrative--the scientists heroically tell droll jokes in the face of unimaginable boredom, the finches are induced to enjoy inter-species necrophiliatic intercourse with decapitated bird cadavers—but no indulgence in humor or kinky sexcapades can make the finches very interesting. The book gradually runs natural selection down and pounds it relentlessly into the guano-encrusted tuff of Daphne Major. However, mere natural selection does not alone give you ""evolution."" The book only dabbles in the critical issue of speciation. It always refers to phenotypically distinct finch groups that tend not to interbreed as ""species,"" but, amazingly, the book never attempts a formal definition of ""species"" and does little more than offer conversations amongst the forlorn scientists that the finch varieties indeed really just have to be separate species despite noisome interbreeding and whatnot. This could have been the interesting part—the critical part—where durable evolutionary divergence happens. Leave it to the finches to start interbreeding and melting back toward a single type. The book actually comes alive when it ditches the finches in favor of something (anything) else. Sadly, this happens in the final quarter, when you are also told of other things you already knew from high school and a few thing you might not have known (a real treat) and this happens at an intelligent pace (another treat). Then, to tie up the book, the author indulges in some big picture/philosophical treatments that are too repetitive and uneven to be very satisfying.Don't get me wrong, the book is very ""well-written"" in a mechanical sense. Truly artful biblical references and adroit and soothing language serve to dull the reader's suffering as the pages slowly go by. Even so, I have never hated the experience of a non-fiction work as much as this. I feel stupid for having finished it. I now hate ""Darwin’s finches"" and their vicissitudinous, environmentally selected beaks. What a waste of my time. I find myself hoping they soon go extinct and that the circumstances and causes of their extinction pass unobserved and unknowable.So, why do people like this tome? (1) Some readers may be surprised to discover what natural selection is, having neither any education nor imagination that would have previously acquainted them with the idea. (2) The book strives to support the theory of evolution, which many people reject for irrational or unscientific reasons. Many readers need to be associated with the smart crowd who like evolution and ""liking"" this book reaffirms their participation in that smart group and further assures them they are totally unlike the other group, who instead intensely dislike the book for analogous reasons.(3) They are, or are related to, one of the scientists whose tragic sacrifice on the altar of pointless empiricism is depicted in this heart-wrenching monument to wasted lives. --Recommended for scientifically inclined boys of middling intellect, aged 12 to 16 years.

11,067973337X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/16275106-pamela,5,"In 1973 Rosemary and Peter Grant went to the Galapagos Islands to take a look at Darwin's finches. The two Princeton evolutionary biologists went to study the finches at first hand on Daphne Major, an even more isolated island in the middle of the Archipelago. These famous finches are the ones that Charles Darwin encountered during his voyage on the HMS Beagle and which inspired his ideas on evolution. The Grants went to see if they could observe evolution in action as they felt that even Darwin did not completely understand his own theory and the evolutionary process was not always the slow and gradual one he believed it to be. They have been watching these finches ever since. What they have found is proof of evolution in action observable within the single life of a finch or taking place in just a few years.The Beak of the Finch: A Story of Evolution in Our Time is the story of how they did all this. In the approximately 30 years that the Grant's and their various assistants have been watching, these tiny birds have shown a remarkable ability to quickly adapt to changes in the environment, climate, and other pressures that nature puts in their path. The story here is absolutely an incredible one, told in exceptionally readable language. In addition to the finches, the author goes on to discuss other theories that came out of this work. Some of their former students went on to do their own experiments on hereditability, adaptation, hybridization in nature, bacterial resistance and resistance to pesticides. This is a book that should fascinate anyone with even a small interest in the natural sciences or just an appreciation of the diversity and wonder of this world we live in. "
12,067973337X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/14431535-sarah,4,"The Beak of the Finch is an excellent introduction to contemporary evolutionary theory. There was quite a lot of detail about studies into the Galapagos finches, which was great! The finches & how quickly they are evolving is super interesting. I also have a new found appreciation for the lengths that ecologists go to for their field work. I think that this book struck a nice balance between hard science, human interest, history and philosophy. It is nice to learn a bit about the scientists' lives, while still having the book firmly focused on their scientific achievements."
13,067973337X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/72907701-dax,3,"Good book. I found just about every chapter interesting, but my attention would wane by the end of each chapter.

14,067973337X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2220787-ram,3,"A description of evolution research and results mostly in the Galapagos Island and mostly on the famous ""Darwin Finches"" with references to the research that Darwin himself conducted and the (wrong and right) conclusions that he came to.It seems that I have read so many books about Darwin's ""On the Origin of Species"" and so many books that refer to ""On the Origin of Species"" that it is about time I read ""On the Origin of Species""…… To some extent, it is like the Bible, I prefer to read references, books about and interpretations of the Bible than reading the book itself……. Hmmmm….. Interesting and significant comparison……..In many levels.The book itself gave various examples where we (i.e. researchers) can see evolution happening in our lifetime and less.We are introduced to the research done by the Peter Raymond Grant and Barbara Rosemary Grant, a British couple, who studied finches for over 20 years , mostly in one secluded Galapagos Island named Daphne Major,. The finch population in this island is small enough so that the researchers could track and record practically each individual bird from birth to death, but large enough to have diversity with thirteen species of finches. Five of these are tree finch, one warbler finch, one vegetarian finch, and six species of ground finch. The Weather of this Island is extreme, with some dry years and some especially wet years. The effect of the weather on the population size, behavior , size of beak and other parameters, clearly showed natural selection even in very few generations.Except for the work of the Grants, the book discusses other similar researches and conclusions, and how the result of these researches coexist with the way Darwin saw things as reflected in his books.I admit that I found the book a bit garbled. The examples that were given, were convincing but in my humble opinion , I have seen more convincing examples in many other book like The Song of the Dodo: Island Biogeography in an Age of Extinctions or Why Evolution Is TrueOr many of  Richard Dawkins books.My mind may be saturated from so many evolution books or this book may be out dated or just not well written, but I did find it boring and over detailed at some points."
15,067973337X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7278262-sher,5,"Extraordinary. This work expands upon the two biographies I read recently about Charles Darwin and evolution. Weiner is a fantastic writer. He takes a science subject and makes it understandable and then at the end of science-sections he inserts beautiful almost poetic prose that makes you sigh. The setting is a tiny island called Daphne Major in the Galapago Islands, and the work is about a 21 year finch study conducted by Rosemary and Peter Grant. The Grants have proven that evolution can happen quickly, and that pressure makes species evolve. Interspersed are passages from Darwin's works and also summaries of his thoughts. It's also explained where Darwin's work is incomplete. Other studies are also detailed that deal with different species such as moths and guppies. I had a lot of questions as I read the book, and pretty much all of them were answered by the time I got to the end. Questions like how do pesticides and antibiotics make creatures evolve, and why don't humans show the variations that Daphne Major finches do? How did consciousness evolve? Well, that question isn't answered, but it is addressed. I leave this work looking forward to reading some of Weiner's other works, and I am wondering how species will evolve in response to the pressures of climate change. Plus, can bees evolve and save themselves? Some scientists recommend this route (recent edition of National Geographic) talks about this- though others worry they will go extinct before they can evolve to be mite and pesticide resistant. So much to think about in this book- timely!"

Brilliant and accessible to readers without any special scientific background, patient and uncondescending toward creationists (though firmly dismissing creationist claims), it made for the perfect accompaniment to my recent Galapagos island trip. You will also learn more about — and enjoy learning more about — finches, and El Niños, and the Humboldt current, and Darwinian angst than you ever thought possible."
17,067973337X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5928145-jennifer-glass,0,"Lots of people I know rave about this book, but my feeling was…. Zzzzzzzz (snore). Unless you are an avid bird-enthusiast, this book feels very repetitive, and overly complimentary to the Grants, almost as if it were an advertisement for their work. They are wonderful people (I met them recently when they came to my university to give a talk) but if Jonathon Weiner spent so much time with them, didn’t he observe anything less flattering? That would have made them seem more normal and less saintly and….blah. Wasn’t Rosemary ever jealous or upset that Peter got all the credit for what was half her research? Didn’t she ever want to become a professor, too? She didn’t directly address this during the luncheon I went to during their visit, but I was tempted to ask (I didn’t). I wish Jonathon Weiner had included tension in the book, it would have made it infinitely more interesting. And the final doomsday chapters (species destruction, antibiotic resistance, global warming etc etc.) felt very cliche. Guess it was written in the mid-1990s when we all hadn't heard quite so much about these topics but these days.... yawn."
18,067973337X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/180908-tatiana,4,"This book is really important. The study of how micro-evolution happens from one year to the next to the next in the Galapagos gave me a lot of insight into how the environment shapes species. Traits are constantly changing, yet the graph jitters back and forth around some more-or-less average value. It's really not average, though, because climate, rainfall, etc. are all fundamentally chaotic systems. Organisms tend to track generation by generation the conditions as they fall out. Over geologic time that can either result in vast changes or effective stasis, depending on the situation. It's cool to picture how macro-evolution happens as a result of thousands of years of micro-evolution."
19,067973337X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/43087013-rachel,5,"It took me awhile to read this, simply because I was working a ton in June and this is not a reflection on the book. I loved this - it was mind blowing, eye opening, engaging, and informative. I would like to go read everything Peter & Rosemary Grant have ever written, and also go read Origin of the Species (again). The complex interactions that rule the world and the Galapagos were explained in detail and examples, which I found to be really helpful. I really enjoyed reading about the boom/bust of rain/drought and how that influenced finches to eat everything (rainy season) or very particular food items they are adapted for (drought), and how that further pushed/pulled the species closer or apart. I have always wanted to go to the Galapagos and this only added onto that desire. Maybe someday I'll get there - hopefully as a scientist, but if not that then as a visitor will work for me too. "
20,067973337X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/12549193-ben,5,"This is a masterpiece of accessible science writing. Oftentimes, scientific people don't understand just how dumb non-scientific people are, but Jonathan Weiner does. Without being condescending, he explains why evolution is accessible knowledge and important to understand. Loosely following the decades-long study of Galapagos finches by Peter and Rosemary Grant, this book explains evolution in real time with the help of real people. I've always been frustrated by some of the gaps in evolutionary theory - or at least as my nonscientific and unlettered mind perceives them. For example, what would consciousness be naturally selected for in humans? Why would constantly worrying about something you said to someone you barely know be selected for? After having a child and watching a newborn grow, why would our children be so monumentally helpless and unpredictable? At the same time, it's always seemed to me that humans have lived a particularly charmed evolutionary existence - walking upright, thumbs, language, brains that are far more developed that any other animal. The size of the Galapagos finches' beaks ebbs and flows depending on the seeds that are available due to the amount of rain, and that's fascinating, but humans write books about this stuff so it's not like all species are evolved at the same rate. This book addresses those questions with theories and examples and a life-affirming gentleness. The final pages of the book are beautifully written, as well, and give a fitting conclusion to such a deftly written book.I'd encourage you to read the book if you are perplexed by these issues because without spoiling anything, there are a lot of factors in natural selection dynamics that you probably aren't considering. The science in the middle of the book lost me for a few dozen pages, but the last one hundred tie everything together. Particularly convincing were the chapters on pesticides and antibiotics - which show evolution in spooky real time. Read this book and I promise that you'll have plenty to say the next time the dreaded topic of science comes up in conversation. Fantastic book!"
21,067973337X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1730247-stephen,5,"This would be on my short list of best science books. Thrilling fieldwork. Especially poignant this month that we commemorate the 200th anniversary of Charles Darwin’s birth, and the 150th anniversary of the publication of his “The Origin of the Species.” Weiner’s book details the study of Darwin’s finches by Princeton evolutionary biologists: Peter and Rosemary Grant. The Grants monitored every single finch on the island of Daphne Major in the Galápagos Islands over more than two decades. They recorded and made detailed measurements of every single bird and its offspring, generation after generation. Charles Darwin himself would have loved this book even though it proved part of his treatise wrong. Evolution is not a slow methodical process, requiring thousands of years to nuance changes in species. It can move much faster. And is observable from season to season dependent on the whims of the surrounding environment. As Darwin surmised (and the Grants demonstrate how) the numerous finch species that live isolated on these tiny islands all emerged from only one mainland species. If you are a naturalist and you asked me to recommend just one book, it would probably be this one because it dramatically illustrates just how dynamic nature truly is. Great story, told well. "
22,067973337X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5946093-bill,5,"Let's start here: Someone really should invent a new word. Evolution, like gravity, is fact. It's far beyond theory status, as most people seem to use and understand the word. And dammit; it's not something you ""believe"" in (that would be like saying you believe in dirt). If you refuse to see that, you have an issue. You are somehow invested in believing something patently untrue. Why could that be?Dunno...it is completely baffling to me.This book ranks with McCullough's John Adams and Shirer's Rise and Fall of the Third Reich in my list of non-fiction favorites. Clearly written, fascinating, enjoyable, clear, focused and concise, directed toward the layman but backed up with real science, verifiable facts and an ultimately undeniable thesis make for a book that should be required reading for everyone (it will be for my kids).The book seems to lose some steam towards the end as the author tries to make some larger points. In general, he's probably more or less on the mark, but perhaps he strays too much from his main topic and expands too quickly points which may seem obvious to some but are more questionable to others. Other than that, it's nearly perfect in its scope and tone.Highly, highly recommended...if you haven't read it yet, seeing that it was published in 1994."
23,067973337X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/309689-lara,4,"3.5 stars. Really interesting and very well narrated, but I will admit I got reeeally sick of hearing, ""natural selection scrutinizes daily and hourly..."" First of all, natural selection is not a dude with a magnifying glass. And second of all, soooooo repetitious! He said it about seven or eight times in the first fourth or so of the book. Too much! Finally on the third time, he at least added ""metaphorically,"" which made me feel a little better. But still. It annoyed me.Other that that, it's a good book, though I didn't think it was amazing. I found the last fourth or so especially interesting though, where Weiner talks more about how natural selection effects us today, and how it might effect us in the future, and isn't something that only applies to the past. We are hearing more and more about how there are various antibiotic-resistant strains of bacteria and pesticide-resistant bugs around these days, so the examples of that were really pretty fascinating (and scary). Anyway, I enjoyed it, but am not convinced it was Pulitzer Prize-worthy. But then, it's the rare Pulitzer Prize winner that I do enjoy or am even interested in, so, as I have stated many a time, I may just have poor taste. Ah well."
24,067973337X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2587129-cathy,4,"In this book Jonathan Weiner shows us that natural selection is neither rare nor slow: it is taking place by the hour, and we can watch. If this notion thrills you, you will love this book. It's not just about finches, either; it's about all kinds of animals, and -- yay! -- humans, too. Weiner puts the microscope on enterobacteria in the human gut as they react to antibiotics, and he puts the lens on the Heliothis moth as it evolves to resist pesticides in the cotton fields. Finally, he zooms back to show us that planet Earth is our Daphne Major, and that the variable human mind is our beak. You do have to wade through a few data-heavy sections that feel a bit like a doctoral thesis, but most of the writing is stunning: original, poetic, and absolutely dazzling."

30,067973337X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5862443-joseph-stieb,3,"This book started off interesting for me, but I got less enthused by about the midway point. The central point of the book is that evolution can happen much faster than Darwin ever thought. Weiner profiles the Grants, two esteemed biologists who spent their entire careers studying the Galapagos finches in incredible depth. A few big insights emerged that I thought were interesting. In a dry year, finches with big beaks survived with the advantage of being able to crack large nuts in a time of scarcity. However, all young finches have soft beaks that can't crack large nuts, but if you are a young, large beaked finch, you have to eat more but your tool doesn't work yet. Thus, not all finches became large beaked because, although once you as a large beaked finch made it to adulthood you were golden, you were more vulnerable as a juvenile. There were a lot of cool insights into variation and flux in species like this.This is a fairly cool book for understanding how evolutionary biologists have built on but also corrected/expanded Darwin's particular views on evolution. However, after this point, the book started going into overwhelming detail on speciation, hybridization, and Nino cycles, and it was harder to retain all the information. I got kind of confused about speciation: Weiner stresses that species can diverge from a single type rapidly, but they could still breed with each other...? I thought the point of speciation was that eventually they can't interbreed or produce sterile offspring. Overall, I think I like evolution books that relate more closely to human beings (like Franz de Waal's books) than this one, which was just a little too much about birds and bugs to keep me engaged."
31,067973337X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/565363-mark,5,"Should you read this book? Absolutely, no doubt, no matter who you are and here’s why. It’s about evolution and the scientific method – both of which cannot be denied but are. A brief story … I once got into an argument with an Evangelical Born Again Christian about something, I don’t remember what, but I do remember I invoked radio-carbon dating and she came back with something of the sort: “That’s a hoax! It’s simply not true – they made it up!” Upon which I asked her if she understood what the scientific method was. Whereupon her husband came to her rescue, came between us, shooing her away, and accused me of “browbeating” her. These types of encounters should not happen, not in the USA. This book should be required reading and study in all high schools, all across America. It makes evolution and the scientific method easy to understand. It is a great story and it’s true! It’s the story of evolution on the Galápagos archipelago, via the study of Darwin’s finches by a team of scientists led by Peter and Rosemary Grant of Princeton University. It covers twenty years, the study (1973-93); and is ongoing still. The finches are famous! AND – it’s written like a thriller.Me – I don’t need to be convinced – I’ve been an evolutionist since my first Anthropology class, back in ’68, “Beginnings Of Mankind.” I was an Evolutionary Psychologist before the words joined and evolved into a new Field of study. I was a Sociobiologist before E.O Wilson wrote Sociobiology: The New Synthesis, and the newly evolved human females became feminists, and wanted Edward Wilson tarred and feathered. Ha! But enough about me.Like I and others have said – the book reads like a thriller. ‘Oh my god! The big flood! What will happen to the birds? Oh my god! Not a drop of rain for over a year! What will happen to the birds?’ By the way, the book won a Pulitzer. It’s even got pictures! Sketches by Darwin himself and the Grants’ daughter, Thalia Grant — beautiful. That’s part of The Method – methodical observation and documentation. And measurement, down to fractions of millimeters, over time, over years and years. (You can see evolution happen!) And study and analysis, and repetition. Did I say how thrilling it is? And you learn things, not only about finches (a finch can live for fifteen years.); but about yourself as well, the most dominant of species to inhabit the earth. Did you know, “A single wipe of toilet paper comes away with as many as two trillion individuals of the Bacteroides species, twenty billion individual enterobacteria, and dozens of other species that have never been named by science.” (pg. 258) Did you know, “ … people are trying to ban the teaching of evolution while their own cotton crops are failing because of evolution.”? (pg. 255)What would you say if I said I think that the very process, evolution, might help explain why the Paradoxical Intervention can work in psychotherapy, when going directly at the problem will fail. What about how struggle leads to variation and Easy Street to fusion, and fusion can lead to extinction. Stress can be a good thing. It’s true! Cooperation isn’t always a good thing. It’s true! Sometimes misfits save the day! Sometimes separation and isolation are a good thing. Sometimes being picky is a very, very, very good thing. And on and on it goes – the learning and the thinking – the evolving of adaptations, the tools that change the world. Darwin wrote life was a, “web of complex relations,” —the slightest change, the smallest variation having profound effects, the difference between life and death. Not all that dissimilar from Tolstoy’s “coincidence of circumstance,” or DeLillo’s “infinite regression,” or Wallace’s “permutations of complications.”Upon reading this book, in the winter of 2015, I thought … maybe there’s another mechanism of evolution besides natural and sexual selection? I’ll call it “un-natural selection” and it’s unique to Homo sapiens, thinking man, or the species that became aware of itself. Self-conscious. For better or worse. Unnatural selection is homicide. It is what the terror group ISIS practices. I have argued that natural selection is no longer a relevant mechanism in the new, flat, fused, technologically advanced modern world, which that then only allows for sexual selection as a mechanism driving human variation. But now, along comes ISIS and their ilk, who now practice homicide as a way to advance change. If you don’t merge, fuse with them, they will kill you and steal your children, rape your women; and teach them, the children, (cultural evolution) to be like them—killers. If you/they can’t stomach it – they’ll kill you and your genes. If your offspring can’t adapt – they’ll kill them, too. Too weepy and you’re dead. Not tough-minded enough and you’re dead. Too sensitive and you’re dead. Too open-minded and you’re dead. Evolution by unnatural selection – homicide. It’s not the first time it’s been tried. The Nazis tried it. Thought the Jew an inferior species worthy of extinction, useless. Not even good for slavery.And if that isn’t enough to convince you to read this book, consider this. Now, in the USA there seems to be yet another movement of evolutionary consequence – the decision not to mate. (See: Selfish, Sallow & Self-Absorbed: Sixteen writers on the decision not to have kids. Spinster by Kate Bolick.) Yes, the “sex chase” is expensive. It can be exhausting and full of psychological and emotional risk. Children are expensive, also. But the consequence of not engaging, of not participating is extinction of your genes, which are totally unique to you, because of the process, and perhaps just what the doctor ordered – to keep us strong and healthy, to keep us going. Perhaps your prodigy is the next Darwin, or Freud, or hero – a super hero who saves the world! I’m not sure what that says, what it means, that the self-conscious animal, our “mind the beak of the finch” (pg.287 ) — that we choose not to mate. Left in charge, having taken control, we’ve mucked it up. Read this book. You tell me – what did we do?“We are not completed as we stand, this is not our final stage.” (p.299)Winter 2015"

I started it from the airplane leaving the Galapagos. From my window I could see the harsh hat-shaped island of Daphne Major where Peter and Rosemary Grant have spent countless hours with their associates measuring every finch and every component interconnected to the lives of these small birds to watch evolution happening in front of their eyes. I appreciated both the proof that the ensuing data provides for natural selection and evolution which Darwin could only logically assume as well as the implications for how we treat the planet and plan strategies for intervention from antibiotics to species introduction.

33,067973337X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/113836486-daniel-gibbard,5,"The Beak of the Finch is an insightful tale into the evolutionary processes that shape the world around us. It focuses mostly on Darwin’s finches of the Galapagos islands, an example famously displayed in every intro-level biology textbook in the nation, and still manages to tell an intriguing story of their struggle for survival and eventual change. Spinning together a number of factors that affect the way the finches survive, this book provides a great example of the way that natural and sexual selection play a role in changing populations on the Galapagos. Filled with numerous and varied evidential examples of the fluidity and speed of evolution in the modern day, this book is a quintessential example of popular science written to be interesting and insightful.

It is a good work of storytelling that balances making the idea of evolution understandable to the general public without skimping on the science. It backs the story up with the history of evolutionary theory with major figures and backs up the evolution of finches in real time with other (relatively) modern studies that are doing similar things.

It describes the work the Grants have done (and are doing?) in the Galapagos Islands studying the 13 species of Darwin's finches that have evolved there. It also describes similar work being done by other scientists in other parts of the world with similar results. The two most important insights for me were that evolution is not unidirectional and that it is not simply something that happened millions of years ago, it is going on, perhaps faster than ever, as I write."

By providing details of observational science, natural experiments, and even controlled experiments, the author paints an accurate picture of how well-supported evolutionary thinking is. In the final sections, modern issues such as anti-biotic resistance, global warming, and creationism are addressed. I think the historical and scientific aspects are most interesting and may provide many examples for teachers looking to engage their students in conversations about the history and nature of science. "
37,067973337X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/13296223-jacob,3,"This book details a wonderful natural experiment: the evolution of the thirteen species of finches found on Daphne Major, one of the Galápagos Islands. (Full disclosure: my fantasy football team is called Darwin's Finches.) One thing the book does well is explain how Peter and Rosemary Grant, the married biologist couple who did most of the research between the 1970s and 90s, collected their data, analysed it, and reached their conclusions--great info on how science is done on the ground. However, the personal anecdotes that the author shares as he tries to put us in their shoes (such as describing their office space or what they were eating for lunch) didn't really add anything for me As the book explains, ""the island is small enough for the Grants to know all the birds, but large enough for them to get good numbers. And they've been doing it continuously since 1973! No one's ever going to do anything like it."" (19) Over the years, they tracked and tagged over 18,700 finches on the small island, recording their diets, mates, and offspring in notebooks which they fed into computer databases. One thing they found is that evolution can happen much more quickly that most people--even Darwin himself--realized. Under strong selection pressures, such as extreme droughts or rainfall, the average length of the birds beaks can change significantly in just a generation as longer or shorter beaks become more advantageous. Despite a lot of recent research showing this rapidity, many people still think of evolution as something that can't be seen in anything under millions of years. Just two days ago I watched a 2011 NOVA special in which an anthropologist said that we couldn't expect to see any human evolution happen in the mere 250 generations between Ötzi the Iceman and ourselves, an assertion that the program itself refuted by pointing out that he was lactose intolerant and the vast majority of Europeans today can process lactose as adults.I found it interesting to realize that ""Species of animals and plants look constant to us, but in reality each generation is a sort of palimpsest, a canvas that is painted over and over the by hand of natural selection, each time a little differently. (106) As Rosemary Grant points out, ""Species don't stand still. You can't 'preserve' a species."" (250) Depending on the exact environment, particular traits become ideal. As the environment shifts around, the ideal target changes to, and the prevalence of those traits in members of the species changes in predictable ways to keep the species as close to the shifting target as possible.The book presumes some familiarity with evolution but gives great explanations--with many examples--of how both natural selection and sexual selection work. The finches aren't the only animals discussed; cichlid fish (a favorite of evolutionary biologists for the ease with which they can be studied) are discussed at several points; and the later part of the book includes a chapter that Rachel Carson would have loved about pesticides and the adaptation of insects that such chemicals prompt. Though not the work's primary focus, ecology is discussed in several places. The information throughout on the history of biology is also interesting. Darwin's time in the Galápagos Islands and his resulting discoveries appear throughout, bursting some bubbles in the process. For instance,Contrary to legend, ... Darwin did not think the finches were very important. He did not even think they were all finches. ... When the vice-governor of the islands told Darwin that the tortoises varied from island to island as well (claiming he could tell which island a tortoise came from the its shell), Darwin more of less ignored him. (22-23)The book also interestingly notes that Darwin's theory that natural selection is the driving force of speciation fell on hard times in the early 1900s, since there was little observational evidence for many of his ideas until the mid 20th century--a lack that the Grant's research helped to end.The book contains a 17-page bibliography and and 8-page index. There are dozens of pictures, mostly of finches, that aren't particularly helpful and that add little. A two-page map of the Galápagos Islands, which shows Darwin's route on his voyage, is helpful. The writing style lacks the beauty of E. O. Wilson's science writing or the skill of Richard Dawkins's prose. But it's enough to get the job done and mainly avoid infelicities of language. The book won the Pulitzer Prize for General Non-fiction in 1995, though I think it's only a solid book, nothing spectacular. Unless you're specifically interested in finches, there are probably other books that you'll get more out of. 3/5 stars.Suggested instead, if you want examples of evolution in action, would be The Ancestor's Tale or The Selfish Gene by Richard Dawkins; if you want evidence that evolution happens try Why Evolution is True by Jerry Coyne; or, if you are especially fond of ecology, the classic Silent Spring by Rachel Carson."

I may have to read it again!
43,067973337X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6693237-regina-lindsey,4,"I’m not a science girl at all. In fact, it was a meteorology class (yes, a meteorology class of all things) that messed up my 4.0 in college. I’m still not over that; I’ve hated science every sense. But, when I had an opportunity to travel with a girl friend to the Galapagos Islands earlier this month I felt I needed to do a little reading on evolution since the islands would not be the attraction it is today without Darwin. As a history lover I did at least have a basic understanding of Darwin and his trip in the 1830’s. However, this book focuses on more recent study of Peter and Rosemary Grant, British evolutionary biologists at Princeton University, who, at the time of the book’s publication, had been spending five weeks a year on the island of Daphne Major for twenty years. “The Grants are doing what Darwin could not do, going back to the Galapagos year after year; and the Grants are seeing there what Darwin did not imagine could be seen at all.” I would say this is a very good laymen book on the thought behind how evolution works through natural and sexual selection. It attempts to tackles a couple of varying opposing arguments such as evolution cannot be seen in action and improvements can be seen in species over time but does not create a new species. Ironically, in my opinion, the author did a much better job with the first argument not with the finches but with research occurring in fish in the Amazon River. For me, the book answered the most fundamental question: why is Galapagos seen as the petri-dish of evolutionary biology. The book argues it is the young age of the islands (closest to what occurred on Earth as it was being formed) and the remoteness of the islands, resulting in hundreds of species not found elsewhere with little opportunity for cross-breeding. While the book does a good job of laying out the evidence for evolution, I marked it down a star for a few reasons. First, it was so repetitive! I hate repetition. I can accept that maybe the author felt it needed to constantly connect new information to former information. But, it really drove me crazy. Secondly, the author kept referring to the “problems” of evolution but never spelled out what the science community accepts as the problems. Maybe this is a bias for me as a historical reader, but I’m use to an author tackling and analyzing multiple angles.In the end, the book is not going to change any minds on the veracity of evolution but it was a good read for some context before heading to the islands and if you are interested in some basic understanding of the arguments in favor of evolution this does a good job of laying out those arguments.

44,067973337X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1879990-adam,4,"Bill McKibben's bookjacket comment promises that The Beak of the Finch 'will forever change your sense of the pace of nature.' That's a bold promise, but Beak of the Finch has some revelations that are serious enough to warrant it. The book is essentially a pop-sci collection of the most recent (in the 90's) evolution-in-action experiments that had been observed. Their findings significantly improve on the vision of evolution that prevails without such evidence. The stories are all told within the framing of one major series of such experiments: the Grant family (Rosemary and Peter and their grad students) observed Darwin's finches on the Galapagos Islands for decades, seeing that their beak characteristics were keenly sensitive, over the generations, to changes in the island's climate, plant community, fellow birds and other animals.The lessons that emerge from such research paint the world in a new light. Everything is shifting, as Heraclitus said, with every generation. The premises are quite well-worn: the environment changes constantly, with one winter harsher than the next, periodic droughts and floods, and new species colonizing and old ones becoming locally extirpated; genetic variation acts on each new generation, always - it has to, by its very nature; environmental changes create the selective pressures that determine which organisms survive in the next generation. Thus quite clearly, populations must be constantly evolving, however minutely, to adjust to whatever the present environment is like. Formerly it was believed that such evolution was too minor to be observed, too minor to matter. The evidence documented in this book debunks that and reveals a new world of constantly changing parts, changes that have repercussions for each other part of the web, such that everything is constantly in flux, and in constant response to everything else. "
45,067973337X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/17435739-greg,3,"The book opens well with a vivid description of the life's work of the Grants in the Galapagos Islands. The detail in Weiner's observations puts you right on the island with them. Next, a refreshing education on natural selection starring the finches and their environment. Given the remarkable detail in the data collected by the Grants and carefully explained by Weiner, there is little room to doubt or disagree with the inevitable conclusions drawn from the data - and the very direct connection to Darwin. The living things that populate the earth are continuously evolving with no end in sight. Evolution is not a mystery of the past but a constant in the present. It can be seen and measured as the Grants have clearly demonstrated.Unfortunately, I think the book bogs down at that point with repetitive additional examples of natural selection evidenced in the research of others. It's as if Weiner doubts that the story he has just told about the Grants is substantial enough to justify the book. Reading the subsequent treatment of hybrid combinations is unsatisfying perhaps due to the lack of resolution. Do hybrids lead to new species or do they collapse back into known varieties? If this is the pathway to new species, can that process be observed in a lifetime of recorded data? The reader is left with just the questions. Despite the struggles in the middle, I think the ending chapters are very strong. It is astounding to see the actual and potential reach of both natural selection and (if you consider the actions of the human race unnatural) human intervention in diverse fields such as genetic research, agricultural chemistry, prescription drugs, global warming and others. I find it hard to dislike a book that leaves the reader with such profound implications to ponder."
46,067973337X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/35412464-rhiannon-root,4,"Few things are more inspiring and beautiful than hearing about people who love what they’re doing. “The Beak of the Finch: a story of evolution in our time” by Jonathan Weiner follows two evolutionary biologists, Peter and Rosemary Grant, and their work on Daphne Major, an island in the Galapagos. On this beautiful, remote island they study 13 species of finches and record their numbers. Weiner details the whole process and it’s fascinating stuff. Weiner also intersperses details about Charles Darwin’s life and his ideas throughout the book to give the Grants’ work some context, too. Even better there are a ton of gorgeous illustrations (many from the Smithsonian and several from one of the Grants’ daughters.) Their passion for their work radiates off the page and it’s amazing. And like any book on evolutionary theory, this one does talk about religion and creationism, though briefly. Weiner mentions that Darwin struggled with the implications of his ideas. Weiner also makes the point (toward the end) that many farmers struggle with insects and pesticides because of natural selection and that these farmers rail against teaching the theory in the first place. Be warned, this isn’t an introduction to evolutionary theory. If you need a refresher (which you might) watch a few videos from Khan Academy or read Ernest Mayr’s “What Evolution Is.” (It’s fantastic. Do read it anyway.) In uncertain times, there’s something lovely and comforting about science and scientific theory. Life means possibilities and life, well, life goes on and adapts. "
47,067973337X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/22112920-jason-fish,5,"I was recommended this book before I went to the Galapagos for vacation, under the assumption I would just learn about Darwin and his unusual finches on the Galapagos Islands. However, I took away much much more, and now have a more comprehensive view of not just the nature of the Galapagos, but of the fluidity and fickleness of life itself. The author primarily highlights the attentive research of Peter and Rosemary Grant, which compels the reader to recognize how dynamic the process of evolution can really be. As I read the book, Weiner’s assertions just seem to make sense, it was almost like I had subtly come to similar conclusions/observations throughout my life; I just never consciously recognized them. It is still common for people to think nature and it’s animals are more or less fixed placeholders for humans to document. The Grant’s research and many other enlightening examples throughout the book prove to show that every aspect of our natural environment continuously oscillates and adapts at an anatomic level. This book really drives the discussion of Darwinian thinking and its prevalence, not just across a billion years, but virtually every second of natural existence. It is astonishing to read about the minute details the Grant’s diligently recorded on the Galapagos finches and how every tiny aspect of their past and present lives play crucial roles in their unfinished journey of evolutionary development.  This book is a must read, regardless if you are going to the Galapagos or not!"
48,067973337X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/714583-anita-pomerantz,4,"This book was incredibly educational. For those who are super interested in science or biology, it probably will be a five star read. It is very detailed. Weiner basically follows the work of evolutionary biologists, primarily focusing on the finches in the Galapagos, but also referencing the work of other biologists with other species. What struck me was the speed with which evolution can actually take place and that biologists have figured out experimental methods to track it. What ASTONISHED me was the infinite patience these scientists have for the minutia and tedium of the work it takes to make breakthroughs in this field. Honestly, it is mindblowing. After year one of catching finches, banding finches, measuring each finch body part, watching them mate, recording the results, - all in near isolation - I'd need mental health treatment. And these folks did this for twenty years straight. My favorite part of the book is about an experiment run with these spotted guppies. The results were so fascinating.Weiner makes all this material very accessible though some parts were certainly more interesting than others. There's various kinds of selection - natural and sexual - and when he discusses hybridization, he kinda lost me. Probably more out of boredom than him not explaining it well.But overall, a really excellent read for anyone who wants to have a better understanding of evolution and how it works in the real world."
49,067973337X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/823100-jared,4,"Peter and Rosemary Grant, both Evolutionary Biologists out of Princeton, have been relentlessly researching one topic since the 70s: the beaks of finches. After identifying a few isolated species of finches in Daphne Major, a small island in the Galapagos chain, the Grants have gathered data for the past 30 years trying to document finch evolution in Darwin’s own. Jonathan Weiner documents, in plain English, the most important evolutionary biology study conducted in the 20th century. He explicitly describes Darwin’s theory as it applies to the finches of the Galapagos—be prepared for more detail than you’re used to—and using the Grant’s thesis, posts evidence of evolution that occurred 2,500 times more quickly than even Darwin hypothesized!Weiner is an experienced scientific author, and did his homework for The Beak, for which he was amply awarded—he got the Pulitzer Prize in 1995. If nothing else, read Part One (100 pgs), subtitled: Evolution in the Flesh. It is in this section that his writing is important, eloquent and understandable. Part Two is detailed data and more supportive of his conclusions in Part One. But the chapters to take with a grain of salt are in Part Three: G.O.D., where Weiner tries to tie together “God and the Galapagos.” I don’t know if Jono is a believer or not, but his explanations lack true syndication of science and faith. "
50,067973337X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/374980-jeff-gramm,3,"I've always loved Charles Darwin's writing, but the Origin of Species' major shortcoming is the complete lack of any evidence. It is a wonderful and sensible theory, but Darwin basically supports it with logic alone. Beak of the Finch is a short book about Darwin's theory that focuses on recent research in the field of evolutionary biology. The book has three sections:- Part 1 focuses on natural selection and profiles Peter and Rosemary Grant, who have spent 20 years collecting data on finch populations in the Galapogos- Part 2 discusses the origin of distinct species and how Darwin and subsequent evolutionists have grappled with the issue- Part 3 returns to the Grants and expands into bigger-picture natural selection questions while also touching on some new research and older, classic studies.While the origin of distinct section was so slow it almost had me putting down the book, the first and third parts were great. The book gives you a feel for what life is like for field biologists (something I knew nothing about). And the discussions of evolution and summaries of classic studies are fun in a Stephen Jay Gould sort of way. The writing is a little bit annoying, but only because much of the Grants' research is so interesting it can speak for itself.  "

There should be a midway point, right?Are you interested in more than a cursory understanding of how evolution works in the real world, but really don't know much about biology? Try The Beak of the Finch.Note: The book is 20 years old, and its age shows a bit in the final chapters that discuss the impact of the human species on the rest of life on the planet. The long list of things that we're doing to screw things up is very familiar to me, and I didn't find much new here. But that doesn't detract from how interesting the first 2/3 of the book was. "
52,067973337X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1306288-jill,2,"I found this book incredibly dry and tedious. It really bothered me that the author never actually defined species. I realize that the book was written 20 years ago, but there was never any real discussion of the role of genetics in the evolution of the finches, only phenotypic changes (although he does discuss genetics when talking about other species). The author refers to a group of fuliginosa (one species of finch) turning to fortis (another species) (p.271). One species doesn't turn into another, that isn't how it works. They could evolve into something else, or the species could change phenotypically, but it doesn't magically change into some other species. Maybe I didn't understand what he was trying to say, or maybe that is an artifact of the thinking of what a species was at the time the book was written, but that idea really bugged me. All in all, I thought the book had the potential to be a lot more interesting than it was."

The story of Darwin, evolution in general and evolution observed in action, and the finches in the Galapagos is well-told and made relevant. It just got better as the book went on, as the researchers and the author kept finding new pieces to explore. I was surprised and delighted when, near the end, the book covered such topics as antibiotic-resistant bacteria and pesticides. As a layperson, I never would have thought about those as evolution in action, but it makes perfect sense now.If you enjoy science, I highly recommend it."

It gives a face to some leading evolutionary biologists, to the point that I kind of feel like I've met them. Beyond that, the science is really cool - this book describes a lot of really interesting evolutionary principles with specific examples. I'd say that this book is best for people who have some knowledge of (and ""belief"" in) evolution, but if I'd imagine that even without that, this would still be a good read. Either way, this book takes a lot of concepts and explains them in a way that is concrete and therefore much easier to remember."

The book is chock full of information and told an interesting story at the same time. Some chapters walked cautiously on a fine line that partitions the layperson from the professional. The italicized words and latin names used frequently on each page kind of had me skimming at times, but the information stuck by the time the chapter came to a conclusion.I loved how the author was able to incorporate the very interesting conundrum of microbiology and evolution in regards to disease, harmful bacteria, pests and viruses. I would recommend this book to anyone interested on the subject. "
56,067973337X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1237886-ross,4,"What is most amazing in this book are the researchers themselves. They are dedicated schoalrs who endure far more hardship than is ever conveyed to follow their passion with scientific rigor and the related boredom and exhilaration that can accompany science. What they see and do is truly remarkable. The story intold clearly and in an engaging fashion, although I did find the timeline and the chapter sequence puzzling. The book covers a lot of years of research and it's not always celar when things happened or what came first. But those are fairly minor quibbles. This is an excellent book. "
57,067973337X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5682069-jessi,5,"This is an interesting, precise, and rather thorough portrait of the study of evolution both today and in Darwin's time. It is evolutionist, literary, and God/creator-affirming in the same breath, making it both convincing and pleasurable. From Darwin's own struggle with the implications of his work to the dynamic changes in beak length and width during climatic changes to the general role of variation in change, this book hits points of fascination for history lovers, obsessors over natural minutiae, and philosophers interested in dynamic systems.

There were some dry spots, and some ideas seemed to be a bit redundant, however, Weiner's development of the mechanisms of evolution and how they apply in other areas of the globe is so complete. Some of the illustrative examples he uses are actually from some the case studies that I use in class, so I will have to use bits and pieces of this book to reinforce those case studies! And we are going to use Grant's data this year in class, so I think this will help to enliven the data for my students!"

Recounts the story of dedicated scientists tracking the river of genes through a small population of finches on a small volcanic island. As their island changes, so do they as sex and death works their selective transformative powers upon them. I missed this reading group for my grandfather's funeral, which I regret, but it's kinda perfect that is what took me away. Eloquently illustrates how the world makes us and how we make the world."
60,067973337X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2199404-andy,3,"A good but long introduction for non-scientists for understanding the reality of evolution. The finches make for a great teaching example because of the exotic nature of the Galapagos, the historic connection to Darwin and the naked eye visibility of the examined trait: beak shape. Much of the book is a narrative about the scientists who hang out on barren rocks watching birds. Their lives seem incredibly tedious but the author does a good job portraying the excitement of scientific discovery. "

The major subject that I noticed in this book, other than the Grant's time on Daphne Major and their finches, was the over arching question: ""Can natural selection/Evolution really make one specie from another?"" Using the Grant's research and discussing a few other studies, it was learned that not only does evolution change a species, but that it can actually be seen."

73,067973337X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/63203817-terry-pitts,3,"The science that Weiner covers in The Beak of the Finch could hardly be more important. He tells of how the research that Peter and Rosemary Grant have done in the Galapagos Islands, combined with other research by scientists elsewhere, has demonstrated how Darwin's theory of natural selection actually works across the span of a few generations of finches (in the Grant's case) and other animals. Through incredibly detailed work over more than two decades, which involves banding nearly every finch in the entire Galapagos chain, the Grants have tracked how weather, food supply, and other conditions cause changes in the beaks of finches (size, strength). Darwin, who thought that evolution worked so slowly that humans would never actually witness it, nevertheless theorized that the struggle for survival would cause species to naturally select mates that would help their offspring. As Weiner shows in this book, scientists can now witness this change in real time in certain species that have relatively short lifespans and high breeding rates.Science writing needs to be accurate, definitive, and understandable, but I think Weiner needed an editor. There had to be a way to make this book more concise, less repetitive, and less confusing. The confusion (for me) stems largely from the constant reference to the various species of finches that the Grants study. Obviously it is necessary to remain accurate, but I suspect most readers will utterly fail to keep track of the dozen or so species and their minute differences as Weiner tries to explain what happens to them season after season. Halfway through, I felt I had grasped the scientific take-away that I wanted and so I gave up. Weiner deservedly won the Pulitzer Prize for The Beak of the Finch, which covers one of the most important groundbreaking scientific projects in the last century. One observation. Weiner's book was published in 1994 and he describes that one of the advantages that the Grants and their team had was the development of the computer, which made some of their findings possible. But the Grants still had to write everything done by hand on the Galapagos and return to the states at the end of the summer to get all of their data onto the computer at their university. Imagine how things have evolved now that work like this could, presumably, be entered into iPads or laptops on the spot. "
74,067973337X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3029510-michele,5,"I’m really glad I read this book. I know I’ve been giving a lot of books a 5 star rating, but I think I’ve just been lucky. Though this book was published in 1995, it is still very relevant. I see why it received the Pulitzer for nonfiction. This book follows Peter and Rosemary Grant over decades of research on an island in the Galápagos Islands, Daphne Major. In the author’s words, “Year after year they go back to the most celebrated place in the study of evolution, the place that helped lead the young Darwin to his theory: the Galápagos, the Enchanted Islands. There they observe Darwin’s finches, the birds that Darwin was the first naturalist to collect; the birds whose beaks inspired his first veiled hints about his revolutionary theory...”. Their research started in 1973 and continued until they retired in 2008, 13 years after this book was published. Thirty-five years. This book covers 22 years of their 35 years. They would camp out every summer and get to know every individual finch on the island. They know entire family trees. During their many summers at Daphne Major, they say evolution in action. Darwin got a lot of criticism on his time for how hypothetical his theory was, and thanks to scientists like the Grants, we know evolution is happening all around us all the time. In the author‘s words, “This is one of the most intensive and valuable animal studies ever conducted in the wild; zoologists and evolutionists already regard it as a classic. It is the best and most detailed demonstration to date of the power of Darwin’s process.”In 1973, there was a bad drought on the island, and about a decade later, there was a very wet summer due to El Niño. These were major selection events and the Grants got to see how the 13 species of finches on the island were impacted. Who lived and died and why, and who was sexually selected the following breeding season. The physical advantages or disadvantages often came down to millimeter differences. Small, but big enough. Darwin spent a mere 5 weeks in the Galapagos in 1835 and the Grants spent 35 years there at a time when there was DNA sequencing and computers. That’s a long science experiment and with much better tools for analysis. I listened to a speech that Jonathan Weiner gave at Pepperdine University. He said that one of his fears is that he’ll never find another story like this to write about again because it goes back “to the origin of the origin”."
75,067973337X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2206973-rick-harrington,5,"RefresherNow that it's linked to the Amazon Empire, Goodreads makes a pretty good catalog of my reading (for myself . . . ) Since I read almost exclusively on Kindle, having disassembled bookshelves and hit the road. I do wish that I took more care to classify and comment since memory is so unreliable.In my mind this book goes together with a book I read some time ago and remember often, but can't quite name. Perhaps it's _Survival of the Sickest_ but I can't get that on Kindle to check my memory. Anyhow - one for medicine and one more generally for the way we inhabit the planet and especially the way we grow our food - both of these books convincingly send up much conventional wisdom as mediated by powerful corporate structures with profit as a motive for understanding. For neither of these books is that the authors' aim. This particular book has become a classic on evolutionary theory, mostly because of how throughly its author documents his comprehensive survey of the field. Dissonance with general understanding (of medicine or of evolution more generally to account for both books) falls out from that documentation.This book continues to resonate because there remains hope by its end that it is because our human designs are so much deficient in the face of the greater forces of ever-evolving life on the planet, that those designs will be subsumed by something more alive.The hint is that this will depend on our own continued evolution as well. That there is something beyond consciousness and cognitive power in store for the planet, and that we are locking ourselves away from it by our only temporary but terminal for the species as we are, dominance. Pride our downfall, but also our hope, as it promises to destroy our destruction. Blessed be the meek who feel the strains of evolution more than the pride of arrival.Anyhow, this book still makes a terrific refresher on the principles of evolutionary theory. I'd wanted a different book to document recent discoveries regarding the heritability of acquired characteristics. Some kind of folding of the DNA. I'll keep looking. Because I retain hope for the flowers."
76,067973337X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/81232236-k,5,"This is the third book about Darwin and the evolution of the ideas about life's origins that I've read in the last year, and it's a really good complement to other books. It's precise, concise, and relatively easy to follow, given the complexity of the topics that are addressed. The work done by the scientists described in the book is amazing, and the conditions under which they do it are remarkable -- basically camping on an inhospitable island (inhospitable for humans) for months at a time.It's a cliche to say that I felt like I was there on the Galapagos, but it's true. But I also felt like I'd be happy with a tourist visit of a few days, rather than endless months crawling around in cactus in the equatorial sunshine and desert conditions to watch a few birds.I found the drawings of various animals, especially finch beaks, to be helpful in explaining the ideas laid out in the text. As a person who can barely tell a cardinal from a bluejay, I'm amazed by the way that scientists can differentiate between individual birds and between related species. It's a combination of hard work, intense study and, I think, an innate attention to detail that few people have.The book also makes good on its promise to explain why and how evolution is happening, and why scientists now believe that it happens much faster than ever imagined. This is a humbling thought for us, but it also makes sense. Since everything in the environment is interacting with everything else, it seems perfectly reasonable to think that variations are always arising that have a minute advantage over other variations, and that those ""better"" variations will outperform for a while. And then, as the environment changes (and environment can be weather, predators, microbes, amount of cosmic rays), it's quite reasonable to think that a new variation will win the next round. And so on. This book brings to light the hard work and research that is proving this to be true."
77,067973337X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4985011-debbie,4,"I found this book to be absolutely fascinating most of the time. Not being a natural scientist, I was only generally aware of Darwin's theory of evolution. It makes sense to me. However, I'd never heard of Darwin's finches. I appreciate the story of the slow changes, generation to generation, of the variation of the finches' beaks. I followed well as variations of other species, over time, was discussed. I was mesmerized by the discussion of the evolution of chemical resistant species of bacteria, viruses and pests that impact our bodies, our animals and our crops. And I was intrigued by the realization that these changes, when reported in mass media, are referred to as ""mutated"" rather than ""evolved"". And I wonder if the journalists realize they are playing a word game. Some probably do.I was enchanted by the view that creation of a new species requires the availability of a unique niche for a new species. They must have some available arena to inhabit and thrive. It reminds me of the saying ""Nature hates a vacuum."" Weiner touched a bit on the impact of humans in many environments resulting not in the creation of new niches but in the destruction of existing niches, the significant lowering of biodiversity. It brought me back to the ideas from another Pulitzer winner I had read, The Sixth Extinction: An Unnatural History by Elizabeth Kolbert. All in all, reading this book was time well spent and I deeply appreciate all I learned that I hadn't realized before. "

On one hand it does deliver on its premise, a description of evolution happening in our time, and not on the time scale of eons. However, I was expecting more drama and more about the ingenuity and uniqueness of the Grant family and I think the book fails to deliver on these. In addition, after describing the Grant's story, the book goes on for maybe an additional third of the book on its own, which I felt was too much. My second problem with the book is that I felt it was a bit old-fashioned and does not really hold well with the years. I felt like the book was written just on the brink of much bigger discoveries, and that modern computers and other technology would have made the story much more exciting (which I believe it did). I rate it three stars out of five.הספר הזה היה קצת אכזבה. מצד אחד הספר מספק את מה שהוא הבטיח, תיאור של האבולוציה כפי שהיא קורה בזמננו ולא על סולם הזמן של עידנים. עם זאת, ציפיתי ליותר דרמה ויותר על משפחת גרנט עצמה והייחודיות שבה ובזה אני חושש שהספר מעט נכשל. בנוסף על כך, לאחר התיאור שלמפעל החיים של הזוג גרנט, ממשיך הספר לשליש נוסף שמרחיב בנושאים אחרים שלדעתי די ידועים ומוכרים, קשורים פחות לסיפור עצמו ולכן אינם מוסיפים (אם כי אולי למי שאינו מכיר הם חשובים).הבעיה השנייה שלי עם הספר היא שהוא לדעתי קצת מיושן ולא התיישן היטב. הרגשתי שהספר נכתב על סף תגליות הרבה יותר גדולות ושמחשבים מודרניים וטכנולוגיה אחרת היו הופכים את הסיפור של האבולוציה להרבה יותר מרגש (מה שאני מאמין שאכן קרה, אם כי אני לא איש מקצוע). אני מדרג את הספר שלושה כוכבים מתוך חמישה."

However, I was really impressed, both by Weiner's writing and by the subject of the book.Although Weiner doesn't appear to be a biologist himself, and the book is targeted to those without much familiarity in the field, he does what many science writers fails to do: he goes into enough detail about what the researchers were actually doing, without any ""a machine the size of a pickup truck""-type glosses. This makes it a lot easier to understand the details of the studies he writes about, and why the scientists did what they did, and made the book a lot more informative than I was expecting.Furthermore, the main focus of the book is a twenty-year (at the time of writing, now forty-year) in-depth study of the finches on several of the Galapagos Islands. The study was incredibly in-depth: the researchers banded and measured every bird on the islands and kept track of their family trees, and also measured the abundance of the birds' food sources in detail. The result: a very detailed set of observations on how natural selection and environmental pressures can cause evolution in real time in the wild, something I'd assumed was impossible.Definitely worth a read if you're interested in evolutionary biology, and hearing about how a group of researchers managed to make it a more quantitative science than it usually is."
80,067973337X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/75751678-max-ritter,4,"This book was simply phenomenal. The only thing stopping me from making it five stars is that some parts of it were filler content, which is largely unavoidable. However, it was incredibly interesting.The book follows researchers in the Galapagos who are studying Darwin's finches. The excellent writing style breaks down complex research of evolutionary biology into something a 19 year old (me) can understand. This book completely changes the perspective on nature and the idea of a species: showing evolution not as a linear change over time, but as a constant adaptation to a cruel world. Something as simple as a finch's beak can waver back and forth in size as these islands go between droughts and storms every couple of years. The progression of any given animal is not a straight line in a specific direction, but rather a wiggling line that might move a certain direction as a long term trend, but also is constantly changing.Anybody who wants to know more about Darwin's research and how it's still being expanded upon today, this book is worthy of the Pullitzer Prize that it won. If this review was a turn-off for you, then the book wouldn't be your kind of entertainment. But overall I definitely recommend this. Any book can make you learn, but not many books can truly stimulate you to think about something you'd never considered."
81,067973337X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/46092811-jennifer,3,"I enjoyed this book and it had a lot of great insights, but I think it think it could greatly benefit from either a forward or an afterward about the changes that have taken place since it was written (1994). For example, the book includes a discussion of climate change and how it may affect the rate of evolution, but back then these ideas were much more speculative. There is also a discussion of the hole in the ozone layer, and how it is affecting the mutation rate of the species of algae that passed beneath it, but in 1994 the Montreal Protocol was only seven years old and its effectiveness was yet to be known. Twenty-three years later, there is evidence the ozone layer is beginning to self-heal and the hole is becoming smaller.The context of 2017 also makes this quote all the more poignant: ""We are altering the terms of the struggle for existence: changing the conditions of life for every species that is coeval with our own. Never before was such havoc caused by the expansion of a single species. Never before was the leading actor aware of the action, concerned about the consequences, conscious of guilt. For better and for worse, this may be one of the most dramatic moments to observe evolution in action since evolution began."" (page 277)."

This book was written decades ago, but I did not know this. I subscribed to genetic data and principles, inferring evolution, but in my mind, this report of the Grants' work earned evolution a place next to gravity as a tested scientific fact, empirical and replicable.Each chapter has its own theme but flows with the greater story's tempo. Weiner also respects the dissenters and supporting researchers, who tend to fall into the background among the household names, like Darwin and Huxley. Furthermore, there is a deep respect for the scientific method, and Weiner does not omit the uncertain eras and looming questions in the community. Similarly, it was rewarding to read about the Grants' own meticulousness and excitement about their work: they truly appreciate this idea and its significance for human history and scientific progress, and that is inspiring for this student of science.Needless to say, these are the ingredients for a memorable book presenting a refined, ecological worldview within a turbulent history of evolutionary science."

That said, I thought it was terrific! Two strongly dedicated individuals and various other near-equally devoted helpers spent decades detailing a tiny speck of the wonder of nature. They accomplished this in harsh and uncomfortable surroundings. Their meticulous findings over the years advanced the knowledge evolution in a profound way. The author’s scrupulous research and recording of the couple’s work is also worthy of high praise. 	The book gives us much information on Darwin and his famous work, especially with regard to the Galapagos Island creatures he found so unique. Influenced by his work, Peter and Rosemary Grant extend his curiosity on an isolated Daphne Major, not much more than a rock, one of the smallest of the Galapagos Archipelago. They manage to identify and band every single bird. They then track generations of finches recording births, deaths and minute changes, especially in their beaks. From their observations they actually see evolution as it results from happenings around the island.	While I’m certain some will find their boring, I found it highly interesting and educational. Five stars all the way! "
84,067973337X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1056629-clare,4,"Focusing mainly on the study of groups of finches in the Galapagos islands, this book manages to touch on several different subjects. The main theme is evolution and concentrates on two scientists who have been studying those birds for decades. It was fascinating to read of all the meticulous measurements and other data they and their assistants gathered over the years and how this data shows that environmental variables effect changes in the bird's physical appearance and mating habits.The book also explores the interconnection of all life on earth and how any deviation from the norm can start a ripple effect that can alter the current status quo. The author points out how man's intervention in some scientific areas, even when the immediate results are helpful, often turn out to be detrimental in the end. Some of the examples he gives are frightening and, given that the book was published in 1994, one can only surmise that things have more than likely worsened since then. The delicate balance in nature is innately precarious enough and man has become even more of an impetus for change on a monumental scale. "
85,067973337X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4171831-jenn,4,"I loved all of this book, but the last part which veered off the specific study and data that was so engaging in the first two parts. Then I thought about how this book was published in 1995 and perhaps the last part of the book that warns about antibiotic resistance, global warming effects etc. seemed so normal was because we are still dealing with them and have no real solution to these problems today. I had no idea about the Grant study, this modern day measure of evolution. What an amazing undertaking! The comparison of evolutionary biology to particle physics, and the dynamism observed on a macro scale really gave me a new view on what evolution is.When I was reading about the DNA experiments, at first the details on the technique seemed so laborious and then I recalled the publishing year. It is amazing how amazing since this book was published we have made leaps and bounds in our ability to extract and analyze DNA. The sentence towards the end about being able to analyze the whole human genome, we have done that (though we still can’t find the answers to all the questions)!"
86,067973337X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/30079754-octavia-cade,5,"This is just excellent. A close look at the finches of the Galapagos Islands, following a monitoring programme which has been going on for decades - scientists returning year after year to record the populations of various finch species - and using the results of that programme to tease out evolution in real time. And that is the exciting focus of all that work: the discovery that evolution is happening there in visible, short term form, in the finch populations. (And this visibility is not just confined to the finches! Weiner has constructed this book amazingly well, and has compared the finch work with similar projects on fish from Venezuela, for instance, and a number of other relatively short-lived species in which natural selection is clearly illustrating evolutionary principle.) This is deeply exciting and relevant work, and it's presented here in a way that anyone can understand it... should they choose to. These experiments should be talked about in every biology class from high school on. Hell, from primary school if possible. It is clear, rational, illuminating work."
87,067973337X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/514956-evan,4,"Perfect book to accompany a cruise through the Galapagos. This book balances several elements exceptionally well. It is a close narrative of the multi-decade investigation of the International Finch Investigation Unit told alongside discussion of Darwin's original observations. These two threads parallel and enrich each other-- we appreciate what the Grants have achieved in relation to the inisight and limits of Darwin and the achievement of Darwin in relation to further vistas the Grants have opened on the same path. However, the book goes even further to provide a respectable survey of current field research in evolutionary biology and the debates and mysteries that remain. The discussion is pellucid. Weiner will frequently introduce a complex concept and then take the time to make it quite graspable to a lay reader by looking at the concept through several perspectives. The most impressive triumph though is that Weiner tells a good story about the relevance of basic science in our times without straying far into philosophical bravado. "

(The four star rating results from my finding a couple of the middle chapters to be a bit of a slog.) The last part of the book is a “page turner”.Copyright 1994, but scientifically, it could have been written yesterday, as evidenced from this quote:“Someone asks (David) Lack a question about the tit(mice) in Wytham Woods. ‘Well, I cant answer that question,’ Lack says, ‘because I have only seventeen years’ data.’” Page 299“The changes now in progress make the whole planet and all that lives on it a single colossal demonstration of the power of Darwin’s process” Page 276The book tells the story of several of these changes. It’s not only about finches. We humans figure into changes happening all around us:“Never before was such havoc caused by the expansion of a single species. Never before was the leading actor aware of the action, concerned about the consequences, conscious of guilt.” Page 277"
89,067973337X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4560826-jared,5,"Jonathan Weiner captures one of the most remarkable science stories of the 20th century by detailing the painstaking effort of Peter and Rosemary Grant's efforts to study evolution on Darwin's finches in the Galapagos. He has a strong narrative describing the early days of their expeditions and helps walk the reader through the data. Aside from telling the story of the finches, he also branches out to other related stories of evolution. He captures many classic studies of evolution like the finches of Daphne Major, sticklebacks, and guppies. He clearly demonstrates how scientists have documented evolution happening in our day. It is clear from the book that evolution happens, it can happen quickly, and scientists can measure it. Excellent book for students of biology (high school, undergrad, graduate), people interested in Darwin and the Galapagos, and people just interested in science (particularly evolution)."
