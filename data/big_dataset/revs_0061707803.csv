1,0061707803,http://goodreads.com/user/show/53165-warwick,1,"A popular science book for people who hate science, Sex at Dawn manages to combine weak arguments with a prose style of such overbearing condescension that I had to grit my teeth to get through it. Everything is couched in terms of facile jokiness or, even worse, of coy euphemism, so that we have the ghastly prospect of a supposedly serious book about sexuality that can talk about a ‘human female's naughty bits’.The basic argument is that evolutionary psychologists, anthropologists and palaeontologists are conspiring to propagate the ‘lie’ that human beings have evolved to be broadly monogamous. The few studies that ‘dare’ to question this narrative are hailed as revolutionary, while the rest of the scientific community is written off as ‘the clipboard-carrying crowd’, who ‘rigidly insist’ on the status quo. Unfortunately this blanket dismissal of an entire discipline succeeds only in fatally damaging the authors' own credibility.The debate over prehistoric sexuality is one that I have followed amateurishly, but with some interest, so I was quite looking forward to seeing what kind of evidence was going to be brought forward. By about page 40 I had realised with a sinking feeling that there wasn't going to be any. Instead, their approach is simply to restate their opponents' arguments in the most ludicrously simplistic terms they can, and hope that will stand for a rebuttal.For instance, there is a mountain of evidence suggesting that prehistoric females were in the habit of ‘bartering’ sex, consciously or otherwise, for access to protection and resources supplied by males. This is a complicated and sophisticated argument, which Ryan and Jethá summarise like so:Darwin says your mother's a whore. Simple as that.After reading that I gave up any hope of finding a serious argument in here.Of the book's other stylistic tics, I will just highlight a few of the more irritating. There is a tendency to ask rhetorical questions as a substitute for actually making an argument: Could it be possible that…? Dare we ask whether…? ‘How many families are fractured by this common, tragic, undetected sequence of events?’ I don't know – do you?? If not, stop asking stupid questions and show me some evidence. (It reminds me of a tabloid headline like ARE IMMIGRANTS CAUSING CANCER?, where the rest of the article amounts to a long admission that the answer is ‘no’.)A few other representative quotations: ‘Sexual monogamy itself may be shrinking men's balls’; ‘Homo sapiens: the great ape with the great penis!’; ‘ancestral females were shameless trollops’; ‘Who's your daddies?’; ‘We've no space for a comprehensive response to this’; ‘Yabba-dabba-doo’. Malthus is introduced, laughably, as ‘Wikipedia's eightieth Most Influential Person in History’.If you're worried about missing the subtle message hidden in all this facile nudge-nudge-wink-winking, have no fear, because they will simply put entire sentences that they consider important in italics. Reading these passages feels like being talked down to by someone who doesn't even properly understand their own arguments. They also repeatedly make the infuriating implication that anyone who disagrees with them is doing so because they're morally offended or out of political expediency.What makes it all so sad is that a book offering some new ideas on hot topics like male parental investment or female sexual receptivity would actually be very welcome. This is not that book. What it really is is a plea for a return to an imagined ‘ancient [sexual] egalitarianism’ where humans – especially men – had repercussion-free sex with multiple partners. I would be more than happy to read a book promoting the benefits of polyamory, but please, don't dress it up as science.Sex at Dawn was condemned by most of the academic community, but it was widely promoted by people like Dan Savage and Peter Sagal, and ended up on the New York Times bestseller list. It doesn't deserve the attention, and I wish I'd done a bit more research on it before I bought a copy. Instead, my advice is to consider the response that a pseudonymous primatologist was moved to write, Sex at Dusk: Lifting the Shiny Wrapping from Sex at Dawn. Because my impression of this one is that it's a disastrous blend of wilful misrepresentations with very poor writing.(Feb 2014)A much better book about the role of polygamy in human evolution (and one that sees it in much more ambiguous terms) is David P Barash's Out of Eden: The Surprising Consequences of Polygamy. Barash's comments on Sex at Dawn, by the way, are as follows: ‘a truly egregious misrepresentation of biological and anthropological fact…grotesquely flawed…shouldn't be tossed aside lightly, [but] thrown away with great force.’ Heh.(Feb 2016)"
2,0061707803,http://goodreads.com/user/show/858949-chris,5,"Hey! Hey, baby, baby, waitwaitwaitwait. Wait. Wait! Baby, don't... don't freak outOkay, okay, I know what this looks like, but I can explain! Quiet, Chad, let me handle this. I can explain! I'm just - please, stop crying and listen - I'm just fulfilling my evolutionary heritage and helping to cement social bonds with... um... the pizza boy, but that'snotthepoint!! That's not the point! Look, before you do anything, y'know, drastic,  you just need to read this book....Humans are really good at figuring things out. As far as we go, we have a real knack for taking things apart and figuring out how they work. Though determined curiosity and perseverance, we know what's happening at the center of the sun, we know how the continents slide across the surface of the earth, how plants turn sunlight into potatoes. We can smash atoms and cure disease and peer back to the moment of creation itself. There is almost nothing that humans cannot comprehend if we put our minds to it.Except ourselves.Don't get me wrong - we have made great strides in philosophy and psychology, and come very far in understanding human origins and our spread across the planet. But there is a fundamental problem that we have when we study ourselves, and that is that we cannot do so objectively. Try as we might, it is impossible to completely put aside our own biases, judgments and backgrounds when we study how humans behave and try to understand why they do what they do. They are still there, if you look for them, and nowhere are they more evident than in the search for the origins of foundations of human sexuality.The standard model, as it's often called, goes something like this: ancient men and women established a pattern of monogamy based on mutual self-interest. The man would keep to one mate in order to be absolutely sure that he was dedicating his efforts towards raising his own kids and not someone else's. If a man had multiple partners, he wouldn't be able to provide for them all, and his genetic investment would die out. So, in terms of efficiency, it is much better for the man to keep himself to one woman, focusing all his attention on the children he knows he has fathered and making sure they live to have children of their own.As far as women are concerned, they require the resources that the men bring. When pregnant, a woman's physical capacities are reduced and she is in a vulnerable state, so by staying monogamous, she is essentially purchasing security and resources that would otherwise be unavailable to her in a world that brought quick and merciless death to the weak. If she slept around, the man wouldn't be sure that the child she bore was his, and would therefore have less interest in taking care of the both of them. Thus, monogamy is the best bet to assure the survival of herself and her child.This is the story that's been told for a long time, and it's considered by most to be the truth. Christopher Ryan and Cacilda Jetha, however, disagree. Not only do they think the standard model is wrong, but they think it is nothing more than a relic of our own modern biases and hang-ups. The process, they say, can be referred to as ""Flintstonization."" As you know, the characters in ""The Flintstones"" were more or less just like us. They went to work, they had houses and appliances and domestic disputes. They had the same issues and amusements as we did, because we overlaid our own society onto a prehistoric setting. Now in cartoons, that's good entertainment, and in the right hands it can be used as powerful satire and commentary. In science, though, it's just no good.Starting with Darwin, people have imagined prehistoric humans to have the same sexual values that we have: a demure, reluctant female who is very choosy in deciding which male she will mate with. A bond forms, and they are faithful to each other until the end of their days. Later researchers, looking at our ape cousins, have plenty of observational research to support the idea that very early humans were monogamous. They look at chimps and gorillas and baboons and confirm what they had always suspected - that our natural sexual state is one of monogamy. The logical conclusion, then, is that our modern attitude towards sexuality, with the rising rates of divorce and teen sexuality, represents a deviation from the way things ""should"" be, and must therefore be fixed. A loveless marriage, a man's roving eye, a woman who cuckolds her husband, serial monogamists, all of these, according to the standard model, result from our attempts to go against our nature.Or is it the other way around?Ryan and Jetha have put together a very compelling argument that the standard model of pre-agricultural human sexuality is not only wrong, but dangerously so. By looking at modern foraging tribes and the way they live, as well as doing a comparative analysis of humans against our nearest ape cousins, they have come to this conclusion: our ""natural"" sexual state is one of promiscuity. Back in the day, communities were small and tightly bonded, and sex was one of the things that held those bonds tight. Rather than one man and one woman struggling to protect their own genetic line, their entire community made sure that children were cared for and raised well. Everyone was everyone else's responsibility, and in a world of plenty there was no reason to try and enforce any kind of sexual exclusivity.It was only with the rise of agriculture that it became important to know what was yours, as opposed to someone else's, and that quickly extended from fields and livestock to wives and children. Now that people were keeping their own food and making sure to divide their lands from their neighbor's lands, sharing went out of style. With so much work put into growing crops, that's where the standard model of economic monogamy settled in, and it's been with us ever since. The advent of agriculture changed everything, and not everything for the better.In addition, the very biology of humans, from the way sperm behaves to the shape of the penis, to the anatomy of the clitoris to the noises women make in the throes of orgasm - all of these point to an evolutionary history of sexual promiscuity. The evidence of our bodies tell us that being locked into a lifetime monogamous pair-bond is not what we evolved to do.Ryan and Jetha know that their view of the fundamental nature of human sexuality will not be popular, mainly because it completely undermines our vision of who we are. So much law, tradition, education, entertainment and just plain common sense relies on humans being naturally monogamous. It's something that seems so obvious to us that we cannot imagine a society built any other way. Unfortunately, if Ryan and Jetha are right, society is the problem. We have established a cultural norm that goes completely against our biological and evolutionary nature, and which makes people miserable on a daily basis.I bought this book mainly to stop Dan Savage from nagging me about it. If you listen to Savage's podcast - and you should - you will soon realize that monogamy is something that a lot of people aren't good at. We look at other people with lust in our hearts, we cheat, we stay in relationships where we're sexually miserable just because that's what we ""should"" do. For most people, our sexual urges are to be fought against, with everything from self-restraint to social shame to law itself. It seems like staying monogamous is one of the hardest things for many people to do.This, of course, raises the question: if it were natural, would it really be so hard?It is a fascinating read, which covers a lot of ground and makes some very compelling arguments. It's also quite funny in places, which was quite welcome. In discussing the standard model the authors note that this is, fundamentally, prostitution, wherein the woman uses sex for material resources. This sexual barter system has been assumed to be true for years, leading the authors to write, ""Darwin says your mother's a whore. Simple as that."" They also put in some special notes for adventurous grad students in the field of sexual research (especially genital to genital rubbing, something popular in bonobo apes, but which is rarely studied in humans) and re-titling the extremely popular song ""When A Man Loves a Woman"" as ""When a Man Becomes Pathologically Obsessed and Sacrifices All Self-Respect and Dignity by Making a Complete Ass of Himself (and Losing the Woman Anyway Because Really, Who Wants a Boyfriend Who Sleeps Out in the Rain Because Someone Told Him To?)""I don't really know what can be made of the serious information proposed in this book. No matter how it may seem, the authors are not proposing a dissolution of marriage or compulsory orgies or anything like that, nor is this book a ""Get Out of Cheating Free"" card. We've spent thousands of years putting these restraints on human sexuality, and they're not going to come off anytime soon. The best we can do right now is to be aware of where our ideas about relationships come from, and stop to think about the difference between what is true and what we wish were true. This understanding might help to save relationships that would otherwise work. People cheat not because they're scum or whores, but because they're human. Being monogamous is really hard not because we're weak or flawed, but because it's not what our bodies want for us.The search for a better understanding of human nature should lead us to being better humans, and nothing should be left out. Not even our most sacred beliefs. Not even sex.------------------------------------------------""Asking whether our species is naturally peaceful or warlike, generous or possessive, free-loving or jealous, is like asking whether H2O is naturally a solid, liquid or gas. The only meaningful answer to such a question is: It depends.""- Christopher Ryan and Cacilda Jetha, Sex at Dawn------------------------------------------------Okay? Okay, baby? So you see, I wasn't really  cheating - okay, I was, but you can see why, right? I was just acting in accordance with my fundamental humanity, following the biological impulses as determined by millions of years of evolution when we... Hey, where are you going? Where are you? Oh, hell, he's going for the shotgun. Run, Chad, leave your pants, you don't have time, run!"
3,0061707803,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1159787-valerie,3,"A long time ago, in a galaxy far away, I was an anthropology major at UCSC. Although I wanted to specialize in physical anthropology, I did quite a bit of classwork in cultural. One of the things that always fascinated me was fictitious kin. The idea of creating a network of ties to promote sharing among small groups. Church congregations and the scooby gang of Joss Whedon's Buffy are examples of this. I found the author's description of several of these types of kinship networks based on common sexual partners very interesting, as well as some of the research comparing primate anatomy and sexual response.However, I had a very hard time getting past the smug, condescending tone of the book. I felt the author's ""we know better than everyone who came before us."" missed the point of iterative science. It also turned off any reader who might actually be reading from an academic perspective. I also felt that they presented some styles of fictitious kin that work well for small groups (less than 150) as the best for everyone. I think their work would have been stronger if they had gone for more of a tone, ""of there are many different styles, and we should be more open minded""."
4,0061707803,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5887419-brendan-shea,1,"I rarely stop reading books before I'm done (and I've read a lot of pretty bad books as a result!), but I think I will with this one. The book has two serious problems: first, it misrepresents (or maybe misunderstands?) the standard model of human sexuality from ev. biology. Perhaps because they are so focused on the most extreme form of ev. psych, they repeatedly oversimplify things, and then accuse various authors (e.g., Darwin) of defending such oversimplified theories because of sexism. Second, their positive theory (e.g., that humans were polygamous until about 10,000 years ago; and basically lived long, happy, war-free, sex-filled lives until the agriculture revolution) is radically undersupported by the evidence. You wouldn't know this from reading the book, though, because they repeatedly cherry-pick evidence, and consistently ignore what most practicing scientists would say are the *reasons* they believe this model (hint: it's not because Steven Pinker did a study of dating strategies in college-age students, or whatever).In short: this is pop-science at its worse--it deliberately distorts science for ideological ends; it ignores evidence for rival theories; it presents biased and uncharitable pictures of other *scientists*; and the conclusion it defends seems to be mostly wish-fulfillment. (I think this is by far the meanest book review I've ever written, if that means anything...)"
5,0061707803,http://goodreads.com/user/show/73783-taka,5,"Fantastic--This is one of those paradigm-shifting books that pretty much changes your belief system. Having read Robin Baker's Sperm Wars and absorbing its grim interpretation of human sexuality, this book, Sex at Dawn came as a pleasant and generally kick-ass surprise.With abundance of humor and compelling narrative, the authors posit that human beings, like their primate cousins, originally engaged in multiple mating for most of their existence on earth before the advent of agriculture. And ""multiple mating"" means both males and females having multiple sexual partners at any given time, and it doesn't mean ""polygamy"" where alpha males get all the girls (such as in the case of gorillas)From the premise that hunter-gatherers shared everything, including food and mates, the authors draw surprising conclusions that pretty much blew my mind.First, they make the question of ""are humans inherently selfish?"" moot by suggesting that of course human beings can be selfish, but it largely depends on the context, sort of like asking, ""Is water gas, liquid, or solid?"" They take on Hobbes's grim view that life without government is ""solitary, poor, nasty, brutish, and short"" point by point and basically proves him dead wrong.If anything, the life of prehistory humans, the authors claim, was the opposite: social, rich, healthy, cooperative, and long. They had plenty to eat, plenty of time to play and take naps, plenty of opportunities to have sex; they generally lived long, healthy, happy lives.One serious--and to some, unsettling--implication of the multiple mating premise is that we weren't made for monogamy. Witness the soaring divorce rates in the Western countries and all the wrecked relationships everywhere you look. Fidelity, defined as being sexually faithful to one partner for one's entire life, is--so the authors say--unnatural.The hardest question that arises from this interpretation of human sexuality is what to make of marriages? The authors' answers are anything but specific: find alternative, untraditional arrangements (e.g. two couples sharing mates and living together), or just stop taking sex so seriously.But the alternatives are more discouraging: not getting married at all and live a solitary life, or get married with an unreasonable expectation of sexual fidelity, have kids, and leave them when you get involved with another man/woman, thus fucking up their lives forever.Not very appealing.This book makes you think about one of the most important aspects of your life, and it's worth it.A must read."
6,0061707803,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2116837-steve,5,"I loved this book, but to be honest I have nowhere near the education to be able to evaluate the validity of the arguments presented in the book. I have seen grumblings here and there about the book, mostly from religious people who this book will understandably offend.One of the main messages of the book is that monogamy is not natural to either men or women.The authors are two researchers and psychologists, both married.Despite being academics and approaching a variety of very weighty subjects the tone of the book is conversational, even jocular. No doubt this provided fuel to critics who wanted to pan the book because of the message. I found the tone endearing. It reminded me of that brilliant, but cool professor from college whose lectures were both fun and educational at the same time. The authors do not advocate any change in lifestyle for anyone, only to be open minded about what they believe to be the biological drives people have.There are too many fascinating arguments about too many related subjects in the book to do the book justice in this space.More than the exploration into humanity's natural lack of monogamy and the biological roots of a number of common sexual fantasies, I enjoyed the deconstruction of the view of prehistoric life being harsh. According to the author there is much evidence for the argument that prehistoric life was not brutish, short and malnourished. Quite the opposite.If you have strong religious values this book will certainly offend you. I am atheist and even some of the ideas in the book about the way men and women relate to each other deeply disturbed me. If you can put your values aside, this book is powerful and entertaining food for thought."
7,0061707803,http://goodreads.com/user/show/18881290-lucas,1,"I feel completely cheated...This review is directed more towards people who have already read Sex at Dawn, and to the authors. But hopefully this will be of use to new readers as well.I'll start by saying that when I first read Sex at Dawn I was blown away. This book completely changed my view of monogamy, sex, and relationships. It sparked this new openness and acceptance in me, and I will say had a very positive impact on my relationship. I thought here was the book that everyone NEEDS to read. I recommended it to everyone, talked about it with everyone, even called it my new bible (not that I put any stock in the old bible – being an Atheist, but you get my meaning).Then I came across a book called Sex at DUSK, by Lynn Saxon, a sort of counter-argument to Sex at Dawn. So, being a 'seeker of truth', I figured I owed it to myself to read this book as well. I really expected (i.e. wanted) Sex at Dusk to be a bad book in that it made a poor case, being full of religious and/or political bias, and couldn't really negate Sex at Dawn. But what I found instead was a very objective, concise argument that pretty much laid waste to everything presented in Sex at Dawn.Lynn Saxon drew on the exact same research that Sex at Dawn used as evidence. However she showed a much more complete view of the research, she removed the apparent cherry-picking and candy-coating that Ryan and Jetha used, and showed that almost every bit of 'evidence' they used has been taken out of context, and presented in a way that is completely misleading.I am no expert in this field so I took the authors of Sex at Dawn for their word. I believed that the evidence they showed was honest and complete. Unfortunately it would seem that it isn't. I am truly disappointed by their dishonesty. The other possibility is that the author of Sex at Dusk is being dishonest, but being that she is only showing more of the same research I would find it hard to make that argument, and I think anyone who reads it will also have a hard time making that argument. I highly recommend that any and all fans of Sex at Dawn read Sex at Dusk, and please if you come to a different conclusion than I did by all means comment here and explain. I honestly feel like I was cheated or scammed by Ryan and Jetha. I sincerely hope that they read this review and read Sex at Dusk to address the issues it brings up. "

I can't believe Dan Savage pushed this crap. There are better arguments for new takes on monogamy, open relationships, and polyamory out there - we don't need to cloak them in bad, gender-essentialist ""science""."

In opposition to what the authors see as the ""standard narrative"" of human sexual evolution, they contend that having multiple sexual partners was common and accepted in the environment of evolutionary adaptedness. The authors contend that mobile, self-contained groups of hunter gatherers were the norm for humans before agriculture led to high population density.تاریخ نخستین خوانش: روز بیست و هشتم ماه آوریل سال 2015 میلادیعنوان: سرشت جنسی انسان، فراز و نشیب روابط جنسی از ماقبل تاریخ تا امروز؛ نویسندگان: کریستوفر ریان، ساسیلدا جفا؛ مترجمان: مهبد مهدیان، آرمیتا کلالی، خشایار مینوی؛ ناشر: اینترنتی، 1393، نسخه کامل(4جلد)؛ در 465 ص؛ موضوع: سرشت جنسی انسان از نویسندگان امریکایی - سده 21 معنوان: چهار بدفهمی در باب سرشت انسان؛ نویسنده: کریستوفر رایان (ریان)؛ مترجم: آرش حسینیان؛ مینا خبوشانی؛ مهدی حسینی؛ مشهد، نشر تلنگر؛ در 146 ص؛ فهرست: فصل اول: یوکاتان را از یاد نبرید. فصل دوم: آن‌چه که داروین در مورد تمایلات جنسی نمی‌دانست؛ فصل سوم: نگاهی دقیق‌تر به روایت مرسوم از تکامل جنسی انسان؛ فصل چهارم: میمون بزرگ در آینه؛ فصل پنجم: چه کسی چه چیزی را در بهشت از دست داد؛ فصل ششم: کدام‌ها پدر تو هستند؛ فصل هفتم: عزیز دردانه مامان؛ فصل هشتم: ابهام در مورد ازدواج، جفت‌گیری و تک همسری؛ فصل نهم: قطعیت پدری؛ فصل دهم: حسادت جنسی، یک راهنما برای طمع داشتن به همسر همسایه؛ فصل یازدهم: ثروت طبیعت؛ فصل دوازدهم: مم خودخواه؛ فصل سیزدهم: جنگی بی‌پایان بر سر وجود جنگ در دوران قبل؛ فصل چهاردهم: عمر کوتاه؛ فهرست پانزدهم: مردی کمی بزرگ؛ فصل شانزدهم: درست‌ترین معیار سنجش یک مرد؛ فصل هفدهم: گاهی یک آلت مذکر، صرفا یک آلت مذکر است؛ فصل هجدهم: اُ (حرف لاتین او) در پیش تاریخ؛؛ فصل نوزدهم: وقتی زنان از نظر جنسی برانگیخته می‌شوندا. شربیانی"
10,0061707803,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5364177-myke-cole,3,"Look, the writers of this intensely popular book don't need my help, and certainly won't be bothered by my disapproval, so I offer my opinion here mostly in the interest of hearing myself talk. This is a really well written book that does a great job of confronting titillating issues head on, with honesty and humor and giving us an unflinching look at our sexual history - by which I really mean our primatological history - a look at how we boinked in our pre-agricultural past.From a primatology standpoint, the arguments feel ironclad. The authors' examination of female copulatory vocalization, the physical mechanics of our sexual dimorphism, thrusting action in intercourse, relative genital sizes and many other factors all point toward a pre-agricultural ancestry where humans were unconcerned about paternity, where everybody pretty much fucked everybody and kids were raised communally. No argument with any of that, and reading about the scientific evidence to support this is fascinating and really enjoyable, especially given the authors' brisk and really engaging style.HOWEVER.The book is clearly making a STRONG argument for polyamory, that monogamy is unnatural and a cause of endless misery, and that the future of human endeavor and satisfaction depends on a frank reckoning with how nature designed us to fuck. Noted. And . . . I guess it's not wrong? But the argument collapses under the weight of the fact that NOTHING humans do in modern society is remotely in keeping with our natural origins. We deliberately make choices in a society that trade some kind of misery/suffering in for what we perceive to be a greater reward. I served in a military (wouldn't ever change that), I live in a climate controlled apartment (wouldn't change that), I drink milk post-weaning and tropical fruits out of season (wouldn't change that).You know what's the most counter-natural thing I could ever imagine? The disciplined research and labor necessary to WRITE A BOOK. Our Bonobo relatives don't do that, and our pre-agricultural progenitors didn't do that either. The authors proselytize for polyamory, but then fail to make any arguments or offer any suggestions for how, as a society, we get there. they also attack monogamy wholesale without examining why smart people who acknowledge and agree with their arguments (I'm a dedicated Dan Savage disciple) would be *willing* to be monogamous in spite of those challenges. In short, the book feels like Bill Mahr's film Religulous, which makes some great arguments, but attempts to strengthen them by omitting all consideration of opposing viewpoints.The result is a book that's 75% fascinating science, and 25% irritating social proselytizing, an argument full of so many holes that I can't be the only reader to have rolled by eyes so hard I nearly detached a retina.Still, worth your time. I'm a lot smarter on our primate past now than I was before I read it."

This sincere recommendation has been brought into our focus to make the decision: what is happiness in terms of sex? This book is the alpha & omega of Human Sexual Behavior in Prehistory. If you read Darwin & respect him (we all do & should), this will debunk many of his own preconceptions of sex & gender and genetics. The standard narrative: boy wants it, girl doesn't, but they stay together and raise kids. But no: sex, &, more specifically, non-monogomy is what's at stake. Question forthwith your relationship, your human basic rights, and why its so hard to stay faithful today and always. Conventions fall like dominoes: these writers did their research (its heavy, too... monkey-heavy), and you, MODERN READER should take heed. It is accessible, funny, rich. Relevant to YOU.But... what of the standard narrative for gay people? I suggest an extension or companion piece of nonficition mastery that involves LGBTQ individuals.

13,0061707803,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4426615-jason,3,"My friend found this book intriguing. Couldn’t put it down, he says. I could’ve probably put it down, but I promised him I would read it and read it I did. In Sex at Dawn, Christopher Ryan lays down a slew of what he believes to be persuasive arguments for our prehistoric ancestors being sexually promiscuous. Considering that we are most closely related to the bonobo (a ‘pygmy chimp’) in the evolutionary sense, he draws parallels between the bonobo’s behavior and anatomical particularities to those of humans in order to suggest that our two species are sociosexually similar, as well. (Not to give anything away, but apparently bonobos are insatiable whores!) The point of Ryan’s point, I guess, is to point out that we humans—as a general rule—commit to monogamous relationships because doing so is socially accepted and expected, but that we may in fact be damaging ourselves and our loved ones by acting in discordance with our innate, biologically-programmed sexual needs.There wasn’t anything I inherently disliked about this book—though the casual language likely meant to foster a ‘connection’ with lay readers leaves something to be desired—I wasn’t interested enough in the subject matter to be swayed by Ryan’s arguments. Even if our prehistoric ancestors were polygamous, what does it matter? Somewhere along the line it became more worthwhile for humans to live in committed, monogamous relationships (whether for social, economic, or perhaps other reasons entirely), and as with any choice made by anyone anywhere ever, it will always be at the expense of something. Perhaps this does leave us more sexually frustrated at times than our ancestors were, but I’d like to believe that the return on this investment provides us a reward that is greater than the sum of our frustrations.At least I fucking hope so."

Who's to say that these hypothesis aren't subject to the same corruption? Of course, that's never addressed. I would be interested to hear whether these authors consider themselves poly and how that influences their ideas.-To write a book like this, you have to believe your hypotheses fully. I think a lot of them were on point, but I found that many of them were WAY too narrow. Human sexuality is SO complex. To boil all our behaviors down the way they have is reductionist and really, just as silly as some of the other scientists/philosopher's the criticize.-Almost exclusive focus on heterosexuality.Overall a solid read with some good food for thought. But I think it all deserves to be viewed through a skeptical lens. "

(For the record, some of us *cough* figured this out much sooner than others of us.) When it happens like that, it's hard to figure out what ""counts,"" if you care about that sort of thing -- anniversaries, firsts, all those markers of 'real relationshipness.' Luckily, neither of us cares what counts. Just, sometime over the past five years, we got to The Thing -- The Real Thing -- and that's cool.Except the part where it isn't cool is that there are a lot of other people who care about what counts. They care a lot. To a lot of people, we can't have The Real Thing, and not because we're both women. No, see, it doesn't matter how much our lives have glommed over the past five years, or how we collectively meet her cancer diagnosis and me conceiving a child to carry as my sister's surrogate. None of that counts because we occasionally sleep with other people, together and separately. Because if you do that, well, that's not a relationship at all.Which has never made sense to me on a logical level, or an instinctive one. Monogamy might be nice for some people (some of my best friends are monogamists, dontcha know), though more often it looks to me like it makes everyone ashamed and unhappy. But for me . . . no. I mean, I've been in monogamous relationships for years at a time, once before I knew what I wanted, and once after I had started to suspect but couldn't experiment to find out, because if your partner is not down with it like mine wasn't, then obviously you respect that. And I just . . . it's not that I was unhappy. Or not just that I was unhappy. I did not feel like myself. I felt like the person I was being in the relationship was untrue on some fundamental level of existential being. That sort of thing wears you down from the inside over time. And I strongly suspect it's a bit like being a closeted gay person trapped in a heterosexual relationship.Anyway. So this book (woo! I got there!). This book is all about how our cultural investment in monogamy doesn't make sense. Or at least how the narratives we're told about it are bullshit. You know this story: men don't want to be in relationships, but they need fidelity from women to be sure the children are really theirs (because otherwise why spend any resources raising them?), and so women trap men into relationships with their sneaky hidden ovulation, but what they're really doing is trading access to their vaginas for resource stability. It's the pigs and prostitutes model. The one that gets used to defend patriarchy, gender inequality, you name it, because it's biology, don't you know.This book is about how it's crap, and how it doesn't make sense given what we know about pre-historic sexuality, about multiple partner procreation now and in the past, and our evolution. It's also a pretty snotty bitchslap to evolutionary psychology which, well, yes. I totally dug it, because it made sense out of a lot of stuff that has never made sense to me. (And the last quarter in particular has some great stuff about different arousal patterns that just -- yes, thank you.) I just really really wish it was less pop and more science, because honestly the thing this book convinced me of the most is that the vast majority of anthropological work has all the scientific rigor of a wet noodle. And I wish this book supplied more of that rigor, since it demonstrated very clearly that the material is there. Also that it was a bit more careful not to continuously fall into the same stereotyped patterns of thinking about gendered behavior that it is chiding its readers for, but, you know, lack of rigor."
16,0061707803,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3846743-althea-ann,3,"SEX AT DAWN: PrefaceOK, I get the point of this. The preface is trying to make the point that humans are primates, and subject to primate urges. However, this is a DUMB story. Seriously, author? A monkey stealing peanuts you'd meant to give to a different monkey makes you feel 'betrayed in a way you'd never been before'? And inspires 'loathing' for monkeys? Plus, over-the-top anthropomorphization, and your telling me about putting on a 'primate display' for the monkey makes me think you may be a little unbalanced. Maybe not the best way to open the book.SEX AT DAWN: INTRODUCTIONThis covers a lot of stuff very quickly, as it's a quick overview of the topic of the book. There is little evidence for the claims here, but I'll trust that will come later.*We're apes - fine, ok.*Our society has sex issues - fine, ok.*The Spanish word 'esposas' means 'wife' and 'handcuffs'... hmm... this word looks more like 'spouse' than 'wife,' looked it up, yep, I'm right, it can also mean husband. Point taken, though.*People like porn - yep, true, but does that really mean sexual dysfunction?*Priests molest kids - yep, true, but is this because of 'denying normal human sexuality' or because predators seek out positions where they have trusted access to kids?*The self help industry is pathetic and non-helpful - agreed.*On to the summary of what we'll find in this book - a theory that from existing evidence, we can conclude that pre-agricultural societies were gender-equal and generally promiscuous. I have serious doubts that it is possible to draw such conclusions. It is POSSIBLE, but I do not think it can be proven. We shall see.*Outline of the typical 'narrative of human sexual evolution.' Yep, heard it before, agree that it's problematic.*Graph of how agricultural societies lead to war. This graph spells the word ""hierarchical"" miserably wrong. PROOFREADERS are important!*More about how agriculture leads to the idea of property, which leads to women losing status, etc. Stuff admittedly cribbed from Jared Diamond. Again, nice theory, not proven, though.*Good point about: really WHY should men care about paternity?SEX AT DAWN: Chapter 1, a.Starts out with the old chestnut about an explorer asking the native ""what's that?"" and ending up thinking that ""I don't understand"" is a noun. I've most often heard this about ""kangaroo"" but the word in question here is ""Yucatan."" If you go to the 'notes' the author admits that this story is anecdotal - but he uses it anyway. It would have been more effective (not to mention more respectable) to talk ABOUT this story and why it flourishes in different versions... Cecil Adams explains in detail. (I LOVE Cecil Adams): (start w/ 4th paragraph) http://www.straightdope.com/columns/r...SEX AT DAWN: Chapter 1, b.A page or two to convince us that food preferences are cultural, and people in one country may eat things that people in another think are gross. This seems very obvious, and a waste of breath - except that a friend & I were recently discussing a post where someone was using others' food habits to demonstrate racism; and then of course there's the whole ""Did Obama eat a dog"" thing, so maybe this actually IS a valuable point to make to a large segment of the population.I'm still stuck in my own culture - I'll pass on the grasshoppers! The references in this bit led me to this out-of-date but interesting blog: http://bugsfordinner.blogspot.com/SEX AT DAWN: Chapter 1, c.""An essential first step in discerning the 'cultural' from the 'human' is what mythologist Joseph Campbell called 'detribalization.' We have to recognize the various tribes we belong to and begin extricating ourselves from the unexamined assumptions each of them mistakes for 'the truth.'""Nice quote. I agree. I know Campbell is frequently considered outdated, and in his search for universals, he was often far TOO reductionist about human mythology. He also grabbed things that were convenient to his narratives and ignored what didn't fit... but I still like him, overall. Interesting stuff.Goes on to say that the commonly-accepted tropes about sexual jealously, etc, are not necessarily natural, but cultural - that evolutionary psychologists are wrong. I feel like that's probably the main focus of this book - the theories of Evo. Psych. are NOT NECESSARILY true. I think that is correct - the evo. psych crowd CANNOT determine that human beings have always been monogamous/jealous/etc. But I still don't think this book can determine the opposite, either. Still, I suppose it's necessary and valuable to point out that one can look at the same set of data, can draw different conclusions or create a different narrative.SEX AT DAWN - Chapter 2aDarwin was influenced in his thought by the prudery of Victorian times, and the religious bias of those who came before him, not to mention his own sexual inexperience. The writing of Darwin were, additionally, censored by his prudish sister.Therefore our first concepts of human evolution were subject to an anti-sex bias.SEX AT DAWN: Chapter 2, b.""the deepest function of myth... to lend narrative order to apparently disconnected bits of information, the way constellations group impossibly distant stars into ... patterns that are simultaneously imaginary and real.""Ok, that is lovely.I've probably never mentioned it here, but I am a huge fan of mythology and mythopoeic fiction; and how they connect to culture and history.The book goes on to say, ""mythology is the loom on which we weave... daily experience into a coherent story. This... becomes tricky when we mythologize about ... ancestors separated from us by 20 or 30,000 years... (there's a) widespread tendency to project contemporary cultural proclivities into the distant past.""YES. Historical fiction writers talk about this A LOT, although usually not on such a grand time frame.But I'm really glad this book is admitting this problem. We'll see where they go from here...SEX AT DAWN, Chap. 2, c.Stuff about Lewis Morgan, a contemporary of Darwin and an anthropologist. Never read much about this guy, but what a fascinating character!http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lewis_H....SEX AT DAWN: Chapter 3Here the author's go into more detail on the assumption of current evolutionary theory that they believe are erroneous, including:#1 - women aren't actually very horny#2 - men are motivated to only care for their own children.Their arguments for this second one are pretty convincing - as they point out, the arguments inherent in this are very questionable:especially: early humans understood that sex led to children, and were certain which children were biologically his. (It's known that even recently, some 'primitive' cultures did not understand this).There's a lot more here but it also points out that evolutionary theory concentrates ONLY on sexual relations as a method of producing children, as if this were the only function of human sexuality - which, as any psychologist can tell you, it certainly isn't.The chapter also points out that no, not all human cultures have centered around 'marriage and the nuclear family,'and that in early societies, which centered around shared resources, the whole sex-as-barter concept does not apply. (The idea that women allow a man sexual access in exchange for his material resources.) The author clearly find this reduction of all human sexuality down to - essentially - acts of prostitution - offensive.SEX AT DAWN - Chapter 4.Finally, the bonobos make an appearance!Starts off with a quote from Stephen Jay Gould about how it's peculiar that we insist on comparing 'nasty' animal and human traits, but not making the same comparison for 'noble' traits.It then talks about how there's a history of comparing human behavior to chimp behavior. Interestingly, it mentions how some of the characterization of chimps as violent and aggressive is also inaccurate (much was based on captive chimps; and their behavior, it is pointed out, differs from behavior in the wild as much as the behavior of jailed humans and free humans.)However, the authors are somehow not as critical of the research done on bonobos, and ignore the fact that (much like chimps) bonobos have also been observed acting in aggressive and violent ways.I don't think this invalidates the author's theory that we can compare ourselves to bonobos, as humans also, obviously, DO act aggressively and violently, but I do feel like the authors are oversimplifying to make a point here, and the point suffers for it.However, there are some very valid points here about the insistence on seeing animal cultures as a reflection of human. For example, the concept of ""rank"" and ""hierarchy"" in animal societies - it's noted that status can come from affection or seniority, rather than a 'rank' system.Also, that primatologists have insisted on describing different groups of apes as 'enemy' groups, when in fact when the groups meet, socializing and sex occur - not what one would expect if they are 'enemies.'Interesting note about how both humans and bonobos, UNLIKE other apes, have a genetic mutation related to oxytocin, and by inference, emotional bonding.And, a reiteration of the books main point: ""Modern man's seemingly instinctual impulse to control women's sexuality is not an intrinsic feature of human nature. It is a response to specific historical socioeconomic conditions - conditions very different from those in which our species evolved.""Sex At Dawn: Chap. 5Starts off with an interpretation of the Adam and Eve story as an allegory about humans moving from a foraging to an agricultural lifestyle. The authors express befuddlement as to why anyone would move from such an Edenic lifestyle to one of toil. It seems rather willfully naive. Foraging may be Edenic, temporarily, in times and places of plenty, but not all places are full of food. The foraging lifestyle requires frequent, nomadic travel. Not so good for those who aren't hale and fit. For me, it's very easy to see why people wanted to be able to settle and make a home, to try to wrest some predictability from an unpredictable world.However, the authors clearly state they they regard the move to agriculture as a 'fall from grace.' I see it as a trade-off, yes... but one that most people have seen as worth it.Next: very interesting (and true) idea about how humans have domesticated themselves, as much as any crop or farm animal: 'our cultures domesticate us for obscure purposes, nurturing and encouraging certain aspects of our behavior... seeking to eliminate those that might be disruptive.""Next: the author claim that, in the animal kingdom, humans are both uniquely social and uniquely sexual. While I see their point, I do think they exaggerate both. And no, 'exile' has not usually been considered the 'worst' punishment one can decree - hello, torture and death? Check out a list of historical punishments sometime.Last: the authors promise to make the case that prehistorical human life was 'far from solitary.' OK, I never thought it was. However, I do think that the degree of privacy/community/social interaction that an individual expects is not an innate thing, but one of those 'culturally pruned' aspects of society mentioned at the beginning of this very chapter.SEX AT DAWN: Chap. 6This chapter explores in more depth the fallacy of the assumption that sexual exclusivity is required because women need the protection and provision of a man, who will only cleave to a woman if he is sure that her children are his.The authors bring up the examples of many, many tribes who have traditionally believed that ALL men a women has sex with contribute to the paternity of a child (and even that, the more men a woman has sex with, the stronger and healthier a child will be).They point out that in cases where a child is considered to have more than one father, the child benefits, because that child has multiple people looking out for his or her well-being. (After all, in small tribal groups, the likelihood is that to some degree, the children ARE actually related to all of the adults in the group.)In a small tribal group, where monogamy is not the rule, and having multiple lovers is not considered to be a cause for jealousy, but rather, something to be expected, having multiple bonds of affection helps draw the group closer together.If women are free to have sex when and with whom they choose, this eliminates conflict & competition between males for female companionship.The authors point out that the egalitarianism of small groups, where resources (and, often, sexuality) are shared, is not somehow more 'noble,' but, rather, is the most efficient way for a small group to survive. Again, showing that monogamy is not always the cultural norm, the authors mention that the Matis tribe of South America (they're pretty much nearly wiped out now, which the book doesn't mention) actually have a word that translates to ""being stingy with one's genitals"" - a cultural transgression. (Kinda the opposite of calling someone a ""slut!"")The authors also mention that if we look at sexuality not solely as a means of reproduction, but as a mechanism for consolidating enduring bonds of affection and caring between multiple individuals in a group, homosexuality no longer appears like a functionless aberration, but rather as just another way to demonstrate mutual bonds.However, the authors then try to make a jump to compare the sexual egalitarianism of tribes to examples such as rock bands or soccer teams that happily share the sexual favors of groupies. I'm not at all sure that this analogy works.This is probably coming up later in the book, but it seems clear to me at this point that this egalitarian model of sharing (both sex and resources) with multiple members of a group, through multiple, enduring bonds of affection works very well IF you are in a tribe - a fairly small group who all share close bonds.It wouldn't work so well in a larger group (say a town or city) where not all your neighbors are people you know intimately, whose well-being and survival is chained inextricably to yours.A change from it being acceptable and expected to have sex with multiple people in your tribe probably occurred when people started having a larger social group, and the ""social unit"" switched from ""tribe"" to ""family.""Huh, This would also explain the weirdness of traditions such as that in Afghanistan where a woman is expected to marry only within her family (usually an uncle or first cousin), and marrying a non-related man is considered to be wrong and threatening (a non-family member is not trusted). It's like the tradition has only half-switched over...SEX AT DAWN - Chapter 7.While the last chapter was all about how other cultures have often had a more non-specific view of paternity, this chapter moves on to how mothering has often been less specific as well, with examples about how, in small tribes, maternal duties are shared amongst all the women.It also points out how, in cultures that have insisted on seeing the nuclear family as the only acceptable family unit, horrible dysfunctions often occur. They bring up a horrible statistic that I had to check: it's true. In 1915, out of ten 'foundling hospitals' visited, in NINE of them, EVERY child died before the age of two. Makes it sound like Little Orphan Annie had it good! Meanwhile, the unwed mothers of these infants would hire out as wet-nurses to other women's children. Hardly the ideal vision of the nuclear family, I agree.This chapter segues right along into CHAPTER 8The main point here is that it's been claimed that ""marriage"" exists in every society around the world because, well, we've taken a look at whatever arrangements exist in whatever culture, and we call that ""marriage,"" ignoring how their arrangements may actually differ quite a lot from what we think of as ""marriage"" - there's no definition of the word. The authors agree that yes, people around the world do 'pair-bond.' But whether a bond is supposed to be permanent, temporary, or brief, whether that bond overlaps with other long-term sexual relationships, whether sexual activity is allowed or expected outside the bond: not at all, all the time, only during festivals, only with strangers, only with tribe members...? this varies, and varies quite a lot. Most of the chapter is composed of details about the ""marriages"" found in other cultures, and it's quite interesting.CHAPTER 9The first half of the chapter is all about Matriarchies. It talks about different cultures that have encouraged female sexual permissiveness, and talks a lot about the Masuo; whom I’ve read about before. In traditional Masuo culture, the family is the essential unit of society – but the family who lives in a shared house are brothers and sisters, and the children of the women. Men go to women’s homes for sex and romance, but never live with their lovers. Men’s fatherly duties are to their sisters’ children.The authors that assert that in a matriarchal society, men have it better than in a patriarchal one, because women don’t have a tendency to form the mirror image of a patriarchy and oppress men – matriarchies tend to be more relaxed and easygoing. Sounds nice, but the evidence presented is a bit scant for that assertion.The second half of the chapter is about animal species which are erroneously considered to behave monogamously. Penguins are brought up (they engage in serial monogamy, sticking with one partner annually to raise chicks), as well as swans (they mention that at least 20% of chicks born to supposedly monogamous birds are not the offspring of that pair).I’m not at all sure why these two segments are jammed together into one chapter, but there you are.CHAPTER 10The topic is jealousy.“In a traditional Canela marriage ceremony… the brother of each partner’s mother comes forward. He admonishes the bride and her new husband to stay together until the last child is grown, specifically reminding them not to be jealous of each other’s lovers.”I like it!Here, the authors argue that jealousy is largely a socially-constructed emotion, pointing out that degrees of sexual jealousy differ from society to society, not to mention exactly what behavior elicits jealousy. They make a very valid point that the results of many studies that we hear bandied about a lot, (saying that men are concerned with sexual infidelity and women are concerned with emotional infidelity) are fundamentally flawed, because their respondents were all Western college students – hardly a wide representation of the many ages and cultures of humanity. Good point.It then moves on (again, and awkward transition) to talking about how Western pop culture views of ideal love are flawed, bringing up as examples the notorious stalker-song “Every Breath you Take “ (The Police), and “When a Man Loves A Woman,” which they amusingly propose should be retitled “When A Man becomes Pathologically Obsessed and Sacrifices All Self Respect and Dignity by Making a Complete Ass of Himself (and Losing the Woman Anyway, Because, Really, Who Wants A Boyfriend Who Sleeps Out In The Rain Because Someone Told Him To?)”They then go on to point out Richard Dawkins’ idea that there’s no reason that sexual love should necessarily be exclusive, since we don’t expect any other sort of love or affection to be exclusive. All good."
17,0061707803,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2018505-thomas,2,"A tragic disappointment of a book, Sex at Dawn attempts to sell pseudoscience as the real deal, and it fails. The first 100 pages intrigued me because of how Christopher Ryan and Cacilda Jetha blended evolutionary psychology, history, and mythology to discuss human sexual relationships. But then they began to make illogical conclusions based on circumstantial and underdeveloped evidence. They critique Richard Dawkins, Matt Ridley, and other reputable scientists, and they try to mold their straw man arguments into a thesis about the impracticality of monogamy. While I agree with their supposed overarching belief that we need to examine the current state of our sexual relationships, Ryan and Jetha present their supporting information in a muddled, unscientific, and invalid way.The writing style of this book also felt immature. In an attempt to market their arguments to a general audience, Ryan and Jetha dumb their ideas down to the point where their thoughts come across as condescending dribble. A few of many examples: they conflate testosterone with happiness, they write about the needs of men and forgo discussing women and their complexity, they espouse caloric reduction as the only way to a good life, and they ignore the multifaceted cultural and societal factors that relate to mating. I would write more about their heteronormative perspective and the off-putting generalizations they form from fetishistic pornography, but you can also read Warwick's and Ryan's reviews for a fuller analysis of this book's lack of thorough reasoning.Overall, I would not recommend this book based on its subtitle: it does not explain how we mate, why we stray, and what it means for modern relationships. If you have an interest in evolutionary psychology and want to wade through several pages of pretentious fluff to get to a few intelligent insights, then maybe check Sex at Dawn out. I will say that I warned you, though."
18,0061707803,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5194069-jenbebookish,5,"Honestly, this is such a great book. In my personal opinion, this is a book everybody should read. It's a really great eye opener in regards to human nature that counteracts the general tendency of people in America to idealize relationships and monogamy in what can be seen as a relatively unnatural way. I do realize that as human beings we are not only potentially logical beings with the ability to reason but also very emotional ones as well and that what we happen to know factually or scientifically doesn't necessarily mean that it can always be applied in place of our instinctual-from-the-gut-feelings, but I just think this is an amazing supply of information for anyone who's interested in the concepts behind monogamy and human sexuality. I actually happen to think that there's info here that could possibly bring some tormented people some peace. ""Why does he check out every ass that walks by, is he not happy with me? Is he looking for somebody better? My spouse cheated on me but claims it didn't mean anything, but obviously it means something to me, how can I even begin to understand his actions?"" And so on and so on. Obviously with each individual there are individual traits and each relationship has it's unique dynamic, but this book offers a little insight into human sexuality and human nature and for the science minded...(and even for the non-science minded actually) there are facts here that might supply one with some biological and evolutionary explanations for emotional issues.Of course, we are human beings. Ultimately, the thing that defines us is our ability to reason, to apply information to a problem and or issue and behave accordingly, rationally, rather than instinctually. We are not animals, we can control ourselves, we make choices, etc etc. So because of that-monogamy is not impossible. It's simply, unnatural. And that is sort of the basis of this book. A look at relationships, monogamy, and sex from the purely scientific. It's an eye opener, it was great, it was interesting, and I reference it constantly so do I recommend it? Yesssss. But only to people who are interested in sex of course;)"
19,0061707803,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6541981-james,1,"Now, I agree with the fundamental point they were making here - humans evolved to use sex socially and with many partners, not for monogamy - but their use of science was...shoddy, and high school level writing at best. They at times (oh hell, all the time) dipped back into stereotype to support their claims and to justify their choices of topic. I frequently found myself reading sections of this aloud to my roommates so we could rip it apart together - and that was pretty fun. They're depressingly normative, extraordinarily insensitive (a suggestion: either explain what was actually going on that was not rape or admit that women can rape - do not use scare quotes around the word rape, in any situation, ever), rely on Othering extensively, and are completely sophomoric in presentation (I have only once cringed through so many penis jokes in what is meant to be an adult look at a controversial topic. It being meant for people outside the scientific field is really no excuse). I would like to urge someone with more than a passing understanding of science, sociology, and sexuality to redo this book. Of course, all evolutionary psychology is to be taken with a giant pillar of salt, since it hardly matters what is 'natural' to us at this point and 'naturalness' is no compelling argument for or against anything in the first place. Humans should be able to create the families that make them happy whether or not it is natural, and this includes people who legitimately enjoy and choose monogamy consciously as well as people who make a family with many partners with the same consideration and intent. Also, it might bear mentioning that in the entirety of the book 'man' and 'woman' are treated as largely homogenous categories with no real room for humanity or individuality. That's the trouble with evo-psych - the details get lost in the attempt to make a coherent big picture and are impossible to account for in the master narrative. There are no intersex people, for instance, or gender variant types, nor, indeed, bisexual men.In reading this be prepared for a heady dose of misandry and misogyny. You will get both in abundance. You will also find a conspicuous lack of critical thought about the practices which support their theory of natural non-monogamy, whether or not they seem to be any more sensitive to consent than our own culture's norms regarding interpersonal sexuality."
20,0061707803,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2737441-sarah,3,"When Sex at Dawn first came out it received a bunch of ecstatic reviews, but I had my doubts. It sounded like more made-up, tenuously supported evolutionary psychology BS that just happened to be more to my (and the reviewers') liking than the standard evo-psych sexuality stories. My expectations were low.Turns out 85% of the book is focused explicitly on debunking and mocking evo-psych theories. ""Asking whether our species is naturally peaceful or warlike, generous or possessive, free-loving or jealous, is like asking whether H2O is naturally a solid, liquid, or gas. The only meaningful answer to such a question is: It depends."" ""'Archaeology,' writes Bogucki, 'is very much constrained by what the modern imagination allows in the range of human behavior.' So is evolutionary theory. Perhaps so many still conclude that sexual monogamy is characteristic of our species' evolutionary past, despite the clear messages inscribed in every man's body and appetites, because this is what they expect and hope to find there."" Hear hear!But then the authors go on to make the same types of errors themselves by selectively presenting and interpreting evidence to make THEIR case. Yes, I like their conclusions better, and thus find them more convincing. Some of the arguments were compelling. Some had obvious holes. Some were ridiculous (e.g. suggesting that the existence of gang-bang porn is evidence of a multi-mating past).With just a slight shift in presentation, the authors could have said, ""We've shown you the flaws in these arguments. Now we'll show you other arguments that can be made from the existing evidence. Science sure is tricky and observer-dependent, isn't it?"" That I would've had respect for. This, not so much. Especially when I don't buy into any of the philosophical stances that make the answers really matter. Why should we care whether cavemen were promiscuous? Are behaviors that are ""natural"" always morally correct? (Like, say, infanticide?) I reject this line of reasoning, just as I find the issue of whether people ""choose"" to be gay as irrelevant to how people should be treated. I find sex research interesting, but not because it affects what I think of as ""right"" or ""moral.""I do however think this book is important for getting a different story out there. Its critical look at evo-psych theories made it much better than I'd expected and it reviews some interesting modern research."
21,0061707803,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2551303-nancy-rector,5,Phenomenal mind opening book about the true origins of our societies typical view of sex and monogamy. Also delves into the topics of war and jealousy and if those are indeed innate traits of humans. The facts show they are not. As with many beliefs that are just mindlessly accepted by so many people this points out that many things are not what they seem. And that we as a people need to have the courage and strength to think for ourselves and to continually question and learn for ourselves. The book also clearly shows that believing and living as we have been conditioned too by religion and other facets of a society rather than by looking for the truth does a massive amount of damage not only to society as a whole but to its individual members. One needs to only look around to see that this is true. So many view the world through the glasses of their conditioning. This is true of researchers and much of the research that has been used as the standard narrative through the years has been manipulated and twisted by the researchers. 
22,0061707803,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5610133-sologdin,2,"A popularizer's polemic against evolutionary psychology vis-a-vis the doctrine and institution of monogamy. The book is well-humored, and the prose reads well. The broad strokes of the argument are difficult to dispute, and I wouldn't want to dispute them. Monogamy earned this ass-kicking--and it is an ass-kicking, a true shellacking, considering the data marshalled in support, as well as the motion-for-summary-judgment style of pointing out a lack of support for the opponent's essential allegations. Those who support the proposition that monogamy is mandated by ""human nature"" are revealed to be conclusively philistine--the only determination for us to make is whether the philistinism is willful theatre or involuntary imposition. As Kuhn might describe them, they deploy a different paradigm on this question, and likely recognize these arguments and evidence only as nonesense and errors; the only remedy is that they die out as time goes on, taking their bad ideas with them.Many good historical anecdotes (the anti-masturbation campaign, say, or the sale by physicians of orgasm therapy to ""hysterical"" women). Lotsa good up-yours moments to the rightwing. And plenty of fists in the face of evopsych overreachers, who deserve every beating they get. It was especially pleasant to see Pinker exposed as intellectually dishonest.All that said, the second and third sections, refuting neo-hobbesianism in general, seems like an unnecessary excursus. Not ontologically unnecssary (quite the contrary), and interesting on its own merits--but unnecessary to the argument of this volume. At times the argument veers into gender essentialism; at other times there's a bit of ultra vires crypto-mccarthyism (marxism apparently did get something wrong about ""human nature"" after all, despite the critique otherwise presented of evopsych's sophomoric economics 101 assumptions); and at still others, toward the end, the tone shifts to relationship advice, which might've been necessary to sell the volume to certain audiences--but the desires of those audiences detract from the text.I could've also used more detailed and thorough review of the relevant scientific literature--this is my main complaint. The text is polemical, sure--but, as a layperson on this matter, I do require a bit of handholding. Yeah, I know, quit being lazy and read the literature yourself. I get it. But it'd be nice for a popularizing volume to fill that role, so that I can carry on without cluttering my brains with the technicalities of the sciences. The text therefore could've been twice the length, and i'd've loved it.Those complaints made, it's difficult not to see the insights in this volume arise from the marriages to which I have been associated. My own conception of jealousy, for instance, is that it is a property ideology applied to persons, particularly to the right of exclusive sexual access. It's a nasty thing, and remains residual as affect despite being abolished in intellect by critique. The text confirms this conception to the extent that jealousy and its antecedent property forms are not dominant throughout the long prehistory of human sexuality. If I were to give marxist sexual relationship advice, it'd be simple: your sexual relationships are not property relationships, you reactionary fuckers. Once that basic principle of progressive humanitarianism is understood, the necessity of tolerance for and encouragement of non-monogamous praxis by one's spouse becomes a proposition of universal rights and basic decency. Understanding it may be difficult, sure--and abolishing it in intellect still leaves the affective residue--one will disagree with oneself, knowing the wrongness of jealousy even while feeling it--but the sting goes away before long, unless you're a teenager or not very worldly, I suppose.Recommended for masturbators, disinfatuated married persons, evopsych epigones, and people who think that they own their spouses."
23,0061707803,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1045774-mehrsa,2,"This book is idiotic. And I don't say this because they are advocating open marriages. I knew that going in and I was interested in the idea (I decided to read it after reading a NYTs article about open marriages so I was intrigued). No, it's idiotic because they are cherry picking historical data, they don't deal with any serious alternative theories, and then they present their case as though you're stupid if you don't believe it. There were some really interesting insights in here about human sexuality, but I expected it to be about ""the prehistoric origins of modern sexuality"" as in an accurate history. It was more a shallow walk through and then an argument."
24,0061707803,http://goodreads.com/user/show/70078-chloe,4,"Books on sex are a dime a dozen these days. From tomes on how to create a more spiritual union or bring more spice to your marriage through the cunning use of super glue, paperclips, and a rubber band (the well-named MacGuyver technique) to how to give your lover earth-shattering orgasms through locating some mythical pressure point, this genre has risen to be one of the pillars of the self-help section of a bookstore. It's gotten so that this subgenre receives even less respect (and deservedly so) than the Harlequin romances that continue to be published at the rate of a gross ton each week. Yet when a writer as highly respected as sex columnist Dan Savage goes as far as to call this book ""the most important piece of sexual research since the Kinsey Papers,"" I have to sit up and take notice.No mere work of bookshelf fluff designed to titillate (hehe) the masses, Sex At Dawn is instead one of the most well-researched works on the roots of human sexuality that I've ever had the pleasure of reading. It's no secret that most modern relationships are broken affairs- soulless/passionless marriages where neither spouse much cares for the other but stays out of some sense of obligation, or cheats rather than discussing and owning up to their feelings of flagging sexual interest (which can not help but end in bitter recriminations and acrimonious heartbreak). With porn of every flavor a mere web search away, swingers on Craigslist, casual bar hook-ups, marriage counselors popping up like mold spores, the chaste Victorian notion of ""one love, happily ever after"" has taken a severe beating in the past century.If humans had evolved to be monogamous pairs raising children, what authors Christopher Ryan and Cacilda Jetha call the Standard Narrative, then wouldn't these systems work better? Wouldn't we naturally fall into them rather than having to create so many social pressures and laws to force us into conforming? Through meticulous research into our closest animal ancestors (that'd be the bonobo and not the chimp, for those with scorecards), anthropological studies of foraging/pre-agricultural communities, and physiological analysis, the authors make a rather convincing case that monogamy is not intrinsic to the human condition but rather a very recent adaptation that humans are still fitfully trying to conform to.While at times a bit dry and overly analytical, the book is still an incredibly interesting read. The section on human semen competition alone provided much fodder for discussion around the dinner table. Still, as ground-breaking as their research may be, the advice they give to couples is still the same- we need to communicate our wants, needs, and desires better and to understand that flagging sexual interest and the desire for new mates is an inherent part of our genetic make-up. This book shouldn't be taken as a clarion call for men to run out and be cads, but as a means of beginning to find better ways to define our sexuality and work toward a more satisfying future for all."
25,0061707803,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4455324-kumar-mcmillan,3,"UPDATE: After writing this review (below) I looked deeper into the author's references; most of them are psuedoscience. I was very disappointed to learn that this book is not based on sound science.This is a fascinating and well researched (edit: so I thought!) view into how humans became the highly sexual creatures we are today. It flips the outdated and poorly proven Hobbes theory--that we were brutish, impoverished, war torn prehistoric animals--on its head. Instead, it offers compelling evidence and astute observations that for 90% of our 2.5 million years on Earth, humans basically had enjoyable sex with each other all day (multiple partners) and ate nutritious food from the earth without war and without many worries. The reason we enjoy sex so much today is that we've spent so much time enjoying it. In fact, the mechanics of male and female orgasms were likely shaped by these egalitarian, prehistoric foraging societies involving shared sex partners and even group sex. The book analyzes the peculiarities of our sex organs and compares us to other hominids (most notably chimps and bonobos) and isolated human societies to make a pretty convincing argument about this radical theory of prehistoric life. Monogamy is most likely a recent development in our existence and thus many of our instincts go against the principles of monogamy. How did monogamy prevail? The book sites the recent event of agriculture as the heaviest culprit since it introduced the concept of ownership; this concept took root and shaped many modern day societies. The authors ultimately call monogamy a failure anyway."
26,0061707803,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3193390-laura-kelley,5,"This book is not an attack on monogamy. It is a well-researched and well-written exploration of how modern sexuality has evolved. This is a must read for anyone in a relationship or would one day like to be in a relationship. The premise is simple. We have been socialized to believe that when you love someone monogomy should come naturally and easily. However, the facts bear out a different reality. I have seen statistics that indicate 80% of married men report cheating on their wives and 50% of married women report cheating on their husbands. Moreover, it is absolutely clear that infidelity is a leading cause of divorce in the United States. If monogomy is so easy and natural, then why are we so bad at it?Well, this book explores the possibility that monogomy, for human beings, is not natural. Instead our pre-agricultural ancestors were most likely very much like bonobos (which, along with chimpanzees are our most closely related primates). If we accept the possibility that it is true that monogomy is not natural for us, then what is the ""solution?"" In all honesty, the book does not delve into that issue. Instead, it is a primer meant to demonstrate that monogomy it's not natural. It demonstrates that the very reason why it is difficult is because it is contrary to how we have evolved. Does this mean that monogomy is wrong? That it shouldn't be attempted? that it's futile? Absolutely not. We didn't evolve to wear clothes or shoes or wear deodorant or do desk jobs... Yet, we, human beings, do those very things.What I have taken away from this book is that monogomy is really hard. Perhaps cheating doesn't make someone a ""bad person."" Perhaps some definitional flexibility is warranted. Perhaps we can have a dialogue about this without shame or indignation. Perhaps by understanding our origins we can be better prepared for our future. This book is just the beginning of the conversation that we all need to have about modern relationships and modern sexuality. "
27,0061707803,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5439484-jess,1,"From the very start, the authors set the stage of this standard (and wrong) view of human sexual evolution and sexuality and their radical alternative. Unfortunately, although they manage to refute some commonly held misconceptions, none of these startling revalations seem like they would be a surprise to anyone in the fields of primatology, anthropology, evolutionary biology, evolutionary psychology, etc. They also do very little to present a positive argument although to be quite honest by the last section of the book I couldn't tell whether their argument was that humans evolved with a variety of pair-bonding experiences with many of them likely to have been multiple-male/multiple-female or that men are genetically hardwired to cheat - compeletly ignoring any female sexual evolution or conditions. I was also disappointed by the cherry-picking of data from the literature and the attempt to spin the literature and case-studies often at the expense of the original publication's intent. The authors also seem to really like logical fallacies including the naturalistic fallacy (nature = good or better), Ad hominem attacks (which may have been intended as cute asides?), as well as a variety of others which made this a painful read. The cute quips and asides (Darwin takes a beating) fell very flat for me. I wish the authors had spent some time addressing how behaviors that evolved in small groups are relevant in today's society especially in reference to child rearing and public health issues like STIs and rape. Ultimately, I felt this book added nothing to the discussion of human evolution or sexuality except point out the authors' uncomfortableness with marriage as an institution and reveal some pretty nasty sexism in the last section of the book."
28,0061707803,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2576681-shakespeareandspice,2,"It was difficult to take this book as seriously because of the snarky little tone this book has—which honestly needn’t be there. I realize this is coming from someone who already thinks of science as fascinating and doesn’t need the lighter tone to keep things interesting but honestly, this book has too much attitude. It lacks a level of professionalism that, if I’m going to read an informative book about the science of sex, needs.Part of why I bring this is up is also because the only other book about sex that I’ve read is Bonk: The Curious Coupling of Science and Sex by Mary Roach. But the difference between the two is that while Bonk is funny, it is funny because Mary Roach is not a scholar in a scientific field and thus, her humor is a genuine commentary on the research she is doing. Authors of Sex at Dawn, however, just made me irritated when trying to joke about what is their daily work (or so I assume; I’m sure there aren’t discussion about sex at the dinner table every day). So all I kept thinking was, “why is this funny to you, sir?”In terms of content, I’ll nod along with a lot of what the other reviewers have had to say, which is that a lot of material in here is presented in a rather peculiar way. The authors do a decent job of presenting all the studies available, however, they fail to make any reasonable conclusions where I was looking for one, and make some rather bizarre assumptions where there wasn’t enough evidence to support a theory properly in the first place.The book also seems to advertise itself as a very “radical” look at human sexual behavior. This is a nice way to get me to read the book, but when it comes to the bigger, juicer topics such as polygamy or monogamy, the authors conveniently avoid taking a stance. Now I’m not saying that there needs to be a straight answer for everything, but it would be kind of nice to know what the author thinks is the more reasonable conclusion to make, or just to better understand what we should be looking more into—as in, what’s next? How do we build on this?All in all, this was entertaining. But it is most definitely pop-science. It offers some interesting cultures, behaviors, and discussions to look further into, but this is definitely not the place where we stop trying to study the human sexual nature."
29,0061707803,http://goodreads.com/user/show/32722-erica,3,"I heard Ryan interviewed on the podcast ""Sex Nerd Sandra"", was intrigued by his novel ideas, and decided to pick up the book. The overarching argument is that men and women were not historically monogamous the way society and many scientists claim. They back up this with physical and behavioral evidence from our close cousins, the chimp and bonobo, and from the information we have about prehistoric human societies and existing hunter-gatherers. The authors are also somewhat avowed neo-Rousseauns in their belief that pre-agrarian societies were more peaceful, more cooperative and even healthier than those from the ""civilizations"" which followed at the advent of agriculture. It's an appealing idea, but intuitively overly-simplistic. In this world, sexual promiscuity was used primarily as a way to strengthen close-knit community bonds, the authors say. Reading this makes you question common assumptions about human sexuality. Where the argument peters out, I think, is in the last few chapters when the authors talk about implications for modern people. How does one translate a sexuality that developed in very small bands of hunter-gatherers to our present hyper-connected, transitory and hugely populated world? Ryan and Jethá point out the problems with repressing sexuality, but don't offer many workable solutions. I was also miffed when, after talking at length about how females are just as promiscuous as males in related apes and pre-ag societies, go on to talk about how to deal with men wanting sexual variety in today's world. Why the sudden gender specificity at this point in the book? In general, the book celebrates female sexuality (even suggesting that matriarchies like those of the Mosuo in China might be a better way to structure family life), but inconsistencies like this betray a model that still needs polishing."
30,0061707803,http://goodreads.com/user/show/123323-rebecca,5,"Agriculture, am I right?I think this was a paradigm shifter for me. While the book ostensibly sets out to prove that we are not meant to be monogamous like gibbons (the only primates to live in nuclear family structures) but rather live in smallish groups like bonobos (and I think it presents its case very well), the real meat of the book for me was how far we've fallen from the original Eden as foragers. The Fall, as such, was the turn to agriculture. God himself says it was a curse. Before then, fierce egalitarianism ruled the day. With no property, there was no need for confirmation of paternity so the ""village"" treated all children as their own. Once agriculture comes on the scene, permanent settlements became necessary and the idea of ownership begins stripping away everything that was once peaceful. With fields to tend and more food in abundance, populations took off. And here we are 10,000 years later wondering where we went wrong. Until I read all of this, I was in the ""we're living in the best of all possible worlds"" camp. Now I'm just depressed.Anyway, sex stuff. They lay out a good case that we should be comparing ourselves more to the free-loving bonobos rather than our warring chimp cousins. Penis size and shape, ejaculatory composition and volume, hidden estrus - all of this points to a previous life as foraging swingers. So now what?"
31,0061707803,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1456035-katherine-riegel,5,"Of course the premise of this book will be controversial, as it questions many religious systems and the values of many non-religious people as well. It asks us to re-think aspects of culture that we have all unquestioningly accepted--one of which is a huge basis of literary works, movies and more: the concept of the One True Love (and the related concepts of jealousy and fidelity). But even if you don't agree with all of the authors' assertions, this book has what is, for me, an optimistic view of the possibilities of being human: that we are just as ""naturally"" capable of sharing, egalitarianism, cooperation, non-possessiveness and lack of jealousy as we are of their opposites. I think of Shakespeare's play ""Othello"": so much love and goodness and possibility ruined because of sexual jealousy, because of the belief that when we are romantically involved, we own our partner's body. What if Othello had just said to Iago, ""Ok. I'll talk to her about it, and we can decide together what we're going to do about attractions to other people""? The loss of a great drama, perhaps; but how much more sane our lives could be. "
32,0061707803,http://goodreads.com/user/show/201807-kristina,1,"Sex at Dawn certainly had some compelling anecdotes and it successfully turns your dreams toward bonobo utopia, but the plot holes were gaping. It is all fine and well to talk up the benefits of small societies in prehistory, but the authors seem to be suggesting that we should undo our heavily ingrained global community for the sake of promiscuity.Not to mention, what is a book about social sexual health that does not address homosexuality, STDs, misogyny, and birth control? In one chapter the authors describe a study proving that women who use condoms have higher chances of depression; in the next, they argue that women on the pill are likely to choose the wrong mate. At one point, they liken the promiscuity of bonobos and chimps to football teams and rock stars sharing groupies among each other.In my opinion, the high reviews for this book come solely from readers' initial burst of excitement upon hearing the confirmation that marriage is broken and society is sexually repressed. Yes, that's all true, but that doesn't automatically invalidate it as an institution. Yes, monogamy is socially constructed, but that doesn't make it imaginary. Yes, modern Western society should be more open-minded about sex, but there is so much more to the story than Sex at Dawn tells."
33,0061707803,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9735648-katie,4,"I enjoyed this. The book presents a lot of interesting arguments, and while it seeks to contest the ""standard narrative"" of humans' biological predisposition toward monogamy, it doesn't seek to tear down the institution of marriage. I appreciated that. It put the whole idea of long-term monogamy in a better light for me. The standard narrative leads to the idea that, since marriage should come naturally to our species, and when it becomes difficult (and it does, because long-term monogamy is WORK) we must be doing something wrong or be personally bad at it. You know that old adage about judging a fish by its ability to climb trees? Anyway, my takeaway from this was that while there is ample biological evidence to suggest that humans are not, at their roots, naturally monogamous, it's a choice we can make if we're willing to work for it. Which, frankly, is a narrative I like better.May main issue with the book is that I think I expected to see a greater variety of sexuality represented and studied. This was pretty solidly focused on heterosexual humans."

Arguing instead for a happy polyamorist pre-Eden existence before the deadening effects of the Agricultural Revolution kicked us into monogamous patriarchy. Not sure how to judge this book. The writing style is irritating at times, and there is a sense, even without knowing the literature, that there is a fair amount of cherry picking going on. The central argument goes off the rails near the end when philandering Phil makes an appearance, which made the book seem more like an apology for men screwing around than any substantive critique of the Standard Model. On other other hand, there were interesting pieces of information spread throughout the text. So on balance I found it a worthwhile read."

38,0061707803,http://goodreads.com/user/show/116363-kate,2,"I should have been able to give this at least 3-4 stars for the interesting subject matter, but I did not like it, it was only ""okay"" according to the definition of the Goodreads rating system. I listened to the whole thing, but it left a bad taste in my mouth, and in some ways I found it irresponsibly glib. If you're interested in the subject, I think you should read The Red Queen: Sex and the Evolution of Human Nature instead.There was so much sarcasm, so much negativity, so many bad jokes and puns and TERRIBLE ANALOGIES strewn about the place. There was a lot railing against other scientists and of course ""the standard model"" but the stuff that was posited in its place just seems like speculation, especially when bad analogies are used as rationale and little attempt is made to even understand that your intellectual opponents might have reasons for the things they believe. These are some serious blind spots. Many of the chapters start off with quotes. Vonnegut quotes always are nice, but a gaggle of chapters start with quotes by Francis somebody-or-other, and if I wanted that much of his opinion I'd read his book. There was entirely FAR too much time devoted to complaining about how little time other authors give to the bonobo (""only 11 mentions in over 200 pages!"" Can you even believe it?! - Or have you already fallen asleep?)Still, I learned a little. I learned that the average life span of humans has never really been around the stated 35-45 yrs, unless you factor in infant mortality, which skews the numbers downward drastically. And that anthropologists have often pinpointed the age range of bones at only ""35+"" because most of our growing is done by then. Of course it was also mentioned that not every society has measured the start of ""life"" at the same point and infanticide has been widespread and seen in a more practical than amoral light (this I already knew). I learned that there are human societies that have survived and thrived in different ways than the ""nuclear family"" model. It reinforced that community and a sense of belonging are important, and supported a possibly objectionable belief I already held and that kids raised by 2+ adults fare better than kids raised in single-parent situations, and that's one way we're failing a lot of people in today's society. And that as long as we're thinking about ways that today's society has failed a lot of people, we should consider that the Hunter-Gatherers did not do so badly for themselves. If you're interested in this, I recommend Beyond Civilization: Humanity's Next Great Adventure.And I thought a little about what I might be looking for in a partner, what I bring to the table as the female of the species (and I admit, in a mate ""selective generosity, fidelity, and sincerity,"" sound pretty appealing), and viewed my previous relationships in this context. I think thinking/talking about these kind of things is important, but ultimately I was just too frustrated by this book as my conversational partner.As a footnote, the audible audiobook readers left a lot to be desired. For example, ""185 - 235 x 10^6 compared to 85 x 10^6,"" the dash should be pronounced ""to"" not ""minus"" as it reflects a RANGE, and context makes clear the first group's measurement should be higher than the second, in contrast. Oh, and TED Talks: nobody pronounces it ""TEE-EE-DEE"" that I know of, just ""Ted"", like the name."
39,0061707803,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4798047-sibyl,2,"This book... UGH. It's starts off talking about bonobos bonobos bonobos! The forgotten cousin who boinks all the time in a free-loving society! And of which there seems to be little actual study! It's great to point out that our genetic closeness to this group has been overlooked, but I would like some more scientific evidence cited here, especially before their exclusion in accounts of human sexuality gets mentioned over and over and over again. Also, maybe all those studies that fail to mention the bonobo do so because of the fact that there's been such little study on the species? After reading far too much about supposed bonobo sexuality, the authors then delve into using logical arguments to refute common assumptions about human sexuality and monogamy. Ambitious, much? If I hadn't read any Jared Diamond or been previously exposed to the loss-of-Eden-equaling-our-descent-into-agricultural-society school of thought, I would have had a much harder time stomaching this section. As it was, it seemed like a position paper I wrote for my freshman Ethics class, using words and logic to prove a point, no matter what the point was, and making sure to address every possible exception. Again, not enough science cited. The last part is a kicker. Throughout the book, there's much talk of females being far more inherently sexual than Victorian scientists (Darwin) ever considered. Orly? But instead of focusing on female discontent in long-term monogamous relationships, they discuss only how it's hard on the man. Wait, isn't this already covered ground? Why bother refuting previous assumptions on this and that if you're just going to end up in the same place that reflects much of current thinking? They give a cop out that a woman's affairs are much more complex than a man's. ORLY? WTF? You're telling me that gals don't want to sometimes just get laid/experience someone new/be flattered by attention/feel the same rush of endorphins that guys get in affairs? Please. Suggesting that they are two vastly different things only obscures the fact that males and females are probably pretty similar in that they both want some variety. Even the examples cited - a polyamorous threesome of two men and one woman, don't support this strange focus on the man in the last few chapters of the book. And there are so many unanswered questions! Homosexuality? Long-term affairs? Japanese porn? I found this book deeply unsatisfying, oftentimes annoying, and in bad need of a stronger feminine perspective (if there was any - I didn't pick up much on the female author's voice). "
40,0061707803,http://goodreads.com/user/show/290581-jonatron,2,"Ok, I haven't finished this book, and maybe never will, but I'm going to start writing a review anyway. It's really slow going because it seems like every other page I have to stop reading and write down something they said that I'm skeptical about.The book in a nutshell: The natural state of humanity is an idyllic communist utopia where we just pick up food off the ground, share everything, including sexual partners, never fight, and live forever. Then some asshole invented agriculture and we consequently settled down in villages, exploded in population, and developed the evils of capitalism, war, patriarchy, and monogamy.Don't get me wrong; I've got nothing against the idea of non-monogamy being natural or good. It may or may not be. I guess the problem I have with the book is that it's not honestly attempting to answer that question. Like the creationism I grew up with, the book is starting from the conclusion (""non-monogamy is awesome!"") and then working backwards, trying to find evidence that it's ""natural"" in order to support the predetermined outcome, while off-handedly dismissing others' life work if it contradicts it. Whether true or not, it just comes across as shoddy axe-grinding rather than objective science.If I understand correctly, the ""standard narrative"" of human relationships that actual researchers actually use is something like ""serial monogamy with opportunistic cheating"". Sex at Dawn repeatedly conflates this with a Puritan ideal of lifelong monogamy, which seems to be just setting up a straw man that they can then easily knock down.Also, the whole thing is just a giant appeal to nature, isn't it? What's natural is good and what's unnatural is bad! Except not really. It is good to research and understand what's natural for us, because it helps inform our decisions and helps us understand our own reactions to things and work through them, but it shouldn't dictate our behavior. We're rational creatures, and perfectly capable of thinking and deciding which behaviors we want and which we don't.And uh, the Mosuo are a feudal, agricultural civilization. How are they more representative of what our ancient ancestors did than, say, the Mormons?"
41,0061707803,http://goodreads.com/user/show/80405-gavin,3,"This is a topic that modern society has been wrestling with for ages. Well packaged in an easy to read book, Christopher Ryan presents a large amount of experimental, anatomical, and anthropological studies with a logical narrative of the evolution of human sexuality. He deals rather fairly with monogamy (remarking that the alternatives are not for everyone), even though it is clear that the bulk of the data is pointing toward a different human nature. Although the topic is relevant to modern society and I commend him (and Cacilda Jethá) for addressing the possible antiquation of monogamy, I think that this work is far from academic in quality. He seems to discredit many of the original evolutionary theorists for failing to parse science from their culture. In fact, he consistently remarks on the socially restrictive Victorian culture and the effects it has on those scholars. Ryan then appeals to the pathos of the reader by accusing current theorist of evolutionary psychologist of calling your mother (or daughter or any female you know) a whore. In this sever bout of hypocrisy, he fails to see that it is our culture that would consider a woman a whore for taking resources, i.e. money, for sexual favor.Furthermore, the section of the book that argues prehistoric hunter-gathers are better off than modern man seems to be one sided and although he said it himself, overly nostalgic. He fails to see the paradox in his discussion of food and infanticide. Also, he seems to be making the argument that ignorance is bliss, but if that is true then North Koreans are some of the happiest people on earth. I wish that he had dealt with this portion of the book with the same agnostic approach as he did with monogamy and its alternatives. Even with the lack of rigor expected from books on science, the subject addressed in this book is important and might be life saving for some individuals. It is easy to read with an MTV like flow and punch, but do not expect anything remotely academic in quality. "

45,0061707803,http://goodreads.com/user/show/128745-malbadeen,3,"'m having a heard time getting into the content of this book because I'm so fixated on the style of writing. The whole idea of science writing for the layman (laywoman? layperson?) is interesting to me. The popularity of this genre' probably says something about our society right now - I don't know what, but probably something - ?And I admit there has been more than one time when I'm going along with the book when I'm thrown for a loop by what feels like a condescending or overly didactic tone. For example when the authors are trying to make a point by explaining that people in other countries have different diets. Their point being that eating grasshoppers seems weird to some people but not to people that grow up eating them. Well, no shit. But they roll it out like they're bestowing some crazy mind expanding experience on the reader when really, I think that, in 2011 +, most people have a fairly good grasp on cultural/dietary relativism.And some of their main premises rub me wrong:1. That in the grand scheme of things we are really not that far, from an evolutionary perspective, from bonobos and chimps. But I can't help but wonder about the evolution of the brain as a separate or at least much more accelerated form of evolution. There is so much research about how differently our brains are functioning due to our interactions with technology and if technology can have that profound of an affect on our brains in that short an amount of time then I think it's worth considering that evolution can be somewhat compartmentalized.2. Looking at other cultures (past and present) is fascinating but I tend to take the Michael Pollen approach here and believe that, in the same way teasing out one portion of an a different cultures diet will probably not yield the same benefits as living the local diet, or at least fully embracing the other one, I don't think it's valid to look at a small slice of a culture - in this case, sexual habits and deem it better or worse than another. It may work great in one culture but wont necessarily thrive outside that context (not that the author is suggesting we transplant sexual habits).3. Some of the arguments they use seem weak at best. For example when they use porn watching habits of Americans to suggest our natural, biological, acceptable propensity to multiple males having sex with one woman. Seriously? Porn watching habits? That's being thrown on the table as evidence of....anything?! Their ""evidence"" of this being the most viewed porn was vague at best and the fact that people don't watch couples having boring missionary sex with one partner isn't exactly compelling evidence that we aren't biologically predisposed to do that anymore than watching violence laden t.v. shows/movies is evidence that we biologically predisposed to murders.Now all that being said: What I like about the book:1. It's making an attempt to start a conversation about sex in the context of our social structure; What might not be working and why that might be.2. It questions many scientific theories/methods that have become widely accepted over the past few decades that might actually be flawed.But really, the thing is, I've got about a 1/3 of the book to go (the 1/3rd that according to ""Unapologetic"" is the best 1/3rd) and I don't know when/if I'll get back to it because right now I'm living the happy, pheromone induced, fantasy that I've found the right person and that we will never be sexually disillusioned with one another and that we will be the couple that still kisses during sex, that he will never look at me and think ""good god why didn't I ever notice how sloppy your tits are before?"" or think ""hooo hummm that tired old move - again?!"" and I'll never look at him and wonder ""why hasn't he touched me all week?"" or ""when was the last time he initiated sex?""I know, I know things change, boring stuff creeps in, life happens blah, blah, blah but right now I want to enjoy the beginnings when all the boring stuff seems impossible and I can't do that when this book is raining on my parade."
46,0061707803,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1477945-kendall,2,"First an alert: this review is of the audio version, which wouldn't be important except for an extra layer of condescension the narrators graft onto an already condescending text. Second, the title is misleading. One suspects the publisher here since the publishing industry these days value a title's sales' power over its relevance to subject. Sex at Dawn (all you can see a few steps away from the B&N shelf) is not about sex at a non-traditional hour. On close approach (very close, the printing is quite small) the subtitle can be made out as The Prehistoric Origins of Modern Sexuality which of course suggests a serious study. Cavaet emptor. Neither is truly forthcoming since the book is really an extended peroration for what is euphemistically called ""open marriage"" and slightly less euphemistically as ""sleeping around."" There are several other words along a downward slope of acceptability I will leave to the reader. To be sure, the authors review the literature on the subject, delving at length on the sexual mores of everything from bonobos, baboons, and gibbons; to Amazonian hunter-gathers; Asian sex markets; and Victorian boudoirs. They stop along the way to examine male vs female sexuality and discover that women get a kick out of sex too (eureka,). Targeting the ""standard model"" of monogamous marriage adapted from sperm-spraying males and nesting females, the actual content of their defense comes down to summary dismissal or ridicule. Citing Stephen Pinker study of 6 different tribes who have survived to modern times but which draws a non-supporting conclusion, they dismiss his choice as not ""representative"" (of what? hunter-gathers?). They ignore another counter example with, ""but who cares."" What? "
47,0061707803,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1634411-woowott,2,"I'll keep it short. Having grown up in a conservative, religious household, I must enforce open-mindedness deliberately. And I genuinely tried to with this book, especially since Mr Savage mentioned it in a column ages ago, and I rather like him, even if we don't always agree.So I read it, intending to be open, expecting to like it.It was...dump.Granted, I was seldom bored, which is nice; and it had some interesting ideas. But, in the end, it seemed to contradict itself. Men apparently can never change their sexual preference, and they will cheat because they need variety. This is never discussed as a societal issue beyond the authors saying monogamy = monotony. But they spend plenty of time discussing female sexual freedom, and the fact that our closest primate relations have randy females having multiple male partners (at least in part to enable sperm competition). But women never want to cheat, just men. Women don't need variety? Essentially, that's what the last chapter seems to say. And they consider none of these things forced upon humans by society.I mean, maybe I missed something in there. But that was just one bit of seemingly contradictory information.AH, and this book was easily as much about the ills of agriculture as it was about human sexuality. I really did not care for the lighthearted, sometimes snarky tone the writers used either. There are more things to say, but it's 4 AM, this goes back to the library in the morning, and I just can't.OH OH OH, and they rolled out the ""Semen Makes Women Happy"" study too.So are lesbians depressed, then?"

In that it made me think and wonder and question myself and bug my eyes at how obvious and logical some of what the authors talked about is.I'm not a scholar or a regular non-fiction reader and I know fuck-all about anthropology, sociology and psychosexuality, but I'm a very critical reader, and what I can tell you is that Sex at Dawn makes a hell of a lot of sense, and it's worth puzzling over for a bit.Plus it got me into reading more about human sexuality - which gets it brownie points - despite also being about many many more things other than sexuality. That made it a little dispersive at times, but also varied and more well-rounded.I love the way it's written with passion, conviction and a sprinkle of humour, and the quite sizeable wealth of historical and otherwise categorised knowledge it provided me with, and the way it's so gripping and flows so easily.Good job, Ryan-and-Jethà."
49,0061707803,http://goodreads.com/user/show/12933866-edward,2,"What Sex at Dawn does well is challenge ideas about traditional relationships and the nature of human sexuality (many of these long established beliefs are obviously untrue and grounded in misogyny or religion and deserve to be overturned). However much of the rationale seems loosely argued (particularly when referring to hunter-gatherer societies), and sometimes misleading or disingenuous (when referring to works of other writers who I have also read). He paints a very idyllic and utopian view of traditional societies that seems at odds with reality. The data appears cherry picked: general trends are argued against by making reference to what appear to be edge cases or exceptions to the rule. There is a lot in here that is both interesting and though provoking, but a greater part is speculative, and from what I understand, runs counter to the scientific consensus."

51,0061707803,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11509598-alex-lee,5,"This book takes a very contrary view of human sexuality.What is radical about this book is that it assumes that human morality and ethics are resource based -- so going preagriculture means removing assumptions that hierarchy and monogamy and so on are all natural and given.Ryan goes pretty far in terms of conjecture. There is no way to know how people actually behaved since there are no artifacts of that. But through analogy from other species, and what evidence there is of populations, and skeletons, Ryan argues that our sexual nature was evolved to be inclusive so that evolution could happen both in terms of sperm competition AND so that human bonding could occur so that cultures and languages could arise. Only through a group mind can people develop culture and language as a platform for deeper thought-systems. Ryan argues that our hypersexuality helped create that platform so that people in small groups could work as bands through rampart sexual expression, and multi-male/multi-female breeding.He takes the long route to develop this, wanting not for us to reject his thesis due to our raised cultural prohibitions. This I appreciate. A book such as this introduces a new paradigm, one cobbled from multiple systems, anthropology, biology, paleontology, archeology -- so that Ryan must face critics from all areas. He can't be a complete master at everything.Still, there can be no proof of behavior because behavior doesn't lead to artifacts. So we cannot know what the social arrangements of people actually were back then, monogamy or not. Still, this book is of great interest merely because it places the emphasis on pieces that we do have in a novel way, leading to different conclusions that match our relatively hyper sexuality, when compared with other animals."

I really did like the book. It was very fun to read. I guess one could assume I approve of everything not mentioned below.The minuses: Heavy reliance on secondary sources, including news articles and Jared-Diamond-style semi-academic books; not really discussing homosexuality at all, despite its promotion as a core point in the book; only around one passing reference to an individual in a working open marriage, though, presumably, the authors consider this a better model than monogamy; and a skimpy, apparently-contradictory conclusion.I wondered whether a research psychologist and a practicing psychiatrist are the most qualified candidates for a body of work that really seems to be more related to evolutionary biology/anthropology/primatology. I think they dealt with their subject matter aptly, but the paucity of cited primary research makes me think maybe they didn't understand the original research? I don't have any reason to doubt their scientific rigor, but most college students would be excoriated if their research papers so heavily favored secondary over primary research. The further from the original data, the more opportunities for bias and misappropriated conclusions abound.UPDATE: I've now read that this work is founded on Ryan's doctoral dissertation. So, presumably, he does understand his subject matter, but... it still makes me uncomfortable that so many of the quotes in the book are pulled from other semi-academic popular works, not from research papers and original research. This would have easily been a five-star work for me if I thought it were better documented.UPDATE TO THE UPDATE: I googled his dissertation advisor... whose background in parapsychology research leaves me... underwhelmed by his academic credentials. However unfairly, it increases my skepticism."
54,0061707803,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1289391-michael,4,"The book challenges many of the theories of evolutionary psychology (successfully, I think) and proposes a new model for prehistoric sexual behavior among humans. Written in a playful voice, the work nevertheless presents some good science with excellent notes and bibliography. We know that the invention of agriculture was more curse than blessing, leading as it has to population explosion, environmental degradation (including the possibility of catastrophic climate disruption), war, health problems, repressive governments, and delusional religions intent on controlling every aspect of life. We know that the lives of foragers were more free of stress and filled with leisure. We know that humans evolved to live in groups of 150 or fewer. We don't, however, have any way (short of the collapse of civilization) to get back to that state of existence. Likewise, we have very limited options for changing the structure of sexual relations (for the entire cultures of nations) based on an ideal monogamy (whether that monogamy turns out to be serial or entirely without the occurence of legal marriage). The authors have shown convincingly that monogamy was not a natural state for humans existing in prehistory before the advent of organized agriculture and have suggested that many of our current problems with sex can be traced to ""unnatural"" cultural constraints on our ""natural"" sexuality. They have left us with a theoretical structure for understanding the unhappiness and psychological distress felt by so many given the current state of sexual relations, but they haven't recommended any feasible fixes for the problem. That they haven't may be seen by some as a deficiency, but, despite the playful tone of the work, the authors have wisely limited their book to their purpose of challenging the traditional narrative of the development of human sexuality and to proposing an alternative narrative that describes a path from which we have diverged. "
55,0061707803,http://goodreads.com/user/show/276109-dan,3,"It was hard for me to not really love this book. I wanted to. The basic premise, that humans really aren't designed for monogamy and that societal pressures to uphold that system are harmful and generally doomed, is one that I personally agree with in general. But as such, I wanted to see the point defended in a more professional manner.The tone of the writing really detracted from it's credibility. For example, it was hard to believe that instead of just talking about sexual patterns in patriarchal vs. matriarchal societies in a scientific manner, they write it as propaganda, trying to convince guys that they'll get a lot laid more if they were to live in a matriarchal society. Seriously. I cringed.Now, to be fair, it did make the book more fun to read at times, which is undoubtedly what the authors were going for. I just think they overdid it. A lot. But one example did make me laugh aloud: in describing why human males' testicles are outside the body, ""A scrotum is like a spare refrigerator in the garage just for beer. If you've got a spare beer fridge, you're probably the type who expects a party to break out at any moment. You want to be prepared"".It loses a few further points in my own mind because the end of the book seems to lose focus. It felt like interesting data and anecdotes are all collected in the last couple of chapters but I couldn't tell what the point of them being there was. It could have had a stronger finish by trimming that stuff out.All in all, I think a lot of excellent points are raised and many accepted beliefs challenged in compelling ways. I hope it is taken seriously enough to generate real discussion and thought amongst those who don't already agree with its conclusions. "

58,0061707803,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4796031-armin-books,4,"I first came across Christopher Ryan's argument a few years ago in his first interview with Joe Rogan. Since then, he's been a recurring guest on Joe Rogan Experience podcast. I must say, I always enjoy his appearances on the show as he seems to have a bottomless supply of stories and personal anecdotes from years of traveling around the globe! I also got into listening to his own podcast, 'Tangentially Speaking' a while ago. He interviews fascinating people from all walks of life, including dominatrixes, comedians, and environmentalists. There is a great line in the first chapter that encapsulates the whole sentiment of the book, ""We didn’t descend from apes. We are apes."" Great line to be printed on a T-shirt or a bumper sticker! The authors explain what Darwin didn't know (or didn't want to admit due to his upbringing) about human sexuality. They raise some interesting points about Darwin's personal life. Of course, we have learned so much more since Darwin first ventured into the field of human evolution in his 1871 book, The Descent of Man. Next, they have a big bone to pick with ""agricultural revolution"" -at least that's the sense I got from reading the book, since this point is hammered throughout the book. This is actually the theme of Ryan's new book as well, Civilized to Death: What Was Lost on the Way to Modernity, to be published in 2018. They argue that the farming revolution that put an end to hunter-gatherer lifestyle came in with a great cost, both physically and mentally to the human species. ""Women who typically had as much access to food, protection, and social support as men"", suddenly found themselves more restricted in the hierarchical structure of settled societies. On a similar note, they contend from scattered evidence from the past and present groups of hunter-gatherers, that there is an explicit notion of ""Fierce egalitarianism"", whereby they share anything and everything among themselves. This all came to an abrupt end with the advent of agriculture, domestication, and civilization itself. I know the authors are aware of the rosy picture they are painting of the hunter-gatherer lifestyle. But there are few things I wish they mentioned, such as the presence of slavery in most societies both pre and post-agriculture. This seems to me to put a blemish on the rosy picture of the noble savage. Maybe, I'm wrong or I'm misinterpreting something they have said here. In chapter 2, they coin an interesting name for an interesting phenomenon: “Flintstonization”! It basically means that there is this widespread tendency to project our modern cultural and behavioral bias into the prehistoric lifestyle of our ancestors. According to the authors, even many in academia are guilty of this blunder. They give compelling examples of behaviors which to western sensibilities might seem objectionable, whereas in some other societies they are absolutely normal behavior. For example, eating insects and grubs can be considered disgusting in one culture, but typical behavior in another. When the British first landed in Australia, they seem to have suffered from bouts of drought and food scarcity, all the while their aboriginal counterparts had full bellies of insects and healthy food which the newcomers didn't deem edible. In the next two chapters, they try to drill further holes in the Standard Narrative of Human Sexual Evolution. Chapter 3 begins with this lovely German quote by Schopenhauer!Mensch kann tun was er will; er kann aber nicht wollen was er will. (One can choose what to do, but not what to want.)There is a technical discussion of Male Parental Investment and concealed evolution that I don't want to get into here. The authors rightfully identify great apes, and bonobos in particular, as a great vessel to study our own species' past and perhaps present. After all, genetically we are more similar to them that they are to both gorillas and orangutans. Bonobo females are reported to share two striking features in common with human females: ""hidden ovulation from immediate detection and that they have sex throughout their cycle"". The authors believe this to be a significant similarity among the two closely related species of primates. In chapter 5, The authors echo Jared Diamond's analysis that, “Hunter-gatherers practiced the most successful and longest-lasting life style in human history"". The change in lifestyle from hunter-gatherer to settled society, in their view, has had massive repercussions reverberating to this day. Here is where the authors make their attack on Steven Pinker's idea of 'declining violence'. Pinker has popularized this idea in his 2010 book, The Better Angels of Our Nature: Why Violence Has Declined. This idea of declining violence has been gaining traction in recent years. Most recently, in Obama's speech at Gates foundation (September 20, 2017). I must confess Pinker's book has been sitting on my reading list for years, but I will pick it up one of these days. Before reading Sex at Dawn, I had only heard praises of Pinker's book from friends and online. That's why I read this chapter with extra caution. I must say the authors of Sex at Dawn make some compelling arguments against the perception of brutality and hardship in our prehistoric life. For example, they mention that ""Foragers have few possessions of any nonsentimental value"", and ""Food is spread out in the environment"". Thus, a competitive or aggressive behavior wouldn't pay off in those type of environments. I'm holding judgment on this one because I still haven't gone through Pinker's arguments. The next chapter is mainly focused on the subject of 'sperm competition'. I remember reading briefly about it in my undergrad studies. If the breadth of evidence laid out here is true, they should have put more emphasis on this topic in my school. There are claims such as; ""...several researchers have demonstrated that a man’s sperm production increases significantly when he has not seen his partner for a few days, regardless of whether or not he ejaculated during her absence."", or ""...experimental evidence that men viewing erotic material suggestive of sperm competition (two men with one woman) produce ejaculates containing a higher percentage of motile sperm than men viewing explicit images of only three women."". Then they return to the topic of female sexual evolution. They mention “genital echo theory” which proposes that female's breasts started to develop when hominids started walking upright. They basically mimic and do the same job that the curvy bottoms previously had been doing in excitation of primitive males, hence the similar shape and structure. According to experts, the pendulous nature of breasts has nothing to do with milk production.It's hard to summarize the last couple of chapters. They basically deal with the complexities of human sexuality in both men and women. They mention statistics that shows the exhausted state of traditional marriage, at least in the west. And they discuss the fascinating diversity of human family arrangements both in the past and present. All in all, I found the book quite informative and thought-provoking. Even if you don't accept all the premises and conclusions, it is still a worthwhile read. "

60,0061707803,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3583387-nebuchadnezzar,3,"Humans were made for free love (and rock 'n roll)! Well, maybe. I have mixed feelings about this book, as it effectively debunks a number of misconceptions but replaces them with some new ones. I've yet to come across any books on sex that shouldn't be taken with at least a little grain, if not an entire shaker, of salt. When it comes to ""sexology"" or scientific attempts to study sexuality in general, there are always to major limitations. One is the obvious cultural bias that tends to run rampant when it comes to sex. The second is the difficulty in gathering data as we humans prefer to keep the hanky-panky in the bedroom and so observations in an experimental setting are difficult to do for quite a variety of reasons. Thus, so much research in this area relies on questionnaires and surveys, which are nearly worthless if you want anything approaching accurate and objective data.With that disclaimer out of the way, Sex at Dawn dispatches with a plethora of popular myths, such as the idea that monogamy is the ""natural"" state of humanity, that women are ""naturally"" inclined to be less sexual, that men are ""naturally"" violent, horny beasts. A common criticism seems to be that the tone is polemical and incredibly snide and sarcastic at times. I'd agree, but I think anyone approaching this expecting a scholarly work is barking up the wrong tree. Frankly, after hearing the baseless tropes they deconstruct parroted so many times even by ""great minds,"" it's admittedly cathartic to see said nonsense getting torn to shreds and spat on. Contrary to the way the authors seem to portray themselves, there is nothing new or revolutionary here to anyone with some background in psychology, anthropology, and biology, especially work done in these areas from feminist and queer perspectives. They are, after all, actually citing findings in these fields and their references point to other classics on this subject such as Sarah Blaffer Hrdy's Mother Nature: Maternal Instincts and How They Shape the Human Species. Big and juicy targets for the authors' snarking include pop evolutionary psychology of the David M. Buss school of thought and the projection of neoliberal economics onto pre-historic hunter-gatherer societies with their intuitively plausible, but ultimately unfounded ""rational actors"" and game theoretical models.While the above aspects of the book are a welcome corrective to the myths of monogamy, Mars and Venus that clog up the media, there are substantial flaws. There are some oversimplifications and misinterpretations of evolution in some places. However, the most irritating are the treatment of paleoanthropology and the normative tone that creeps in at some points. Anyone who's studied a bit of paleoanthropology knows that even the scholarly literature is littered with examples of authors who can't resist a bit of mythologizing and pushing pet theories and the popular literature is almost always little more than someone pushing a Hobbesian or Rousseauian agenda, to adopt Ryan and Jetha's terms. Because we in fact know so little about the social dynamics of pre-historic hunter-gatherers, Ryan and Jetha have to rely on a lot of circumstantial evidence and speculation to make their case for ""the way things really were."" This is a fatal mistake -- human pre-history covers thousands of years and multiple continents. With the diversity we see even in contemporary hunter-gatherer societies, it's very likely that there was a wide range of social arrangements and behavior in pre-history as well. ""The way things really were"" probably varied wildly from place to place and time to time. Paleoanthropologists and archaeologists have generally abandoned the search for a singular narrative because the data (and lack thereof) simply does not fit into simplistic Hobbesian or Rousseauian morality tales, no matter how much some people would like them to.Ryan and Jetha are clearly pushing a neo-Rousseauian line and, while social arrangements they describe probably did exist, there's no way to tell how typical or widespread they were. We simply don't know, and as a result, the book crosses into ""noble savage"" territory a bit too much. They also recycle Jared Diamond's ""worst mistake"" argument about agriculture. The terms ""hunter-gatherer"" and ""agriculture"" mask a lot of social complexity. The Living Anthropologically website, a good resource in general for the lay person, has a concise deconstruction of Diamond's argument:http://www.livinganthropologically.co...Some of the other evidence they present doesn't hold up. They claim bonobos are a better model for human behavior, but we are separated from both chimps and bonobos by millions of years of history and evolution. Their evidence simply doesn't justify using one or the other as a superior model. They also include the ""kamikaze sperm hypothesis,"" which was based on flimsy evidence to begin with and has been thoroughly discredited.I have to agree with biological anthropologist Patrick Clarkin: Humans are (Blank-ogamous):http://kevishere.wordpress.com/2011/0...Their slide into normative suggestions toward the end of the book is disappointing. It's nice to see a corrective to all the regressive tripe that gets pushed in the popular media, but they come off as pushing way too hard to establish their own view of ""human nature"" (whatever that may be) as the definitive truth on the matter. The idea of one true unitary ""natural"" human sexuality belongs on the ash heap of history.I guess I would say this is recommended with the above qualifications. It proves to be fun, easy, and mostly informative reading for the lay person, as long as it isn't taken as scientific gospel."

I loathed the sanctimonious condescending tone. Offensive to anyone who can take in information and think for themselves. Also, I felt that the author relied on several false dichotomies, and that plus the tone makes me wonder how much of this is based on personal agenda. I would rather have read something more impartial and scientific."

65,0061707803,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4660282-hillary-hunt,4,"This was a really fascinating read. Even if I didn’t agree with everything and felt some of the reasoning was less than compelling, it did broaden my perspective on sexuality. It instigated some good dialogue between my husband and I, and communication is always good in a relationship. Things I liked: This book is not a dry, academic tome. There are bits of wit and humor sprinkled through-out that kept the discussion light hearted. This was good for me, because it made me relaxed while considering challenging, possibly threatening issues. Humor is a great way to dispel tension, and they used it well in this book.It challenges the long held notion that men are just inherently more sexual than women. It advocates that empowered, autonomous, sexually free women create more stable, peaceful societies with content men. With the females ability to have multiples orgasms and basically last longer in the bedroom, perhaps it is we, my fellow ladies, who are designed to be having lots of sex with lots of partners. Perhaps we are designed for sperm competition, not men fighting over the right to do us exclusively. My feminist self cheered those parts.Even if you don’t want to practice a polyamorous lifestyle yourself, I think this book is useful in at least dispelling some knee jerk/jealous reactions you might have to infidelity, flirting, or your swinging neighbors. In general, I think it advocates the idea that jealous, possessive relationships are actually nothing to swoon over, despite our culture’s tendency to romanticize that kind of possessive love. Maybe we don’t have to immediately get divorced if a spouse messes around. Maybe we don’t have to see red if our spouse is flirting with someone else. Maybe we shouldn’t beat ourselves up (or our spouses) for watching porn, having sexual fantasies, checking out a hottie and what not. Maybe love is realizing you don’t own them or their sexuality and that you want them to be satisfied, not miserable for your benefit. Doesn’t mean we have to be doormats…more like we should challenge our gut reactions before we act on them. Things I didn’t like:In building their theory that our ancestors lived a more free love communal lifestyle, they pointed to several cultures that were/are polyamorous. I felt they painted an overly rosy picture of these groups; idealizing them as being more natural and beneficial, instead of just another type of culture with its own set of pro’s and con’s. In particular, I was uncomfortable with the way some of these cultures that were supposed to be “open” really just seemed like they commodified women into peace pipes to be passed around for everyone’s enjoyment. Any culture is going to have pressure to conform to social expectations that you as an individual may feel uncomfortable with. Whether it’s better or worse seems fairly subjective. I simply wasn’t buying their idealization of these sexually open groups. And I don’t know that I agree that jealousy is just a product of western culture. Certainly I think culture can enable and romanticize the feeling, but it seems too simplistic to blame it all on that. While it’s interesting to theorize that our hunter-gatherer ancestors were egalitarian and sexually promiscuous, we can’t go back to those times. We can’t erase the modern knowledge that influence our choices, even if those choices are contradictory to our instincts. We’re here now, and maybe in this landscape monogamy is what works for some people, or is simply the most reasonable? I don’t think it’s as simple as saying, “It’s not natural, therefore it isn't ideal.”But it’s great to be open minded and to challenge the status quo. It’s good to consider different options. It's a relief to consider that one's desire for sexual variety doesn't cancel out their devotion to their significant other. This book facilitates that, even if you don’t agree with everything they put out there."
66,0061707803,http://goodreads.com/user/show/204691-ryan,2,"Ordinarily I'd shelve this under science or psychology or something. But I couldn't do it. This is a weird, almost entirely awful book. This guy says it better than me: http://chronicle.com/blogs/brainstorm...They try to make the case that humans were naturally promiscuous and back in utopia, no one cared who the daddy was, and sexual jealousy is a recently learned thing that causes the world's problems. They misrepresent natural selection, genetics, evolution, evolutionary psychology, and contemporary morality. They even follow up a few chapters about women's sexual unfailing appetites with the one prescriptive chapter in the book, wherein they argue that marriages would be better if MEN were allowed to have flings with other women (it's not personal, ladies!) but don't say anything about women doing their own trouser-chasing. As a married person, I was at first scared to read this for book club (what if I found it compelling and then had to come up with reasons why I disagreed?). But the book did it all for me. Their examples of societies where people are promiscuous seem anecdotal and utopian and parsimonius/simplistic. Evolutionary psychology gives understanding to how/why we have mechanisms in our brains, not how culture and society developed in certain ways. We have a fight/flight mechanism, and it greatly helps to explain our stress response, but does not explain either how we've dealt with stress for the last 10000 years, nor if that way of dealing with stress is a good way.They try to have it both ways - saying ""we're just explaining how things were, we're not saying it's good"" but then spent most of their time talking up benefits of nomadic communal promiscuous family life. They're attempting to sweep under the rug instances of their alternative to the ""standard narrative"" causing pain/anxiety/chaos/dissolution/poor health to those involved.Their definition of monogamy and the standard narrative is a straw man. It's not Victorian English wealthy dudes versus everyone. There are a lot of benefits to expanding the family beyond just the nuclear. That doesn't mean that people would be better off sharing partners all the time. And that ALSO doesn't mean that constantly sharing partners and never longterm pair bonding was always how our ancestors did it.I don't think anyone thinks that hunter-gatherer early humans had marriage ceremonies and didn't have sex with others before bonding. There's a lot to be said for guys looking around to be with more than one women, and women looking for the athletic jerk and have the smart, devoted, nice guy take care of him. But guys are also preoccupied with paternity, and are more likely to stay around and be monogamous if they are pretty sure it's their kid. So behavior and custom developed where they were able to have more certainty of that. That's what the genes wanted. And that was more stable.Very thought-provoking, but for me, not in a productive way. I just started taking notes every time I read something that made my brain hurt."
67,0061707803,http://goodreads.com/user/show/50656-marissa,2,"I am going to admit that I did not actually finish this book because I got too enraged by it as I got deeper in. While I enjoy the evolutionary psychology take downs which abound here and I'm glad that this book is being read by many of the mega annoying evpsych trolls out there, I still ultimately found it kind of bullshit. I realize that this book is trying to market itself to a wider crowd and thus takes on some of usual pop science hobgoblins with its colloquialisms and tongue in cheek sense of humor. However, there was something about the overall tone of the book that really started to grate on me. I very much felt like the authors were not so much approaching the subject with an open attitude of objectivity, but with a desire to prove an argument with some kind of gross ulterior agendas attached. For as feminist as they seem to want you to think they are, I couldn't help being constantly put on guard the ultimate, all too familiar, all too pat thesis of ""Monogamy is almost impossible for humans to exist within because we are evolved to want sexual novelty and variety. Therefore, cut your husbands some slack, Ladies!"" Even though the authors repeatedly stress that wanting sexual novelty is not exclusive to men, but is very much true of women as well, they still fall back on old attitudes about men being the ones who are more in need of sexual adventure and who must ultimately have allowances made for them. Additionally, my critical feminist/critical race theory alert meter kept going off because of the broad generalizations they continually make about all pre-industrial societies being a certain way, without any qualifiers or allowances for the specific contexts those societies are within, possible exceptions to certain generalizable practices, or the constant bias that attaches in any analysis of pre-industrial cultures being studied in a Western post-industrial context. I also felt like we were never getting the other side of a lot of the research they quote in support of their theories, also making me somewhat wary of feeling like this book presents a full, fair picture of the science involved.  "
68,0061707803,http://goodreads.com/user/show/14716566-julia,5,"I never gave much thought to monogamy and sexuality from a historical perspective. Never really thought much about my prehistoric ancestors, period. Just figured, we evolved, our parents taught us how to behave and we do our best. I'm almost embarrassed to admit that I never cared about male/female roles in other societies. Why should I? My society knows best. Well, this book opened my eyes. I have become aware of different cultures, traditions and relationships. It led me to question my own views on promiscuity, desire, jealousy, society pressures. So thank you, it was a fantastic read.My conclusion? We are as lost as we've ever been. We are still trying to figure out male / female relationships thousands of years later! Adam and Eve, Darwin, primates.... No one really knows what the ideal relationship scenario is. We can extrapolate from skeletal remains, make assumptions from scriptures, follow tribes and at the end of the day we are more confused than ever. Just read the article below and other book reviews. They all contradict each other. Science isn't science if it is not questioned, if theories and hypothesis are not revised. I’m not disagreeing with the book simply questioning its validity and that of others.The fact is we can only do our best for us and those around us. Yes, we live in a post agricultural era where we are now bound by a multitude of constrains. But looking back and thinking, damn those tribal women had it good? Oh yes! Please send a village to rape me on my wedding day. And Bonobo monkeys get to screw like crazy? They also kill their young! It's a misguided outlook. Grass is always greener until you cross over to that side.All any of us ever wants is a connection. And once we find it we have to hold on to it with every last breath for however long we can. As for monogamy or marriage, I don't know how it is supposed to work. Who does? Clearly not these writers.

This book has a bit of science (specifically having to do with evolution) and a little bit of psychology. As much as we like to think that we're smart and intelligent and capable of making our decisions. As this book points out, so many of the things we do and feel are due to nature and thousands and millions of years of our ancestors learning how to get it right. Not those really intelligent thoughts that we're sure that we totally and utterly thought of ourselves. It's almost mind blowing to think of things that way.And sex being one of our most base behaviors is most definitely not immune to our animal behavior. While I don't agree with everything that the authors had to say (monogamy does work for some couples and they don't address same sex relationships really but obviously those happen out in the world so there has to be some reasoning). I learned a lot from this book.I know a lot of people don't like to read non-fiction because they feel that the books are often dry and feel like reading textbooks. This is most definitely not the case with this book. It's engaging and written in a sometimes amusing but always informative way that even those who have an aversion to non-fiction will probably still get something out of this book."

Unfortunately only the barest traces of a serious argument are to be found in this book, which combines polemic, sarcasm and condescension to the point that you are clear that the authors think they are right, but can't really have confidence in what they say about anyone else, particularly anyone who thinks that pair-bonding is in any way important beyond the fantasies of the fiendish conspirators who have foisted it on generations of unwilling mates.A mild strike in their favour is that they are very dismissive of Steven Pinker, who has certainly failed to convince me at all. I was also interested in the evidence presented that men in industrialised societies are producing fewer sperm, though this came at the end of so much straw-manning that I really wasn't sure I could trust it. But in general, it's a great example of how to take the very interesting discussion that one could have about polyamory, and then weaken it through the choice of rhetorical tools."

But how on earth are the authors going to hold my attention for 400 pages with this one idea?"" - they do, and then some. Sure, the authors decimate the idea of monogamy being the natural order of things, but they also poke big holes in the idea of the superiority of agrarian society, showing up the ugly double standards as destructive to both women and men, and casting an incredibly positive light onto egalitarian, <> socialist community. Along the way I learned a good deal about bonobos, about chimpanzees, about the uses and abuses of anthropology, ""flintstonization"" (look it up), & about many societies where sex is so much more than just a means to procreation, and so much less than all consuming obsession with which we torture ourselves and others. I cannot recommend this book highly enough for people interested in the history of sexuality, sex in general, culture, human history, anthropology - for everyone. "
72,0061707803,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3617921-david-schwan,4,"An original and certainly a controversial book. The central premise is that our modern view of monogamous relationships has little in common with the historic record. Earlier man lived in hunter-gatherer societies in which everything was shared, including sex partners. When man developed agriculture we became monogamous. The more interesting parts of the book dealt with the physical health of hunter-gatherer societies and how they were healthier than the later settled life of agriculture. The authors point out quite well how statistics can deceive in their discussion of the height of ancient man (look at the total data set, not the average of the data).My complaint about the book is that the writing style is too assertive. The author's could have made their point without reminding us every other page what the point was."

I had ev psych fatigue, I guess, and felt those discussions all boiled down to the same 1-2 theories. so this book is refreshing and I'm glad I read it, but I'm going to pick up The Moral Animal again now, when I feel like I need some perspective in my life and on human nature. there's a reason christopher ryan and cecilia jedtha are so cheeky in this book- they're compensating."

77,0061707803,http://goodreads.com/user/show/27609802-david-quijano,3,"'Sex at Dawn: The Prehistoric Origins of Modern Sexuality,' by Christopher Ryan and Cacilda Jetha, initially grabbed my attention because of the title. I honestly didn’t know what to expect from it, but because of it’s so-so ratings on Goodreads (under 4 stars when I bought it), I assumed it would be a boring book filled with hard science. In actuality, it was almost the opposite. This is really a pop science book with some attention to actual science, but a lot of smug, casual editorializing.The premise of 'Sex at Dawn' is relatively simple. In terms of DNA, humans are closest to chimps and bonobos. Prior to the agricultural revolution, our sexual practices would have looked a lot like that of those two animal groups. With the advent of the agricultural revolution, humans created social structures (monogamous marriage) that were unnatural to us and are often the source of much misery. Over the years, we’ve convinced ourselves that monogamy is natural, and can’t understand why we can’t keep it in our pants or why our divorce rate is so high. Though the authors claim they are not advocating for any particular way of thinking about modern sex, I thought they pretty clearly advocated against monogamous marriage and were annoying about it. And this is coming from someone who already thinks monogamous marriage is unnatural.Despite the editorializing, the evidence in the book strongly supports much of the premise. Prior to the agricultural revolution, humans lived in groups of about 150 individuals or fewer. Rather than monogamous marriage, these groups would have indiscriminate sex with each other (like chimps and bonobos). Additionally, these people lived off the land and would move as seasons changed and climate patterns required them to. The authors argue that these groups lived wonderful, stress-free lives, with better life expectancy than we assume, tons of sex, and very little physical work.This is the second book I’ve read in recent years that tried to frame hunter-gather life as easy, and I have to tell you, I’m still not buying it. I do think the point is critical to the argument they advance in their book. The authors spent many pages trying to prove the point. I am not entirely sure why, but I guess in their minds, if hunter-gatherer life was terrible, as most people believe, then why would we look to them for any kind of wisdom about sex? If, by contrast, their lives were much better than previously assumed, maybe we should adopt at least some aspects of their lives.I don’t want to spend too much time attacking the idea that hunter-gatherers lived great lives, but I can’t help myself. For one, the authors say that finding food was very easy for these people. If that is true, why did anyone ever start farming? It is really the most basic question to the claim that farming ruined humanity, yet it is never convincingly addressed. Also, why did the human population increase drastically after humans started farming? Was it because they finally had a surplus of food? No, the authors argue. Despite food supposedly being very easy to find, hunter-gatherers practiced wide-spread infanticide in order to control their population and allow themselves to live easy lives. This is a convenient way to explain away the high infant mortality in pre-historic times which is usually blamed on a lack of food. Regardless of the true reason for the high infant mortality, I am not sure any explanation proves the underlying point - that hunter-gathers lived good lives. Whether your children are dying of starvation or you are killing them because you don’t want to find food for them, your life is objectively terrible.One last point about hunter-gatherers. If that lifestyle is so great, why doesn’t anyone choose to become a hunter-gatherer today? After all, wouldn’t it be cool to not have to work, spend a lot of time outside, and be able to feed yourself by scrounging around for food for a couple hours a day? Of course not! There are people like that and it’s called being homeless. Until these academics give up their air conditioning for living under a tarp down by the river, I won’t take this claim seriously.The authors do make some good points regarding the sexual practices of hunter-gathers. They use a couple of different sources of information to come to these conclusions. Take anatomy as an example. Most people think that human sexuality is based around alpha males - the idea that a lot of women want to mate with a relatively small number of men. The problem with that idea is that species who behave this way usually have bigger disparities between the size of their males and females. The male gorilla, as an example, is almost twice the size of the female gorilla. By contrast, human males are only about 10% taller than human females. On the surface, this seemed like a very good point, but the more I thought about it, the less sense it made. When discussing gorillas, they cited weight, when discussing humans they cited height. Human males are much more than 10% larger than human females if using weight - more like 25-30% larger. Still not as big of a difference as with gorillas, but maybe enough to make the idea of the alpha male model more true with humans that they would like to admit. The authors were clearly trying to inflate their argument, in a way that I thought was pretty dishonest and unnecessary. There are other characteristics that help prove the author's argument for humans not being alpha-centric including the large size of our species' testicles and even the relatively long duration of sex.The testicle size of human males is especially important. It implies human males are expected to make frequent and regular deposits (so to speak) in women. Since the ability to make sperm far outpaces what is necessary to impregnate one woman, this must mean males are meant to make regular deposits in multiple women. Additionally, since we are not an alpha-centric species (where one man fights for the right to mate with all the women), it means the competition for procreation happens at the sperm level. It is as gross as it sounds.Let me paint a fuller picture here. As a species, humans traditionally lived in groups of fewer than 150 people where the men continuously engage in gang bangs (they cite research that suggests women have loud orgasms to attract more potential mates) on the various women in the tribe. After everyone is “done,” the sperm from the various tribesmen fight for the ability to create children that you will most likely end up killing anyway. What a paradise.Maybe this is how everyone lived ten thousand years ago. I don’t have a problem with describing how people probably lived. I do have a problem with pretending this was good or preferable when compared to living as an early farmer or even today. And I definitely have a problem with them leaving out a couple important bits of information. For one, the description of the indiscriminate sex of hunter-gatherers ignores the most objectionable aspect of that way of life. If you are in a group of 150 people where everyone has sex with everyone else (to the point where you wouldn’t know the identity of the father for a given child), you are going to be closely related to the vast majority of people in that group. This means when you and your bros are going at it with that one hot chick in the tribe, they might literally be your brothers and uncles and the girl could easily be a sister or aunt. The authors leave this fact out, probably because it would create sympathy for the Christian colonizers who made people stop having sex with their family members.There is also a serious issue with the consent in the sexual arrangements of hunter-gatherers. The authors cite different modern-day tribes who have promiscuous sexual practices similar to what they assumed existed in pre-modern humans. To their credit, the authors clearly state that these cultures have social pressures against being a prude or saying no to sex. I don’t know how that is any more preferable or natural than a society that has pressures to limit sexual promiscuity. Imagine a bunch of your half brothers and cousins wanting to have sex with you and you cannot say no. Again, I don’t think it is a coincidence they left these ideas out of this book. Literally, no informed person would think this is a good or desirable outcome for any society.Another issue the authors left unaddressed is that many of us are thousands of years removed from tribal living. Even if monogamy was completely unnatural ten thousand years ago, it wouldn’t necessarily be that way today. It is possible that even a couple hundred years of half-hearted monogamy would lead to evolutionary changes that could make people more capable of adopting a monogamous lifestyle. To their credit, the authors do cite some evidence that shows natural selection is still alive and well within the human race, but they never entertain the idea that it could be shifting our sexual practices. Instead, they insist, that monogamy is a social construct, which leads to my final criticism.The authors rely heavily on the idea that natural is good and unnatural (including social constructs) are bad. That isn’t true. Natural is not inherently good. Unnatural is not inherently bad. What does natural even mean? Is brushing your teeth natural? Does the answer to that question determine whether or not someone should brush their teeth? Or should a person brush their teeth, regardless?Similarly, a lot of people want to sleep around, but they’re willing to give up that for the right person. They may not do it perfectly, and I do think it is important to be self-aware enough to know why. This book does a good job of explaining why monogamy is difficult. It doesn’t explain why monogamy shouldn’t be considered ideal, though. It just assumes that since it isn’t natural, that it isn’t good.Naturally, I want to eat and drink unlimited amounts of pizza and beer all day, every day. In this sense, I think I would fit in pretty well with these lazy hunter-gatherers the authors love so much. I think most people would to a certain extent. But we also know a lot more than these pre-historic people and live in a completely different world. All of which makes the idealization of them a moot point in my opinion.I went back and forth with whether to give this book three or four stars. I was really put off by certain aspects of this book. I thought arguments were exaggerated at times, obvious questions weren’t asked, and basic points completely ignored if they didn’t fit the desired narrative. At the same time, I think there were enough good, thought-provoking ideas to almost warrant four stars. This isn’t a perfect book, but regardless of what you believe, it will challenge you and you will most likely learn something you didn’t know before (unless you are a big anthropology nerd). Three stars."

Or, at least, that is what would be termed the ""standard narrative"". I use this here not in the sense of the authors (who do like that terminology), but rather as the generic cultural framework in which we exist -- and in which our existence, in many a way, has been made very difficult (though primarily for half of the population only).The authors use a wide range of prehistoric evidence and modern tribal existence in order to support their statements, the most common of which would be, to paraphrase it by my understanding, that sex, sexuality and sexual preferences should not be used to ostracise or exclude. I enjoyed the evidential background to the work, and some of the statements were convincing enough to make me want to investigate them and their framework in more detail, especially where concerned with the lifestyle of the prehistoric man and how this survived and changed with the evolution of man into a property holder.A number of counter-arguments are brought in throughout the entire work, and this is quite enjoyable as obviously one who tries to refute their opponent by the use of facts and statistics is made to sound more convincing than one who doesn't. What I missed, perhaps, was a bit more solid statistical basis for some of the statements (say numbers of extant tribes do 'X', has declined/increased/etc), but I don't have any knowledge whether such datasets even exist.What the book does achieve, therefore, is bringing the debate about sexuality to a more approachable baseline. However, with this activity comes a bit of an interesting thought exercise and that concerns itself with the mainstream arguments: ""In whose interests is it?"" This is not a question I am going to answer here, but it is something I would recommend the intrepid reader to ask themselves when reading this work (and other ones!) and noting interesting facts.I'll just add that it is entirely possible all the arguments herein are absolute bollocks. Either way, it's an interesting concept to think about and I would encourage people to give it a try. Lastly, I cannot leave unmentioned that one of the chapter introductions was a quote of Kahlil Gibran. Well chosen!Originally posted here."

Firstly, making a comparison between contemporary hunter-gatherer societies and hunter-gatherer societies from the distant past is just not scientific in any way. Every society changes, industrial societies of China and USA changed each in their unique way. Even more similar industrial societies developed differently, like France and UK. In the same way hunter-gatherer societies change even without any big technological developments, they have different social developments. Also, this book glorifies to live in peace with nature, to live in egalitarian societies. Why am I against that? Well, libtards and their ilk might want to live in peace with nature, but I like the sewer system, I like my huge apartment with hot water and my nice bed. I do not want to live in nature or in peace with nature. I am glad that forests with wolves, lynxes and bears are far away from me. Why am I against egalitarian societies? Two words. North Korea.North Korea is not a hunter-gatherer society. Yes. But I do not want to live in the bushes, I am proud to be part of Babylonian heritage. This book glorifies the egalitarian and green lifestyle of our ancestors because it was through that more sexual free. Hunter-gatherers are just like bonobos, that is the main assumption of the authors. Isn t that a little bit racist? This book is against monogamy because the authors think that most of human history (the hunter-gatherer period of it) humans lived in small squads where everybody screw everyone. The authors give a lot of reasons for their idea, I do not have the time and space to dwell them. Among them is one that says that human men have the biggest penises among all big apes and that the monogamous gorilla has a penis of only 5 cm. Supposedly human men developed big penises because they needed to give pleasure to horny women. Really? What a luminous thought.Some aspects of the book are more interesting. But you need to find them yourselves because my review ends.Cheers from the Balkans!"

81,0061707803,http://goodreads.com/user/show/55881969-christopher-porzenheim,2,"I'd like to offer a reason why this book is so controversial without agreeing or disagreeing with the authors views of natural human sexuality. I say that despite the authors claims to the contrary, they are telling us how we should live our sex lives. This is why this book is so controversial, nobody appreciates being told why and how to have sex unless its the way they are already doing it. Here's my proof:When you describe what 'something is,' perhaps by using the language of science or mathematics, this is fundamentally different from when we describe what 'something ought to be.' 'Ought' is the language of moral argument. 'Is' is the language of objective or empirical statements.You can't derive an 'ought' from and 'is' and call the result 'science.' For example, I love bosc pears. But its not 'science' if I observe that some pears are bosc pears and that therefore all pears ought to be bosc pears. This is just wishful thinking. Whether we notice it or not, whenever we say what human nature 'is' we are saying what humans 'ought' to do. Statements about human nature are moral arguments. Because moral arguments rely on 'ought' you cannot scientifically prove them in the same way that you can prove a gasoline powered car requires gasoline to run. Try turning a car on without fuel. There is no empirically valid test for human nature, nor can there ever be. If this book just presented itself as a 'scientific presentation of early humans mating habits,' whether or not the authors understood the science they cited properly, this book wouldn't have been so controversial. This book is controversial because it makes moral arguments about human nature and how we ought to lead our sex lives cloaked in the language of science. So despite the fact that the authors say otherwise, they are suggesting a certain sexual lifestyle. You gotta love the authors hypocrisy, because they bemoan moral arguments about sexuality as often as they accuse other scientists of letting their moral prejudices about human nature get in the way of 'science.' Only because this book is written with such snark and misplaced wit, I give not 1 but 2 stars. It was at least pleasant to read, if as substantial as passing wind."
82,0061707803,http://goodreads.com/user/show/28867353-natanel,4,"It was a good read. I overall enjoyed it. The evolutional psychology theory that we are not a monogamous species is credible. It's fun to think that we should embrace our nature and just be non-monogamous. The most important for me is to find out what is true to me. Rather this theory sounds true for some or not, it doesn't really matter unless you're doing research in the field I guess. For readers, it's a good way to challenge some classical views about marriage and our western societies views of relationships. As a bonus, reading that book in an airplane I had a very interesting moment and discussion with the person seating next to me when she saw the title of the chapter I was on "" a Penis is just a penis"" ... we ended up having a lovely discussion, the kind I would not expect having with a stranger on a plane. "
83,0061707803,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4362792-manish,4,"I took a lot of notes while reading this book. But overall, my comprehension of  his hypothesis is still based on an intuitive understanding . Ryan argues that the idea of women being coy and men being the aggressive pursuer of sex is a flawed understanding of sex. Agreed! To explain this, he goes into breaking apart the theories and assumptions of numerous writers including Darwin, Hobbes, Rousseau and Matt Ridley. Ryan argues that it was agriculture that led to serial monogamy becoming the order of the day. The latter part of the book had some biological explanations - how sperm competition was the 'original' way for human propogation, why men ejaculate quickly while women can manage multiple orgasms, the significance of women's loud shrieks during intercourse and so on.  "
84,0061707803,http://goodreads.com/user/show/58000417-ali-benam,4,"While reading this book I noticed a rebuttal book aimed at Ryan & Jethá named 'Sex at Dusk', so I started to compare the arguments made in both books.Ryan & Jethá accuse the researchers supporting the 'standard narrative', of a concept named 'confirmation bias', yet they seem to have fallen in the very same trap. Still, so does the author of 'Sex at Dusk'.I have to say, with all of the flaws 'Dawn' seems to have, it raises some serious questions about the sexual behavior of modern human and suggests a revolutionary theory."
85,0061707803,http://goodreads.com/user/show/49763531-khoa,4,"An analytical book about human sexual history. The idea promoted by the book basically is about how human sexuality is misaligned with the morality of modern society. The one who recommended me this book says people should read this book to have more open-minded thinking about intercourse and infidelity. I think that person is right. However, in the end, the most important thing is that we understand the reasons and make an informed, personalized decision, not simply follow what the conventional script the society puts before us."

88,0061707803,http://goodreads.com/user/show/50780228-sarah-ames-foley,5,"This review can also be found on my blog.I've read some of the criticisms of this book, and also recognize that it was published almost a decade ago and may be a bit outdated. Regardless, it's nice to read a book that validates your sexuality and makes you feel more ""normal"" than society at large might have you believe. As a queer, polyamorous woman I thought this was a really good starting point to learn about human sexuality. I'll certainly be picking up some other works and doing further research, but I found this book to be well-written, humorous, and just what I needed."
89,0061707803,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8081637-m-rt,5,"The message of Sex at Dawn is: Don't beat yourself up over liking multiple people - it is natural, it's what humans have evolved to do!This is easily one of my favourite books in recent years, brimming with fascinating information from a range of sources about the sexual evolution of humans: from anthropology (historical and current pre-agricultural societies), primates (chimps, bonobos), human anatomy, and contemporary psycho-sexuality (sexual issues, fetishes).If you have limited time, I recommend the 14-min TED talk (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LJhkl...), this 27 min interview (http://vimeo.com/16031664) and this 46 min interview (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sZ_fH...) to capture the main ideas. There's more material available at the site (http://chrisryanphd.com), although I would definitely read/listen to the book!Humans evolved in a group hunter-gatherer setting for over 100,000 years where sharing everything, including sexual partners and children, was the best survival strategy. This changed when agriculture came around at about 10,000 years BC, and men started hoarding property, which besides land and cattle also started to include women in order to control their sexuality to secure the paternity of the kids to pass the property down to. This was when monogamy was ""invented"".Nowadays, the expectation of spending your life in sexual exclusivity with one person and the resulting societal ""scarcity of sex"" is a source of much frustration, deceit, violence and low self-esteem, and leads to people blaming themselves or their relationships for not being fully happy. The authors of the book are careful not to pretend that they have the answers, but to urge these issues to be approached with compassion and with consideration to the actual make-up of the minds and bodies of human beings.The book presents a compelling mountain of evidence that humans have evolved primarily to treat sex as not only a device for reproduction (humans have sex more then 1000 times per birth and pretty much at all times, while most mammals have this number at 12 and only during the female's ovulation) but as a social device to bond and enhance relationships. People are wired to be naturally attracted to the new stuff: new music, new places, new people.There are many gems in the book, including stories of encounters with pre-agricultural societies, description of Darwin as a very ignorant ""proper"" Victorian man who likely did not have sex before his thirties, WW2 fighter pilots with 25% fatality rate being the first ""wife swappers"" in the US, the 5th domestic electric appliance created having been a vibrator which cured females from ""hysteria"" aka lack of orgasms, music terms ""funk"" and ""jazz"" being derived from the vocabulary of sex, men in their 40s and 50s running low on testosterone which would get a ""refill"" with a new affair, evolutionary conclusions drawn from inspecting the anatomy of human genitalia, etc etc.In the end, with all the evidence Sex at Dawn encourages us to consider that sex does not have to be such a big deal, and to be more open about it. From a personal perspective, I've spent some time in groups where women were sexually just as empowered as men, and as the authors state, it tends to lead to a much more tolerant, happier group.Due to its ""popular science"" approach and controversial nature, Sex at Dawn has received a fair amount of criticism. There is a nice summary of it here: http://www.amazon.com/review/RPE20JIL..."
