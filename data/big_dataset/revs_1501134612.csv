0,1501134612,http://goodreads.com/user/show/47571190-beata,4,"Having read several books on this catastrophe, I was tempted yet again to learn more about the disaster which affected directly, among others, my country to a still unknown degree. The Midnight in Chernobyl is one of the best non-fiction that you can read in order to obtain the most insightful and detailed account into the reasons behind the explosion, but it offers more. The Author tells the story of the nuclear ambitions during the communist era in the USSR, describes the building process of both the reactors and the dream-like city for the employees and their families, gives thorough minute-after-minute chronicle of the fateful night of April 25, 1986, and reports on the cleaning up process. I was, as always, shaken by the way the disaster impacted the lives of hundreds of thousands of ordinary people, both civilians and those who were liquidators ……. If you know little about what happened in Chernobyl on that night, I recommend this title. "
1,1501134612,http://goodreads.com/user/show/68708752-beverly,4,"Surreal and demoralizing, Midnight in Chernobyl tells the true story of the worst nuclear accident in the history of the world. This statement by one of the officers from the Department of Internal Affairs of the former USSR sums it up. He wrote in the official log on that horrible morning, about six hours after the explosion, at 7:07 a.m., that"" . . . The situation is normal. The radiation level is rising. ""These two opposing statements tell the story of a group of bureaucrats so invested in their careers and frozen by shock that the manager of the plant never gave the order to evacuate the town of Pripyat which was 2 miles away. The leaders of the plant were crazed and couldn't or wouldn't act to save lives, those of their workers or the town's people. They also actively sought to cover it up. This criminal negligence was also done by the government of the USSR. They hid the accident from the world and also their own people.They also started looking for scapegoats. The design of the reactors (there were four online and 2 more being built at Chernobyl )were faulty from the start, because of their unsafe design. Many physicists had pointed out 2 major problems with them, but were ignored. Later, it was acknowledged that several smaller accidents had happened with these reactors in different places in Soviet Russia, but had been hushed up. As a member of the IAEA, the Soviets were supposed to report any nuclear accidents, but secrecy was king.The designers of this particular reactor had ignored 10 years of warnings.Also, and this is horrific, apparently, radiation poisoning was not understood well by the workers or the plant managers who had little to no safety equipment, no high powered showers, many men injured in the plant wore the same canvas uniforms for days before being treated. One poor man had walked through radioactive waste water and his skin came off in strips later. After the accident was over, they sent firefighters directly into the building without protection.These same plant workers who suffered cruel deaths in mere days and weeks after the accident were later found guilty and blamed for the accident and their heroic sacrifice to try and shut down the reactor were not recognized until recently. There had been mistakes made, but if a safe shutdown system had been designed, the reactor would have never melted down. This accident and its effect on the economy was one of the things that eventually lead to the breakdown of the former Soviet Union."
2,1501134612,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3672777-nataliya,5,"I’ve been deeply fascinated with Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant Explosion ever since I read Svetlana Alexievich’s brilliant and deeply soul-crushing Voices from Chernobyl: The Oral History of a Nuclear Disaster that was indeed the people’s story of a true catastrophe. Since then I’ve read a number of books on the disaster - and for reasons strange and unfathomable even to my weird brain HBO brilliant miniseries “Chernobyl” became for me a kind of a comfort watch — a disturbing, soul-crushing, painful “comfort watch”. Maybe it hits home, me being a kid at the time and living relatively speaking not that far (but thankfully far enough!) from the site of the tragedy. Maybe it’s remembering the stories my mom used to tell how in the Chernobyl summer our close relatives in the areas of Belarus less than 100 miles away from the disaster site noted how very large and pretty and delicious the mushrooms and berries were, not connecting the lushness of nature with the radiation effects. Maybe I just get obsessed easily with morbid situations. I don’t know - but by now I’ve read a few tomes about the disaster, and Higginbotham’s book, although stopping just a bit short of the excellence reached by Serhii Plokhy in his brilliantly researched Chernobyl: The History of a Nuclear Catastrophe, is still quite excellent.
“The temperature inside the reactor rose to 4,650 degrees centigrade—not quite as hot as the surface of the sun.”
It is not easy not only to describe a tragedy but also to make the readers easily understand the science behind the faulty reactor and the Swiss-cheese model chain of events that led to it. It’s not easy to strike a balance between laying the groundwork, explaining the science, describing the political background usually not too familiar for non-Soviets, and still keeping it engaging and interesting and easy to follow. Adam Higginbotham does a very good job with it.
“The roof of the twenty-story building had been torn open, its upper levels blackened and collapsed into heaps of rubble. They could see shattered panels of ferroconcrete, tumbled blocks of graphite, and, here and there, the glinting metal casings of fuel assemblies from the core of a nuclear reactor. A cloud of steam drifted from the wreckage into the sunlit sky.”“Graphite blocks that had once formed the core of the reactor lay everywhere—some turned white, perhaps by the heat of the explosion, but otherwise intact. Around them, levels of radiation reached as much as 10,000 roentgen an hour: enough for a fatal dose in less than three minutes.”
——————————The recipe for Chernobyl nuclear disaster in a nutshell:(view spoiler)[ - Human error - the initial desperate convenient scapegoat: The test run at the time of the explosion was botched due to numerous factors including human error, unforgiving hierarchy, fear of retribution, fear to admit a mistake, lack of accountability and transparency, and lack of understanding the consequences of mishandling the supposedly super-safe reactor due to overarching secrecy in which the nuclear program and its failures have been shrouded. “But it soon became clear that neither the design of the reactor nor the long trail of accidents and institutional cover-ups that preceded the disaster would be considered by the court. Although none of the accused was tortured to confess or brought to the stand to denounce counterrevolutionary activity, no one doubted the outcome of the proceedings: it effectively became one of the final show trials in the history of the Soviet Union.” 
- Unsafe RBMK reactor: The botched test tested the limits of the unwieldy and unsafe reactor which had multiple faults including its unmanageable size and terrifyingly dangerous positive void coefficient, and the emergency shutdown button which in certain condition could turn reactor into a bomb - but the reactor nevertheless continued to be used because it was cheap to make, and accidents were kept secret, and any modifications to improve safety were either not done or the reasoning for them not made clear to the operators because of neverending state secrecy. “This problem was especially pronounced during start-up and shutdown, when the reactor was operating at low power—and the systems designed to detect reactivity within the core proved unreliable. During these crucial periods, the engineers at their desks in the control room became almost totally blind to what was happening inside the active zone. Instead of reading their instruments, they were forced to estimate the levels of activity in the core, using “experience and intuition.” This made start-up and shutdown the most demanding and treacherous stages of RBMK operation.”“While conducting tests before the two reactors could be brought into normal operation, the start-up teams of nuclear engineers in Ignalina and Chernobyl noticed a small but disturbing glitch. When they used the AZ-5 scram button to shut down the reactor, the control rods began their descent into the core, but instead of completing a smooth shutdown, the rods initially had the opposite effect: for a brief moment, reactor power rose instead of falling.”
- The faulty bureaucratic secrecy-ridden stagnant state system: And all this made possible and potentiated by the state and political system steeped in secrecy, inefficiency, and retribution — which immediately responded with the attempts to pretend that a global disaster did not happen. “In 1980 NIKIET completed a confidential study that listed nine major design failings and thermohydraulic instabilities which undermined the safety of the RBMK reactor. The report made it clear that accidents were not merely possible under rare and improbable conditions but also likely in the course of everyday operation. Yet they took no action to redesign the reactor or even to warn plant personnel of its potential hazards.”“Meanwhile, every accident that did occur at a nuclear station in the Soviet Union continued to be regarded as a state secret, kept even from the specialists at the installations where they occurred.”
 (hide spoiler)]—————And so it led to the reactor that exploded, a city of 50,000 just 3 kilometers away (and densely populated Ukrainian capital only a couple of hours from there), basking in the radiation glow that existed no matter how much the officials and the nomenklatura wished it didn’t, and there was no good way or plan or any idea how to deal with the potential catastrophic contamination that has never happened before. Eventual city evacuation and the creation of the (eventually much expanded) exclusion zone resulted, followed by attempts at containment and cleanup (some useless, some excellent, and some involving the chilling concept of “bio-robots”), and now online you can find the slowly crumbling ghost town of Pripyat partially reclaimed by nature and the world’s loneliest creepiest Ferris Wheel.  “And even the machines intended for use on the surface of the moon were no match for the inhospitable new landscape they encountered on the roof of the ruined plant. Their artificial brains scrambled, their wheels stuck in the bitumen, hung up on blocks of masonry or snarled in their own cables, one by one the robots all stuttered to a halt.”
—————Yes, it’s hard to create a good balance between historical accuracy, presentation of scientific concepts and still maintaining interest and readability for the non-physicist reader. Higginbotham does well, keeping the dense material still easy to read and follow. The science is explained well. But what takes skill is the depiction of political climate, the nomenklatura, the intricacies of heavy Soviet bureaucracy and party apparatus. After all, Chernobyl explosion, coverup, cleanup and the aftermath are considered some of the reasons behind the collapse of the Soviet State, and showing the foundation that the cracks took down is important. 
“Reactor Number Four was gone. In its place was a simmering volcano of uranium fuel and graphite—a radioactive blaze that would prove all but impossible to extinguish.”
For now the reactor at the decommissioned Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant lies quietly, with the desperately constructed enveloping sarcophagus for now safely resting within the recently build sleek hangar of the New Safe Confinement — and we still have no clue what to with it in a century. For now a reasonably-priced and supposedly safe guided tour to the dead city of Pripyat can provide you with an opportunity to take a cool selfie with the tragedy as your backdrop. For now, we still have no idea what the constant low-level radiation exposure actually does, as the studies have always focused on the Hiroshima model, not very applicable in this situation.Safety for us, humans, is a fragile thing. ————————Some other quite interesting books about Chernobyl nuclear explosion and its effects that I think are excellent:- Voices from Chernobyl: The Oral History of a Nuclear Disaster by Svetlana Alexievich;- Chernobyl: The History of a Nuclear Catastrophe by Serhii Plokhy;- Manual for Survival: An Environmental History of the Chernobyl Disaster by Kate Brown."

I couldn't have told you anything more than that. When my friend Beata reviewed this book, I realised how ignorant I was on this topic. The review was enticing and I decided to read this book. How happy I am that I did! Shout out to Beata!Midnight in Chernobyl reads like an apocalyptic thriller; I did not want to put this book down! Wow! Author Adam Higginbotham certainly did his homework. This book is full of so much information about this, the worst nuclear accident in world history. He tells of how the USSR cut corners during construction of their nuclear power plants in order to save money. How the operators were ignorant of the risks and not properly trained. How, during a rundown experiment of one of the reactors at Chernobyl there was an explosion. How the men at the plant bravely risked their lives to put out the ensuing fire, several losing their lives and many others becoming gravely ill and suffering severe radiation burns. Mr. Higginbotham takes us on a nail-biting, hair-raising ride, detailing the fight to contain the fire and how many of those in charge were in denial of the severity of the accident. It was anxiety-inducing to read how they delayed evacuation of the citizens of nearby Pripyet because they didn't want word of the catastrophe to get out to the wider world. It is absolutely horrifying how they allowed so many people to be exposed to dangerous levels of radiation and I just kept wanting to race back through time and warn those poor people!The book goes on to tell of the clean-up and investigation of the accident, and of the later repercussions to both humans and animals (a total of 20,000 domestic and agricultural animals were killed by huntsmen due to their radiation levels). The cleanup was vast, exposing even more people to the radioactive material. However, ""only ten square kilometers of the zone would ever be truly decontaminated. A total cleanup would have required nearly six hundred million tonnes of topsoil to have been removed and buried as nuclear waste.""I learned so much from this book and found it absolutely riveting. I highly recommend it to anyone who would like to learn more about this incredible tragedy. "

[Evgeny Velikhov] asked Deputy Minister Silayev to call Gorbachev with a message: ""Tell him that our outhouse is overflowing, and they'll have to climb a mountain of shit.""
Midnight in Chernobyl is a comprehensive account of the events leading up to and resulting from the meltdown of Reactor Number Four at Chernobyl power station. It details not only the technical failures that led to the meltdown, but also the interpersonal dynamics and prevailing attitudes of secrecy and sycophancy within the USSR governmental structure that contributed to the disaster. It also explores the subsequent confusion around how to contain the nuclear fallout and the monumental efforts by so many firefighters, plant operators, scientists, doctors, and ordinary citizens to undo the damage and save lives.I went in knowing almost nothing about Chernobyl, and found it absolutely fascinating and eye-opening. The author did a great job building a cohesive narrative out of what must have been hundreds of people's testimonies and a considerable amount of data, likely obscured by secrecy and the passage of time. I found I had no trouble understanding the technical explanations around how the reactor worked and what led to its ultimate meltdown.One of the things I found most interesting is the book's exploration of the part that cultural and interpersonal dysfunctions played in contributing to and exacerbating the after-effects of the meltdown. 
When General Pikalov... forecast the decontamination work would take up to seven years to complete... the hardline Politburo member Yegor Ligachev exploded in fury. He told Pikalov he would have seven months.""And if you haven't done it by then, we'll relieve you of your Party card!""""Esteemed Yegor Kuzmich,"" the general replied, ""if that is the situation, you needn't wait seven months to take my Party card. You can have it now.""
There were so many nuggets of gold like this one within the book. The focus on each individual person, and their motivations and emotions, brought them to life on the pages. It turned what could have been a dry nonfiction account into a captivating read.If you've ever been curious about what happened at Chernobyl, I highly recommend this book. It's accessible to the layman, and contains so many insightful and often inadvertently humorous passages on what went so horribly wrong and the heroic effort to set it right. Especially at this time, when we are all dealing with a viral disaster in the making, it can offer a bit of relief to escape and read about a completely different disaster from the past."
5,1501134612,http://goodreads.com/user/show/16254355-matthew,4,"Growing up during the 80s and the final stages of the cold war I remember many, big defining stories in the 80s and early 90s. Reagan vs Gorbachev. The arms race. The fall of the Berlin Wall. But, probably the biggest event with the longest lasting impact is the Chernobyl disaster.While the Berlin Wall falling was a big deal and has had a lasting impact on the political climate in Europe, there are very few remaining sections, some memorials, but any lasting visible impact is mainly relegated to history books and museums. Chernobyl, on the other hand, has led to thousands of square miles of land that are still uninhabitable to this day and will be for decades to come. Entire shells of cities crumbling - barley touched since the hours after the event. A gigantic metal and concrete sarcophagus concealing rubble that is too hot to move or cleanup and sits concealed as it was just moments after the reactor was destroyed.Midnight in Chernobyl is the story of that fateful night and the months afterward. I have always been very interested in learning more about this event and was excited to finally read this. It has me even more intrigued to watch the recent HBO mini-series. I learned so much from this book and now it is much more than just stark pictures online and a footnote from my childhood.Two things to be aware of going in if you are interested in checking this out. First, it does get very technical and scientific at times. This may interest you or you may just need to push through it and say ""okay, yeah, nuclear science stuff - okay, got it!"" Second, there are LOTS of characters so there are LOTS of Russian names. This can be difficult to keep track of. There is a list of these at the beginning to help you keep track, but the list is pretty daunting, too.If you like history, remember this from your childhood and want to know more, or a big fan of disaster books/movies, this book is 100% worth checking out."
6,1501134612,http://goodreads.com/user/show/111566858-greta,5,"Chernobyl- The thriller-like account of the disaster and it‘s aftermath On 25 April 1986 the technicians prepared to do a routine maintenance test at Chernobyl’s reactor No 4, designed to showcase the Soviet Union’s scientific prowess. The purpose of the test was to simulate what would happen during an electrical blackout. The senior engineer Leonid Toptunov was in the control room and began to power down.For a few seconds everything was normal. But then there was a roar and the plant began to tremble. A shift overseer watched with astonishment how the reactor’s fuel caps started to bounce up and down, before the entire thing exploded, destroyed the nuclear core and blew off the plant’s concrete roof.Explosion of reactor block 4 26. April 1986 More than 30 years later, Adam Higginbotham tells the story of the disaster and its horrible aftermath in a thriller-like flair. It‘s is a story of cover ups, irresponsibility, confusion, lies and doomed ambition, favoring Communist party leaders of the UdSSR and bailing on engineers, factory workers, fire fighters, soldiers and civilians.The mechanical engineer Alexander Yuvchenko was on duty that day and one of the first to fully comprehend the scale of the catastrophe. He saw rubble, a roofless cavern and thick severed cables swaying with electric sparks. There was a “shimmering pillar of ethereal blue-white light, reaching straight up into the night sky, disappearing into infinity”, which was the radioactive ionisation of air. The atomic contents of the reactor were spilling into the atmosphere and a terrifiing cloud emerged that blew north until reaching Sweden, causing mystification and panic.Evacuation after 2 days. The citizens were let to believe that they would return soon.The response of the USSR was a nightmare. Viktor Bryukhanov, who was the director of Chernobyl, simply refused to accept the radiation readings reported to him. He didn‘t gave out an official warning and Ukraine’s regional chiefs refused to evacuate, while the politburo in Moscow downplayed the crisis, highly alarmed at losing face before the international community and appearance.“every accident that did occur at a nuclear station in the Soviet Union continued to be regarded as a state secret, kept even from the specialists at the installations where they occurred.” It took 2 days before the citizens around the reactor were informed that anything happened and were evacuated. Before they cut the telephone lines, silenced the propaganda radio, but despite that everything was as usual. The ambulances that were driving to the plant were doing so in the middle of the night without alarm to not seek attention. People were sitting in parks, children were playing in contaminated sand and everyone enjoyed a summer day in open air, breathing in radiation. When the order to move inhabitants out of Pripyat (the model city built next to the plant for the factory workers) finally came, the citizens were bussed out. They were told to go for approximately three days, not for the rest of their lives and left all belongings behind. A woman came home from a weekend away to find a ghost town, with nothing but pets, which were abandoned because their fur was contaminated. Counterproductive attempts of putting out the fire and cooling In between all the bureaucratic incompetence were scenes of stunning bravery of those who understood that their life was ending and tried to safe everyone. Helicopter pilots dumped tons of sand and other materials into the reactor to quell its burning red core. Before they dumped water on it, that only evaporated, increasing the radioactivity in the air even more. After each trip, crews would strip off their clothes and decontaminate as best they could. Others wore their contaminated clothes for 24h, kneeled in contaminated water, used their bare hands and were sleeping next to the reactor, while doing 16h shifts. The pilots were vomiting between their flights and knew that what they were doing was deadly. Some managed to flee, others were threatened with their life if they didn‘t continue. When they returned to their aircraft the next day they found the surrounding grass had gone yellow. They knew that what they were doing wasn‘t working, the reactor kept burning. Still they kept on doing what they were told because the UdSSR government couldn‘t appear not to have the situation under control and take action. They were massively afraid of the ""China Syndrome"" a core meltdown that would set the other reactors on fire as well and burn through the ground, affecting all water lines up to the sea. Looking back almost none of the actions they took proofed successful.The empty city today, most belongings were left behind and started to perishThey tried to keep the accident a secret to all means, which backfired. During the explosion only one factory worker died and one was missing, but The New Yorker wrote of 2000 death and mass graves, stating that the UdSSR would spread false information. They did, but the worldwide media did much worse. They didn‘t have an accurate picture of what was happening and the impacts but spread wrong informations anyways. It took two and a half weeks before Gorbachev officially acknowledged on tv that a nuclear accident has occurred. Meanwhile 25 injured factory workers and fire fighter were flown off to Moscow for radiation sickness, without noticing their families. They were just gone. In Moscow they underwent the three stages of radiation sickness. Because of severe anemia their white blood cells plunged to zero. All of them got their heads shaved off because of extreme hair-loss and experienced extreme nausea and weakness, until they suddenly felt better and wanted to discharge themselves. A typical and misleading high, before their skin went black and their lungs racked by gamma radiation stopped working. Loved ones, that were finally informed, watched helpless as they died one by one. The official death toll from the explosion was set to under 50, but until today it is not clear how many people died in consequence of the catastrophe. 800 000 men were send into the plant as liquidators to clean up the plant and there are unknown numbers of civilians dying of cancers or children's who were born with malformations. Estimations range from thousands to millions. People being tested for radiationWhat is even worse, the 1986 disaster was not a single event. Instead there were continuously other nuclear mishaps that were covered up before. The USSR and the US carried out nuclear tests throughout the Cold War and both lied about the toxic consequences, to reassure the public that civilian nuclear energy and the bomb were perfectly safe. Chernobyl was built in a watery landscape made up of numerous streams and rivers with a giant swamp. Contamination seeped into the ecosystem, affecting villagers who picked berries, drank milk from cows and grew their own food. It wasn‘t until the year 2000 that they shut off the remaining reactors of the Chernobyl plant.The main cause for the accident was the faulty technical design of the reactor, which was a product of the planned economy of the UdSSR. To operate safely the reactor required constant surveillance by the operators. Due to the Cold War they wanted to proof that they were the first ones able to use nuclear energy for civilians, which put them under pressure to the reactor fast and cheap. Many design steps were skipped technology adopted than new designed, at the cost of functionality. The engineer were aware of the dangers the reactor imposed but were optimistic that close and constant monitoring would prevent any problems. They wrote countless instructions and procedures, but were careful not to expose the underlying design faults that made them necessary. The Soviet Union‘s main aim was to present their technical superiority to the world. Admitting weaknesses or mistake wasn‘t an option and covering up‘s common practice.  Chernobyl low radiation victims of the next generationA secondary problem was the training and operating rules for the factory workers, that were confronted with tasks they weren't trained for. The test running that caused the accident was practiced by a operator who had never done it before, didn‘t sleep for thirty-six hours and made a key mistake. A lack of sleep and drinking weren‘t unusual among the operators running the plant. They couldn‘t have understood or anticipated the reasons for the meltdown, because the relevant information was hidden from the workers by the engineers. All operators were sure that an explosion of the reactor would be impossible, which is why it took them several hours to realize, that it actually happened. The dead factory workers were blamed for the accident, even though the technical design error was the much bigger problem.“the origins of the accident lay with those who had designed the reactor and the secret, incestuous bureaucracy that had allowed it to go into operation.”I think this is an extremely well written account of what happened in Chernobyl, with the complexity it requires."
7,1501134612,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5427149-nick-borrelli,5,"The Chernobyl disaster is an event that has fascinated me over the past couple of decades. I was in my early teens when it actually happened and although I remember seeing the news stories about the disaster on TV, being an adolescent at the time with an adolescent's priorities, it didn't really register with me. As I've gotten older I have become more interested in reading about historical events that took place either before I was born or when I was too young to fully appreciate the significance of them. I've read a couple of books about Chernobyl in the past but neither really answered the questions that I had fully. They scratched the surface but never dug into the nuts and bolts of the chain of occurances that caused the worst nuclear disaster in the history of the world. When I saw this title on Netgalley, I thought ""maybe this will be the one"". I was approved for a free review copy a few weeks ago and have been obsessed with this book ever since, having just finished it late last night. Here's what my conclusion is with regard to Midnight in Chernobyl by Adam Higginbotham: If you read only one book about the disaster of Chernobyl, this is the only one that you should read. To say that it is comprehensive is a profound understatement. The book begins in the late 1960's covering the USSR's budding nuclear program. We learn how the idea of Chernobyl was born and we are taken through the very beginnings of the construction of both the reactors and the town in Pripyat that would house the tens of thousands of workers and their families. Higginbotham then gradually breaks down the entire evening/morning leading up to the catastrophic meltdown. This is where I was absolutely flabbergasted as numerous warning flags were raised and either ignored or taken as not so serious. If even one of these warning flags were caught or taken seriously, this catastrophe might have been averted. The book then describes the eventual evacuation of the town surrounding the power plant and also the attempted coverups by the government to minimize the seriousness of what occured. Midnight in Chernobyl was one of the best non-fiction reads I have had in quite some time. Even though the subject matter is at times very difficult to get through, the book is impeccably researched and just so well-written that you can't stop reading. This book won't be released until February of 2019, but I highly recommend pre-ordering it on Amazon. You will be both informed and amazed at the history of this horrible accident."
8,1501134612,http://goodreads.com/user/show/13650342-mindful-librarian,5,"Riveting, horrifying, absolutely STELLAR reporting. I have always been fascinated (in horror) at the Chernobyl disaster and this book was JUST what I needed to wrap my mind around it. The only criticism I can possibly think of is that I would have loved even MORE pictures but I was able to find tons on The Atlantic and Nat Geo and Time online to fulfill my need for visual confirmation. What I found even more fascinating about this account than the many articles I had read previously was the detailed analysis of the role that the Soviet culture and politics played in the cause of the disaster, and the impact that disaster had on the downfall of the Soviet empire.I can’t recommend this book highly enough. FYI, I have zero background knowledge of nuclear science whatsoever and was able to grasp enough in this book to understand what happened. Also, don’t let the size intimidate you - almost a 1/4 of the book is endnotes ;-)"
9,1501134612,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5293536-melki,4,"The worst nuclear disaster in history occurred April 26th, 1986 in northern Ukraine. Chernobyl's deputy chief engineer for science was the first to call back. He calmly explained what he knew: Unit Four had been taken off-line for routine maintenance, and some kind of electrical tests were being carried out; exactly what, he couldn't say. During those tests, an accident had occurred.But when asked about the progress of emergency cooling of the core - the vital work that would ensure Reactor Number four could soon be repaired and brought back online - the Chernobyl engineer's composure snapped abruptly.""There's nothing left to be cooled!"" he shouted. Then the line went dead.  As soon as government officials took charge of the emergency, saving face became more important than saving lives. ""We need to evacuate everyone.""Scherbina snatched the phone from the energy minister's hand.""He's a panicker!"" he yelled at Scherbitsky. ""How are you going to evacuate all these people? We'll be humiliated in front of the whole world!"" Meanwhile a cloud of escaped radiation was heading for neighboring countries . . . It's hard to tell what's more horrifying - the accident, the nightmarish clean-up, or the higher-ups' attempts at downplaying the severity of the situation. There are a lot of edge-of-your seat moments here, and, be warned, the author pulls no punches as he describes what it's like to die of radiation exposure. A highly disturbing, but necessary read. And, yet another reminder that the ones who call the shots won't be among the ones risking their lives. Gorbachev told Slavsky he wanted the reactor sealed up by the end of the year. Deaths were almost inevitable. The octogenarian nuclear minister turned to his men.""Lads, you'll have to take the risk."""
10,1501134612,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8079403-max,5,"Higginbotham holds our attention with his focus on the human side of the tragedy at Chernobyl. We learn about those working at the plant that fateful night, their backgrounds, their daily lives, their families and friends. Thus as Higginbotham describes the unfolding of the disaster in a blow by blow account, we can feel their dismay as their lives and their world come apart. In addition to a riveting account of the night of the disaster and the chaotic days following, Higginbotham explains the reasons for the nuclear reactor’s failure and the wider impact on Soviet society. We get a glimpse of what it was like to live in the 1980s Soviet Union under a dysfunctional authoritarian government. The tragedy is explored at three levels: First there is the human toll, the suffering and death, and the displacement of over one hundred thousand people. Then there is the technical failure of the reactor and the failure of the scientists and administrators that culminated in the disaster. Lastly there is the deeper underlying issue of autocratic and expedient Soviet governance that led to all the suffering and failures and made them worse with an ill prepared inept response.The town of Pripyat was built near the Chernobyl atomic power station to provide places to live for the men and women who constructed, maintained and operated the plant. Fifty thousand people were living there including many families with children on April, 26 1986 when reactor number four exploded spewing huge amounts of radioactive particles high into the air. The scientists and technicians working at the plant at first denied the seriousness of the accident. They did not believe it possible for the reactor to explode. Many of them would succumb to radiation poisoning. For the first 36 hours, the people of the town were misled by the authorities who told them everything was under control. Soviet leaders did not want to create panic and did not want negative press. But the core of the reactor had destroyed itself creating a radioactive fire that could not be extinguished by conventional means. Microscopic radioactive particles kept falling on the town as people unaware went about their everyday Saturday and Sunday activities, many of them outside on an otherwise pleasant spring day. Suddenly they were told that they would have to evacuate. Over a thousand buses were lined up. The townspeople were told to just take what they needed for two or three days. The buses deposited them one by one with rural and small town families in the countryside who were told to take them in.Pripyat would never be reopened. Lied to by the authorities, it slowly dawned on its former citizens they would never return. They would be permanently resettled as would thousands more in nearby areas as the extent of the contamination was uncovered. Radioactive particles were dispersed far and near following the whims of the winds and rain. Kiev, over 100 kilometers away, closed its schools in mid-May and evacuated hundreds of thousands of children, their mothers and expectant mothers. They were scattered around Ukraine, many to summer camps and some even to Crimean resorts. Staff and first responders at the plant that night showing signs of acute radiation sickness were sent without notifying their families to a hospital in Moscow. Many would never see their loved ones again. Thirty of them would die from radiation sickness. The descriptions of their deaths are horrifying as visible injuries heal and the patient appears to get better only to succumb to the relentless radiation from particles inside the body destroying vital organs and tissues. Thousands of others from Pripyat and other contaminated areas would die early deaths as radiation weakened immune systems and induced cancers.What caused the accident? Primarily it was poor design. Higginbotham gets into the technical details which I’ll skip. Basically to operate safely, the reactor required constant attention by the operators. The faulty design was the product of an insular scientific establishment led by a bureaucracy enamored with its own creations. They were also under great pressure to get the reactors built fast and cheap, thus many design steps were skipped and readily available technology adopted even if not the best. The designers recognized some of the inherent weaknesses of their reactors, but felt conscientious operation would prevent any problems. They wrote reams of instructions and procedures, but were careful not to expose the underlying design faults that required them. The Soviet leadership always wanted to present a face to the world of technical superiority. Covering up faults was common practice. A secondary problem was the training and rules governing the operators. While Higginbotham presents all of them as capable and well intentioned, they weren’t always prepared for the job at hand. The accident occurred while running a test, one they hadn’t run before or practiced. Mistakes were made. The reactor became unstable for reasons the operators never could have anticipated or understood because the relevant information was hidden from them by the designers. They all were sure that under no circumstances could the reactor explode. It took many hours after the explosion for the operators and their management to believe that it actually did. Also, reactor operators were not always in the best condition to perform critical tasks. A key mistake was made during the test by an operator who had not slept for thirty-six hours. Higginbotham notes some operators would drink before coming to work. Higginbotham portrays heavy drinking as common in the community. Higginbotham spends much of the book on the response to the reactor explosion and the radioactive contamination. It begins with first responders trying to put out the fire and determine the extent of the damage. Apparently unaware of how dangerously radioactive the area was, many would suffer from acute radiation sickness. Radioactive debris was spread all around the reactor. There was no way to get close to it and live. Everyone was afraid of another explosion or the China Syndrome. If the remains of the core sunk into the earth, it could contaminate the water supply for the heavily populated Kiev. Team after team of government officials and workman would engage in cleanup effort after cleanup effort taking years as one approach after another failed to achieve results. Over 600,000 people were engaged in the cleanup effort, many conscripted for the work and many ruining their health. A major impediment to the cleanup was the Soviet leadership’s refusal to admit the true causes of the disaster and the enormity of the damage and contamination. Government leaders and their scientific functionaries remained insular and did not seek help from other countries. All remediation plans were homegrown often decided by those with power but little expertise.The Chernobyl disaster cost the Soviet Union an amount equal to its entire 1989 defense budget. As the public realized it was continually being lied to and word spread about the true extent of the devastation and the fumbling attempts to deal with it, people lost faith in their government. Gorbachev said Chernobyl was a primary reason for the Soviet Union falling apart. In 2016, exactly thirty years later, the Ukrainian president gave a speech dedicating a huge new structure being built to further contain the remnants of the still highly radioactive reactor. He too noted that the Chernobyl disaster was an important factor in the breakup of the Soviet Union and Ukraine’s independence. He recognized the 115,000 people who would never return to Pripyat and the Exclusion Zone. He acknowledged that 2,500,000 people were living on contaminated land and that the state was still making payments to hundreds of thousands of people disabled by the accident. The Exclusion Zone extends 30 kilometers from Chernobyl covering 1,000 square miles. While not safe for permanent habitation, there are tours offered. Everyone’s radiation level is monitored and there are signs warning of hot spots. Nature has been resurgent in the zone. Fears of three headed cows did not come true although genetic changes have been detected in plants and animals. Wildlife has prospered in the absence of humans with wolves, bears, elk, lynx and other native species forming a vibrant ecosystem.Higginbotham has done a masterful job of research. He provides extensive notes. He interviewed people that were there, members of their families, people involved in the Soviet nuclear program at the time and people involved in the containment effort. He was able to access files only recently available. Perhaps most important he made this remarkable book one we want to read by putting the human story first. Today when nuclear power plants are still being built and seen as a way to help stem climate change, his book is highly relevant. Taken together with the Fukushima disaster and the partial reactor meltdown at Three Mile Island, it makes one pause to consider whether the risk is worth it. I am convinced it isn’t."

12,1501134612,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2222319-jill-hutchinson,5," It could have easily become the end of the world as we know it.....a nuclear disaster which was not connected to war......a series of human error that continues to haunt. This is the harrowing account of the April, 1986 explosion at Reactor 4 of the Chernobyl Atomic Energy Station in Chernobyl, Ukraine (then the USSR) which released unbelievable amounts of radiation into the atmosphere. The ever-secretive Soviet government attempted to keep news of this horror from becoming public even within their own departments. Of course, that was an impossible task and rumors (and radiation) started to spread across Europe and the western world. It became a political, finger pointing, bureaucratic nightmare as well as a nuclear one.The author has done an amazing job of collecting information from original sources, new resources, and interviews with many of those involved. Obviously there are still events that are being hidden by the former USSR, such as the number of deaths but the author has discovered, through his research, much of what was previously not revealed. The result is a brilliant book which puts one into the hell that was Chernobyl and will stun the reader. I highly recommend this important book."

It gives you a look at why it was created, why the location, who were involved, what are atoms, Gemma and beta, and so forth. I do wish we got more information about the people made to leave and followed them more, but this book focused more on the administration which was still really interesting. Granted, I’m not 100 percent sure how accurate it is and how dramatic the author makes the story... While there is over 100 pages of footnotes since this was an advance copy the footnotes were not connected to the text yet. So if I wanted to verify a source I couldn’t. However for the most part, it seems this was a well researched and thought out book! Granted it’s hard to tell what people were thinking but I’m going to let that slide since this was a very interesting book! I’d def recommend buying it or getting it from your local library! "
14,1501134612,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10770371-dan,4,"Midnight in Chernobyl by Adam Higginbotham  On Tuesday evening, Vremya broadcast a new statement in the name of the Soviet Council of Ministers. This conceded that two people had been killed as a result of an explosion at the Chernobyl plant, that a section of the reactor building been destroyed, and that Pripyat had been evacuated. There was no mention of a radioactive release. This time the report was relegated to sixth place, behind the latest encouraging news about the mighty Soviet economy. By then, the rest of the world’s media had the scent of a spectacular catastrophe behind the Iron Curtain, and Chernobyl had become headline news in the West. The nuclear meltdown at the Chernobyl Atomic Energy Station Reactor Number 4 in Pripyat, U.S.S.R, in modern day Ukraine, occurred on April 25 1986 just before midnight.Ironically the disaster began during a botched safety system check that was meant to ensure that the Chernobyl nuclear power station could continue to safely operate in the event the surrounding electricity grid went down. The law of unintended consequences. No one suspected that there would be serious problems even though the test had never been successfully demonstrated at Chernobyl. In fact it had been aborted numerous times over the prior years for less serious reasons and as a result the plant manager was eager to complete and check it off the list. Although there would be a cascade of bad decisions necessary for the full disaster, the critical error was when the plant manager in a bid to make the test safer instructed the engineer to lower the reactor power output to 200 MW, even though the manual stated never to go below 700 MW because the reactor could become unstable. The engineer protested but to no avail and within minutes the reactor output spiraled below 200 MW amidst numerous circuit failures and water valve failures. Despite the ongoing alarms the test was continued. The water valves were intentionally shut, the rods were lowered and the fuel channels failed and within a minute the there was an explosion in Reactor #4 and a meltdown. There simply was nowhere for the reactor energy to go as the coolant evaporated.The vast bulk of the book follows the officials during their futile efforts to get the situation under control, the evacuation the townspeople, the initial denials by the Gorbachev administration, Europe’s outrage at the nuclear fallout, and the multi-year cleanup and the investigation and prosecutions.The focus is on those officials and engineers who were in charge of Chernobyl and the cleanup workers who risked and who ultimately gave their lives. I felt the coverage of the resulting prosecution of the plant officials could have been a little deeper.The section on the “Sarcophagus” — the massive concrete structure built to cover Reactor #4 and stop the spread of radiation — was so dramatically and eloquently described. Thousands of roentgens of radiation, levels so high that the robotic bulldozers failed during the cleanup, their circuitry overcome. The radiation was clearly at fatal levels, but nonetheless thousands of humans, called “bio-robots”, were sent in to clean up. Some workers intentionally went first to receive their maximum allowable doses of radiation knowing that they would be sent home quickly. Later on, with workers now scarce, the radiation exposure guidelines were routinely violated to “get the job done”.4.5 stars. The level of research in this book was top-notch. The writing and editing were superb and concise. The narrative was neutral, with a somewhat scientific bent. Although nuclear disasters are serious matters, I found this to be an informative book and not a depressing read"
15,1501134612,http://goodreads.com/user/show/646347-chris,5,"Midnight in Chernobyl is magnificent: a page-turner that is scary as hell, but a history that is meticulous and surprising.

16,1501134612,http://goodreads.com/user/show/72907701-dax,3,"I can appreciate the effort that went into collecting sufficient research and organizing those documents into a coherent narrative. I can’t imagine that the USSR was transparent with its documentation of facts. For that, Higginbotham gets an A+. I am also a fan of Higginbotham’s efforts to illustrate the ramifications of the disaster beyond death toll and pollution. The Chernobyl disaster was, in a way, the straw that broke the camels back with regards to the USSR’s economic viability as well as its geopolitical reputation. I am settling on three stars because I struggled keeping track of who is who and felt disconnected from the story from time to time. Undoubtedly a very good book, but can’t call it excellent. High three stars."
17,1501134612,http://goodreads.com/user/show/85395248-elizabeth,4,"Midnight in Chernobyl is a definitive and chilling account of the nuclear disaster that began on April 25-26, 1986 when the fourth nuclear reactor of the Chernobyl plant exploded, causing a nuclear disaster that the USSR tried to deny but had to reveal when the fallout spread into Europe. If you remember Chernobyl, this book is definitely worth reading. If the words Chernobyl or USSR seem like ancient history, Midnight in Chernobyl is definitely worth reading.When Reactor #4 of the Chernobyl Nuclear Power Complex failed due to poor design, construction, and human error, the USSR, then in its last years, did its best to keep as much of what happened a secret not just from the rest of the world, but from within as well, meaning that thousands upon thousands of people within the area and provinces around Chernobyl (located within the Ukraine) were unwittingly exposed to enormous doses of radiation.The extent of the nuclear disaster spawned by the reactor implosion was and is enormous. Over thirty years later, the town built to house the worker complex of Chernobyl, a then bustling town named Priypat, remains contaminated with nuclear fallout, and it will remain (safely) uninhabitable for almost another 30,000 years. So will a large portion of the land around it.Not uninhabitable for 30 years. Or 300. Or 3000. 30,000. Years.Because the USSR, as Higginbotham explains, worked tirelessly to keep its secrets secret--there had been nuclear accidents in the USSR before, though nothing on this scale--and was still, even in the dawn of glasnost (the period where the USSR attempted to be more open to its citizens and the world, which led to its destruction) not interested or even equipped to be forthcoming about just how bad things were, it took years for what really happened at Chernobyl to come to light. And even now the repercussions of exposing so much radiation to so large an area is virtually impossible to study because so many records pertaining to the reactor number 4 and its destruction were destroyed or simply not created because so few could understand or even believe just how bad things were. (And because there were simply no resources or even plans to deal with this kind of nuclear disaster.) The USSR, which excelled at so many things in its race with the United States and the rest of the world to harness the energy created by nuclear power, simply cut corners to get what it wanted, creating reactor plans and then using them to create electricity without considering the problems created when the reaction in question--the yield created by harnessing the power of atomic energy--went wrong. As a result, the consideration of potential problems weren't buried--they ceased to exist.In 2019, it's almost impossible to think of a large scale nuclear disaster not being broadcast to the world in some way or form. Midnight in Chernobyl does an excellent job of showing how tightly the USSR controlled information internally and the extraordinary lengths it went to postpone any external release of information even when it was obvious to the pre-internet world that something truly terrible had happened.Midnight in Chernobyl isn't perfect--since there are very few survivors left (the parts of the book that deal with the radiation exposure caused deaths are straightforward and more terrifying than fiction could ever be), there are very few first hand accounts, and any records created by the then USSR are often hard to access, cryptic, incomplete, inaccurate, or simply gone--the account of what happened is layered with a lot of scientific detail. And while the explanation of how nuclear power works and the dangers that lay in early attempts to yoke the extreme danger and instability of harnessing it to create electricity is fascinating, there's so much more about the construction of early reactors, the various units used to measure radiation exposure*, and scientific infighting in the USSR about it, that Midnight in Chernobyl does slow its pace at times.While I would have liked less of the scientific detail (*the radiation units, for example, don't matter to the narrative much because everyone involved in the reactor meltdown and lengthy attempt to contain it got this much: wayyyyyy too much) I see why it's there--to drive home the point that Chernobyl was very, very bad gain but to also fill out sections like the containment attempts, which boil down to: it was mostly luck that none of the other reactors exploded, to this day no one is really sure exactly where the reactor core went, and just about everyone involved in the containment efforts died. (!!!)Having just said all that, the section of the book devoted to the attempt to first ""clean"" and then the increasingly frenzied efforts to contain the damage caused by Reactor #4's enormous and deadly nuclear blast that also produced days and and weeks and months of continued radiation leaking from what was left of the open and exposed reactor core is so very well done. It's chilling--bone deep terror inducing chilling--to see how ineffective the early efforts were in the race to literally bury the reactor. Yep, that's how Chernobyl was ""fixed""-- what was left of the reactor was buried under an enormous metal structure as containment. And hope that that solution will continue to work. Will it?Theoretically--probably. Maybe.Check back in when another 30 or 300 or 3000 years have passed.That's the ultimate and terrifying message of Midnight in Chernobyl. Over 30 years ago an enormous nuclear incident occurred, and a cover up was attempted. Though the cover up failed, it failed after thousands, if not hundreds of thousands of people (not to mention animals and the earth itself) were exposed to massive amounts of radiation without any knowledge of it.The damage caused by the destruction of Reactor #4 was immediate and long lasting. Scientists are attempting to study the effects, but monitoring the human fallout is nearly impossible as the USSR relocated thousands of Priypat residents who had been exposed to radiation, and also failed to track those who were exposed to the release of radiation that was dispersed via the wind, rain, etc. Attempts to study the effects of the radioactive fallout on animals and plants in the area are hampered by lack of funds, falling off of interest, and the whole ""the area is deadly if you're in it for too long"" thing. Midnight in Chernobyl is thoughtful and more than a little frightening. It's a disaster story that no one seems to think about anymore even though its impact will be felt for lifetimes to come. Highly recommended."
18,1501134612,http://goodreads.com/user/show/58158333-allen,5,"Of all the sorry spectacles that characterized the fearful 45-year interlude called the Cold War, the Chernobyl nuclear disaster has to be one of the worst. The site was supposed to embody the best and most flawless of Soviet technology -- four enormous nuclear reactors pumping out enough electricity for western Ukraine and southern Belarus (both still part of the U.S.S.R. in those days). An entirely new “atomic town” (*Atomgrad*) called Pripyat had been carved out of the wilderness simply to house elite nuclear workers for the jumbo-sized power station. The town’s buildings were enlivened with bits and pieces of metal and glass used as mosaics by the feisty town architect -- strictly against the rulebook but charming. There was even a high-speed hydrofoil designed to take the residents of Pripyat down the Dnieper river for shopping expeditions to Kiev, avoiding the primitive local roads. Yet despite the “best in the world” propaganda, the plant was doomed to failure almost from the git-go. Years earlier a serious accident had occurred at a plant of the same design, but it had been so successfully hushed-up by top-down censorship that even the Chernobyl planners were unaware of it. Ironically, the accident that led to the meltdown of Unit No. 4 in April of 1986 came in response to a failed safety test, which could have been postponed a while longer if not for the desire to meet quotas before the upcoming May Day holiday. A gerontocracy ran Soviet nuclear power-production, men going back to the days of nuclear submarines who so invested in that technology that they could not feature a better approach for a huge civilian installation in the 1980’s. Even the computers -- like so many other things touted as the best in the world -- were obsolescent by the time the Chernobyl installation was fully operational, much slower than computers in use in the West. As bad as the Unit 4 meltdown was, human intervention (or more properly, lack thereof) made the bad much worse. In order to put a good face on things, officials claimed that only a handful of people had died in the incident, when it was already dozens and after shockingly high doses of radiation, hundreds soon to come. Many of the workers lay seriously ill or dying in a Moscow hospital, yet their relatives were not allowed to set foot inside (once again, an obsession with optics at the expense of truth). Since lies were the order of the day, the population of Pripyat and children of Kiev were allowed to stay in place much longer than they should have been. In essence the response to the Chernobyl disaster made mockery of the policies of *glasnost* (openness) and *perestroika* (restructuring) then mouthed by Premier Gorbachev, and hastened the demise of the once-mighty U.S.S.R. five years later. MIDNIGHT IN CHERNOBYL is the best non-fiction book I've read in a long time. Author Adam Higginbotham has done an incredible job of researching the 1986 nuclear accident: its origin in questionable design, the building of the reactors, the technical gigantism that assumed if one huge suboptimal reactor could work, why not four of them? All this within a martial Soviet culture that mixed military, political and engineering concerns in an atmosphere of not asking questions. He does a fine job of taking us nuclear non-experts into a working understanding of nuclear-reactor design flaws, the unfortunate traits of control-rod “tip” and “positive void coefficient” that better design could have avoided. The several waves of attention devoted to keep lethal radiation confined to the destroyed Unit 4 -- largely dumping boron and sand into the nuclear fires in a dicey attempt to quell them -- were only partly successful, and occasionally ill-advised, leading to even more expensive and dangerous remedial efforts later on. It is not journalistic exaggeration to say that the area around the stricken installation became a “nuclear wasteland.” The 32-year gap between the accident and this book's publication enabled Higginbotham to re-interview survivors and have a look around the mutated countryside and the dead, wholly irradiated company town of Pripyat that had been built to serve the reactor. This is a great book to read and I recommend it without qualification. I would advise American readers to be aware that once in a great while, author Higginbotham uses Briticisms: “creche” where we would say preschool or nursery; “pitch” instead of tar for the reactors’ roofs (yes -- inflammable roofs at a nuclear installation, incredible but true). This book deserves its healthy sales and will probably become a staple not only in the annals of failed technology, but as a history of a dictatorship in the first stage of its death throes. For all that, it is surprisingly easy to read. "

Painstakingly researched and written in an engaging style, this was an enthralling and horrifying account of the disaster written through the eyes of the many people involved at all levels. Tears fell on many occasions. One instance that haunts me is when two men went to fix a broken pipe in contaminated water and used their bare hands as the gloves they were issued fit so poorly. There is so much to discover about the disaster in this book that we previously hadn't known. I listened to this as an audiobook and the narration by Jacques Roy is wonderful."
20,1501134612,http://goodreads.com/user/show/50297885-joy-d,4,"Detailed account of the Chernobyl nuclear reactor meltdown in 1986 in the former Soviet Union (now Ukraine). Higginbotham takes a look at the reasons behind the explosion, what happened at the plant immediately afterward, the radioactive fallout, protracted clean-up efforts, and the consequences. The author’s account is based on interviews, archives, and de-classified documents. Despite Gorbachev’s stated policy of glasnost, a blanket of secrecy was drawn over the catastrophe. Operators were blamed and punished, despite multiple design flaws. Thirty-one people died, according to official numbers, though the statistics were not meticulously tracked, and subsequent deaths were intentionally attributed to causes other than radiation. It is almost unbelievable how long it took to evacuate the nearby town of Pripyat.This book provides a detailed analysis of causes and effects, focused on scientific and political explanations. It requires a strong interest in science to fully appreciate it. The chapters related to the disaster are both horrifying and riveting. There were many people involved and it is sometimes difficult to keep them straight. I listened to the audiobook, read by Jacques Roy. He does an excellent job. His narration is smooth and lively. I found it an enlightening examination of the Soviet bureaucracy and cultural legacy of the era. Employees generally had no desire to communicate bad news upward in the organization for fear of reprimand. Political loyalty was prized above technical proficiency. The “narrative” was tightly controlled such that what really happened was obscured from public view. I think a great deal can be learned (mainly on what not to do) from this in-depth assessment of the disaster. "

Arrogance, incompetence, and truly masterful levels of denial worked to create the nuclear meltdown. It had far-reaching effects for the health of the people throughout Asia and Europe, as well as political consequences for the former USSR. Well-researched and written. I also liked that the focus was kept on the Soviet people and their perspective rather than trying to bring in judgment from the West."

For me it was a slow and often difficult read - an information overload - as the subject was a concise and detailed account of the Chernobyl/Pripyat nuclear accident in 1986. The author provided several helpful materials to aid in the digestion: A Cast of Characters, a Glossary, and a page on Units of Radiation.

I have been meaning to read Svetlana Alexivich's work, Chernobyl Prayer: A Chronicle of the Future and Voices from Chernobyl but somehow, I couldn't get around to it. It was only when I started watching Chernobyl, which was streaming on HBO, that I thought to find more about it. It was when I came across this book and started reading it immediately. Midnight in Chernobyl is a detailed, minute-by-minute account of the nuclear disaster of Chernobyl. What made this book worth reading isn't just related to these details. For a reader like me, who had an incongruent idea about USSR's history, this book was the golden touch of Midas. The author told about the communist era of the country, along with their nuclear ambitions and pride in the nation. Not only history, but the relevant information about the functioning of the reactors are also included for a better understanding. I read many scientific jargons absent-mindedly, but whatever little I did retain from the reading helped me a lot in understanding the intricacies of the reactors, while also aided me in understanding the radiation induced bodily changes. The fall of the Soviet Union following the nuclear disaster and the changes that occurred in the world are also given in details.I felt a lack of testimonies in the book, but that was okay considering it read like a history book which is trying to make me understand the scientific and historical details. It reaffirmed my faith in my species - if human beings can be a cause of destruction, they can certainly recognise their folly and work on it. Let us hope that it remains this way. "

Higginbotham tries to cover it all—politics, people, science, even some of the international response. So, if you aren't too familiar with what happened—Midnight in Chernobyl is an excellent starting point. It's also written in a very engaging way and reads like a long work of journalism, which is a writing style that really worked for me."
25,1501134612,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4957858-judith-e,4,"In spite of the USSR’s secrecy, misinformation, and paranoia, author Higginbotham has written a minute by minute account of the domino effect causing the meltdown of reactor 4 in Chernobyl and the aftereffects. The need for Soviet gigantomania and the accompanying shoddy workmanship to meet the Party’s demands to prove superior nuclear utilization are just two of a multitude of prescriptions for a nuclear disaster. The Soviet engineers’ insistence to use a positive void cooling system, unlike the West’s negative void cooling, was a fatal start. The nuclear containment was and still is an immense puzzle to solve and the lives of so many have been shattered. This is not the most flattering portrait of Mikhail Gorbachev and the incident diverted his plans for Glasnost."

Now I admit that I have not seen the show - but I did binge listen to the podcasts from the show creator (available on youtube) and am about to embark on relistening to them in light of what I have learned from this book which does actually get name-checked in the first podcast episode (I have just listened to it again) as a valuable info source which had not been available to the shows writer when they were researching the project back in 2015.Once again I listened to this on audio as a loan from my library through the wonderful libby app & can't say I found it easy listening content wise but the way this topic was handled is very digestible and helps even clueless dumbos like me to get a better picture of what happened, how it was ""handled"" & possibly most interestingly wasn't talked about 🤐The author manages to weave many narratives together to give the reader a better understanding not only of the accident itself, it's aftermath, the direct and indirect affect on all in the vicinity and up the political food chain...but also sneakpeeks into peoples backgrounds and the indelible mark left behind. Focussing on many people at once, yet I never felt lost and saw many different peoples perspectives - it is really well done for such a difficult topic to tackle tactfully.This disaster simultaneously shows the best & worst of humanity in how people reacted in its aftermath. The many that stepped up and put themselves at great risk (whether knowingly or not considering so much about nuclear fall out is still unknowable) and those that austrich'd, aka buried their heads in the sand and outright lied to themselves and others as to the ramifications of what happened that April night in 1986...Therein lies my fascination with these types of topics and while I cannot speak to how this read might come across in its written form. I can wholeheartedly recommend the audiobook 👍I also really recommend the HBO show podcasts on YouTube to help potentially give you a crash course before diving into the mountain of names that assault you at the start of this book. I'm sure watching the show itself will also help, but as I have not done so myself I cannot actually speak to it 😅"

On May 1st they told us to go to May parade and refusing was not an option - and who can refuse such festivity of happy Soviet people marching, saying thanks to our beautiful motherland same time as party leaders of all ranks evacuated their relatives to safe places. The biggest problem of Soviet union wasn't a poor quality of nuclear plant production (or any other kind of production) - it was a LIE. Lie that killed so many people (including 3 in my family).

It's not shit that happens which differentiate good government from bad one - it's a reaction, whose butts they going to save first - peoples' or their own. In case of Chernobyl they failed miserably, but again after all they did to their own people (Stalin's purges of 1937, number of soldiers died in 2nd world war, etc) - who can wait them to behave differently that time. And they didn't betray us in our anticipation - they told us nothing about danger of that catastrophe and keep maintaining ""business as usual"" faces.So I think main lesson of Chernobyl disaster is that LIE kills as certain as bullets, poisons or radiation."
28,1501134612,http://goodreads.com/user/show/47188780-kathleen,5,"Everyone knows that Chernobyl was a horrible nuclear accident that poisoned the entire area around the reactor. So—what is to be learned in this latest recounting of the disaster? Plenty! Higginbotham’s excellent journalism reads like a true crime novel. And his human interest stories place a human face on the tragedy. It all began innocently enough—just a routine safety check to simulate what would happen during an electrical blackout on April 25th, 1986. The senior engineer, Leonid Toptunov, began powering down. At first, everything seemed normal—and then there was a roar. The entire plant began to tremble and then there was a blast so strong that the concrete roof blew off. The radioactive ionization of the air caused a “shimmering pillar of ethereal blue-white light, reaching straight up into the night sky, disappearing into infinity”.Higginbotham does an excellent job detailing why the reactor blew up. The USSR’s reactor design was flawed from the beginning—an accident was inevitable. The engineers were poorly trained and simulations of possible accident scenarios were ignored. Once the accident happened, it took politicians ‘forever’ to notify their own government leaders—let alone the adjacent countries in harm’s way from the heavily radioactive cloud drifting towards them.The author recounts the brutal effects of radiation poisoning on the engineers and first responders. Their individual stories are heart-wrenching. Highly recommend."

The reactor was a pistol with the hammer cocked. All that remained was for someone to pull the trigger.
The Chernobyl disaster shows what can happen when all of these factors come together:-	Faulty design that no one is able or willing to admit to-	Operators that do not fully understand what they’re working with and how to operate it safely-	A culture of secrecy and denial-	An institutionalized reluctance to acknowledge when things do indeed go wrong. Which they did often. Even before that fateful day in April 1986.-	A propensity to suppress details of the accident in an attempt to save face.In short, it shows what happens when lies and cover-ups are preferred to admitting failure or even just a lack of knowledge or understanding.Many payed the price for this. However, as one would expect, medical records were also altered.This book depicts the construction process of the plant. One of unreasonable and unreachable timetables and of neglect for safety measures. It takes a close look at the events that lead up to the catastrophe and gives a very detailed account (sometimes to the second) of what happened on the night of 26 April 1986. It also takes a look at the science behind the disaster. Which was sometimes dense, but nevertheless explained well enough. It spends quite some time with the immediate aftermath and shows pretty well the immense forces people were dealing with and how little control we have over them. These parts were chilling and highly fascinating to read, and offered some memorable quotes like this one:
And from somewhere in the heart of the tangled mass of rebar and shattered concrete - from deep inside the ruins of Unit Four, where the reactor was supposed to be - Alexander Yuvchenko could see something more frightening still: a shimmering pillar of ethereal blue-white light, reaching straight up into the night sky, disappearing into infinity.
Then comes the phase of denial, which lead to indecisiveness, and the subsequent attempts to cover the whole thing up. Later we hear about the liquidators, those poor souls.
Their throats itched, they felt dizzy, and there was never enough water to drink. Some men suffered nosebleeds, while others began vomiting. Called to help clear the chunks of reactor graphite lying on the ground near Unit Three, a detachment of chemical warfare troops arrived in a truck and began to pick them up using their hands.Such tasks exposed the liquidators to their maximum allowed annual doses of radiation – often in a matter of seconds. In the high-radiation areas of the Special Zone, a single task that anywhere else could be completed by a single man working for an hour might now require thirty men to work for two minutes each. And the new regulations dictated that as soon as they each reached their 25 rem limit, they should be sent from the zone, never to return. Each job had to be measured not only in time but also in the number of individuals who would have to be “burned” to accomplish it. In the end, some commanders resolved that it was better to keep deploying the men they had – men who had already been exposed to their limits – than to burn fresh troops in the danger zone.
We witness the hasty construction of the sarcophagus and the search for the missing nuclear fuel. During all of this Adam Higginbotham doesn’t forget the people involved. Be it the plant operators, commanders, liquidators, scientists, firefighters, politicians, doctors, nurses and so on. We get a backstory for some and we also see what became of several of them years later. Although for some there were not a lot more years to come, and we spend some time with them in the hospital, on their way to an agonizing death. Others we will meet again in the courtroom.The author also finds the time to draw a picture of the political landscape prior to and during the Chernobyl disaster, and to go into the downfall of the Soviet Union thereafter. Well, it’s a long book. One that took over Adam Higginbotham’s life for many years. And one that I think is well worth your time.4.5 stars"
30,1501134612,http://goodreads.com/user/show/34570157-jenny-jo-weir,4,Wow! This one was a hard read. The whole time I'm thinking about all that radiation and the effects of the explosion. The amount of people affected by this and the cost of this unfortunate event were unprecedented. You can't help but feel bad fro all the people involved and for all the victims. It's something that sticks with you. 
31,1501134612,http://goodreads.com/user/show/38617426-juli,4,"Interest in the Chernobyl nuclear disaster has spiked since the award winning HBO mini-series aired. I watched the show and listened to HBO's accompanying podcast and several other podcast episodes on the accident and its aftermath. Several of the podcasts mentioned this book, so I secured a spot on the library's wait list for the audiobook. I'm glad I did! This book is excellent!Higginbotham outlines the buildup of the soviet power grid and nuclear technology. Along the way there were accidents, cost cutting measures that had disastrous effects, mismanagement, poor training and flawed maintenance. All the mistakes culminated in the explosion at Chernobyl on April 25, 1986.Higginbotham gives details about the people involved, the plant itself, the history of Soviet nuclear power, the accident, the evacuation of Pripyat, and the continuing aftermath of the accident. It's a very interesting, and concerning, story. Many countries have nuclear power plants now. It's an awesome way to generate electricity, unless there is an accident. In recent years, the Fukushima accident shows that an earthquake or other natural event can cause modern nuclear plants to become quite dangerous. But with mismanagement, bad maintenance, lackluster employee training and shoddy parts/construction, any nuclear plant can be potentially dangerous. With more countries around the world turning to nuclear power, the chances of an accident increase.....I remember news reports in 1986 about the event. I can remember initial reports stating that it was known there had been some sort of nuclear event in the Soviet Union but scientists were not sure what had happened and no information was being released by USSR officials. When the full truth came out, it was horrifying. An entire city evacuated. Firemen and emergency response personnel dying. The struggle to prevent a melt-down. 33 years later, many are still interested in the accident and the lasting damage it caused. Pripyat is becoming a tourist attraction even. Yikes! I can think of much better vacation sites than one that is completely irradiated. Pripyat, and the surrounding region, will be not be safely habitable for more than 20,000 years.Nuclear power is safe when handled responsibly by properly trained people. Most plants operating in the modern world are quite safe, and managed/maintained properly. But, a nuclear power plant can be potentially deadly if proper safety protocols are not strictly adhered to and the potential effects of natural disasters and other catastrophes are not properly taken into consideration. I hope it is a very, very long time -- or never -- that our planet ends up with another uninhabitable, radiation soaked region from a nuclear accident. The effects are long lasting, and far reaching.Great book! Lots of highly researched information presented in an interesting manner. The audio book is about 14 hours long and narrated by Jacques Roy. Roy reads at a steady pace. His voice is easily understandable. Very enjoyable listening experience!"
32,1501134612,http://goodreads.com/user/show/352711-leftbanker,5,"I began this book out of desperation from the cliff-hanger of episode 2 of Chernobyl on HBO, one of the best TV dramas I’ve ever watched. Like the series, the pacing and tone of this account reads like the best of thrillers and I literally couldn’t put it down. I’m old enough to have vivid recollections of the event as it was unfolding. My USAF unit stationed in Athens, Greece, received intelligence on the crisis well ahead of the local news. We knew that it was a nuclear accident well before the Soviets admitted to this fact, but what we didn’t know was just how close the world was to a bigger, unspeakable disaster. This news really wasn’t available for years after the events of April 1986. The world had moved on. I had all but forgotten Chernobyl until this brilliant series came over the horizon. A viewer of the series wrote, “The tragedy will live forever because of this haunting masterpiece, what a brilliant creative achievement.” I could say the same for this book. Informative, objective, and written with a breath-taking pace, I couldn’t recommend it more highly to anyone looking to become better informed on the events of Chernobyl, both when it happened, and in the years since.It’s hard to laugh when you’re reading in the fetal position, but this part struck me as the epitome of gallows humor. One nuclear scientist working on cleaning up the disaster gives safety advice to another nuclear scientist just arriving, “If you smell ozone, run!”The big surprise is that the death toll wasn’t tens of times greater than the reality. Of course, we may never know the true results of the accident as Soviet record keeping tended to down-play cancer deaths which may have been related to Chernobyl.The most terrifying aspect of all is to consider how our leaders today would deal with a disaster on this order. Even the monumentally corrupt Soviets of that era had some highly intelligent, rational people among them, which is more than you can say of Putin and Trump, and their flunkies. Trump prevaricates on matters of little or no importance; imagine his response on this sort of travesty."
33,1501134612,http://goodreads.com/user/show/714583-anita-pomerantz,3,"This book is sooo highly rated and was listed as ""best non-fiction"" by numerous sources in 2019. All I have to say is I wish I read Voices from Chernobyl: The Oral History of a Nuclear Disaster instead. This book was just boring unless you like reading a lot about engineering and the technical structure of power plants and buildings. In addition, there are a zillion Russian names, and even with Kindle X-Ray and a guide to who was who, I struggled because the people just were not brought to life for me.This is reporting. It's very strong reporting, and it unveils the type of cover-up that makes you worried about government and implies that conspiracy theories can be true. The story is important. I just did not find it interesting because of the absolute overload of details, many of which were beyond my understanding or ability to picture. Maybe my timing in picking up this one was just way off . . .as we are in the middle of a crisis ourselves, my concentration is pretty shot. So, judge this one by the reviews of others. I just can barely bring myself to give it 3 stars. "
34,1501134612,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5349403-carolyn,4,"The author has written an impressive, comprehensive book of historical importance. It brings to light events surrounding the Chernobyl catastrophe of 1986 which may be unknown to many in the Western world, and even to the Russian people. The author presents a crash course in nuclear physics and energy, simplified as much as possible. This may present difficulties for the average reader without some background knowledge. I thought the human factor surrounding the disaster to be interesting and appreciated that the book included a summary list of the Cast of Characters and their positions and involvement with Chernobyl. The book emphasized the social/political Cold War mentality, economic factors, technical failures, the cut-throat ambition of the politicians and their secrecy which led to public complacency or wild rumours. Reaction time was slow due to uncertainty and arguments about the best course of action. I feel this is the definitive book of situations leading up to the disaster, what happened when Reactor 4 malfunctioned causing a huge surge of radiation, and its aftermath. The history is impeccable and thoroughly researched and stands as a sample for other writers of historical events and will be the definitive book on Chernobyl.The Chernobyl atomic complex was built to produce cheap electricity for a vast surrounded area, and to establish the Soviet Union ’s predominance in nuclear power. The disaster occurred in Reactor #4 on April 26, 1986. A model town, Pripyat, was built in the wilderness area close to the Nuclear Plant to house tens of thousands of workers and their families. From rough, cold shacks inhabited by the early builders, it grew into an impressive town with 3 schools, 35 playgrounds, 3 swimming pools, a library, sports facility and shopping center. Groceries and goods in the stores were more varied and abundant than in cities of origin of most of the workers. No expense was spared in planting trees and importing flowering shrubs to enhance the blocks of apartments. The nuclear accident which occurred resulted in a coverup where plant workers and women and children were not aware of the danger to their lives and health from nuclear fallout.there were cultural and political reasons contributing to lack of safety. Poor building design, shoddy materials, forced deadlines for builders and plant workers to meet, incompetent and negligent staff without knowledge of dangers they faced. There had been a smaller explosion at another plant and plenty of malfunctions but they were ignorant of possible critical problems. After the reactor imploded and seemed to be going into meltdown, releasing radiation far and wide, members of the emergency response team who did know the peril were either forced to stop the leak or went in willingly out of patriotic duty.  Following the disaster, people of Pripyat went about their lives ignorant of dangers from radioactive fallout. During this time a gathering of academics, Generals and politicians argued about the course they needed to take but were mainly concerned with secrecy. Finally, it was decided to evacuate the town of 51,000 people but leaving behind 4,000 essential service workers. People being evacuated were led to believe that they would only be away from home a couple of days and to bring only essentials for a short stay. Immediately after the explosion, there were two deaths of reactor workers.28 died soon of acute radiation sickness.. Evacuation orders soon included 90,000 people within a 30 K radius. High radiation levels soon spread to areas distant from Chernobyl and was detected in Sweden, Belarus and Poland. By May 20, 95,000 people had been hospitalized. High levels of radioactivity had already reached the capital, Kiev. May Day celebrations were carried out in the open air. Soon over 300,000 children were ordered evacuated from Kiev, along with expectant and nursing mothers (about 1/5 of the population). Teams were hired to shoot 20,000 domestic animals left behind.  We will never know how many people died over the years from radiation-induced cancers, as doctors were pressed not to mention a possible connection. Once the danger of a meltdown had eased and the reactor was covered with a dome, it was felt necessary to lay blame. Six plant officials were put on trial resulting in prison sentences. Official statements refused to place blame on faulty building materials, reactor design flaws, or the irresponsibility and poor discipline of the plant workers present when the disaster occurred. They had been conducting a safety inspection to simulate a power failure and did not follow the procedure properly outlined on a checklist. The author emphasizes the social/political Cold War mentality. The secrecy of generals and politicians which led to wild rumours or complacency subsequently caused the people to distrust in their leaders. Economic factors due to the billions of rubles spent on evacuation, housing, pay for thousands of emergency workers, and the deactivating the reactor was a great financial loss for the country. The author feels this was a major factor contributing to the breakup of the Soviet Union Thanks to NetGalley and Simon & Schuster for an advance copy of this important book."
35,1501134612,http://goodreads.com/user/show/53179837-george,4,"This book covers the events from the construction of the plant to the fall of the Soviet Union, but unlike Serhii Plokhy he does it from the perspective of the people who were actually close enough to absorb the radiation. Mostly he focused on the scientists, workers and liquidators, who had to deal with the clean up. He focused so much on these people that at the beginning of the book there was a list of characters, as if it was a play or something. I've never seen that done with a nonfiction book before, but maybe that was just a quirk of my particular edition. Now, because I have read Chernobyl: History of a Tragedy by Serhii Plokhy I couldn't help but compare these two. Serhii Plokhy covered the construction of the plant and the causes of the explosion itself better then Adam Higginbotham, but Adam didn't just brush of the clean up process. After reading them both I find it that they are both necessary to understand this disaster, just to get all the angles.Lastly, on to the Voices of Chernobyl to see what the ordinary people had to say about this whole mess. "
36,1501134612,http://goodreads.com/user/show/17428284-steven-z,5,"March 28, 1979 was an overcast day in Woodbridge, Va. when news arrived of a nuclear accident at Three Mile Island Unit 2 reactor near Middletown, Pa. Feeling totally in the dark when it came to information about the accident, my neighbors and I gathered outside our homes and immediately began testing to see which way the winds were blowing, and should we pack up and head in the opposite direction. Living about two and a half hours from the reactor which would eventually partially melt down, we were scared. Up to that time this would be considered the greatest nuclear accident in history being unaware of the Kyshtym Disaster which was a radioactive contamination accident that occurred on September 29, 1957 at Mayak, a plutonium production site in Russia for nuclear weapons and a nuclear fuel reprocessing plant in the Soviet Union. After reading Adam Higginbotham’s new book, MIDNIGHT IN CHERNOBYL: THE UNTOLD STORY OF THE WORLD’S GREATEST NUCLEAR DISASTER, an excellent account of the explosion and meltdown at Chernobyl the evening of April 25-26, 1986 and the ramifications of that disaster, memories of that March day flashed before my eyes.Higginbotham has written the most informative and insightful description of events and analysis of the meltdown that has yet to appear. It replaces Harvard historian, Serhii Plokhy’s CHERNOBYL: A HISTORY OF A NUCLEAR CATASYTROPHE as the most comprehensive and detailed work that has been written. In dealing with events such as Chernobyl one must ask: What happened, why did it happen, and could it happen again? Higginbotham, a journalist and his research partner Taras Shumeyko interviewed numerous eyewitnesses and conducted a prodigious amount of research that included a small number of declassified documents available, and argues that the fanatical view among Soviet bureaucrats and leadership to maintain secrecy, (for example, information about what occurred at Mayak was kept from the public for thirty years) was the reason the accident was so devastating, but also not surprising that it occurred. Higginbotham recreates the disaster providing a history of Soviet nuclear development, including numerous accidents; the planning and building of Chernobyl; the accident; attempts to remediate the situation after it occurred, the trial of the operators who were blamed for the disaster; and other aspects of the aftermath. The book reads in part as narrative history, but also a terrifying account of an event which could easily be repeated today.The plan to build Chernobyl was hatched in February 1970 as a means of catching up to the west and meet Soviet electricity needs. The Soviet Union would engage in a crash program to build nuclear reactors, but the problem was that the project began during a period of economic stagnation with material and resource shortages everywhere. The reactor was to be completed by 1975 which was totally unrealistic due to the approach taken by the Soviet bureaucracy, party elites, and engineers that did not consider shortages, safety needs, and planning for possible future nuclear accidents. The result is that corners were cut in terms of material, training, design flaws, “cooking the books,” and the stubborn nature of the Soviet bureaucracy in charge of construction. As Higginbotham discusses this aspect of the project, he provides the reader an interesting history of the development of radiation, nuclear development, and their affects on people and society. The author’s approach to complex scientific information and jargon is such that it is very easy to understand for the lay reader as he describes how reactors are supposed to be constructed.According to Higginbotham there were design flaws dealing with a high-power channel reactor labeled RMBK. These flaws would dog designers who would pay little attention to test results because of pressure from the Communist Party and the bureaucracy that flowed from it. This made disaster possible because no one knew how the reactor would react in case of an accident. The reactors colossal size made start up and shut down the most demanding and treacherous stages of RMBK operation. The author follows RMBK’s development and its flaws as it went into production, particularly the AZ-5 emergency protection system whose design took too long to respond in an emergency which came home to roost on April 25, 1986.  A similar plant in Leningrad experienced an accident on November 11, 1975 resulting in the release of radiation into the atmosphere over the Gulf of Finland. However, Sredmash, the Soviet agency in charge of production and construction of nuclear reactors covered up the investigative findings of design flaws related to the accident. On September 9, 1982 there was a partial meltdown at Unit 1 at Chernobyl which took eight months to repair, but the KGB instituted a gag order, and the following year a similar accident took place in a Lithuanian reactor and one in Armenia. But the world knew nothing of these accidents. Further exacerbating Soviet nuclear reactor building was the shoddy workmanship that plagued Soviet industry in general, and that carried over to the construction of Chernobyl.  A major problem that arose once Reactor #4 at Chernobyl exploded is that many of those in charge were unprepared to deal with what occurred and succumbed to wishful thinking and self-delusion in approaching how to deal with what had transpired. Higginbotham describes in detail the lethargic Soviet bureaucracy and their response to disaster. Soviet Prime Minister Mikhail Gorbachev was not notified as to what had occurred until the afternoon of April 26, 1986. The author narrates the debates inside the Commission that was set up to oversee the crisis. He relates the personalities involved and their debates on how to respond and their final decision making, many of which were out of some sort of fantasy. An excellent example apart from how to cool the reactor was whether they should evacuate the city of Pripyat and its 50,000 residents who were in danger of radiation exposure which took until April 27th to accomplish. As the radioactive cloud blew over Scandinavia, Swedish, Finish, and Danish diplomats lodged complaints to Moscow once it was realized where the radiation originated resulting in the Soviet government stonewalling. It would take until April 28th at 8:00pm for Moscow to come clean and announce that “an accident had taken place at the Chernobyl nuclear power plant.…One of the atomic reactors has been damaged.” Soviet citizens were used to this type of response as it was a continuation of the way the state had covered industrial accidents for decades.Higginbotham descriptions of helicopter pilots flying low dumping sand and boron on the reactor are harrowing. The author’s approach as he carefully describes how officials, academics, scientists, fire fighters, guards, and others and what they went through is chilling, especially as he brings the reader to Hospital #6 in Moscow created to treat victims of nuclear accidents and war. The ultimate fear was the “China Syndrome,” the further devastation that would occur if the reactor’s foundation exploded and nuclear material leaked into the earth. Even though Moscow TV announced on May 11, 1986 that the primary threat of explosion was over, scientists remained skeptical.The Central Committee of the Politburo decided against Gorbachev’s new policy of Glasnost and followed the traditional approach and blamed “bourgeois falsification….propaganda and inventions” as its immediate reaction, in addition to dishonesty and declining help from the west. This approach would backfire in terms of containing the accident but also hindering Gorbachev’s hope of nuclear disarmament talks with the United States because how could one negotiate with someone who was so untrustworthy.Higginbotham spends a great deal of time describing what the victims of the disaster experienced. He follows the medical care that victims received and for far too many their ultimate deaths. He recounts the bravery of so many who fought to contain the toxic results of the explosion, and countless men who returned to build the sarcophagus that was designed to seal reactor #4 for at least a hundred years. The narrative of how the newly created refugees, numbering over 116,000 from the exclusion zone is told with sensitivity and insight into their future plight. The scapegoating that dominated the investigation by Soviet authorities was appalling as was the propaganda machine that worked overtime to find blame and paint the accident in the best light as possible. The stories are often poignant and provide a true picture of what can happen on a personal and societal level from a nuclear disaster.Perhaps one of the most destructive results of Chernobyl was the beginning of the end of the Soviet Union. Gorbachev realized that even his own nuclear bureaucracy was rotten to the “core” and as was most of the Soviet state. The launching of perestroika opened debate among Soviet citizens that had been dormant, but slowly the issues of Afghanistan, drug addiction, the abortion epidemic, and the horrors of Stalinism emerged. The Russian people began to realize that they had been lied to for decades and as Higginbotham successfully argues they “faced the realization that their leaders were corrupt and that the Communist dream was a sham.”If wonders if a major nuclear accident could occur in the future remind yourself of Fukushima. In 2011, the Tokyo Electric Power Company’s nuclear plant underwent a process identical to Chernobyl; the loss of coolant that provoked a meltdown. As to what remains of Chernobyl itself, it is part of an “exclusion zone” of 1,000 square miles, a radioactive Eden for new wildlife and vegetation. Higginbotham has done the public a favor by exposing the events of April-May 1986 and give us pause as to how we should approach nuclear power in the future."
37,1501134612,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3357765-jimmy,5,"I have long been fascinated with Russia. Russian dissenters have long been my heroes going all the way back to Alexander Solzhenitsyn up to Pussy Riot and Garry Kasparov. It feels like Russia has an inferiority complex. The government is always trying to look bigger and stronger than they really are. Thus the arms buildups, the Olympic obsession, the meddling. In the case of Chernobyl, it was the cover ups, the refusal to admit mistakes, the effort to make the reactor bigger than anything else no matter how many corners had to be cut. As Higginbotham said, ""Lies and deception were endemic to the system, trafficked in both directions along the chain of management: those lower down passed up reports to their superiors packed with falsified statistics and inflated estimates, of unmet goals triumphantly reached, unfulfilled quotas heroically exceeded. To protect his own position, at every stage, relayed the lies upward or compounded them."" (15) ""Seated at the top of a teetering pyramid of falsehood, poring over reams of figures that had little basis in reality, were the economic mandarins of the State General Planning Committee--Gosplan--in Moscow."" (15) It worries me that Trump and his climate change deniers are setting up something of the same situation here in the US. Facts are not important in this administration. And scientific facts are even less important to the Trumpites. "". . . the plans called for fireproof cables, but when none could be found, the builders simply did the best they could."" (20) ""When the ministry of energy in Moscow learned that the roof of the plant's turbine hall had been covered with highly flammable bitumen, they ordered him to replace it. But the flame-retardent material . . . was not even being manufactured in the USSR, so the Ministry granted Brukhanov an exception, and the bitumen remained."" (20) But when they ordered him to build an ""olympic-sized swimming pool,"" he had to ""hoodwink the state bank"" to build it. He had no choice but to obey the order. Considering all of these facts, it makes me wonder if Chernobyl is the best way to look at nuclear power. The fault lies more with the communist system and its lack of regulatory power. People always think of communist systems as having too many regulations. In reality, communism has few regulations because it is all about the power at the top, like with Trump. The goal was to build ""increasingly gigantic stations throughout the western territories of the Union. By the end of the century, Moscow intended Chernobyl to be one part of a dense network of atomic power megacomplexes."" (20) In spite of ""alarming building faults,"" the work kept on. On pages 62 to 63, the designers saw ""no need to prepare for such a calamity"" in reference to the worst possible scenarios. All warnings about the dangers were ignored. Former Chernobyl chief engineer Nikolai Steinberg said that the origins of the disaster lay in a combination of ""scientific, technological, socioeconomic, and human factors"" unique to the USSR. (347) The Soviet Union ""lacked even rudimentary safety practices."" They ""relied upon its operators to behave with robotic precision night after night."" They were under ""constant pressure to beat deadlines."" All of this made ""disregard for the letter of the regulations almost inevitable."" The deceased operators of Control Room Number Four ""had brought the reactor into an unstable condition, but only on account of the acute pressure they felt to complete the test on the turbine."" (347) ""Some environmentalists argued that humanity could not afford to turn its back on the promise and terrors of the peaceful atom. The global need for electricity was increasing exponentially: humanity was predicted to double the amount of energy it used by 2050. Despite the growing certainty that burning fossil fuels was the cause of devastating climate change--making the stabilization of carbon emissions imperative--coal remained the most widely used source of energy in the world. The fine particulates from fossil fuel plants in the United States killed more than thirteen thousand people a year; worldwide, three million people died annually as a result of air pollution released by coal- and oil-fueled power stations. Even to begin to head off climate change over the coming thirty-five years would have to be clean, yet neither wind, solar, hydroelectric, nor geothermal power--nor any combination of them--had the potential to bridge the gap."" (357 to 358) ""And at last, more than seventy years after the technology's inception, engineers were finally developing reactors with design priorities that lay not in making bombs but in generating electricity. In principle, these fourth-generation reactors would be cheaper, safer, smaller, more efficient, and less poisonous than their predecessors and could yet prove to be the technology that saves the world."" (358) There is a ""liquid fluoride thorium reactor (LFTR)"" developed at Tennessee's Oak Ridge National Laboratory that is fueled by ""thorium. More plentiful and far harder to process into bomb-making material than uranium, thorium also burns more efficiently in a reactor and could produce less hazardous radioactive waste with half-lives of hundreds, not tens of thousands, of years. . . . It does not require a massive containment building to guard against loss-of-coolant accidents or explosions and can be constructed on such a compact scale that every steel mill or small town could have its own microreactor tucked away underground."" (358) ""In 2015, Bill Gates had begun funding research projects similar to these fourth-generation reactors in a quest to create a carbon-neutral power source for the future. By then, the Chinese government had already set seven hundred scientists on a crash program to build the world's first industrial thorium reactor as part of a war on pollution. 'The problem of coal has become clear,' the engineering director of the project said. 'Nuclear power provides the only solution.'"" (358) I was selective in my quotes. The question now is, Must we turn to nuclear power as a last resort to get out of the mess of climate change? I would be interested in your responses. "
38,1501134612,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1863589-robert-sheard,5,"This is without question my top nonfiction read of 2019. It handles an amazingly complicated subject and history, and a massive cast of Soviet names, and somehow keeps it all clear even for non-scientist reader. If you're too young to remember Chernobyl, read this (and watch the HBO miniseries). If you are old enough to remember Chernobyl (and perhaps even Three Mile Island), read this anyway. It's frightening, compelling, brilliant, and vital as we try to ward off climate change and turn to energy sources other than fossil fuels. "

Senior Lieutenant Alexander Logachev loved radiation the way other men loved their wives. Tall and good-looking, twenty-six years old, with close-cropped dark hair and ice-blue eyes, Logachev had joined the Soviet army when he was still a boy. They had trained him well. The instructors from the military academy outside Moscow taught him with lethal poisons and unshielded radiation. He traveled to the testing grounds of Semipalatinsk in Kazakhstan, and to the desolte East Urals Trace, where the fallout from a clandestine radioactive accident still poisoned the landscape; eventually, Logachev’s training took him even to the remote and forbidden islands of Novaya Zemlya, high in the Arctic Circle and ground zero for the detonation of the terrible Tsar Bomba, the largest thermonuclear device in history.
Although I haven’t been born at the time of the Chernobyl disaster, the events of that time have fascinated me for years. This is probable also due to the fact that my parents, who were living in Poland during the catastrophe, were directly affected by the radioactive cloud. I have seen nearly every documentary that exists and I also found the HBO miniseries amazing! So amazing that every day I look skeptically in the direction of the nuclear power plant that stands here around the corner. So, it was clear that I would read this book the moment I heard about it for the first time. And even if, unfortunately, I had little time to read due to university and private courses, in the end it was absolutely worth! __________________________________________In the book, first there are some maps and overviews showing, among other things, Russia and the location of Pripyat and the construction of Unit Four of the Chernobyl Nuclear Plant (Tschernobylska AES im. W. I. Lenina). This is followed by a list of key persons and their function within the catastrophy. Then, the “story” begins.Journalist Higginbotham describes his incredibly well-researched information as far as possible in chronological order, sometimes even to the nearest second. It starts before the catastrophe and provides information on how the nuclear industry has built up in the USSR, how atomgrad* Pripyat was formed and how the nuclear power plant came online, years before the big mistake that was due to humane and machine failures.Within the text numerous, sometimes very scientific information, can be found – for example, how radiation works or that men radiate more than women due to their higher muslce mass. For me, there were actually some new things that I did not know before!In the further process, Higginbotham describes the events from the point of view of the varius persons: Director Brukhanov, scientist Legassov or the firefighters, who were unsuspecting at the scene and sealed their death with their intervention, but prevented a major catastrophe. Personally, this chapter has hit me the most, as I do not want to imagine how they must have felt in this situation.After detailed descriptions of the events at the plant and politics, which among other things led to the collapse of the Soviet Union, Higginbotham gives an insight into the current situation in the Ukraine: Among other things, he conducted interviews with people who vere involved in the disaster and he visits the ghost town of Pripyat. Attached are a glossary with all the important technical terms in the field of nuclear energy and images of the people and places mentioneds in the book. __________________________________________Even though the book requires a lot of concentration and you need a little more time to understand everything, it was absolutely worth to read this book! I would recommend it to anyone – whether he has already experienced the disaster or was born later. The topic is more present after the accident in Japan and should be known to everyone. For those who, like me, are interested in the events during that time, the book is an absolute must have!"

Ma!)Boom. Kablewey. You pick. Things burn. 51,300 comrades 💤 (Ma!) in their beds. It was only a 2 minute flight from Reactor 4 to Pripyat. Maybe 10 minutes by car. The radioactive dust took the car. MA!Are you telling this story, Dorothy? The explosion was mostly vertical, but the damage? The damage was horizontal, soaring on winded wings as far as Sweden and that’s when sh*t really got real - don’t 🙄 at your mother, Dorothy Zbornak! Where do you think Stan got his weirdness?So Gorbachev’s all open door and honesty’s the best policy - well, how do you like them dosimeters? Open door policy, my foot! That’s how some cities knew what happened! They took radioactive readings off the sandals of a lady who just traveled to Pripyat. Gorby didn’t tell them. It was the shoes!Back to my story: So we got bureaucrats on the ground, fires blazing in the central core, 1,200 Kievan buses evac’ing the city and no clue how to stop this giant wildebeest from exploding again, China Syndrome style. Meanwhile: The winds have blown ... now we gotta evac another 116k people in the newly designated “Exclusion Zone” (though later they’d rename it the “Nuclear Reservation” like that helps), but the story of Chernobyl doesn’t stop there! Nope...✋ Now we gotta get Reactors 1-3...back...online?? Isn’t that the reason we’re gonna throw 750,000 bio robots at this sucker to begin with?? Not sure what you call *waves hand dramatically* all this, then. Oh right, “nuclear meltdowns don’t happen in the Soviet Union” (Stellan Skarsgard better get an Emmy for that brilliantly executed meltdown!).So here we are, 30 ish years later (ironic that’s the “official” death toll = 31 souls), two sarcophagi, 800 radioactive waste dumps, 4700 km squared of inhabitable land, hu HUM huh of ARS victims (it’s classified. So, of course, they told me, but I’m Sophia Petrillo! I keep my word! I’ll write it down, you throw it in the fireplace!) and a city built specifically to support the wildebeest dies in 16 years. Don’t worry though, they moved everyone to Slavutych, another atomgrad, and hey, the world makes sense again!That’s how we tell stories in Sicily! Obviously, loved this one! It is a little dry, but as you can see, it’s hard to write without judgement. Higginbotham does just the facts, no sass and still tells the story in a way that’s both completely understandable and emotionally harrowing all at the same time. Very well done!"
41,1501134612,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9981052-nicholereadswithcats,5,Very informative. Some of the scientific information was a little over my head but I enjoyed the mix between facts and personal experience. Shocking the lengths which were taken to attempt to cover up what happened. Loved the pictures at the end.
42,1501134612,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3670585-erin-cataldi,3,"This book has all the info you never knew you needed on Chernobyl - down to the last technical detail. I listened to this rather than reading it and was soon bogged down by the sheer amount of physics detailed; at times I found myself struggling to pay attention. That being said, this was still a fascinating detailed look on the events that caused the accidents and the actions taken afterward. It was a perfect storm of horrible events and it really will get your heart racing as the author gives you a near minute by minute account. Unsettling at moments, and overly technical; this insanely well researched guide is not for the casual reader. This book is heavy; but will change the way you think about Chernobyl forever! "
43,1501134612,http://goodreads.com/user/show/55342889-elizabethanne-olsen,5,Just. Fucking. Fantastic. The descriptions of the destruction seemed so surreal like it was a fictional dystopian novel. So difficult to grasp the enormity of this as a real event. The horrific descriptions of ailments to the ones who suffered exposure was intense and necessary. Everyone should real this book. Everyone. 
44,1501134612,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2168708-marta,5,"Astonishing, thrillingly written, with a lot of new information, including the causes of the accident. I have bought this on audio and listened to it; but I missed so much information that I am listening to it again. It is thrilling the second time as well, and this time I can put the stories of the people more into context. My family was also interested so I bought a print copy as well. I am using it to look up names, and there are pictures as well. I stopped listening second time about halfway through - the pandemic happened and I am tired of bad news. This is a thrilling telling of a cautionary tale about the dangers of arrogance dealing with the forces of nature. The minimizing, denials, trying to cover it up, confused scrambling to stall an even bigger disaster - all echo in the reaction of the US government to the pandemic in the last weeks/months. The arrogance and the wishful thinking that made the disaster so much worse are just as present now. Leaders need to read history - and we elected one that expressly disdains science, reading, and history. This is of course wholly unfair to the people in the Chernobyl catastrophe. There was a lot of heroism, and some ofticials showed remarkable leadership. Which is why I felt most enraged when those operators who gave their lives willingly and performed heroics to save the reactor in the first hours of the disaster, were scapegoated. These people were heroes (well, some, I have no sympathy for plant director Brukhanov), and they were tried as criminals, some declared as such posthumously. The world was told at the time that the accident was caused by careless operators who conducted a test and disabled the safety systems. But in reality, the RBMK reactor had multiple design flaws and the accident was waiting to happen. One of those was in the emergency shutdown. When the Chernobyl operators realized they had trouble, they initiated a shutdown by dropping all safety rods - but instead of shutting down, the reactor went critical - because of the rods were graphite-tipped! The designers have discovered this flaw years before, but they thought it was unlikely to happen. (Arrogance and negligence). It was only an issue if most control rods were withdrawn - which was the case at Chernobyl, due to the other major flaw of the reactor, the positive void coefficient (Google it). This basically made it unsafe to operate the reactor at low power levels, which the designers also discovered, but all they did was sent a new operating manual, without explaining why this was important. Experienced operators did learn that the reactor got unstable at lower power levels, from experience, but did not know that it could be a safety risk. So when the manager of the tests wanted to perform it at low power levels, one protested - but he was overruled and threatened of being fired. Presumably the manager wanted to be safer... and thus the reactor went to overdrive with the lower powerlevel, so they withdrew the rods - then tried to shut down. Boom.All this has been previously detected as a risk, and ignored. Then came the fallout.Read this - but maybe not during a pandemic."
45,1501134612,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8413178-liam,5,"I, like everybody else, have been entranced by HBO's Chernobyl. Watching it, I realised how little I really knew about the disaster despite having spent untold hours wandering around in the fictional version of the Zone in the STALKER games.Much like most people I imagine, I was kind of astounded by how huge a disaster it actually was, and how close it came to being so much worse. I kind of ran under the assumption that the HBO show was dramatised to a certain extent, because how could I have possibly not heard that there was a distinct possibility that Reactor 4 would explode again with the force of several atomic bombs? - but no, this actually occurred.Higginbotham's writing is detached, which somehow makes it all the more impactful - dry descriptions of Pripyat firefighters experiencing 'violent diarrhea' in the days following the initial explosion, which was determined to be 'their intestines liquefying' is one example I'm going to have trouble forgetting.As a companion to the show, Midnight in Chernobyl was excellent. I didn't plan it out that way, but events in the show as I watched it every few nights kind of lined up to the events in the book as I listened to it on my way to and from work, expanding and providing further detail, or refuting the more dramatised parts of the show. Legasov for example is portrayed a lot more heroic in the show, routinely martyring himself before the Communist Party for the good of all - whereas he was far more likely to toe the Party line in real life, and only repented soon before his death.Midnight in Chernobyl is a fantastic in-depth exploration of the disaster - causes and repercussions, and it has certainly sparked interest in the topic for myself. An excellently written book, very well read by Jacques Roy. Highly recommend."

If, instead, you want to know the true story read Higginbotham's fine book, which does an excellent job of not only describing in a blow-by-blow fashion the disaster and it's aftermath, but places the disaster in the broader context of Soviet society and rule. 4-stars."
47,1501134612,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5072847-will-ansbacher,5,"Well written, fast paced and unbelievable action – this would be a terrific disaster thriller if it wasn’t actually all true.Adam Higginbotham has done a simply brilliant job of researching and writing about the world’s worst nuclear disaster, with a style that’s riveting yet balanced and without hyperbole. It opens with a couple of pages describing Civil Defence responders’ panic as they first realize the extent of the radioactive horror they’d been catapulted into. From that initial adrenalin burst, the first part of the story (titled Birth of a City) goes back to the origins of nuclear power development in Russia and the founding of the atomic city of Pripyat, and is interleaved with the events surrounding the explosion of reactor #4 and the immediate after-effects. The longer part two (Death of an Empire) covers the awful radiation effects, the mainly futile clean-up attempts, the cover-ups, denials, excruciating investigations and show trials; at the same time providing insight into the breakup of the USSR. (If Chernobyl wasn’t the catalyst that led to the end of the Soviet Union, then it certainly was a major factor). The story ends with more recent developments, including interviews the author had with those involved - at least, those who still were alive after 2006.This changing focus is a really effective way of dealing with a highly complex subject that could otherwise have been quite dry. Interestingly, I thought, the structure mirrors radiation poisoning itself: the initial terrifying experience of acute exposure and a short period of apparent recovery, but followed by the much longer and agonizing progress of an array of worsening symptoms. I won’t go into the story itself, (this  NY Times review is a great summary). But I was struck by a few recurrent themes:One, the cynical way disasters were suppressed so nobody could ever learn from previous mistakes;Two, the culture of craven compliance that prevented anyone from speaking out about known problems; (Together, these made not only the reactor explosion inevitable but the aftermath about as bad as it could possibly be)Three, the casual attitudes – bordering on macho defiance - to radiation dangers;And four, the sheer resilience of the Russian and Ukrainian people – both workers at the plant and the general population - in the face of all the horrors that were thrown at them. (Though these last two are as much the result of the authorities ruthlessly suppressing information) A ton of authoritative information has become available over the last 30 years, and Higginbotham seems to have read it all - there are 100 pages of end notes alone. However in order not to interrupt the flow he wisely left all the cross-referencing to the end, where a few relevant words in each note point to the text. There is also an extensive bibliography and a short but useful cast of characters ... Ligachev? Logachev? Legasov? ... which I found I had to flip back to often. There is still much we don’t know about Chernobyl, but to understand the disaster and what it means, I don’t think you could do better than this book. It isn’t perfect of course; Higginbotham didn’t explain some of the radiation physics or its effects on humans too well, but for this non-technical account it’s more than good enough."
48,1501134612,http://goodreads.com/user/show/32091911-sallie-dunn,4,"This was an excellent and thoroughly researched telling of the nuclear disaster that happened in Chernobyl in 1986. Despite the scientific leanings (some of which was over my head) it was immensely readable account of the event. There was background relating to the construction of the nuclear reactor and a minute by minute, hour by hour account of the disaster itself as it unfolded on April 26, 1986. Then the aftermath, the world-wide scale of international proportions, the denial, the cover-up, the prosecution and trials that followed were riveting reading. If you’re in the mood for some serious non-fiction, this is it! Four stars from me. "

50,1501134612,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11701608-barbara,5,"10+stars: Oh My Dear Lord, this novel will scare the beejesus out of you. Journalist Adam Higgnbothem has written an amazing documentary of the 1986 catastrophe at the Chernobyl nuclear plant in the USSR. I listened to the audible production that is narrated by Jacques Roy. At the beginning, Roy lists all the important characters in this story. Since I listened to it, I was at a disadvantage keeping all the players straight in my head. If one wants to truly understand the politics, lies, radiation illnesses, etc, that involved each character, one should read the novel. As an American listener, all those Russian names were difficult to keep in my mind.That said, it is an amazing listen. Just getting the timeline of events, the mistakes, the horror of the disaster while listening is enough for me. This tragedy was a culmination of mistakes. Although the USSR wanted to lay blame on separate individuals, Higgenbothem shows that is was straws, that individually wouldn’t be the blame, but added together resulted in a global tragedy. Also, it was the political pressure and the culture of Russia at that time that lead to the explosion. Russia wanted to save face which added layers to the event that cost thousands of lives. The government secrecy magnified mistakes.Higgenbothem exposes the devastating losses and damages to humans, the landscape, and animals. Once the catastrophe made global news, he explains the collective efforts made to find solutions. Nuclear energy seems here to stay. Creating safe nuclear energy is paramount to the safety and survival of the earth. Making worker education a priority is a necessity. We must remain aware and well informed of the cost/benefit of producing nuclear energy. This is an amazing case study."
51,1501134612,http://goodreads.com/user/show/92319245-mona,4,"This is probably one of the most comprehensive books about Cherbobyl disaster. Author and his multiple researchers did a great job going through documentation, books, articles and statements. They also interviewed quite a few people who participated in described events.Book is well written and narrative is concise. Author guides a reader through basics of physics and construction necessary to understand the events properly. I specifically liked the description of research done on the reactor which were conducted few years after the disaster. I was not familiar with those findings.When it comes to shortcomings of this book - it was written by Brit living in the US and this Western point of view is very clear here. I felt the narration had lingering condescending and superior tone to it, what at points became quite annoying. I think the author did not have a good understanding of Russian culture and mentality (particularly noted during his last interview with the plant director) and he undermined the value of some heroic acts done by firefighters and soldiers after the disaster. This is not the first book I read on this topic and I think Russian and Ukrainian writers are much better in this area for obvious reasons.This is a great book for Westerners who know nothing or close to nothing about Charnobyl disaster and would like to have a general overview. Kinda ""all you can eat""..... but not a white cloth."

It was as good a read as any gripping thriller with the downside that this is not fiction but reality.

''But when I went back to Ukraine, they started telling me about people who had died. Was it due to radiation? I don't know. I don't understand anything about statistics. But, when my friends ask me about it, I tell them: the less you think about it, the longer you'll live.''Midnight in Chernobyl autora Adama Higginbothama enciklopedijski je uvid u najveću nuklearnu katastrofu koja se dogodila u Černobilju, u Ukrajini 26.aprila 1986. godine.Priča o najvećoj nesreći jedne države, grada, političkog i državnog uređenja, počinje u trenutku kada se postavljaju temelji za građenje ovog nukelarnog postrojenja 1970. godine i rađanja grada u kome su živjeli ljudi zaposleni na izgradnji, kao i radnici predviđeni da rade u novootvorenoj centrali.U jeku hladnog rata Sovjetski savez se svim silama trudio da ukroti atom, da svijetu podari sliku o naučnim dostignućima bez premca, a ljudi su uživali u plodovima svog rada, bezbrižni, poletni i vjerni državi koja im je stvorila atomski grad Pripjat, obezbjedila udobnost sadašnjosti i velike planove za budućnost.Ali sovjetski naučnici koji su radili pod okriljem jednog zatvorenog i ambicioznog sistema, zatvarali su oči pred bilo kakvim greškama na koje su upozoravani prilikom izrade nuklearnih reaktora RBMK-1000 (koji je i eksplodirao u Černobilju), sve mane koje su nesumnjivo postojale držane su u strogoj tajnosti, a sve, naizgled, male stvari dovele su do katastrofe koja je, prema mnogima, dovela i do raspada SSSR-a.Autor se kroz brojne izvore ovim događajem bavio sa naučnog, političkog, socijalnog i ljudskog aspekta, hirurški precizno kombinujući dešavanja u Černobilju sa sudbinama stanovnika Pripjata, koji nesvjesni onoga što ih je snašlo odlaze iz svojih domova, dok radijacija bjesomučno prekriva kvadratne kilometre gradova, tokove rijeka, dječije igračke, kućne ljubimce i tijela svih koji su učestvovali u saniranju posljedica eksplozije.Usljed loše izrađenog reaktora, kojim su upravljali ambiciozni i često nestručni ljudi, zaslijepljeni egom i grandioznošću, 26.aprila 1986. godine desio se početak kraja jednog doba, zapečanjen sudbinama nekih običnih ljudi koji su na poziv domovine golim rukama uklanjali radioaktivni materijal, koji su u sobama Bolnice broj šest ostavljali svoje živote, koji su gradili sarkofag iznad uništenog reaktora u uslovima visoke radijacije kobne po ljudsko zdravlje.A put kojim se došlo do toga, kao i njegove posljedice Adam Higginbotham predstavio je na opširan, zanimljiv i stručan način, te ostavio još jedno važno svjedočanstvo o ovom događaju.P.S. Ponovo preporučujem da pogledate HBO mini seriju Chernobyl, s obzirom da je nakon gledanja mnogo lakše shvatiti suštinu ove knjige, kao i komplikovane opise načina rada nuklearnog reaktora.''Amid the chaos of the collapsing empire, most of the men and women who had fought the Battle of Chernobyl were forgotten - the final defenders of a nation that had seemingly vanished overnight.''"
57,1501134612,http://goodreads.com/user/show/684704-morgan,5,"It took fourteen days to read, but I was riveted and fascinated the entire time. I am too young to remember the Chernobyl melt down when the event took place in 1986, but I'm certain it's an event that contributed to my very vague, yet frightening notions of the war grown ups referred to as Cold.Later in life, I discovered pictures of Pripyat -an abandoned and radioactive city. These images captivated and haunted me. Yet, why did Chernobyl really melt down, and could other nuclear power plants face such demise? (An uneasy question for someone who heard a nuclear power plant's monthly test sirens while sitting in her high school classes.)This book delivered a lot of information - from how nuclear fission takes place, to who were the people on the ground before, during, and after the explosions in 1986. For me, the science bits were just enough - explained with clarity, yet never cumbersome or off-putting. (I'm language oriented, so science text books are off-putting for me personally.) But, the heart of this book is the people you meet. The firemen, the young nuclear engineers, an architect mapping out an ideal city, people loyal (albeit, questionably) to their county and the beliefs it strived to uphold. Midnight in Chernobyl portrayed a nuclear power plant, its atomgard, and its people with such distinction, that it was hard to shake any of these elements even when the book was closed. That childhood fear of the Cold War and nuclear weapons crept into my dreams, waking me with fears of radiation exposure and an urgency to find my children. A fleeting moment later, and my comfortable reality reasserted itself; but I wanted to know more, to understand more about an era in history - and about our future.It's quite a read. I'll eagerly offer it up to other readers as a worthy title. **(I already have - my apologies to those who came to my family's cook-out over the weekend who listened to me chatter on about a nuclear meltdown, when all they wanted to do was enjoy some pulled pork and spare ribs. I really do try to keep the overzealous librarian in me at bay during large social events, but alas, this title was just too good.)"
58,1501134612,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5862503-sweetwilliam,5,"Rarely do I read a book of 385 pages in 3 or 4 sittings but this book was engrossing. I started it on a Thursday and finished it over the weekend. It is an indictment of a flawed system of government. I watched the Chernobyl mini-series several times. Had not my son given this book to me as a birthday present, I probably wouldn’t have read it but I’m glad I did. A miniseries cannot delve into the details and provide all the interesting backstories and other essential information intrinsic to this story. The reactor was of a flawed design. This disaster was bound to happen sooner or later. Previous accidents had been swept under the rug. Soviet prestige was at stake and this was more important than the safety of the people or the planet. There was no oversight. In fact on page 323, Acadamician Valery Legasov realized “…the true scope of the decay at the heart of the [Soviet] nuclear state: The culture of secrecy and complacency, the arrogance and negligence and the shoddy standards of design and construction.”  On page 327 the author explains that the explosion was the last straw of a failing system:The most destructive forces unleashed by the explosion of Reactor Number Four were not radiological but political and economic. The cloud of radiation that spread out across Europe, making the catastrophe impossible to conceal had forced the touted openness of Gorbachev’s glasnost on even the most reluctant conservatives in the Politburo. Even the nuclear bureaucracy had been undermined by secrecy, incompetence, and stagnation convinced him that the entire state was rotten. Perestroika was launched in a desperate bid to save the Socialist experiment before it was too late. But all this did was to promote discussion on other censored topics such as drug addiction, abortion, Afghan war, and the horrors of Stalinism.Thus the author argues, the Chernobyl disaster brought down an empire. It is a fascinating read."
59,1501134612,http://goodreads.com/user/show/284714-kasandra,4,"This is a fascinating, horrifying, depressing, and enlightening read, with tons of details I'd never heard or learned before. What's most terrifying is how much the chances of this were known inside the former Soviet Union and covered up for years (along with previous accidents). The heroism of many Russians is astounding in dealing with this crisis, as is the callousness of others. A warning for the nuclear energy industry and all of us, about how quickly this technology can spiral out of control without transparency, honesty, readiness for all emergencies, and even with all proper planning - how quickly we can destroy ourselves and our environment due to simple human error and pride. Incredibly well-reported and thorough, and highly recommended."
60,1501134612,http://goodreads.com/user/show/34570157-jenny-jo-weir,4,Wow! This one was a hard read. The whole time I'm thinking about all that radiation and the effects of the explosion. The amount of people affected by this and the cost of this unfortunate event were unprecedented. You can't help but feel bad fro all the people involved and for all the victims. It's something that sticks with you. 
61,1501134612,http://goodreads.com/user/show/38617426-juli,4,"Interest in the Chernobyl nuclear disaster has spiked since the award winning HBO mini-series aired. I watched the show and listened to HBO's accompanying podcast and several other podcast episodes on the accident and its aftermath. Several of the podcasts mentioned this book, so I secured a spot on the library's wait list for the audiobook. I'm glad I did! This book is excellent!Higginbotham outlines the buildup of the soviet power grid and nuclear technology. Along the way there were accidents, cost cutting measures that had disastrous effects, mismanagement, poor training and flawed maintenance. All the mistakes culminated in the explosion at Chernobyl on April 25, 1986.Higginbotham gives details about the people involved, the plant itself, the history of Soviet nuclear power, the accident, the evacuation of Pripyat, and the continuing aftermath of the accident. It's a very interesting, and concerning, story. Many countries have nuclear power plants now. It's an awesome way to generate electricity, unless there is an accident. In recent years, the Fukushima accident shows that an earthquake or other natural event can cause modern nuclear plants to become quite dangerous. But with mismanagement, bad maintenance, lackluster employee training and shoddy parts/construction, any nuclear plant can be potentially dangerous. With more countries around the world turning to nuclear power, the chances of an accident increase.....I remember news reports in 1986 about the event. I can remember initial reports stating that it was known there had been some sort of nuclear event in the Soviet Union but scientists were not sure what had happened and no information was being released by USSR officials. When the full truth came out, it was horrifying. An entire city evacuated. Firemen and emergency response personnel dying. The struggle to prevent a melt-down. 33 years later, many are still interested in the accident and the lasting damage it caused. Pripyat is becoming a tourist attraction even. Yikes! I can think of much better vacation sites than one that is completely irradiated. Pripyat, and the surrounding region, will be not be safely habitable for more than 20,000 years.Nuclear power is safe when handled responsibly by properly trained people. Most plants operating in the modern world are quite safe, and managed/maintained properly. But, a nuclear power plant can be potentially deadly if proper safety protocols are not strictly adhered to and the potential effects of natural disasters and other catastrophes are not properly taken into consideration. I hope it is a very, very long time -- or never -- that our planet ends up with another uninhabitable, radiation soaked region from a nuclear accident. The effects are long lasting, and far reaching.Great book! Lots of highly researched information presented in an interesting manner. The audio book is about 14 hours long and narrated by Jacques Roy. Roy reads at a steady pace. His voice is easily understandable. Very enjoyable listening experience!"
62,1501134612,http://goodreads.com/user/show/352711-leftbanker,5,"I began this book out of desperation from the cliff-hanger of episode 2 of Chernobyl on HBO, one of the best TV dramas I’ve ever watched. Like the series, the pacing and tone of this account reads like the best of thrillers and I literally couldn’t put it down. I’m old enough to have vivid recollections of the event as it was unfolding. My USAF unit stationed in Athens, Greece, received intelligence on the crisis well ahead of the local news. We knew that it was a nuclear accident well before the Soviets admitted to this fact, but what we didn’t know was just how close the world was to a bigger, unspeakable disaster. This news really wasn’t available for years after the events of April 1986. The world had moved on. I had all but forgotten Chernobyl until this brilliant series came over the horizon. A viewer of the series wrote, “The tragedy will live forever because of this haunting masterpiece, what a brilliant creative achievement.” I could say the same for this book. Informative, objective, and written with a breath-taking pace, I couldn’t recommend it more highly to anyone looking to become better informed on the events of Chernobyl, both when it happened, and in the years since.It’s hard to laugh when you’re reading in the fetal position, but this part struck me as the epitome of gallows humor. One nuclear scientist working on cleaning up the disaster gives safety advice to another nuclear scientist just arriving, “If you smell ozone, run!”The big surprise is that the death toll wasn’t tens of times greater than the reality. Of course, we may never know the true results of the accident as Soviet record keeping tended to down-play cancer deaths which may have been related to Chernobyl.The most terrifying aspect of all is to consider how our leaders today would deal with a disaster on this order. Even the monumentally corrupt Soviets of that era had some highly intelligent, rational people among them, which is more than you can say of Putin and Trump, and their flunkies. Trump prevaricates on matters of little or no importance; imagine his response on this sort of travesty."
63,1501134612,http://goodreads.com/user/show/714583-anita-pomerantz,3,"This book is sooo highly rated and was listed as ""best non-fiction"" by numerous sources in 2019. All I have to say is I wish I read Voices from Chernobyl: The Oral History of a Nuclear Disaster instead. This book was just boring unless you like reading a lot about engineering and the technical structure of power plants and buildings. In addition, there are a zillion Russian names, and even with Kindle X-Ray and a guide to who was who, I struggled because the people just were not brought to life for me.This is reporting. It's very strong reporting, and it unveils the type of cover-up that makes you worried about government and implies that conspiracy theories can be true. The story is important. I just did not find it interesting because of the absolute overload of details, many of which were beyond my understanding or ability to picture. Maybe my timing in picking up this one was just way off . . .as we are in the middle of a crisis ourselves, my concentration is pretty shot. So, judge this one by the reviews of others. I just can barely bring myself to give it 3 stars. "
64,1501134612,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5349403-carolyn,4,"The author has written an impressive, comprehensive book of historical importance. It brings to light events surrounding the Chernobyl catastrophe of 1986 which may be unknown to many in the Western world, and even to the Russian people. The author presents a crash course in nuclear physics and energy, simplified as much as possible. This may present difficulties for the average reader without some background knowledge. I thought the human factor surrounding the disaster to be interesting and appreciated that the book included a summary list of the Cast of Characters and their positions and involvement with Chernobyl. The book emphasized the social/political Cold War mentality, economic factors, technical failures, the cut-throat ambition of the politicians and their secrecy which led to public complacency or wild rumours. Reaction time was slow due to uncertainty and arguments about the best course of action. I feel this is the definitive book of situations leading up to the disaster, what happened when Reactor 4 malfunctioned causing a huge surge of radiation, and its aftermath. The history is impeccable and thoroughly researched and stands as a sample for other writers of historical events and will be the definitive book on Chernobyl.The Chernobyl atomic complex was built to produce cheap electricity for a vast surrounded area, and to establish the Soviet Union ’s predominance in nuclear power. The disaster occurred in Reactor #4 on April 26, 1986. A model town, Pripyat, was built in the wilderness area close to the Nuclear Plant to house tens of thousands of workers and their families. From rough, cold shacks inhabited by the early builders, it grew into an impressive town with 3 schools, 35 playgrounds, 3 swimming pools, a library, sports facility and shopping center. Groceries and goods in the stores were more varied and abundant than in cities of origin of most of the workers. No expense was spared in planting trees and importing flowering shrubs to enhance the blocks of apartments. The nuclear accident which occurred resulted in a coverup where plant workers and women and children were not aware of the danger to their lives and health from nuclear fallout.there were cultural and political reasons contributing to lack of safety. Poor building design, shoddy materials, forced deadlines for builders and plant workers to meet, incompetent and negligent staff without knowledge of dangers they faced. There had been a smaller explosion at another plant and plenty of malfunctions but they were ignorant of possible critical problems. After the reactor imploded and seemed to be going into meltdown, releasing radiation far and wide, members of the emergency response team who did know the peril were either forced to stop the leak or went in willingly out of patriotic duty.  Following the disaster, people of Pripyat went about their lives ignorant of dangers from radioactive fallout. During this time a gathering of academics, Generals and politicians argued about the course they needed to take but were mainly concerned with secrecy. Finally, it was decided to evacuate the town of 51,000 people but leaving behind 4,000 essential service workers. People being evacuated were led to believe that they would only be away from home a couple of days and to bring only essentials for a short stay. Immediately after the explosion, there were two deaths of reactor workers.28 died soon of acute radiation sickness.. Evacuation orders soon included 90,000 people within a 30 K radius. High radiation levels soon spread to areas distant from Chernobyl and was detected in Sweden, Belarus and Poland. By May 20, 95,000 people had been hospitalized. High levels of radioactivity had already reached the capital, Kiev. May Day celebrations were carried out in the open air. Soon over 300,000 children were ordered evacuated from Kiev, along with expectant and nursing mothers (about 1/5 of the population). Teams were hired to shoot 20,000 domestic animals left behind.  We will never know how many people died over the years from radiation-induced cancers, as doctors were pressed not to mention a possible connection. Once the danger of a meltdown had eased and the reactor was covered with a dome, it was felt necessary to lay blame. Six plant officials were put on trial resulting in prison sentences. Official statements refused to place blame on faulty building materials, reactor design flaws, or the irresponsibility and poor discipline of the plant workers present when the disaster occurred. They had been conducting a safety inspection to simulate a power failure and did not follow the procedure properly outlined on a checklist. The author emphasizes the social/political Cold War mentality. The secrecy of generals and politicians which led to wild rumours or complacency subsequently caused the people to distrust in their leaders. Economic factors due to the billions of rubles spent on evacuation, housing, pay for thousands of emergency workers, and the deactivating the reactor was a great financial loss for the country. The author feels this was a major factor contributing to the breakup of the Soviet Union Thanks to NetGalley and Simon & Schuster for an advance copy of this important book."
65,1501134612,http://goodreads.com/user/show/53179837-george,4,"This book covers the events from the construction of the plant to the fall of the Soviet Union, but unlike Serhii Plokhy he does it from the perspective of the people who were actually close enough to absorb the radiation. Mostly he focused on the scientists, workers and liquidators, who had to deal with the clean up. He focused so much on these people that at the beginning of the book there was a list of characters, as if it was a play or something. I've never seen that done with a nonfiction book before, but maybe that was just a quirk of my particular edition. Now, because I have read Chernobyl: History of a Tragedy by Serhii Plokhy I couldn't help but compare these two. Serhii Plokhy covered the construction of the plant and the causes of the explosion itself better then Adam Higginbotham, but Adam didn't just brush of the clean up process. After reading them both I find it that they are both necessary to understand this disaster, just to get all the angles.Lastly, on to the Voices of Chernobyl to see what the ordinary people had to say about this whole mess. "
66,1501134612,http://goodreads.com/user/show/17428284-steven-z,5,"March 28, 1979 was an overcast day in Woodbridge, Va. when news arrived of a nuclear accident at Three Mile Island Unit 2 reactor near Middletown, Pa. Feeling totally in the dark when it came to information about the accident, my neighbors and I gathered outside our homes and immediately began testing to see which way the winds were blowing, and should we pack up and head in the opposite direction. Living about two and a half hours from the reactor which would eventually partially melt down, we were scared. Up to that time this would be considered the greatest nuclear accident in history being unaware of the Kyshtym Disaster which was a radioactive contamination accident that occurred on September 29, 1957 at Mayak, a plutonium production site in Russia for nuclear weapons and a nuclear fuel reprocessing plant in the Soviet Union. After reading Adam Higginbotham’s new book, MIDNIGHT IN CHERNOBYL: THE UNTOLD STORY OF THE WORLD’S GREATEST NUCLEAR DISASTER, an excellent account of the explosion and meltdown at Chernobyl the evening of April 25-26, 1986 and the ramifications of that disaster, memories of that March day flashed before my eyes.Higginbotham has written the most informative and insightful description of events and analysis of the meltdown that has yet to appear. It replaces Harvard historian, Serhii Plokhy’s CHERNOBYL: A HISTORY OF A NUCLEAR CATASYTROPHE as the most comprehensive and detailed work that has been written. In dealing with events such as Chernobyl one must ask: What happened, why did it happen, and could it happen again? Higginbotham, a journalist and his research partner Taras Shumeyko interviewed numerous eyewitnesses and conducted a prodigious amount of research that included a small number of declassified documents available, and argues that the fanatical view among Soviet bureaucrats and leadership to maintain secrecy, (for example, information about what occurred at Mayak was kept from the public for thirty years) was the reason the accident was so devastating, but also not surprising that it occurred. Higginbotham recreates the disaster providing a history of Soviet nuclear development, including numerous accidents; the planning and building of Chernobyl; the accident; attempts to remediate the situation after it occurred, the trial of the operators who were blamed for the disaster; and other aspects of the aftermath. The book reads in part as narrative history, but also a terrifying account of an event which could easily be repeated today.The plan to build Chernobyl was hatched in February 1970 as a means of catching up to the west and meet Soviet electricity needs. The Soviet Union would engage in a crash program to build nuclear reactors, but the problem was that the project began during a period of economic stagnation with material and resource shortages everywhere. The reactor was to be completed by 1975 which was totally unrealistic due to the approach taken by the Soviet bureaucracy, party elites, and engineers that did not consider shortages, safety needs, and planning for possible future nuclear accidents. The result is that corners were cut in terms of material, training, design flaws, “cooking the books,” and the stubborn nature of the Soviet bureaucracy in charge of construction. As Higginbotham discusses this aspect of the project, he provides the reader an interesting history of the development of radiation, nuclear development, and their affects on people and society. The author’s approach to complex scientific information and jargon is such that it is very easy to understand for the lay reader as he describes how reactors are supposed to be constructed.According to Higginbotham there were design flaws dealing with a high-power channel reactor labeled RMBK. These flaws would dog designers who would pay little attention to test results because of pressure from the Communist Party and the bureaucracy that flowed from it. This made disaster possible because no one knew how the reactor would react in case of an accident. The reactors colossal size made start up and shut down the most demanding and treacherous stages of RMBK operation. The author follows RMBK’s development and its flaws as it went into production, particularly the AZ-5 emergency protection system whose design took too long to respond in an emergency which came home to roost on April 25, 1986.  A similar plant in Leningrad experienced an accident on November 11, 1975 resulting in the release of radiation into the atmosphere over the Gulf of Finland. However, Sredmash, the Soviet agency in charge of production and construction of nuclear reactors covered up the investigative findings of design flaws related to the accident. On September 9, 1982 there was a partial meltdown at Unit 1 at Chernobyl which took eight months to repair, but the KGB instituted a gag order, and the following year a similar accident took place in a Lithuanian reactor and one in Armenia. But the world knew nothing of these accidents. Further exacerbating Soviet nuclear reactor building was the shoddy workmanship that plagued Soviet industry in general, and that carried over to the construction of Chernobyl.  A major problem that arose once Reactor #4 at Chernobyl exploded is that many of those in charge were unprepared to deal with what occurred and succumbed to wishful thinking and self-delusion in approaching how to deal with what had transpired. Higginbotham describes in detail the lethargic Soviet bureaucracy and their response to disaster. Soviet Prime Minister Mikhail Gorbachev was not notified as to what had occurred until the afternoon of April 26, 1986. The author narrates the debates inside the Commission that was set up to oversee the crisis. He relates the personalities involved and their debates on how to respond and their final decision making, many of which were out of some sort of fantasy. An excellent example apart from how to cool the reactor was whether they should evacuate the city of Pripyat and its 50,000 residents who were in danger of radiation exposure which took until April 27th to accomplish. As the radioactive cloud blew over Scandinavia, Swedish, Finish, and Danish diplomats lodged complaints to Moscow once it was realized where the radiation originated resulting in the Soviet government stonewalling. It would take until April 28th at 8:00pm for Moscow to come clean and announce that “an accident had taken place at the Chernobyl nuclear power plant.…One of the atomic reactors has been damaged.” Soviet citizens were used to this type of response as it was a continuation of the way the state had covered industrial accidents for decades.Higginbotham descriptions of helicopter pilots flying low dumping sand and boron on the reactor are harrowing. The author’s approach as he carefully describes how officials, academics, scientists, fire fighters, guards, and others and what they went through is chilling, especially as he brings the reader to Hospital #6 in Moscow created to treat victims of nuclear accidents and war. The ultimate fear was the “China Syndrome,” the further devastation that would occur if the reactor’s foundation exploded and nuclear material leaked into the earth. Even though Moscow TV announced on May 11, 1986 that the primary threat of explosion was over, scientists remained skeptical.The Central Committee of the Politburo decided against Gorbachev’s new policy of Glasnost and followed the traditional approach and blamed “bourgeois falsification….propaganda and inventions” as its immediate reaction, in addition to dishonesty and declining help from the west. This approach would backfire in terms of containing the accident but also hindering Gorbachev’s hope of nuclear disarmament talks with the United States because how could one negotiate with someone who was so untrustworthy.Higginbotham spends a great deal of time describing what the victims of the disaster experienced. He follows the medical care that victims received and for far too many their ultimate deaths. He recounts the bravery of so many who fought to contain the toxic results of the explosion, and countless men who returned to build the sarcophagus that was designed to seal reactor #4 for at least a hundred years. The narrative of how the newly created refugees, numbering over 116,000 from the exclusion zone is told with sensitivity and insight into their future plight. The scapegoating that dominated the investigation by Soviet authorities was appalling as was the propaganda machine that worked overtime to find blame and paint the accident in the best light as possible. The stories are often poignant and provide a true picture of what can happen on a personal and societal level from a nuclear disaster.Perhaps one of the most destructive results of Chernobyl was the beginning of the end of the Soviet Union. Gorbachev realized that even his own nuclear bureaucracy was rotten to the “core” and as was most of the Soviet state. The launching of perestroika opened debate among Soviet citizens that had been dormant, but slowly the issues of Afghanistan, drug addiction, the abortion epidemic, and the horrors of Stalinism emerged. The Russian people began to realize that they had been lied to for decades and as Higginbotham successfully argues they “faced the realization that their leaders were corrupt and that the Communist dream was a sham.”If wonders if a major nuclear accident could occur in the future remind yourself of Fukushima. In 2011, the Tokyo Electric Power Company’s nuclear plant underwent a process identical to Chernobyl; the loss of coolant that provoked a meltdown. As to what remains of Chernobyl itself, it is part of an “exclusion zone” of 1,000 square miles, a radioactive Eden for new wildlife and vegetation. Higginbotham has done the public a favor by exposing the events of April-May 1986 and give us pause as to how we should approach nuclear power in the future."
67,1501134612,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3357765-jimmy,5,"I have long been fascinated with Russia. Russian dissenters have long been my heroes going all the way back to Alexander Solzhenitsyn up to Pussy Riot and Garry Kasparov. It feels like Russia has an inferiority complex. The government is always trying to look bigger and stronger than they really are. Thus the arms buildups, the Olympic obsession, the meddling. In the case of Chernobyl, it was the cover ups, the refusal to admit mistakes, the effort to make the reactor bigger than anything else no matter how many corners had to be cut. As Higginbotham said, ""Lies and deception were endemic to the system, trafficked in both directions along the chain of management: those lower down passed up reports to their superiors packed with falsified statistics and inflated estimates, of unmet goals triumphantly reached, unfulfilled quotas heroically exceeded. To protect his own position, at every stage, relayed the lies upward or compounded them."" (15) ""Seated at the top of a teetering pyramid of falsehood, poring over reams of figures that had little basis in reality, were the economic mandarins of the State General Planning Committee--Gosplan--in Moscow."" (15) It worries me that Trump and his climate change deniers are setting up something of the same situation here in the US. Facts are not important in this administration. And scientific facts are even less important to the Trumpites. "". . . the plans called for fireproof cables, but when none could be found, the builders simply did the best they could."" (20) ""When the ministry of energy in Moscow learned that the roof of the plant's turbine hall had been covered with highly flammable bitumen, they ordered him to replace it. But the flame-retardent material . . . was not even being manufactured in the USSR, so the Ministry granted Brukhanov an exception, and the bitumen remained."" (20) But when they ordered him to build an ""olympic-sized swimming pool,"" he had to ""hoodwink the state bank"" to build it. He had no choice but to obey the order. Considering all of these facts, it makes me wonder if Chernobyl is the best way to look at nuclear power. The fault lies more with the communist system and its lack of regulatory power. People always think of communist systems as having too many regulations. In reality, communism has few regulations because it is all about the power at the top, like with Trump. The goal was to build ""increasingly gigantic stations throughout the western territories of the Union. By the end of the century, Moscow intended Chernobyl to be one part of a dense network of atomic power megacomplexes."" (20) In spite of ""alarming building faults,"" the work kept on. On pages 62 to 63, the designers saw ""no need to prepare for such a calamity"" in reference to the worst possible scenarios. All warnings about the dangers were ignored. Former Chernobyl chief engineer Nikolai Steinberg said that the origins of the disaster lay in a combination of ""scientific, technological, socioeconomic, and human factors"" unique to the USSR. (347) The Soviet Union ""lacked even rudimentary safety practices."" They ""relied upon its operators to behave with robotic precision night after night."" They were under ""constant pressure to beat deadlines."" All of this made ""disregard for the letter of the regulations almost inevitable."" The deceased operators of Control Room Number Four ""had brought the reactor into an unstable condition, but only on account of the acute pressure they felt to complete the test on the turbine."" (347) ""Some environmentalists argued that humanity could not afford to turn its back on the promise and terrors of the peaceful atom. The global need for electricity was increasing exponentially: humanity was predicted to double the amount of energy it used by 2050. Despite the growing certainty that burning fossil fuels was the cause of devastating climate change--making the stabilization of carbon emissions imperative--coal remained the most widely used source of energy in the world. The fine particulates from fossil fuel plants in the United States killed more than thirteen thousand people a year; worldwide, three million people died annually as a result of air pollution released by coal- and oil-fueled power stations. Even to begin to head off climate change over the coming thirty-five years would have to be clean, yet neither wind, solar, hydroelectric, nor geothermal power--nor any combination of them--had the potential to bridge the gap."" (357 to 358) ""And at last, more than seventy years after the technology's inception, engineers were finally developing reactors with design priorities that lay not in making bombs but in generating electricity. In principle, these fourth-generation reactors would be cheaper, safer, smaller, more efficient, and less poisonous than their predecessors and could yet prove to be the technology that saves the world."" (358) There is a ""liquid fluoride thorium reactor (LFTR)"" developed at Tennessee's Oak Ridge National Laboratory that is fueled by ""thorium. More plentiful and far harder to process into bomb-making material than uranium, thorium also burns more efficiently in a reactor and could produce less hazardous radioactive waste with half-lives of hundreds, not tens of thousands, of years. . . . It does not require a massive containment building to guard against loss-of-coolant accidents or explosions and can be constructed on such a compact scale that every steel mill or small town could have its own microreactor tucked away underground."" (358) ""In 2015, Bill Gates had begun funding research projects similar to these fourth-generation reactors in a quest to create a carbon-neutral power source for the future. By then, the Chinese government had already set seven hundred scientists on a crash program to build the world's first industrial thorium reactor as part of a war on pollution. 'The problem of coal has become clear,' the engineering director of the project said. 'Nuclear power provides the only solution.'"" (358) I was selective in my quotes. The question now is, Must we turn to nuclear power as a last resort to get out of the mess of climate change? I would be interested in your responses. "

It handles an amazingly complicated subject and history, and a massive cast of Soviet names, and somehow keeps it all clear even for non-scientist reader. If you're too young to remember Chernobyl, read this (and watch the HBO miniseries). If you are old enough to remember Chernobyl (and perhaps even Three Mile Island), read this anyway.

Senior Lieutenant Alexander Logachev loved radiation the way other men loved their wives. Tall and good-looking, twenty-six years old, with close-cropped dark hair and ice-blue eyes, Logachev had joined the Soviet army when he was still a boy. They had trained him well. The instructors from the military academy outside Moscow taught him with lethal poisons and unshielded radiation. He traveled to the testing grounds of Semipalatinsk in Kazakhstan, and to the desolte East Urals Trace, where the fallout from a clandestine radioactive accident still poisoned the landscape; eventually, Logachev’s training took him even to the remote and forbidden islands of Novaya Zemlya, high in the Arctic Circle and ground zero for the detonation of the terrible Tsar Bomba, the largest thermonuclear device in history.
Although I haven’t been born at the time of the Chernobyl disaster, the events of that time have fascinated me for years. This is probable also due to the fact that my parents, who were living in Poland during the catastrophe, were directly affected by the radioactive cloud. I have seen nearly every documentary that exists and I also found the HBO miniseries amazing! So amazing that every day I look skeptically in the direction of the nuclear power plant that stands here around the corner. So, it was clear that I would read this book the moment I heard about it for the first time. And even if, unfortunately, I had little time to read due to university and private courses, in the end it was absolutely worth! __________________________________________In the book, first there are some maps and overviews showing, among other things, Russia and the location of Pripyat and the construction of Unit Four of the Chernobyl Nuclear Plant (Tschernobylska AES im. W. I. Lenina). This is followed by a list of key persons and their function within the catastrophy. Then, the “story” begins.Journalist Higginbotham describes his incredibly well-researched information as far as possible in chronological order, sometimes even to the nearest second. It starts before the catastrophe and provides information on how the nuclear industry has built up in the USSR, how atomgrad* Pripyat was formed and how the nuclear power plant came online, years before the big mistake that was due to humane and machine failures.Within the text numerous, sometimes very scientific information, can be found – for example, how radiation works or that men radiate more than women due to their higher muslce mass. For me, there were actually some new things that I did not know before!In the further process, Higginbotham describes the events from the point of view of the varius persons: Director Brukhanov, scientist Legassov or the firefighters, who were unsuspecting at the scene and sealed their death with their intervention, but prevented a major catastrophe. Personally, this chapter has hit me the most, as I do not want to imagine how they must have felt in this situation.After detailed descriptions of the events at the plant and politics, which among other things led to the collapse of the Soviet Union, Higginbotham gives an insight into the current situation in the Ukraine: Among other things, he conducted interviews with people who vere involved in the disaster and he visits the ghost town of Pripyat. Attached are a glossary with all the important technical terms in the field of nuclear energy and images of the people and places mentioneds in the book. __________________________________________Even though the book requires a lot of concentration and you need a little more time to understand everything, it was absolutely worth to read this book! I would recommend it to anyone – whether he has already experienced the disaster or was born later. The topic is more present after the accident in Japan and should be known to everyone. For those who, like me, are interested in the events during that time, the book is an absolute must have!"

That being said, this was still a fascinating detailed look on the events that caused the accidents and the actions taken afterward. It was a perfect storm of horrible events and it really will get your heart racing as the author gives you a near minute by minute account. Unsettling at moments, and overly technical; this insanely well researched guide is not for the casual reader. This book is heavy; but will change the way you think about Chernobyl forever! "
73,1501134612,http://goodreads.com/user/show/55342889-elizabethanne-olsen,5,Just. Fucking. Fantastic. The descriptions of the destruction seemed so surreal like it was a fictional dystopian novel. So difficult to grasp the enormity of this as a real event. The horrific descriptions of ailments to the ones who suffered exposure was intense and necessary. Everyone should real this book. Everyone. 
74,1501134612,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2168708-marta,5,"Astonishing, thrillingly written, with a lot of new information, including the causes of the accident. I have bought this on audio and listened to it; but I missed so much information that I am listening to it again. It is thrilling the second time as well, and this time I can put the stories of the people more into context. My family was also interested so I bought a print copy as well. I am using it to look up names, and there are pictures as well. I stopped listening second time about halfway through - the pandemic happened and I am tired of bad news. This is a thrilling telling of a cautionary tale about the dangers of arrogance dealing with the forces of nature. The minimizing, denials, trying to cover it up, confused scrambling to stall an even bigger disaster - all echo in the reaction of the US government to the pandemic in the last weeks/months. The arrogance and the wishful thinking that made the disaster so much worse are just as present now. Leaders need to read history - and we elected one that expressly disdains science, reading, and history. This is of course wholly unfair to the people in the Chernobyl catastrophe. There was a lot of heroism, and some ofticials showed remarkable leadership. Which is why I felt most enraged when those operators who gave their lives willingly and performed heroics to save the reactor in the first hours of the disaster, were scapegoated. These people were heroes (well, some, I have no sympathy for plant director Brukhanov), and they were tried as criminals, some declared as such posthumously. The world was told at the time that the accident was caused by careless operators who conducted a test and disabled the safety systems. But in reality, the RBMK reactor had multiple design flaws and the accident was waiting to happen. One of those was in the emergency shutdown. When the Chernobyl operators realized they had trouble, they initiated a shutdown by dropping all safety rods - but instead of shutting down, the reactor went critical - because of the rods were graphite-tipped! The designers have discovered this flaw years before, but they thought it was unlikely to happen. (Arrogance and negligence). It was only an issue if most control rods were withdrawn - which was the case at Chernobyl, due to the other major flaw of the reactor, the positive void coefficient (Google it). This basically made it unsafe to operate the reactor at low power levels, which the designers also discovered, but all they did was sent a new operating manual, without explaining why this was important. Experienced operators did learn that the reactor got unstable at lower power levels, from experience, but did not know that it could be a safety risk. So when the manager of the tests wanted to perform it at low power levels, one protested - but he was overruled and threatened of being fired. Presumably the manager wanted to be safer... and thus the reactor went to overdrive with the lower powerlevel, so they withdrew the rods - then tried to shut down. Boom.All this has been previously detected as a risk, and ignored. Then came the fallout.Read this - but maybe not during a pandemic."
75,1501134612,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8413178-liam,5,"I, like everybody else, have been entranced by HBO's Chernobyl. Watching it, I realised how little I really knew about the disaster despite having spent untold hours wandering around in the fictional version of the Zone in the STALKER games.Much like most people I imagine, I was kind of astounded by how huge a disaster it actually was, and how close it came to being so much worse. I kind of ran under the assumption that the HBO show was dramatised to a certain extent, because how could I have possibly not heard that there was a distinct possibility that Reactor 4 would explode again with the force of several atomic bombs? - but no, this actually occurred.Higginbotham's writing is detached, which somehow makes it all the more impactful - dry descriptions of Pripyat firefighters experiencing 'violent diarrhea' in the days following the initial explosion, which was determined to be 'their intestines liquefying' is one example I'm going to have trouble forgetting.As a companion to the show, Midnight in Chernobyl was excellent. I didn't plan it out that way, but events in the show as I watched it every few nights kind of lined up to the events in the book as I listened to it on my way to and from work, expanding and providing further detail, or refuting the more dramatised parts of the show. Legasov for example is portrayed a lot more heroic in the show, routinely martyring himself before the Communist Party for the good of all - whereas he was far more likely to toe the Party line in real life, and only repented soon before his death.Midnight in Chernobyl is a fantastic in-depth exploration of the disaster - causes and repercussions, and it has certainly sparked interest in the topic for myself. An excellently written book, very well read by Jacques Roy. Highly recommend."
76,1501134612,http://goodreads.com/user/show/23195904-radiantflux,4,"72nd book for 2019.Friends have told me lots of good things about the HBO series on Chernobyl, too bad that many of its details are inaccurate, and will become fact in many people's minds. If, instead, you want to know the true story read Higginbotham's fine book, which does an excellent job of not only describing in a blow-by-blow fashion the disaster and it's aftermath, but places the disaster in the broader context of Soviet society and rule. 4-stars."
77,1501134612,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5072847-will-ansbacher,5,"Well written, fast paced and unbelievable action – this would be a terrific disaster thriller if it wasn’t actually all true.Adam Higginbotham has done a simply brilliant job of researching and writing about the world’s worst nuclear disaster, with a style that’s riveting yet balanced and without hyperbole. It opens with a couple of pages describing Civil Defence responders’ panic as they first realize the extent of the radioactive horror they’d been catapulted into. From that initial adrenalin burst, the first part of the story (titled Birth of a City) goes back to the origins of nuclear power development in Russia and the founding of the atomic city of Pripyat, and is interleaved with the events surrounding the explosion of reactor #4 and the immediate after-effects. The longer part two (Death of an Empire) covers the awful radiation effects, the mainly futile clean-up attempts, the cover-ups, denials, excruciating investigations and show trials; at the same time providing insight into the breakup of the USSR. (If Chernobyl wasn’t the catalyst that led to the end of the Soviet Union, then it certainly was a major factor). The story ends with more recent developments, including interviews the author had with those involved - at least, those who still were alive after 2006.This changing focus is a really effective way of dealing with a highly complex subject that could otherwise have been quite dry. Interestingly, I thought, the structure mirrors radiation poisoning itself: the initial terrifying experience of acute exposure and a short period of apparent recovery, but followed by the much longer and agonizing progress of an array of worsening symptoms. I won’t go into the story itself, (this  NY Times review is a great summary). But I was struck by a few recurrent themes:One, the cynical way disasters were suppressed so nobody could ever learn from previous mistakes;Two, the culture of craven compliance that prevented anyone from speaking out about known problems; (Together, these made not only the reactor explosion inevitable but the aftermath about as bad as it could possibly be)Three, the casual attitudes – bordering on macho defiance - to radiation dangers;And four, the sheer resilience of the Russian and Ukrainian people – both workers at the plant and the general population - in the face of all the horrors that were thrown at them. (Though these last two are as much the result of the authorities ruthlessly suppressing information) A ton of authoritative information has become available over the last 30 years, and Higginbotham seems to have read it all - there are 100 pages of end notes alone. However in order not to interrupt the flow he wisely left all the cross-referencing to the end, where a few relevant words in each note point to the text. There is also an extensive bibliography and a short but useful cast of characters ... Ligachev? Logachev? Legasov? ... which I found I had to flip back to often. There is still much we don’t know about Chernobyl, but to understand the disaster and what it means, I don’t think you could do better than this book. It isn’t perfect of course; Higginbotham didn’t explain some of the radiation physics or its effects on humans too well, but for this non-technical account it’s more than good enough."
78,1501134612,http://goodreads.com/user/show/32091911-sallie-dunn,4,"This was an excellent and thoroughly researched telling of the nuclear disaster that happened in Chernobyl in 1986. Despite the scientific leanings (some of which was over my head) it was immensely readable account of the event. There was background relating to the construction of the nuclear reactor and a minute by minute, hour by hour account of the disaster itself as it unfolded on April 26, 1986. Then the aftermath, the world-wide scale of international proportions, the denial, the cover-up, the prosecution and trials that followed were riveting reading. If you’re in the mood for some serious non-fiction, this is it! Four stars from me. "

80,1501134612,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11701608-barbara,5,"10+stars: Oh My Dear Lord, this novel will scare the beejesus out of you. Journalist Adam Higgnbothem has written an amazing documentary of the 1986 catastrophe at the Chernobyl nuclear plant in the USSR. I listened to the audible production that is narrated by Jacques Roy. At the beginning, Roy lists all the important characters in this story. Since I listened to it, I was at a disadvantage keeping all the players straight in my head. If one wants to truly understand the politics, lies, radiation illnesses, etc, that involved each character, one should read the novel. As an American listener, all those Russian names were difficult to keep in my mind.That said, it is an amazing listen. Just getting the timeline of events, the mistakes, the horror of the disaster while listening is enough for me. This tragedy was a culmination of mistakes. Although the USSR wanted to lay blame on separate individuals, Higgenbothem shows that is was straws, that individually wouldn’t be the blame, but added together resulted in a global tragedy. Also, it was the political pressure and the culture of Russia at that time that lead to the explosion. Russia wanted to save face which added layers to the event that cost thousands of lives. The government secrecy magnified mistakes.Higgenbothem exposes the devastating losses and damages to humans, the landscape, and animals. Once the catastrophe made global news, he explains the collective efforts made to find solutions. Nuclear energy seems here to stay. Creating safe nuclear energy is paramount to the safety and survival of the earth. Making worker education a priority is a necessity. We must remain aware and well informed of the cost/benefit of producing nuclear energy. This is an amazing case study."
81,1501134612,http://goodreads.com/user/show/92319245-mona,4,"This is probably one of the most comprehensive books about Cherbobyl disaster. Author and his multiple researchers did a great job going through documentation, books, articles and statements. They also interviewed quite a few people who participated in described events.Book is well written and narrative is concise. Author guides a reader through basics of physics and construction necessary to understand the events properly. I specifically liked the description of research done on the reactor which were conducted few years after the disaster. I was not familiar with those findings.When it comes to shortcomings of this book - it was written by Brit living in the US and this Western point of view is very clear here. I felt the narration had lingering condescending and superior tone to it, what at points became quite annoying. I think the author did not have a good understanding of Russian culture and mentality (particularly noted during his last interview with the plant director) and he undermined the value of some heroic acts done by firefighters and soldiers after the disaster. This is not the first book I read on this topic and I think Russian and Ukrainian writers are much better in this area for obvious reasons.This is a great book for Westerners who know nothing or close to nothing about Charnobyl disaster and would like to have a general overview. Kinda ""all you can eat""..... but not a white cloth."

''But when I went back to Ukraine, they started telling me about people who had died. Was it due to radiation? I don't know. I don't understand anything about statistics. But, when my friends ask me about it, I tell them: the less you think about it, the longer you'll live.''Midnight in Chernobyl autora Adama Higginbothama enciklopedijski je uvid u najveću nuklearnu katastrofu koja se dogodila u Černobilju, u Ukrajini 26.aprila 1986. godine.Priča o najvećoj nesreći jedne države, grada, političkog i državnog uređenja, počinje u trenutku kada se postavljaju temelji za građenje ovog nukelarnog postrojenja 1970. godine i rađanja grada u kome su živjeli ljudi zaposleni na izgradnji, kao i radnici predviđeni da rade u novootvorenoj centrali.U jeku hladnog rata Sovjetski savez se svim silama trudio da ukroti atom, da svijetu podari sliku o naučnim dostignućima bez premca, a ljudi su uživali u plodovima svog rada, bezbrižni, poletni i vjerni državi koja im je stvorila atomski grad Pripjat, obezbjedila udobnost sadašnjosti i velike planove za budućnost.Ali sovjetski naučnici koji su radili pod okriljem jednog zatvorenog i ambicioznog sistema, zatvarali su oči pred bilo kakvim greškama na koje su upozoravani prilikom izrade nuklearnih reaktora RBMK-1000 (koji je i eksplodirao u Černobilju), sve mane koje su nesumnjivo postojale držane su u strogoj tajnosti, a sve, naizgled, male stvari dovele su do katastrofe koja je, prema mnogima, dovela i do raspada SSSR-a.Autor se kroz brojne izvore ovim događajem bavio sa naučnog, političkog, socijalnog i ljudskog aspekta, hirurški precizno kombinujući dešavanja u Černobilju sa sudbinama stanovnika Pripjata, koji nesvjesni onoga što ih je snašlo odlaze iz svojih domova, dok radijacija bjesomučno prekriva kvadratne kilometre gradova, tokove rijeka, dječije igračke, kućne ljubimce i tijela svih koji su učestvovali u saniranju posljedica eksplozije.Usljed loše izrađenog reaktora, kojim su upravljali ambiciozni i često nestručni ljudi, zaslijepljeni egom i grandioznošću, 26.aprila 1986. godine desio se početak kraja jednog doba, zapečanjen sudbinama nekih običnih ljudi koji su na poziv domovine golim rukama uklanjali radioaktivni materijal, koji su u sobama Bolnice broj šest ostavljali svoje živote, koji su gradili sarkofag iznad uništenog reaktora u uslovima visoke radijacije kobne po ljudsko zdravlje.A put kojim se došlo do toga, kao i njegove posljedice Adam Higginbotham predstavio je na opširan, zanimljiv i stručan način, te ostavio još jedno važno svjedočanstvo o ovom događaju.P.S. Ponovo preporučujem da pogledate HBO mini seriju Chernobyl, s obzirom da je nakon gledanja mnogo lakše shvatiti suštinu ove knjige, kao i komplikovane opise načina rada nuklearnog reaktora.''Amid the chaos of the collapsing empire, most of the men and women who had fought the Battle of Chernobyl were forgotten - the final defenders of a nation that had seemingly vanished overnight.''"
87,1501134612,http://goodreads.com/user/show/684704-morgan,5,"It took fourteen days to read, but I was riveted and fascinated the entire time. I am too young to remember the Chernobyl melt down when the event took place in 1986, but I'm certain it's an event that contributed to my very vague, yet frightening notions of the war grown ups referred to as Cold.Later in life, I discovered pictures of Pripyat -an abandoned and radioactive city. These images captivated and haunted me. Yet, why did Chernobyl really melt down, and could other nuclear power plants face such demise? (An uneasy question for someone who heard a nuclear power plant's monthly test sirens while sitting in her high school classes.)This book delivered a lot of information - from how nuclear fission takes place, to who were the people on the ground before, during, and after the explosions in 1986. For me, the science bits were just enough - explained with clarity, yet never cumbersome or off-putting. (I'm language oriented, so science text books are off-putting for me personally.) But, the heart of this book is the people you meet. The firemen, the young nuclear engineers, an architect mapping out an ideal city, people loyal (albeit, questionably) to their county and the beliefs it strived to uphold. Midnight in Chernobyl portrayed a nuclear power plant, its atomgard, and its people with such distinction, that it was hard to shake any of these elements even when the book was closed. That childhood fear of the Cold War and nuclear weapons crept into my dreams, waking me with fears of radiation exposure and an urgency to find my children. A fleeting moment later, and my comfortable reality reasserted itself; but I wanted to know more, to understand more about an era in history - and about our future.It's quite a read. I'll eagerly offer it up to other readers as a worthy title. **(I already have - my apologies to those who came to my family's cook-out over the weekend who listened to me chatter on about a nuclear meltdown, when all they wanted to do was enjoy some pulled pork and spare ribs. I really do try to keep the overzealous librarian in me at bay during large social events, but alas, this title was just too good.)"
88,1501134612,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5862503-sweetwilliam,5,"Rarely do I read a book of 385 pages in 3 or 4 sittings but this book was engrossing. I started it on a Thursday and finished it over the weekend. It is an indictment of a flawed system of government. I watched the Chernobyl mini-series several times. Had not my son given this book to me as a birthday present, I probably wouldn’t have read it but I’m glad I did. A miniseries cannot delve into the details and provide all the interesting backstories and other essential information intrinsic to this story. The reactor was of a flawed design. This disaster was bound to happen sooner or later. Previous accidents had been swept under the rug. Soviet prestige was at stake and this was more important than the safety of the people or the planet. There was no oversight. In fact on page 323, Acadamician Valery Legasov realized “…the true scope of the decay at the heart of the [Soviet] nuclear state: The culture of secrecy and complacency, the arrogance and negligence and the shoddy standards of design and construction.”  On page 327 the author explains that the explosion was the last straw of a failing system:The most destructive forces unleashed by the explosion of Reactor Number Four were not radiological but political and economic. The cloud of radiation that spread out across Europe, making the catastrophe impossible to conceal had forced the touted openness of Gorbachev’s glasnost on even the most reluctant conservatives in the Politburo. Even the nuclear bureaucracy had been undermined by secrecy, incompetence, and stagnation convinced him that the entire state was rotten. Perestroika was launched in a desperate bid to save the Socialist experiment before it was too late. But all this did was to promote discussion on other censored topics such as drug addiction, abortion, Afghan war, and the horrors of Stalinism.Thus the author argues, the Chernobyl disaster brought down an empire. It is a fascinating read."
89,1501134612,http://goodreads.com/user/show/284714-kasandra,4,"This is a fascinating, horrifying, depressing, and enlightening read, with tons of details I'd never heard or learned before. What's most terrifying is how much the chances of this were known inside the former Soviet Union and covered up for years (along with previous accidents). The heroism of many Russians is astounding in dealing with this crisis, as is the callousness of others. A warning for the nuclear energy industry and all of us, about how quickly this technology can spiral out of control without transparency, honesty, readiness for all emergencies, and even with all proper planning - how quickly we can destroy ourselves and our environment due to simple human error and pride. Incredibly well-reported and thorough, and highly recommended."
90,1501134612,http://goodreads.com/user/show/34570157-jenny-jo-weir,4,Wow! This one was a hard read. The whole time I'm thinking about all that radiation and the effects of the explosion. The amount of people affected by this and the cost of this unfortunate event were unprecedented. You can't help but feel bad fro all the people involved and for all the victims. It's something that sticks with you. 
91,1501134612,http://goodreads.com/user/show/38617426-juli,4,"Interest in the Chernobyl nuclear disaster has spiked since the award winning HBO mini-series aired. I watched the show and listened to HBO's accompanying podcast and several other podcast episodes on the accident and its aftermath. Several of the podcasts mentioned this book, so I secured a spot on the library's wait list for the audiobook. I'm glad I did! This book is excellent!Higginbotham outlines the buildup of the soviet power grid and nuclear technology. Along the way there were accidents, cost cutting measures that had disastrous effects, mismanagement, poor training and flawed maintenance. All the mistakes culminated in the explosion at Chernobyl on April 25, 1986.Higginbotham gives details about the people involved, the plant itself, the history of Soviet nuclear power, the accident, the evacuation of Pripyat, and the continuing aftermath of the accident. It's a very interesting, and concerning, story. Many countries have nuclear power plants now. It's an awesome way to generate electricity, unless there is an accident. In recent years, the Fukushima accident shows that an earthquake or other natural event can cause modern nuclear plants to become quite dangerous. But with mismanagement, bad maintenance, lackluster employee training and shoddy parts/construction, any nuclear plant can be potentially dangerous. With more countries around the world turning to nuclear power, the chances of an accident increase.....I remember news reports in 1986 about the event. I can remember initial reports stating that it was known there had been some sort of nuclear event in the Soviet Union but scientists were not sure what had happened and no information was being released by USSR officials. When the full truth came out, it was horrifying. An entire city evacuated. Firemen and emergency response personnel dying. The struggle to prevent a melt-down. 33 years later, many are still interested in the accident and the lasting damage it caused. Pripyat is becoming a tourist attraction even. Yikes! I can think of much better vacation sites than one that is completely irradiated. Pripyat, and the surrounding region, will be not be safely habitable for more than 20,000 years.Nuclear power is safe when handled responsibly by properly trained people. Most plants operating in the modern world are quite safe, and managed/maintained properly. But, a nuclear power plant can be potentially deadly if proper safety protocols are not strictly adhered to and the potential effects of natural disasters and other catastrophes are not properly taken into consideration. I hope it is a very, very long time -- or never -- that our planet ends up with another uninhabitable, radiation soaked region from a nuclear accident. The effects are long lasting, and far reaching.Great book! Lots of highly researched information presented in an interesting manner. The audio book is about 14 hours long and narrated by Jacques Roy. Roy reads at a steady pace. His voice is easily understandable. Very enjoyable listening experience!"
92,1501134612,http://goodreads.com/user/show/352711-leftbanker,5,"I began this book out of desperation from the cliff-hanger of episode 2 of Chernobyl on HBO, one of the best TV dramas I’ve ever watched. Like the series, the pacing and tone of this account reads like the best of thrillers and I literally couldn’t put it down. I’m old enough to have vivid recollections of the event as it was unfolding. My USAF unit stationed in Athens, Greece, received intelligence on the crisis well ahead of the local news. We knew that it was a nuclear accident well before the Soviets admitted to this fact, but what we didn’t know was just how close the world was to a bigger, unspeakable disaster. This news really wasn’t available for years after the events of April 1986. The world had moved on. I had all but forgotten Chernobyl until this brilliant series came over the horizon. A viewer of the series wrote, “The tragedy will live forever because of this haunting masterpiece, what a brilliant creative achievement.” I could say the same for this book. Informative, objective, and written with a breath-taking pace, I couldn’t recommend it more highly to anyone looking to become better informed on the events of Chernobyl, both when it happened, and in the years since.It’s hard to laugh when you’re reading in the fetal position, but this part struck me as the epitome of gallows humor. One nuclear scientist working on cleaning up the disaster gives safety advice to another nuclear scientist just arriving, “If you smell ozone, run!”The big surprise is that the death toll wasn’t tens of times greater than the reality. Of course, we may never know the true results of the accident as Soviet record keeping tended to down-play cancer deaths which may have been related to Chernobyl.The most terrifying aspect of all is to consider how our leaders today would deal with a disaster on this order. Even the monumentally corrupt Soviets of that era had some highly intelligent, rational people among them, which is more than you can say of Putin and Trump, and their flunkies. Trump prevaricates on matters of little or no importance; imagine his response on this sort of travesty."
93,1501134612,http://goodreads.com/user/show/714583-anita-pomerantz,3,"This book is sooo highly rated and was listed as ""best non-fiction"" by numerous sources in 2019. All I have to say is I wish I read Voices from Chernobyl: The Oral History of a Nuclear Disaster instead. This book was just boring unless you like reading a lot about engineering and the technical structure of power plants and buildings. In addition, there are a zillion Russian names, and even with Kindle X-Ray and a guide to who was who, I struggled because the people just were not brought to life for me.This is reporting. It's very strong reporting, and it unveils the type of cover-up that makes you worried about government and implies that conspiracy theories can be true. The story is important. I just did not find it interesting because of the absolute overload of details, many of which were beyond my understanding or ability to picture. Maybe my timing in picking up this one was just way off . . .as we are in the middle of a crisis ourselves, my concentration is pretty shot. So, judge this one by the reviews of others. I just can barely bring myself to give it 3 stars. "
94,1501134612,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5349403-carolyn,4,"The author has written an impressive, comprehensive book of historical importance. It brings to light events surrounding the Chernobyl catastrophe of 1986 which may be unknown to many in the Western world, and even to the Russian people. The author presents a crash course in nuclear physics and energy, simplified as much as possible. This may present difficulties for the average reader without some background knowledge. I thought the human factor surrounding the disaster to be interesting and appreciated that the book included a summary list of the Cast of Characters and their positions and involvement with Chernobyl. The book emphasized the social/political Cold War mentality, economic factors, technical failures, the cut-throat ambition of the politicians and their secrecy which led to public complacency or wild rumours. Reaction time was slow due to uncertainty and arguments about the best course of action. I feel this is the definitive book of situations leading up to the disaster, what happened when Reactor 4 malfunctioned causing a huge surge of radiation, and its aftermath. The history is impeccable and thoroughly researched and stands as a sample for other writers of historical events and will be the definitive book on Chernobyl.The Chernobyl atomic complex was built to produce cheap electricity for a vast surrounded area, and to establish the Soviet Union ’s predominance in nuclear power. The disaster occurred in Reactor #4 on April 26, 1986. A model town, Pripyat, was built in the wilderness area close to the Nuclear Plant to house tens of thousands of workers and their families. From rough, cold shacks inhabited by the early builders, it grew into an impressive town with 3 schools, 35 playgrounds, 3 swimming pools, a library, sports facility and shopping center. Groceries and goods in the stores were more varied and abundant than in cities of origin of most of the workers. No expense was spared in planting trees and importing flowering shrubs to enhance the blocks of apartments. The nuclear accident which occurred resulted in a coverup where plant workers and women and children were not aware of the danger to their lives and health from nuclear fallout.there were cultural and political reasons contributing to lack of safety. Poor building design, shoddy materials, forced deadlines for builders and plant workers to meet, incompetent and negligent staff without knowledge of dangers they faced. There had been a smaller explosion at another plant and plenty of malfunctions but they were ignorant of possible critical problems. After the reactor imploded and seemed to be going into meltdown, releasing radiation far and wide, members of the emergency response team who did know the peril were either forced to stop the leak or went in willingly out of patriotic duty.  Following the disaster, people of Pripyat went about their lives ignorant of dangers from radioactive fallout. During this time a gathering of academics, Generals and politicians argued about the course they needed to take but were mainly concerned with secrecy. Finally, it was decided to evacuate the town of 51,000 people but leaving behind 4,000 essential service workers. People being evacuated were led to believe that they would only be away from home a couple of days and to bring only essentials for a short stay. Immediately after the explosion, there were two deaths of reactor workers.28 died soon of acute radiation sickness.. Evacuation orders soon included 90,000 people within a 30 K radius. High radiation levels soon spread to areas distant from Chernobyl and was detected in Sweden, Belarus and Poland. By May 20, 95,000 people had been hospitalized. High levels of radioactivity had already reached the capital, Kiev. May Day celebrations were carried out in the open air. Soon over 300,000 children were ordered evacuated from Kiev, along with expectant and nursing mothers (about 1/5 of the population). Teams were hired to shoot 20,000 domestic animals left behind.  We will never know how many people died over the years from radiation-induced cancers, as doctors were pressed not to mention a possible connection. Once the danger of a meltdown had eased and the reactor was covered with a dome, it was felt necessary to lay blame. Six plant officials were put on trial resulting in prison sentences. Official statements refused to place blame on faulty building materials, reactor design flaws, or the irresponsibility and poor discipline of the plant workers present when the disaster occurred. They had been conducting a safety inspection to simulate a power failure and did not follow the procedure properly outlined on a checklist. The author emphasizes the social/political Cold War mentality. The secrecy of generals and politicians which led to wild rumours or complacency subsequently caused the people to distrust in their leaders. Economic factors due to the billions of rubles spent on evacuation, housing, pay for thousands of emergency workers, and the deactivating the reactor was a great financial loss for the country. The author feels this was a major factor contributing to the breakup of the Soviet Union Thanks to NetGalley and Simon & Schuster for an advance copy of this important book."

Mostly he focused on the scientists, workers and liquidators, who had to deal with the clean up. He focused so much on these people that at the beginning of the book there was a list of characters, as if it was a play or something. I've never seen that done with a nonfiction book before, but maybe that was just a quirk of my particular edition. Now, because I have read Chernobyl: History of a Tragedy by Serhii Plokhy I couldn't help but compare these two. Serhii Plokhy covered the construction of the plant and the causes of the explosion itself better then Adam Higginbotham, but Adam didn't just brush of the clean up process. After reading them both I find it that they are both necessary to understand this disaster, just to get all the angles.Lastly, on to the Voices of Chernobyl to see what the ordinary people had to say about this whole mess. "
96,1501134612,http://goodreads.com/user/show/17428284-steven-z,5,"March 28, 1979 was an overcast day in Woodbridge, Va. when news arrived of a nuclear accident at Three Mile Island Unit 2 reactor near Middletown, Pa. Feeling totally in the dark when it came to information about the accident, my neighbors and I gathered outside our homes and immediately began testing to see which way the winds were blowing, and should we pack up and head in the opposite direction. Living about two and a half hours from the reactor which would eventually partially melt down, we were scared. Up to that time this would be considered the greatest nuclear accident in history being unaware of the Kyshtym Disaster which was a radioactive contamination accident that occurred on September 29, 1957 at Mayak, a plutonium production site in Russia for nuclear weapons and a nuclear fuel reprocessing plant in the Soviet Union. After reading Adam Higginbotham’s new book, MIDNIGHT IN CHERNOBYL: THE UNTOLD STORY OF THE WORLD’S GREATEST NUCLEAR DISASTER, an excellent account of the explosion and meltdown at Chernobyl the evening of April 25-26, 1986 and the ramifications of that disaster, memories of that March day flashed before my eyes.Higginbotham has written the most informative and insightful description of events and analysis of the meltdown that has yet to appear. It replaces Harvard historian, Serhii Plokhy’s CHERNOBYL: A HISTORY OF A NUCLEAR CATASYTROPHE as the most comprehensive and detailed work that has been written. In dealing with events such as Chernobyl one must ask: What happened, why did it happen, and could it happen again? Higginbotham, a journalist and his research partner Taras Shumeyko interviewed numerous eyewitnesses and conducted a prodigious amount of research that included a small number of declassified documents available, and argues that the fanatical view among Soviet bureaucrats and leadership to maintain secrecy, (for example, information about what occurred at Mayak was kept from the public for thirty years) was the reason the accident was so devastating, but also not surprising that it occurred. Higginbotham recreates the disaster providing a history of Soviet nuclear development, including numerous accidents; the planning and building of Chernobyl; the accident; attempts to remediate the situation after it occurred, the trial of the operators who were blamed for the disaster; and other aspects of the aftermath. The book reads in part as narrative history, but also a terrifying account of an event which could easily be repeated today.The plan to build Chernobyl was hatched in February 1970 as a means of catching up to the west and meet Soviet electricity needs. The Soviet Union would engage in a crash program to build nuclear reactors, but the problem was that the project began during a period of economic stagnation with material and resource shortages everywhere. The reactor was to be completed by 1975 which was totally unrealistic due to the approach taken by the Soviet bureaucracy, party elites, and engineers that did not consider shortages, safety needs, and planning for possible future nuclear accidents. The result is that corners were cut in terms of material, training, design flaws, “cooking the books,” and the stubborn nature of the Soviet bureaucracy in charge of construction. As Higginbotham discusses this aspect of the project, he provides the reader an interesting history of the development of radiation, nuclear development, and their affects on people and society. The author’s approach to complex scientific information and jargon is such that it is very easy to understand for the lay reader as he describes how reactors are supposed to be constructed.According to Higginbotham there were design flaws dealing with a high-power channel reactor labeled RMBK. These flaws would dog designers who would pay little attention to test results because of pressure from the Communist Party and the bureaucracy that flowed from it. This made disaster possible because no one knew how the reactor would react in case of an accident. The reactors colossal size made start up and shut down the most demanding and treacherous stages of RMBK operation. The author follows RMBK’s development and its flaws as it went into production, particularly the AZ-5 emergency protection system whose design took too long to respond in an emergency which came home to roost on April 25, 1986.  A similar plant in Leningrad experienced an accident on November 11, 1975 resulting in the release of radiation into the atmosphere over the Gulf of Finland. However, Sredmash, the Soviet agency in charge of production and construction of nuclear reactors covered up the investigative findings of design flaws related to the accident. On September 9, 1982 there was a partial meltdown at Unit 1 at Chernobyl which took eight months to repair, but the KGB instituted a gag order, and the following year a similar accident took place in a Lithuanian reactor and one in Armenia. But the world knew nothing of these accidents. Further exacerbating Soviet nuclear reactor building was the shoddy workmanship that plagued Soviet industry in general, and that carried over to the construction of Chernobyl.  A major problem that arose once Reactor #4 at Chernobyl exploded is that many of those in charge were unprepared to deal with what occurred and succumbed to wishful thinking and self-delusion in approaching how to deal with what had transpired. Higginbotham describes in detail the lethargic Soviet bureaucracy and their response to disaster. Soviet Prime Minister Mikhail Gorbachev was not notified as to what had occurred until the afternoon of April 26, 1986. The author narrates the debates inside the Commission that was set up to oversee the crisis. He relates the personalities involved and their debates on how to respond and their final decision making, many of which were out of some sort of fantasy. An excellent example apart from how to cool the reactor was whether they should evacuate the city of Pripyat and its 50,000 residents who were in danger of radiation exposure which took until April 27th to accomplish. As the radioactive cloud blew over Scandinavia, Swedish, Finish, and Danish diplomats lodged complaints to Moscow once it was realized where the radiation originated resulting in the Soviet government stonewalling. It would take until April 28th at 8:00pm for Moscow to come clean and announce that “an accident had taken place at the Chernobyl nuclear power plant.…One of the atomic reactors has been damaged.” Soviet citizens were used to this type of response as it was a continuation of the way the state had covered industrial accidents for decades.Higginbotham descriptions of helicopter pilots flying low dumping sand and boron on the reactor are harrowing. The author’s approach as he carefully describes how officials, academics, scientists, fire fighters, guards, and others and what they went through is chilling, especially as he brings the reader to Hospital #6 in Moscow created to treat victims of nuclear accidents and war. The ultimate fear was the “China Syndrome,” the further devastation that would occur if the reactor’s foundation exploded and nuclear material leaked into the earth. Even though Moscow TV announced on May 11, 1986 that the primary threat of explosion was over, scientists remained skeptical.The Central Committee of the Politburo decided against Gorbachev’s new policy of Glasnost and followed the traditional approach and blamed “bourgeois falsification….propaganda and inventions” as its immediate reaction, in addition to dishonesty and declining help from the west. This approach would backfire in terms of containing the accident but also hindering Gorbachev’s hope of nuclear disarmament talks with the United States because how could one negotiate with someone who was so untrustworthy.Higginbotham spends a great deal of time describing what the victims of the disaster experienced. He follows the medical care that victims received and for far too many their ultimate deaths. He recounts the bravery of so many who fought to contain the toxic results of the explosion, and countless men who returned to build the sarcophagus that was designed to seal reactor #4 for at least a hundred years. The narrative of how the newly created refugees, numbering over 116,000 from the exclusion zone is told with sensitivity and insight into their future plight. The scapegoating that dominated the investigation by Soviet authorities was appalling as was the propaganda machine that worked overtime to find blame and paint the accident in the best light as possible. The stories are often poignant and provide a true picture of what can happen on a personal and societal level from a nuclear disaster.Perhaps one of the most destructive results of Chernobyl was the beginning of the end of the Soviet Union. Gorbachev realized that even his own nuclear bureaucracy was rotten to the “core” and as was most of the Soviet state. The launching of perestroika opened debate among Soviet citizens that had been dormant, but slowly the issues of Afghanistan, drug addiction, the abortion epidemic, and the horrors of Stalinism emerged. The Russian people began to realize that they had been lied to for decades and as Higginbotham successfully argues they “faced the realization that their leaders were corrupt and that the Communist dream was a sham.”If wonders if a major nuclear accident could occur in the future remind yourself of Fukushima. In 2011, the Tokyo Electric Power Company’s nuclear plant underwent a process identical to Chernobyl; the loss of coolant that provoked a meltdown. As to what remains of Chernobyl itself, it is part of an “exclusion zone” of 1,000 square miles, a radioactive Eden for new wildlife and vegetation. Higginbotham has done the public a favor by exposing the events of April-May 1986 and give us pause as to how we should approach nuclear power in the future."
97,1501134612,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3357765-jimmy,5,"I have long been fascinated with Russia. Russian dissenters have long been my heroes going all the way back to Alexander Solzhenitsyn up to Pussy Riot and Garry Kasparov. It feels like Russia has an inferiority complex. The government is always trying to look bigger and stronger than they really are. Thus the arms buildups, the Olympic obsession, the meddling. In the case of Chernobyl, it was the cover ups, the refusal to admit mistakes, the effort to make the reactor bigger than anything else no matter how many corners had to be cut. As Higginbotham said, ""Lies and deception were endemic to the system, trafficked in both directions along the chain of management: those lower down passed up reports to their superiors packed with falsified statistics and inflated estimates, of unmet goals triumphantly reached, unfulfilled quotas heroically exceeded. To protect his own position, at every stage, relayed the lies upward or compounded them."" (15) ""Seated at the top of a teetering pyramid of falsehood, poring over reams of figures that had little basis in reality, were the economic mandarins of the State General Planning Committee--Gosplan--in Moscow."" (15) It worries me that Trump and his climate change deniers are setting up something of the same situation here in the US. Facts are not important in this administration. And scientific facts are even less important to the Trumpites. "". . . the plans called for fireproof cables, but when none could be found, the builders simply did the best they could."" (20) ""When the ministry of energy in Moscow learned that the roof of the plant's turbine hall had been covered with highly flammable bitumen, they ordered him to replace it. But the flame-retardent material . . . was not even being manufactured in the USSR, so the Ministry granted Brukhanov an exception, and the bitumen remained."" (20) But when they ordered him to build an ""olympic-sized swimming pool,"" he had to ""hoodwink the state bank"" to build it. He had no choice but to obey the order. Considering all of these facts, it makes me wonder if Chernobyl is the best way to look at nuclear power. The fault lies more with the communist system and its lack of regulatory power. People always think of communist systems as having too many regulations. In reality, communism has few regulations because it is all about the power at the top, like with Trump. The goal was to build ""increasingly gigantic stations throughout the western territories of the Union. By the end of the century, Moscow intended Chernobyl to be one part of a dense network of atomic power megacomplexes."" (20) In spite of ""alarming building faults,"" the work kept on. On pages 62 to 63, the designers saw ""no need to prepare for such a calamity"" in reference to the worst possible scenarios. All warnings about the dangers were ignored. Former Chernobyl chief engineer Nikolai Steinberg said that the origins of the disaster lay in a combination of ""scientific, technological, socioeconomic, and human factors"" unique to the USSR. (347) The Soviet Union ""lacked even rudimentary safety practices."" They ""relied upon its operators to behave with robotic precision night after night."" They were under ""constant pressure to beat deadlines."" All of this made ""disregard for the letter of the regulations almost inevitable."" The deceased operators of Control Room Number Four ""had brought the reactor into an unstable condition, but only on account of the acute pressure they felt to complete the test on the turbine."" (347) ""Some environmentalists argued that humanity could not afford to turn its back on the promise and terrors of the peaceful atom. The global need for electricity was increasing exponentially: humanity was predicted to double the amount of energy it used by 2050. Despite the growing certainty that burning fossil fuels was the cause of devastating climate change--making the stabilization of carbon emissions imperative--coal remained the most widely used source of energy in the world. The fine particulates from fossil fuel plants in the United States killed more than thirteen thousand people a year; worldwide, three million people died annually as a result of air pollution released by coal- and oil-fueled power stations. Even to begin to head off climate change over the coming thirty-five years would have to be clean, yet neither wind, solar, hydroelectric, nor geothermal power--nor any combination of them--had the potential to bridge the gap."" (357 to 358) ""And at last, more than seventy years after the technology's inception, engineers were finally developing reactors with design priorities that lay not in making bombs but in generating electricity. In principle, these fourth-generation reactors would be cheaper, safer, smaller, more efficient, and less poisonous than their predecessors and could yet prove to be the technology that saves the world."" (358) There is a ""liquid fluoride thorium reactor (LFTR)"" developed at Tennessee's Oak Ridge National Laboratory that is fueled by ""thorium. More plentiful and far harder to process into bomb-making material than uranium, thorium also burns more efficiently in a reactor and could produce less hazardous radioactive waste with half-lives of hundreds, not tens of thousands, of years. . . . It does not require a massive containment building to guard against loss-of-coolant accidents or explosions and can be constructed on such a compact scale that every steel mill or small town could have its own microreactor tucked away underground."" (358) ""In 2015, Bill Gates had begun funding research projects similar to these fourth-generation reactors in a quest to create a carbon-neutral power source for the future. By then, the Chinese government had already set seven hundred scientists on a crash program to build the world's first industrial thorium reactor as part of a war on pollution. 'The problem of coal has become clear,' the engineering director of the project said. 'Nuclear power provides the only solution.'"" (358) I was selective in my quotes. The question now is, Must we turn to nuclear power as a last resort to get out of the mess of climate change? I would be interested in your responses. "

It handles an amazingly complicated subject and history, and a massive cast of Soviet names, and somehow keeps it all clear even for non-scientist reader. If you're too young to remember Chernobyl, read this (and watch the HBO miniseries). If you are old enough to remember Chernobyl (and perhaps even Three Mile Island), read this anyway. It's frightening, compelling, brilliant, and vital as we try to ward off climate change and turn to energy sources other than fossil fuels. "

Senior Lieutenant Alexander Logachev loved radiation the way other men loved their wives. Tall and good-looking, twenty-six years old, with close-cropped dark hair and ice-blue eyes, Logachev had joined the Soviet army when he was still a boy. They had trained him well. The instructors from the military academy outside Moscow taught him with lethal poisons and unshielded radiation. He traveled to the testing grounds of Semipalatinsk in Kazakhstan, and to the desolte East Urals Trace, where the fallout from a clandestine radioactive accident still poisoned the landscape; eventually, Logachev’s training took him even to the remote and forbidden islands of Novaya Zemlya, high in the Arctic Circle and ground zero for the detonation of the terrible Tsar Bomba, the largest thermonuclear device in history.
Although I haven’t been born at the time of the Chernobyl disaster, the events of that time have fascinated me for years. This is probable also due to the fact that my parents, who were living in Poland during the catastrophe, were directly affected by the radioactive cloud. I have seen nearly every documentary that exists and I also found the HBO miniseries amazing! So amazing that every day I look skeptically in the direction of the nuclear power plant that stands here around the corner. So, it was clear that I would read this book the moment I heard about it for the first time. And even if, unfortunately, I had little time to read due to university and private courses, in the end it was absolutely worth! __________________________________________In the book, first there are some maps and overviews showing, among other things, Russia and the location of Pripyat and the construction of Unit Four of the Chernobyl Nuclear Plant (Tschernobylska AES im. W. I. Lenina). This is followed by a list of key persons and their function within the catastrophy. Then, the “story” begins.Journalist Higginbotham describes his incredibly well-researched information as far as possible in chronological order, sometimes even to the nearest second. It starts before the catastrophe and provides information on how the nuclear industry has built up in the USSR, how atomgrad* Pripyat was formed and how the nuclear power plant came online, years before the big mistake that was due to humane and machine failures.Within the text numerous, sometimes very scientific information, can be found – for example, how radiation works or that men radiate more than women due to their higher muslce mass. For me, there were actually some new things that I did not know before!In the further process, Higginbotham describes the events from the point of view of the varius persons: Director Brukhanov, scientist Legassov or the firefighters, who were unsuspecting at the scene and sealed their death with their intervention, but prevented a major catastrophe. Personally, this chapter has hit me the most, as I do not want to imagine how they must have felt in this situation.After detailed descriptions of the events at the plant and politics, which among other things led to the collapse of the Soviet Union, Higginbotham gives an insight into the current situation in the Ukraine: Among other things, he conducted interviews with people who vere involved in the disaster and he visits the ghost town of Pripyat. Attached are a glossary with all the important technical terms in the field of nuclear energy and images of the people and places mentioneds in the book. __________________________________________Even though the book requires a lot of concentration and you need a little more time to understand everything, it was absolutely worth to read this book! I would recommend it to anyone – whether he has already experienced the disaster or was born later. The topic is more present after the accident in Japan and should be known to everyone. For those who, like me, are interested in the events during that time, the book is an absolute must have!"

MA!Are you telling this story, Dorothy? The explosion was mostly vertical, but the damage? The damage was horizontal, soaring on winded wings as far as Sweden and that’s when sh*t really got real - don’t 🙄 at your mother, Dorothy Zbornak! Where do you think Stan got his weirdness?So Gorbachev’s all open door and honesty’s the best policy - well, how do you like them dosimeters? Open door policy, my foot! That’s how some cities knew what happened! They took radioactive readings off the sandals of a lady who just traveled to Pripyat. Gorby didn’t tell them. It was the shoes!Back to my story: So we got bureaucrats on the ground, fires blazing in the central core, 1,200 Kievan buses evac’ing the city and no clue how to stop this giant wildebeest from exploding again, China Syndrome style. Meanwhile: The winds have blown ... now we gotta evac another 116k people in the newly designated “Exclusion Zone” (though later they’d rename it the “Nuclear Reservation” like that helps), but the story of Chernobyl doesn’t stop there! Nope...✋ Now we gotta get Reactors 1-3...back...online?? Isn’t that the reason we’re gonna throw 750,000 bio robots at this sucker to begin with?? Not sure what you call *waves hand dramatically* all this, then.

So, of course, they told me, but I’m Sophia Petrillo! I keep my word! I’ll write it down, you throw it in the fireplace!) and a city built specifically to support the wildebeest dies in 16 years. Don’t worry though, they moved everyone to Slavutych, another atomgrad, and hey, the world makes sense again!That’s how we tell stories in Sicily! Obviously, loved this one! It is a little dry, but as you can see, it’s hard to write without judgement. Higginbotham does just the facts, no sass and still tells the story in a way that’s both completely understandable and emotionally harrowing all at the same time. Very well done!"

I listened to this rather than reading it and was soon bogged down by the sheer amount of physics detailed; at times I found myself struggling to pay attention. That being said, this was still a fascinating detailed look on the events that caused the accidents and the actions taken afterward. It was a perfect storm of horrible events and it really will get your heart racing as the author gives you a near minute by minute account. Unsettling at moments, and overly technical; this insanely well researched guide is not for the casual reader. This book is heavy; but will change the way you think about Chernobyl forever! "

104,1501134612,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2168708-marta,5,"Astonishing, thrillingly written, with a lot of new information, including the causes of the accident. I have bought this on audio and listened to it; but I missed so much information that I am listening to it again. It is thrilling the second time as well, and this time I can put the stories of the people more into context. My family was also interested so I bought a print copy as well. I am using it to look up names, and there are pictures as well. I stopped listening second time about halfway through - the pandemic happened and I am tired of bad news. This is a thrilling telling of a cautionary tale about the dangers of arrogance dealing with the forces of nature. The minimizing, denials, trying to cover it up, confused scrambling to stall an even bigger disaster - all echo in the reaction of the US government to the pandemic in the last weeks/months. The arrogance and the wishful thinking that made the disaster so much worse are just as present now. Leaders need to read history - and we elected one that expressly disdains science, reading, and history. This is of course wholly unfair to the people in the Chernobyl catastrophe. There was a lot of heroism, and some ofticials showed remarkable leadership. Which is why I felt most enraged when those operators who gave their lives willingly and performed heroics to save the reactor in the first hours of the disaster, were scapegoated. These people were heroes (well, some, I have no sympathy for plant director Brukhanov), and they were tried as criminals, some declared as such posthumously. The world was told at the time that the accident was caused by careless operators who conducted a test and disabled the safety systems. But in reality, the RBMK reactor had multiple design flaws and the accident was waiting to happen. One of those was in the emergency shutdown. When the Chernobyl operators realized they had trouble, they initiated a shutdown by dropping all safety rods - but instead of shutting down, the reactor went critical - because of the rods were graphite-tipped! The designers have discovered this flaw years before, but they thought it was unlikely to happen. (Arrogance and negligence). It was only an issue if most control rods were withdrawn - which was the case at Chernobyl, due to the other major flaw of the reactor, the positive void coefficient (Google it). This basically made it unsafe to operate the reactor at low power levels, which the designers also discovered, but all they did was sent a new operating manual, without explaining why this was important. Experienced operators did learn that the reactor got unstable at lower power levels, from experience, but did not know that it could be a safety risk. So when the manager of the tests wanted to perform it at low power levels, one protested - but he was overruled and threatened of being fired. Presumably the manager wanted to be safer... and thus the reactor went to overdrive with the lower powerlevel, so they withdrew the rods - then tried to shut down. Boom.All this has been previously detected as a risk, and ignored. Then came the fallout.Read this - but maybe not during a pandemic."
105,1501134612,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8413178-liam,5,"I, like everybody else, have been entranced by HBO's Chernobyl. Watching it, I realised how little I really knew about the disaster despite having spent untold hours wandering around in the fictional version of the Zone in the STALKER games.Much like most people I imagine, I was kind of astounded by how huge a disaster it actually was, and how close it came to being so much worse. I kind of ran under the assumption that the HBO show was dramatised to a certain extent, because how could I have possibly not heard that there was a distinct possibility that Reactor 4 would explode again with the force of several atomic bombs? - but no, this actually occurred.Higginbotham's writing is detached, which somehow makes it all the more impactful - dry descriptions of Pripyat firefighters experiencing 'violent diarrhea' in the days following the initial explosion, which was determined to be 'their intestines liquefying' is one example I'm going to have trouble forgetting.As a companion to the show, Midnight in Chernobyl was excellent. I didn't plan it out that way, but events in the show as I watched it every few nights kind of lined up to the events in the book as I listened to it on my way to and from work, expanding and providing further detail, or refuting the more dramatised parts of the show. Legasov for example is portrayed a lot more heroic in the show, routinely martyring himself before the Communist Party for the good of all - whereas he was far more likely to toe the Party line in real life, and only repented soon before his death.Midnight in Chernobyl is a fantastic in-depth exploration of the disaster - causes and repercussions, and it has certainly sparked interest in the topic for myself. An excellently written book, very well read by Jacques Roy. Highly recommend."

107,1501134612,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5072847-will-ansbacher,5,"Well written, fast paced and unbelievable action – this would be a terrific disaster thriller if it wasn’t actually all true.Adam Higginbotham has done a simply brilliant job of researching and writing about the world’s worst nuclear disaster, with a style that’s riveting yet balanced and without hyperbole. It opens with a couple of pages describing Civil Defence responders’ panic as they first realize the extent of the radioactive horror they’d been catapulted into. From that initial adrenalin burst, the first part of the story (titled Birth of a City) goes back to the origins of nuclear power development in Russia and the founding of the atomic city of Pripyat, and is interleaved with the events surrounding the explosion of reactor #4 and the immediate after-effects. The longer part two (Death of an Empire) covers the awful radiation effects, the mainly futile clean-up attempts, the cover-ups, denials, excruciating investigations and show trials; at the same time providing insight into the breakup of the USSR. (If Chernobyl wasn’t the catalyst that led to the end of the Soviet Union, then it certainly was a major factor). The story ends with more recent developments, including interviews the author had with those involved - at least, those who still were alive after 2006.This changing focus is a really effective way of dealing with a highly complex subject that could otherwise have been quite dry. Interestingly, I thought, the structure mirrors radiation poisoning itself: the initial terrifying experience of acute exposure and a short period of apparent recovery, but followed by the much longer and agonizing progress of an array of worsening symptoms. I won’t go into the story itself, (this  NY Times review is a great summary). But I was struck by a few recurrent themes:One, the cynical way disasters were suppressed so nobody could ever learn from previous mistakes;Two, the culture of craven compliance that prevented anyone from speaking out about known problems; (Together, these made not only the reactor explosion inevitable but the aftermath about as bad as it could possibly be)Three, the casual attitudes – bordering on macho defiance - to radiation dangers;And four, the sheer resilience of the Russian and Ukrainian people – both workers at the plant and the general population - in the face of all the horrors that were thrown at them. (Though these last two are as much the result of the authorities ruthlessly suppressing information) A ton of authoritative information has become available over the last 30 years, and Higginbotham seems to have read it all - there are 100 pages of end notes alone. However in order not to interrupt the flow he wisely left all the cross-referencing to the end, where a few relevant words in each note point to the text. There is also an extensive bibliography and a short but useful cast of characters ... Ligachev? Logachev? Legasov? ... which I found I had to flip back to often. There is still much we don’t know about Chernobyl, but to understand the disaster and what it means, I don’t think you could do better than this book. It isn’t perfect of course; Higginbotham didn’t explain some of the radiation physics or its effects on humans too well, but for this non-technical account it’s more than good enough."

Despite the scientific leanings (some of which was over my head) it was immensely readable account of the event. There was background relating to the construction of the nuclear reactor and a minute by minute, hour by hour account of the disaster itself as it unfolded on April 26, 1986. Then the aftermath, the world-wide scale of international proportions, the denial, the cover-up, the prosecution and trials that followed were riveting reading. If you’re in the mood for some serious non-fiction, this is it! Four stars from me. "

110,1501134612,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11701608-barbara,5,"10+stars: Oh My Dear Lord, this novel will scare the beejesus out of you. Journalist Adam Higgnbothem has written an amazing documentary of the 1986 catastrophe at the Chernobyl nuclear plant in the USSR. I listened to the audible production that is narrated by Jacques Roy. At the beginning, Roy lists all the important characters in this story. Since I listened to it, I was at a disadvantage keeping all the players straight in my head. If one wants to truly understand the politics, lies, radiation illnesses, etc, that involved each character, one should read the novel. As an American listener, all those Russian names were difficult to keep in my mind.That said, it is an amazing listen. Just getting the timeline of events, the mistakes, the horror of the disaster while listening is enough for me. This tragedy was a culmination of mistakes. Although the USSR wanted to lay blame on separate individuals, Higgenbothem shows that is was straws, that individually wouldn’t be the blame, but added together resulted in a global tragedy. Also, it was the political pressure and the culture of Russia at that time that lead to the explosion. Russia wanted to save face which added layers to the event that cost thousands of lives. The government secrecy magnified mistakes.Higgenbothem exposes the devastating losses and damages to humans, the landscape, and animals. Once the catastrophe made global news, he explains the collective efforts made to find solutions. Nuclear energy seems here to stay. Creating safe nuclear energy is paramount to the safety and survival of the earth. Making worker education a priority is a necessity. We must remain aware and well informed of the cost/benefit of producing nuclear energy. This is an amazing case study."
111,1501134612,http://goodreads.com/user/show/92319245-mona,4,"This is probably one of the most comprehensive books about Cherbobyl disaster. Author and his multiple researchers did a great job going through documentation, books, articles and statements. They also interviewed quite a few people who participated in described events.Book is well written and narrative is concise. Author guides a reader through basics of physics and construction necessary to understand the events properly. I specifically liked the description of research done on the reactor which were conducted few years after the disaster. I was not familiar with those findings.When it comes to shortcomings of this book - it was written by Brit living in the US and this Western point of view is very clear here. I felt the narration had lingering condescending and superior tone to it, what at points became quite annoying. I think the author did not have a good understanding of Russian culture and mentality (particularly noted during his last interview with the plant director) and he undermined the value of some heroic acts done by firefighters and soldiers after the disaster. This is not the first book I read on this topic and I think Russian and Ukrainian writers are much better in this area for obvious reasons.This is a great book for Westerners who know nothing or close to nothing about Charnobyl disaster and would like to have a general overview. Kinda ""all you can eat""..... but not a white cloth."
112,1501134612,http://goodreads.com/user/show/56337479-h-a-leuschel,5,"This book is an incredibly well researched documentary of one of the great disasters of the twentieth century. It was as good a read as any gripping thriller with the downside that this is not fiction but reality. The details that went into the descriptions, the inclusion of all the main witnesses and victims of the accident was astounding. What a great achievement and testament to a horrific event!"

By the end of it, you'll know all you wanted to know about the disaster and your curiosity will be satisfied. Contains very illuminating information on socialist Russia, nuclear technology, crisis management, and the environmental/public health effects of radiation exposure."

''But when I went back to Ukraine, they started telling me about people who had died. Was it due to radiation? I don't know. I don't understand anything about statistics. But, when my friends ask me about it, I tell them: the less you think about it, the longer you'll live.''Midnight in Chernobyl autora Adama Higginbothama enciklopedijski je uvid u najveću nuklearnu katastrofu koja se dogodila u Černobilju, u Ukrajini 26.aprila 1986. godine.Priča o najvećoj nesreći jedne države, grada, političkog i državnog uređenja, počinje u trenutku kada se postavljaju temelji za građenje ovog nukelarnog postrojenja 1970. godine i rađanja grada u kome su živjeli ljudi zaposleni na izgradnji, kao i radnici predviđeni da rade u novootvorenoj centrali.U jeku hladnog rata Sovjetski savez se svim silama trudio da ukroti atom, da svijetu podari sliku o naučnim dostignućima bez premca, a ljudi su uživali u plodovima svog rada, bezbrižni, poletni i vjerni državi koja im je stvorila atomski grad Pripjat, obezbjedila udobnost sadašnjosti i velike planove za budućnost.Ali sovjetski naučnici koji su radili pod okriljem jednog zatvorenog i ambicioznog sistema, zatvarali su oči pred bilo kakvim greškama na koje su upozoravani prilikom izrade nuklearnih reaktora RBMK-1000 (koji je i eksplodirao u Černobilju), sve mane koje su nesumnjivo postojale držane su u strogoj tajnosti, a sve, naizgled, male stvari dovele su do katastrofe koja je, prema mnogima, dovela i do raspada SSSR-a.Autor se kroz brojne izvore ovim događajem bavio sa naučnog, političkog, socijalnog i ljudskog aspekta, hirurški precizno kombinujući dešavanja u Černobilju sa sudbinama stanovnika Pripjata, koji nesvjesni onoga što ih je snašlo odlaze iz svojih domova, dok radijacija bjesomučno prekriva kvadratne kilometre gradova, tokove rijeka, dječije igračke, kućne ljubimce i tijela svih koji su učestvovali u saniranju posljedica eksplozije.Usljed loše izrađenog reaktora, kojim su upravljali ambiciozni i često nestručni ljudi, zaslijepljeni egom i grandioznošću, 26.aprila 1986. godine desio se početak kraja jednog doba, zapečanjen sudbinama nekih običnih ljudi koji su na poziv domovine golim rukama uklanjali radioaktivni materijal, koji su u sobama Bolnice broj šest ostavljali svoje živote, koji su gradili sarkofag iznad uništenog reaktora u uslovima visoke radijacije kobne po ljudsko zdravlje.A put kojim se došlo do toga, kao i njegove posljedice Adam Higginbotham predstavio je na opširan, zanimljiv i stručan način, te ostavio još jedno važno svjedočanstvo o ovom događaju.P.S. Ponovo preporučujem da pogledate HBO mini seriju Chernobyl, s obzirom da je nakon gledanja mnogo lakše shvatiti suštinu ove knjige, kao i komplikovane opise načina rada nuklearnog reaktora.''Amid the chaos of the collapsing empire, most of the men and women who had fought the Battle of Chernobyl were forgotten - the final defenders of a nation that had seemingly vanished overnight.''"
117,1501134612,http://goodreads.com/user/show/684704-morgan,5,"It took fourteen days to read, but I was riveted and fascinated the entire time. I am too young to remember the Chernobyl melt down when the event took place in 1986, but I'm certain it's an event that contributed to my very vague, yet frightening notions of the war grown ups referred to as Cold.Later in life, I discovered pictures of Pripyat -an abandoned and radioactive city. These images captivated and haunted me. Yet, why did Chernobyl really melt down, and could other nuclear power plants face such demise? (An uneasy question for someone who heard a nuclear power plant's monthly test sirens while sitting in her high school classes.)This book delivered a lot of information - from how nuclear fission takes place, to who were the people on the ground before, during, and after the explosions in 1986. For me, the science bits were just enough - explained with clarity, yet never cumbersome or off-putting. (I'm language oriented, so science text books are off-putting for me personally.) But, the heart of this book is the people you meet. The firemen, the young nuclear engineers, an architect mapping out an ideal city, people loyal (albeit, questionably) to their county and the beliefs it strived to uphold. Midnight in Chernobyl portrayed a nuclear power plant, its atomgard, and its people with such distinction, that it was hard to shake any of these elements even when the book was closed. That childhood fear of the Cold War and nuclear weapons crept into my dreams, waking me with fears of radiation exposure and an urgency to find my children. A fleeting moment later, and my comfortable reality reasserted itself; but I wanted to know more, to understand more about an era in history - and about our future.It's quite a read. I'll eagerly offer it up to other readers as a worthy title. **(I already have - my apologies to those who came to my family's cook-out over the weekend who listened to me chatter on about a nuclear meltdown, when all they wanted to do was enjoy some pulled pork and spare ribs. I really do try to keep the overzealous librarian in me at bay during large social events, but alas, this title was just too good.)"
118,1501134612,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5862503-sweetwilliam,5,"Rarely do I read a book of 385 pages in 3 or 4 sittings but this book was engrossing. I started it on a Thursday and finished it over the weekend. It is an indictment of a flawed system of government. I watched the Chernobyl mini-series several times. Had not my son given this book to me as a birthday present, I probably wouldn’t have read it but I’m glad I did. A miniseries cannot delve into the details and provide all the interesting backstories and other essential information intrinsic to this story. The reactor was of a flawed design. This disaster was bound to happen sooner or later. Previous accidents had been swept under the rug. Soviet prestige was at stake and this was more important than the safety of the people or the planet. There was no oversight. In fact on page 323, Acadamician Valery Legasov realized “…the true scope of the decay at the heart of the [Soviet] nuclear state: The culture of secrecy and complacency, the arrogance and negligence and the shoddy standards of design and construction.”  On page 327 the author explains that the explosion was the last straw of a failing system:The most destructive forces unleashed by the explosion of Reactor Number Four were not radiological but political and economic. The cloud of radiation that spread out across Europe, making the catastrophe impossible to conceal had forced the touted openness of Gorbachev’s glasnost on even the most reluctant conservatives in the Politburo. Even the nuclear bureaucracy had been undermined by secrecy, incompetence, and stagnation convinced him that the entire state was rotten. Perestroika was launched in a desperate bid to save the Socialist experiment before it was too late. But all this did was to promote discussion on other censored topics such as drug addiction, abortion, Afghan war, and the horrors of Stalinism.Thus the author argues, the Chernobyl disaster brought down an empire. It is a fascinating read."
119,1501134612,http://goodreads.com/user/show/284714-kasandra,4,"This is a fascinating, horrifying, depressing, and enlightening read, with tons of details I'd never heard or learned before. What's most terrifying is how much the chances of this were known inside the former Soviet Union and covered up for years (along with previous accidents). The heroism of many Russians is astounding in dealing with this crisis, as is the callousness of others. A warning for the nuclear energy industry and all of us, about how quickly this technology can spiral out of control without transparency, honesty, readiness for all emergencies, and even with all proper planning - how quickly we can destroy ourselves and our environment due to simple human error and pride. Incredibly well-reported and thorough, and highly recommended."
120,1501134612,http://goodreads.com/user/show/34570157-jenny-jo-weir,4,Wow! This one was a hard read. The whole time I'm thinking about all that radiation and the effects of the explosion. The amount of people affected by this and the cost of this unfortunate event were unprecedented. You can't help but feel bad fro all the people involved and for all the victims. It's something that sticks with you. 
121,1501134612,http://goodreads.com/user/show/38617426-juli,4,"Interest in the Chernobyl nuclear disaster has spiked since the award winning HBO mini-series aired. I watched the show and listened to HBO's accompanying podcast and several other podcast episodes on the accident and its aftermath. Several of the podcasts mentioned this book, so I secured a spot on the library's wait list for the audiobook. I'm glad I did! This book is excellent!Higginbotham outlines the buildup of the soviet power grid and nuclear technology. Along the way there were accidents, cost cutting measures that had disastrous effects, mismanagement, poor training and flawed maintenance. All the mistakes culminated in the explosion at Chernobyl on April 25, 1986.Higginbotham gives details about the people involved, the plant itself, the history of Soviet nuclear power, the accident, the evacuation of Pripyat, and the continuing aftermath of the accident. It's a very interesting, and concerning, story. Many countries have nuclear power plants now. It's an awesome way to generate electricity, unless there is an accident. In recent years, the Fukushima accident shows that an earthquake or other natural event can cause modern nuclear plants to become quite dangerous. But with mismanagement, bad maintenance, lackluster employee training and shoddy parts/construction, any nuclear plant can be potentially dangerous. With more countries around the world turning to nuclear power, the chances of an accident increase.....I remember news reports in 1986 about the event. I can remember initial reports stating that it was known there had been some sort of nuclear event in the Soviet Union but scientists were not sure what had happened and no information was being released by USSR officials. When the full truth came out, it was horrifying. An entire city evacuated. Firemen and emergency response personnel dying. The struggle to prevent a melt-down. 33 years later, many are still interested in the accident and the lasting damage it caused. Pripyat is becoming a tourist attraction even. Yikes! I can think of much better vacation sites than one that is completely irradiated. Pripyat, and the surrounding region, will be not be safely habitable for more than 20,000 years.Nuclear power is safe when handled responsibly by properly trained people. Most plants operating in the modern world are quite safe, and managed/maintained properly. But, a nuclear power plant can be potentially deadly if proper safety protocols are not strictly adhered to and the potential effects of natural disasters and other catastrophes are not properly taken into consideration. I hope it is a very, very long time -- or never -- that our planet ends up with another uninhabitable, radiation soaked region from a nuclear accident. The effects are long lasting, and far reaching.Great book! Lots of highly researched information presented in an interesting manner. The audio book is about 14 hours long and narrated by Jacques Roy. Roy reads at a steady pace. His voice is easily understandable. Very enjoyable listening experience!"
122,1501134612,http://goodreads.com/user/show/352711-leftbanker,5,"I began this book out of desperation from the cliff-hanger of episode 2 of Chernobyl on HBO, one of the best TV dramas I’ve ever watched. Like the series, the pacing and tone of this account reads like the best of thrillers and I literally couldn’t put it down. I’m old enough to have vivid recollections of the event as it was unfolding. My USAF unit stationed in Athens, Greece, received intelligence on the crisis well ahead of the local news. We knew that it was a nuclear accident well before the Soviets admitted to this fact, but what we didn’t know was just how close the world was to a bigger, unspeakable disaster. This news really wasn’t available for years after the events of April 1986. The world had moved on. I had all but forgotten Chernobyl until this brilliant series came over the horizon. A viewer of the series wrote, “The tragedy will live forever because of this haunting masterpiece, what a brilliant creative achievement.” I could say the same for this book. Informative, objective, and written with a breath-taking pace, I couldn’t recommend it more highly to anyone looking to become better informed on the events of Chernobyl, both when it happened, and in the years since.It’s hard to laugh when you’re reading in the fetal position, but this part struck me as the epitome of gallows humor. One nuclear scientist working on cleaning up the disaster gives safety advice to another nuclear scientist just arriving, “If you smell ozone, run!”The big surprise is that the death toll wasn’t tens of times greater than the reality. Of course, we may never know the true results of the accident as Soviet record keeping tended to down-play cancer deaths which may have been related to Chernobyl.The most terrifying aspect of all is to consider how our leaders today would deal with a disaster on this order. Even the monumentally corrupt Soviets of that era had some highly intelligent, rational people among them, which is more than you can say of Putin and Trump, and their flunkies. Trump prevaricates on matters of little or no importance; imagine his response on this sort of travesty."
123,1501134612,http://goodreads.com/user/show/714583-anita-pomerantz,3,"This book is sooo highly rated and was listed as ""best non-fiction"" by numerous sources in 2019. All I have to say is I wish I read Voices from Chernobyl: The Oral History of a Nuclear Disaster instead. This book was just boring unless you like reading a lot about engineering and the technical structure of power plants and buildings. In addition, there are a zillion Russian names, and even with Kindle X-Ray and a guide to who was who, I struggled because the people just were not brought to life for me.This is reporting. It's very strong reporting, and it unveils the type of cover-up that makes you worried about government and implies that conspiracy theories can be true. The story is important. I just did not find it interesting because of the absolute overload of details, many of which were beyond my understanding or ability to picture. Maybe my timing in picking up this one was just way off . . .as we are in the middle of a crisis ourselves, my concentration is pretty shot. So, judge this one by the reviews of others. I just can barely bring myself to give it 3 stars. "
124,1501134612,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5349403-carolyn,4,"The author has written an impressive, comprehensive book of historical importance. It brings to light events surrounding the Chernobyl catastrophe of 1986 which may be unknown to many in the Western world, and even to the Russian people. The author presents a crash course in nuclear physics and energy, simplified as much as possible. This may present difficulties for the average reader without some background knowledge. I thought the human factor surrounding the disaster to be interesting and appreciated that the book included a summary list of the Cast of Characters and their positions and involvement with Chernobyl. The book emphasized the social/political Cold War mentality, economic factors, technical failures, the cut-throat ambition of the politicians and their secrecy which led to public complacency or wild rumours. Reaction time was slow due to uncertainty and arguments about the best course of action. I feel this is the definitive book of situations leading up to the disaster, what happened when Reactor 4 malfunctioned causing a huge surge of radiation, and its aftermath. The history is impeccable and thoroughly researched and stands as a sample for other writers of historical events and will be the definitive book on Chernobyl.The Chernobyl atomic complex was built to produce cheap electricity for a vast surrounded area, and to establish the Soviet Union ’s predominance in nuclear power. The disaster occurred in Reactor #4 on April 26, 1986. A model town, Pripyat, was built in the wilderness area close to the Nuclear Plant to house tens of thousands of workers and their families. From rough, cold shacks inhabited by the early builders, it grew into an impressive town with 3 schools, 35 playgrounds, 3 swimming pools, a library, sports facility and shopping center. Groceries and goods in the stores were more varied and abundant than in cities of origin of most of the workers. No expense was spared in planting trees and importing flowering shrubs to enhance the blocks of apartments. The nuclear accident which occurred resulted in a coverup where plant workers and women and children were not aware of the danger to their lives and health from nuclear fallout.there were cultural and political reasons contributing to lack of safety. Poor building design, shoddy materials, forced deadlines for builders and plant workers to meet, incompetent and negligent staff without knowledge of dangers they faced. There had been a smaller explosion at another plant and plenty of malfunctions but they were ignorant of possible critical problems. After the reactor imploded and seemed to be going into meltdown, releasing radiation far and wide, members of the emergency response team who did know the peril were either forced to stop the leak or went in willingly out of patriotic duty.  Following the disaster, people of Pripyat went about their lives ignorant of dangers from radioactive fallout. During this time a gathering of academics, Generals and politicians argued about the course they needed to take but were mainly concerned with secrecy. Finally, it was decided to evacuate the town of 51,000 people but leaving behind 4,000 essential service workers. People being evacuated were led to believe that they would only be away from home a couple of days and to bring only essentials for a short stay. Immediately after the explosion, there were two deaths of reactor workers.28 died soon of acute radiation sickness.. Evacuation orders soon included 90,000 people within a 30 K radius. High radiation levels soon spread to areas distant from Chernobyl and was detected in Sweden, Belarus and Poland. By May 20, 95,000 people had been hospitalized. High levels of radioactivity had already reached the capital, Kiev. May Day celebrations were carried out in the open air. Soon over 300,000 children were ordered evacuated from Kiev, along with expectant and nursing mothers (about 1/5 of the population). Teams were hired to shoot 20,000 domestic animals left behind.  We will never know how many people died over the years from radiation-induced cancers, as doctors were pressed not to mention a possible connection. Once the danger of a meltdown had eased and the reactor was covered with a dome, it was felt necessary to lay blame. Six plant officials were put on trial resulting in prison sentences. Official statements refused to place blame on faulty building materials, reactor design flaws, or the irresponsibility and poor discipline of the plant workers present when the disaster occurred. They had been conducting a safety inspection to simulate a power failure and did not follow the procedure properly outlined on a checklist. The author emphasizes the social/political Cold War mentality. The secrecy of generals and politicians which led to wild rumours or complacency subsequently caused the people to distrust in their leaders. Economic factors due to the billions of rubles spent on evacuation, housing, pay for thousands of emergency workers, and the deactivating the reactor was a great financial loss for the country. The author feels this was a major factor contributing to the breakup of the Soviet Union Thanks to NetGalley and Simon & Schuster for an advance copy of this important book."
125,1501134612,http://goodreads.com/user/show/53179837-george,4,"This book covers the events from the construction of the plant to the fall of the Soviet Union, but unlike Serhii Plokhy he does it from the perspective of the people who were actually close enough to absorb the radiation. Mostly he focused on the scientists, workers and liquidators, who had to deal with the clean up. He focused so much on these people that at the beginning of the book there was a list of characters, as if it was a play or something. I've never seen that done with a nonfiction book before, but maybe that was just a quirk of my particular edition. Now, because I have read Chernobyl: History of a Tragedy by Serhii Plokhy I couldn't help but compare these two. Serhii Plokhy covered the construction of the plant and the causes of the explosion itself better then Adam Higginbotham, but Adam didn't just brush of the clean up process. After reading them both I find it that they are both necessary to understand this disaster, just to get all the angles.Lastly, on to the Voices of Chernobyl to see what the ordinary people had to say about this whole mess. "
126,1501134612,http://goodreads.com/user/show/17428284-steven-z,5,"March 28, 1979 was an overcast day in Woodbridge, Va. when news arrived of a nuclear accident at Three Mile Island Unit 2 reactor near Middletown, Pa. Feeling totally in the dark when it came to information about the accident, my neighbors and I gathered outside our homes and immediately began testing to see which way the winds were blowing, and should we pack up and head in the opposite direction. Living about two and a half hours from the reactor which would eventually partially melt down, we were scared. Up to that time this would be considered the greatest nuclear accident in history being unaware of the Kyshtym Disaster which was a radioactive contamination accident that occurred on September 29, 1957 at Mayak, a plutonium production site in Russia for nuclear weapons and a nuclear fuel reprocessing plant in the Soviet Union. After reading Adam Higginbotham’s new book, MIDNIGHT IN CHERNOBYL: THE UNTOLD STORY OF THE WORLD’S GREATEST NUCLEAR DISASTER, an excellent account of the explosion and meltdown at Chernobyl the evening of April 25-26, 1986 and the ramifications of that disaster, memories of that March day flashed before my eyes.Higginbotham has written the most informative and insightful description of events and analysis of the meltdown that has yet to appear. It replaces Harvard historian, Serhii Plokhy’s CHERNOBYL: A HISTORY OF A NUCLEAR CATASYTROPHE as the most comprehensive and detailed work that has been written. In dealing with events such as Chernobyl one must ask: What happened, why did it happen, and could it happen again? Higginbotham, a journalist and his research partner Taras Shumeyko interviewed numerous eyewitnesses and conducted a prodigious amount of research that included a small number of declassified documents available, and argues that the fanatical view among Soviet bureaucrats and leadership to maintain secrecy, (for example, information about what occurred at Mayak was kept from the public for thirty years) was the reason the accident was so devastating, but also not surprising that it occurred. Higginbotham recreates the disaster providing a history of Soviet nuclear development, including numerous accidents; the planning and building of Chernobyl; the accident; attempts to remediate the situation after it occurred, the trial of the operators who were blamed for the disaster; and other aspects of the aftermath. The book reads in part as narrative history, but also a terrifying account of an event which could easily be repeated today.The plan to build Chernobyl was hatched in February 1970 as a means of catching up to the west and meet Soviet electricity needs. The Soviet Union would engage in a crash program to build nuclear reactors, but the problem was that the project began during a period of economic stagnation with material and resource shortages everywhere. The reactor was to be completed by 1975 which was totally unrealistic due to the approach taken by the Soviet bureaucracy, party elites, and engineers that did not consider shortages, safety needs, and planning for possible future nuclear accidents. The result is that corners were cut in terms of material, training, design flaws, “cooking the books,” and the stubborn nature of the Soviet bureaucracy in charge of construction. As Higginbotham discusses this aspect of the project, he provides the reader an interesting history of the development of radiation, nuclear development, and their affects on people and society. The author’s approach to complex scientific information and jargon is such that it is very easy to understand for the lay reader as he describes how reactors are supposed to be constructed.According to Higginbotham there were design flaws dealing with a high-power channel reactor labeled RMBK. These flaws would dog designers who would pay little attention to test results because of pressure from the Communist Party and the bureaucracy that flowed from it. This made disaster possible because no one knew how the reactor would react in case of an accident. The reactors colossal size made start up and shut down the most demanding and treacherous stages of RMBK operation. The author follows RMBK’s development and its flaws as it went into production, particularly the AZ-5 emergency protection system whose design took too long to respond in an emergency which came home to roost on April 25, 1986.  A similar plant in Leningrad experienced an accident on November 11, 1975 resulting in the release of radiation into the atmosphere over the Gulf of Finland. However, Sredmash, the Soviet agency in charge of production and construction of nuclear reactors covered up the investigative findings of design flaws related to the accident. On September 9, 1982 there was a partial meltdown at Unit 1 at Chernobyl which took eight months to repair, but the KGB instituted a gag order, and the following year a similar accident took place in a Lithuanian reactor and one in Armenia. But the world knew nothing of these accidents. Further exacerbating Soviet nuclear reactor building was the shoddy workmanship that plagued Soviet industry in general, and that carried over to the construction of Chernobyl.  A major problem that arose once Reactor #4 at Chernobyl exploded is that many of those in charge were unprepared to deal with what occurred and succumbed to wishful thinking and self-delusion in approaching how to deal with what had transpired. Higginbotham describes in detail the lethargic Soviet bureaucracy and their response to disaster. Soviet Prime Minister Mikhail Gorbachev was not notified as to what had occurred until the afternoon of April 26, 1986. The author narrates the debates inside the Commission that was set up to oversee the crisis. He relates the personalities involved and their debates on how to respond and their final decision making, many of which were out of some sort of fantasy. An excellent example apart from how to cool the reactor was whether they should evacuate the city of Pripyat and its 50,000 residents who were in danger of radiation exposure which took until April 27th to accomplish. As the radioactive cloud blew over Scandinavia, Swedish, Finish, and Danish diplomats lodged complaints to Moscow once it was realized where the radiation originated resulting in the Soviet government stonewalling. It would take until April 28th at 8:00pm for Moscow to come clean and announce that “an accident had taken place at the Chernobyl nuclear power plant.…One of the atomic reactors has been damaged.” Soviet citizens were used to this type of response as it was a continuation of the way the state had covered industrial accidents for decades.Higginbotham descriptions of helicopter pilots flying low dumping sand and boron on the reactor are harrowing. The author’s approach as he carefully describes how officials, academics, scientists, fire fighters, guards, and others and what they went through is chilling, especially as he brings the reader to Hospital #6 in Moscow created to treat victims of nuclear accidents and war. The ultimate fear was the “China Syndrome,” the further devastation that would occur if the reactor’s foundation exploded and nuclear material leaked into the earth. Even though Moscow TV announced on May 11, 1986 that the primary threat of explosion was over, scientists remained skeptical.The Central Committee of the Politburo decided against Gorbachev’s new policy of Glasnost and followed the traditional approach and blamed “bourgeois falsification….propaganda and inventions” as its immediate reaction, in addition to dishonesty and declining help from the west. This approach would backfire in terms of containing the accident but also hindering Gorbachev’s hope of nuclear disarmament talks with the United States because how could one negotiate with someone who was so untrustworthy.Higginbotham spends a great deal of time describing what the victims of the disaster experienced. He follows the medical care that victims received and for far too many their ultimate deaths. He recounts the bravery of so many who fought to contain the toxic results of the explosion, and countless men who returned to build the sarcophagus that was designed to seal reactor #4 for at least a hundred years. The narrative of how the newly created refugees, numbering over 116,000 from the exclusion zone is told with sensitivity and insight into their future plight. The scapegoating that dominated the investigation by Soviet authorities was appalling as was the propaganda machine that worked overtime to find blame and paint the accident in the best light as possible. The stories are often poignant and provide a true picture of what can happen on a personal and societal level from a nuclear disaster.Perhaps one of the most destructive results of Chernobyl was the beginning of the end of the Soviet Union. Gorbachev realized that even his own nuclear bureaucracy was rotten to the “core” and as was most of the Soviet state. The launching of perestroika opened debate among Soviet citizens that had been dormant, but slowly the issues of Afghanistan, drug addiction, the abortion epidemic, and the horrors of Stalinism emerged. The Russian people began to realize that they had been lied to for decades and as Higginbotham successfully argues they “faced the realization that their leaders were corrupt and that the Communist dream was a sham.”If wonders if a major nuclear accident could occur in the future remind yourself of Fukushima. In 2011, the Tokyo Electric Power Company’s nuclear plant underwent a process identical to Chernobyl; the loss of coolant that provoked a meltdown. As to what remains of Chernobyl itself, it is part of an “exclusion zone” of 1,000 square miles, a radioactive Eden for new wildlife and vegetation. Higginbotham has done the public a favor by exposing the events of April-May 1986 and give us pause as to how we should approach nuclear power in the future."
127,1501134612,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3357765-jimmy,5,"I have long been fascinated with Russia. Russian dissenters have long been my heroes going all the way back to Alexander Solzhenitsyn up to Pussy Riot and Garry Kasparov. It feels like Russia has an inferiority complex. The government is always trying to look bigger and stronger than they really are. Thus the arms buildups, the Olympic obsession, the meddling. In the case of Chernobyl, it was the cover ups, the refusal to admit mistakes, the effort to make the reactor bigger than anything else no matter how many corners had to be cut. As Higginbotham said, ""Lies and deception were endemic to the system, trafficked in both directions along the chain of management: those lower down passed up reports to their superiors packed with falsified statistics and inflated estimates, of unmet goals triumphantly reached, unfulfilled quotas heroically exceeded. To protect his own position, at every stage, relayed the lies upward or compounded them."" (15) ""Seated at the top of a teetering pyramid of falsehood, poring over reams of figures that had little basis in reality, were the economic mandarins of the State General Planning Committee--Gosplan--in Moscow."" (15) It worries me that Trump and his climate change deniers are setting up something of the same situation here in the US. Facts are not important in this administration. And scientific facts are even less important to the Trumpites. "". . . the plans called for fireproof cables, but when none could be found, the builders simply did the best they could."" (20) ""When the ministry of energy in Moscow learned that the roof of the plant's turbine hall had been covered with highly flammable bitumen, they ordered him to replace it. But the flame-retardent material . . . was not even being manufactured in the USSR, so the Ministry granted Brukhanov an exception, and the bitumen remained."" (20) But when they ordered him to build an ""olympic-sized swimming pool,"" he had to ""hoodwink the state bank"" to build it. He had no choice but to obey the order. Considering all of these facts, it makes me wonder if Chernobyl is the best way to look at nuclear power. The fault lies more with the communist system and its lack of regulatory power. People always think of communist systems as having too many regulations. In reality, communism has few regulations because it is all about the power at the top, like with Trump. The goal was to build ""increasingly gigantic stations throughout the western territories of the Union. By the end of the century, Moscow intended Chernobyl to be one part of a dense network of atomic power megacomplexes."" (20) In spite of ""alarming building faults,"" the work kept on. On pages 62 to 63, the designers saw ""no need to prepare for such a calamity"" in reference to the worst possible scenarios. All warnings about the dangers were ignored. Former Chernobyl chief engineer Nikolai Steinberg said that the origins of the disaster lay in a combination of ""scientific, technological, socioeconomic, and human factors"" unique to the USSR. (347) The Soviet Union ""lacked even rudimentary safety practices."" They ""relied upon its operators to behave with robotic precision night after night."" They were under ""constant pressure to beat deadlines."" All of this made ""disregard for the letter of the regulations almost inevitable."" The deceased operators of Control Room Number Four ""had brought the reactor into an unstable condition, but only on account of the acute pressure they felt to complete the test on the turbine."" (347) ""Some environmentalists argued that humanity could not afford to turn its back on the promise and terrors of the peaceful atom. The global need for electricity was increasing exponentially: humanity was predicted to double the amount of energy it used by 2050. Despite the growing certainty that burning fossil fuels was the cause of devastating climate change--making the stabilization of carbon emissions imperative--coal remained the most widely used source of energy in the world. The fine particulates from fossil fuel plants in the United States killed more than thirteen thousand people a year; worldwide, three million people died annually as a result of air pollution released by coal- and oil-fueled power stations. Even to begin to head off climate change over the coming thirty-five years would have to be clean, yet neither wind, solar, hydroelectric, nor geothermal power--nor any combination of them--had the potential to bridge the gap."" (357 to 358) ""And at last, more than seventy years after the technology's inception, engineers were finally developing reactors with design priorities that lay not in making bombs but in generating electricity. In principle, these fourth-generation reactors would be cheaper, safer, smaller, more efficient, and less poisonous than their predecessors and could yet prove to be the technology that saves the world."" (358) There is a ""liquid fluoride thorium reactor (LFTR)"" developed at Tennessee's Oak Ridge National Laboratory that is fueled by ""thorium. More plentiful and far harder to process into bomb-making material than uranium, thorium also burns more efficiently in a reactor and could produce less hazardous radioactive waste with half-lives of hundreds, not tens of thousands, of years. . . . It does not require a massive containment building to guard against loss-of-coolant accidents or explosions and can be constructed on such a compact scale that every steel mill or small town could have its own microreactor tucked away underground."" (358) ""In 2015, Bill Gates had begun funding research projects similar to these fourth-generation reactors in a quest to create a carbon-neutral power source for the future. By then, the Chinese government had already set seven hundred scientists on a crash program to build the world's first industrial thorium reactor as part of a war on pollution. 'The problem of coal has become clear,' the engineering director of the project said. 'Nuclear power provides the only solution.'"" (358) I was selective in my quotes. The question now is, Must we turn to nuclear power as a last resort to get out of the mess of climate change? I would be interested in your responses. "

It handles an amazingly complicated subject and history, and a massive cast of Soviet names, and somehow keeps it all clear even for non-scientist reader. If you're too young to remember Chernobyl, read this (and watch the HBO miniseries). If you are old enough to remember Chernobyl (and perhaps even Three Mile Island), read this anyway. It's frightening, compelling, brilliant, and vital as we try to ward off climate change and turn to energy sources other than fossil fuels. "

Senior Lieutenant Alexander Logachev loved radiation the way other men loved their wives. Tall and good-looking, twenty-six years old, with close-cropped dark hair and ice-blue eyes, Logachev had joined the Soviet army when he was still a boy. They had trained him well. The instructors from the military academy outside Moscow taught him with lethal poisons and unshielded radiation. He traveled to the testing grounds of Semipalatinsk in Kazakhstan, and to the desolte East Urals Trace, where the fallout from a clandestine radioactive accident still poisoned the landscape; eventually, Logachev’s training took him even to the remote and forbidden islands of Novaya Zemlya, high in the Arctic Circle and ground zero for the detonation of the terrible Tsar Bomba, the largest thermonuclear device in history.
Although I haven’t been born at the time of the Chernobyl disaster, the events of that time have fascinated me for years. This is probable also due to the fact that my parents, who were living in Poland during the catastrophe, were directly affected by the radioactive cloud. I have seen nearly every documentary that exists and I also found the HBO miniseries amazing! So amazing that every day I look skeptically in the direction of the nuclear power plant that stands here around the corner. So, it was clear that I would read this book the moment I heard about it for the first time. And even if, unfortunately, I had little time to read due to university and private courses, in the end it was absolutely worth! __________________________________________In the book, first there are some maps and overviews showing, among other things, Russia and the location of Pripyat and the construction of Unit Four of the Chernobyl Nuclear Plant (Tschernobylska AES im. W. I. Lenina). This is followed by a list of key persons and their function within the catastrophy. Then, the “story” begins.Journalist Higginbotham describes his incredibly well-researched information as far as possible in chronological order, sometimes even to the nearest second. It starts before the catastrophe and provides information on how the nuclear industry has built up in the USSR, how atomgrad* Pripyat was formed and how the nuclear power plant came online, years before the big mistake that was due to humane and machine failures.Within the text numerous, sometimes very scientific information, can be found – for example, how radiation works or that men radiate more than women due to their higher muslce mass. For me, there were actually some new things that I did not know before!In the further process, Higginbotham describes the events from the point of view of the varius persons: Director Brukhanov, scientist Legassov or the firefighters, who were unsuspecting at the scene and sealed their death with their intervention, but prevented a major catastrophe. Personally, this chapter has hit me the most, as I do not want to imagine how they must have felt in this situation.After detailed descriptions of the events at the plant and politics, which among other things led to the collapse of the Soviet Union, Higginbotham gives an insight into the current situation in the Ukraine: Among other things, he conducted interviews with people who vere involved in the disaster and he visits the ghost town of Pripyat. Attached are a glossary with all the important technical terms in the field of nuclear energy and images of the people and places mentioneds in the book. __________________________________________Even though the book requires a lot of concentration and you need a little more time to understand everything, it was absolutely worth to read this book! I would recommend it to anyone – whether he has already experienced the disaster or was born later. The topic is more present after the accident in Japan and should be known to everyone. For those who, like me, are interested in the events during that time, the book is an absolute must have!"

Ma!)Boom. Kablewey. You pick. Things burn. 51,300 comrades 💤 (Ma!) in their beds. It was only a 2 minute flight from Reactor 4 to Pripyat. Maybe 10 minutes by car. The radioactive dust took the car. MA!Are you telling this story, Dorothy? The explosion was mostly vertical, but the damage? The damage was horizontal, soaring on winded wings as far as Sweden and that’s when sh*t really got real - don’t 🙄 at your mother, Dorothy Zbornak! Where do you think Stan got his weirdness?So Gorbachev’s all open door and honesty’s the best policy - well, how do you like them dosimeters? Open door policy, my foot! That’s how some cities knew what happened! They took radioactive readings off the sandals of a lady who just traveled to Pripyat. Gorby didn’t tell them. It was the shoes!Back to my story: So we got bureaucrats on the ground, fires blazing in the central core, 1,200 Kievan buses evac’ing the city and no clue how to stop this giant wildebeest from exploding again, China Syndrome style. Meanwhile: The winds have blown ... now we gotta evac another 116k people in the newly designated “Exclusion Zone” (though later they’d rename it the “Nuclear Reservation” like that helps), but the story of Chernobyl doesn’t stop there! Nope...✋ Now we gotta get Reactors 1-3...back...online?? Isn’t that the reason we’re gonna throw 750,000 bio robots at this sucker to begin with?? Not sure what you call *waves hand dramatically* all this, then. Oh right, “nuclear meltdowns don’t happen in the Soviet Union” (Stellan Skarsgard better get an Emmy for that brilliantly executed meltdown!).So here we are, 30 ish years later (ironic that’s the “official” death toll = 31 souls), two sarcophagi, 800 radioactive waste dumps, 4700 km squared of inhabitable land, hu HUM huh of ARS victims (it’s classified. So, of course, they told me, but I’m Sophia Petrillo! I keep my word! I’ll write it down, you throw it in the fireplace!) and a city built specifically to support the wildebeest dies in 16 years. Don’t worry though, they moved everyone to Slavutych, another atomgrad, and hey, the world makes sense again!That’s how we tell stories in Sicily! Obviously, loved this one! It is a little dry, but as you can see, it’s hard to write without judgement. Higginbotham does just the facts, no sass and still tells the story in a way that’s both completely understandable and emotionally harrowing all at the same time. Very well done!"
131,1501134612,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9981052-nicholereadswithcats,5,Very informative. Some of the scientific information was a little over my head but I enjoyed the mix between facts and personal experience. Shocking the lengths which were taken to attempt to cover up what happened. Loved the pictures at the end.
132,1501134612,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3670585-erin-cataldi,3,"This book has all the info you never knew you needed on Chernobyl - down to the last technical detail. I listened to this rather than reading it and was soon bogged down by the sheer amount of physics detailed; at times I found myself struggling to pay attention. That being said, this was still a fascinating detailed look on the events that caused the accidents and the actions taken afterward. It was a perfect storm of horrible events and it really will get your heart racing as the author gives you a near minute by minute account. Unsettling at moments, and overly technical; this insanely well researched guide is not for the casual reader. This book is heavy; but will change the way you think about Chernobyl forever! "
133,1501134612,http://goodreads.com/user/show/55342889-elizabethanne-olsen,5,Just. Fucking. Fantastic. The descriptions of the destruction seemed so surreal like it was a fictional dystopian novel. So difficult to grasp the enormity of this as a real event. The horrific descriptions of ailments to the ones who suffered exposure was intense and necessary. Everyone should real this book. Everyone. 
134,1501134612,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2168708-marta,5,"Astonishing, thrillingly written, with a lot of new information, including the causes of the accident. I have bought this on audio and listened to it; but I missed so much information that I am listening to it again. It is thrilling the second time as well, and this time I can put the stories of the people more into context. My family was also interested so I bought a print copy as well. I am using it to look up names, and there are pictures as well. I stopped listening second time about halfway through - the pandemic happened and I am tired of bad news. This is a thrilling telling of a cautionary tale about the dangers of arrogance dealing with the forces of nature. The minimizing, denials, trying to cover it up, confused scrambling to stall an even bigger disaster - all echo in the reaction of the US government to the pandemic in the last weeks/months. The arrogance and the wishful thinking that made the disaster so much worse are just as present now. Leaders need to read history - and we elected one that expressly disdains science, reading, and history. This is of course wholly unfair to the people in the Chernobyl catastrophe. There was a lot of heroism, and some ofticials showed remarkable leadership. Which is why I felt most enraged when those operators who gave their lives willingly and performed heroics to save the reactor in the first hours of the disaster, were scapegoated. These people were heroes (well, some, I have no sympathy for plant director Brukhanov), and they were tried as criminals, some declared as such posthumously. The world was told at the time that the accident was caused by careless operators who conducted a test and disabled the safety systems. But in reality, the RBMK reactor had multiple design flaws and the accident was waiting to happen. One of those was in the emergency shutdown. When the Chernobyl operators realized they had trouble, they initiated a shutdown by dropping all safety rods - but instead of shutting down, the reactor went critical - because of the rods were graphite-tipped! The designers have discovered this flaw years before, but they thought it was unlikely to happen. (Arrogance and negligence). It was only an issue if most control rods were withdrawn - which was the case at Chernobyl, due to the other major flaw of the reactor, the positive void coefficient (Google it). This basically made it unsafe to operate the reactor at low power levels, which the designers also discovered, but all they did was sent a new operating manual, without explaining why this was important. Experienced operators did learn that the reactor got unstable at lower power levels, from experience, but did not know that it could be a safety risk. So when the manager of the tests wanted to perform it at low power levels, one protested - but he was overruled and threatened of being fired. Presumably the manager wanted to be safer... and thus the reactor went to overdrive with the lower powerlevel, so they withdrew the rods - then tried to shut down. Boom.All this has been previously detected as a risk, and ignored. Then came the fallout.Read this - but maybe not during a pandemic."
135,1501134612,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8413178-liam,5,"I, like everybody else, have been entranced by HBO's Chernobyl. Watching it, I realised how little I really knew about the disaster despite having spent untold hours wandering around in the fictional version of the Zone in the STALKER games.Much like most people I imagine, I was kind of astounded by how huge a disaster it actually was, and how close it came to being so much worse. I kind of ran under the assumption that the HBO show was dramatised to a certain extent, because how could I have possibly not heard that there was a distinct possibility that Reactor 4 would explode again with the force of several atomic bombs? - but no, this actually occurred.Higginbotham's writing is detached, which somehow makes it all the more impactful - dry descriptions of Pripyat firefighters experiencing 'violent diarrhea' in the days following the initial explosion, which was determined to be 'their intestines liquefying' is one example I'm going to have trouble forgetting.As a companion to the show, Midnight in Chernobyl was excellent. I didn't plan it out that way, but events in the show as I watched it every few nights kind of lined up to the events in the book as I listened to it on my way to and from work, expanding and providing further detail, or refuting the more dramatised parts of the show. Legasov for example is portrayed a lot more heroic in the show, routinely martyring himself before the Communist Party for the good of all - whereas he was far more likely to toe the Party line in real life, and only repented soon before his death.Midnight in Chernobyl is a fantastic in-depth exploration of the disaster - causes and repercussions, and it has certainly sparked interest in the topic for myself. An excellently written book, very well read by Jacques Roy. Highly recommend."

If, instead, you want to know the true story read Higginbotham's fine book, which does an excellent job of not only describing in a blow-by-blow fashion the disaster and it's aftermath, but places the disaster in the broader context of Soviet society and rule. 4-stars."
137,1501134612,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5072847-will-ansbacher,5,"Well written, fast paced and unbelievable action – this would be a terrific disaster thriller if it wasn’t actually all true.Adam Higginbotham has done a simply brilliant job of researching and writing about the world’s worst nuclear disaster, with a style that’s riveting yet balanced and without hyperbole. It opens with a couple of pages describing Civil Defence responders’ panic as they first realize the extent of the radioactive horror they’d been catapulted into. From that initial adrenalin burst, the first part of the story (titled Birth of a City) goes back to the origins of nuclear power development in Russia and the founding of the atomic city of Pripyat, and is interleaved with the events surrounding the explosion of reactor #4 and the immediate after-effects. The longer part two (Death of an Empire) covers the awful radiation effects, the mainly futile clean-up attempts, the cover-ups, denials, excruciating investigations and show trials; at the same time providing insight into the breakup of the USSR. (If Chernobyl wasn’t the catalyst that led to the end of the Soviet Union, then it certainly was a major factor). The story ends with more recent developments, including interviews the author had with those involved - at least, those who still were alive after 2006.This changing focus is a really effective way of dealing with a highly complex subject that could otherwise have been quite dry. Interestingly, I thought, the structure mirrors radiation poisoning itself: the initial terrifying experience of acute exposure and a short period of apparent recovery, but followed by the much longer and agonizing progress of an array of worsening symptoms. I won’t go into the story itself, (this  NY Times review is a great summary). But I was struck by a few recurrent themes:One, the cynical way disasters were suppressed so nobody could ever learn from previous mistakes;Two, the culture of craven compliance that prevented anyone from speaking out about known problems; (Together, these made not only the reactor explosion inevitable but the aftermath about as bad as it could possibly be)Three, the casual attitudes – bordering on macho defiance - to radiation dangers;And four, the sheer resilience of the Russian and Ukrainian people – both workers at the plant and the general population - in the face of all the horrors that were thrown at them. (Though these last two are as much the result of the authorities ruthlessly suppressing information) A ton of authoritative information has become available over the last 30 years, and Higginbotham seems to have read it all - there are 100 pages of end notes alone. However in order not to interrupt the flow he wisely left all the cross-referencing to the end, where a few relevant words in each note point to the text. There is also an extensive bibliography and a short but useful cast of characters ... Ligachev? Logachev? Legasov? ... which I found I had to flip back to often. There is still much we don’t know about Chernobyl, but to understand the disaster and what it means, I don’t think you could do better than this book. It isn’t perfect of course; Higginbotham didn’t explain some of the radiation physics or its effects on humans too well, but for this non-technical account it’s more than good enough."

Journalist Adam Higgnbothem has written an amazing documentary of the 1986 catastrophe at the Chernobyl nuclear plant in the USSR. I listened to the audible production that is narrated by Jacques Roy. At the beginning, Roy lists all the important characters in this story. Since I listened to it, I was at a disadvantage keeping all the players straight in my head. If one wants to truly understand the politics, lies, radiation illnesses, etc, that involved each character, one should read the novel. As an American listener, all those Russian names were difficult to keep in my mind.That said, it is an amazing listen. Just getting the timeline of events, the mistakes, the horror of the disaster while listening is enough for me. This tragedy was a culmination of mistakes. Although the USSR wanted to lay blame on separate individuals, Higgenbothem shows that is was straws, that individually wouldn’t be the blame, but added together resulted in a global tragedy. Also, it was the political pressure and the culture of Russia at that time that lead to the explosion. Russia wanted to save face which added layers to the event that cost thousands of lives. The government secrecy magnified mistakes.Higgenbothem exposes the devastating losses and damages to humans, the landscape, and animals. Once the catastrophe made global news, he explains the collective efforts made to find solutions. Nuclear energy seems here to stay. Creating safe nuclear energy is paramount to the safety and survival of the earth. Making worker education a priority is a necessity. We must remain aware and well informed of the cost/benefit of producing nuclear energy. This is an amazing case study."

Author and his multiple researchers did a great job going through documentation, books, articles and statements. They also interviewed quite a few people who participated in described events.Book is well written and narrative is concise. Author guides a reader through basics of physics and construction necessary to understand the events properly. I specifically liked the description of research done on the reactor which were conducted few years after the disaster. I was not familiar with those findings.When it comes to shortcomings of this book - it was written by Brit living in the US and this Western point of view is very clear here. I felt the narration had lingering condescending and superior tone to it, what at points became quite annoying. I think the author did not have a good understanding of Russian culture and mentality (particularly noted during his last interview with the plant director) and he undermined the value of some heroic acts done by firefighters and soldiers after the disaster. This is not the first book I read on this topic and I think Russian and Ukrainian writers are much better in this area for obvious reasons.This is a great book for Westerners who know nothing or close to nothing about Charnobyl disaster and would like to have a general overview. Kinda ""all you can eat""..... but not a white cloth."

''But when I went back to Ukraine, they started telling me about people who had died. Was it due to radiation? I don't know. I don't understand anything about statistics. But, when my friends ask me about it, I tell them: the less you think about it, the longer you'll live.''Midnight in Chernobyl autora Adama Higginbothama enciklopedijski je uvid u najveću nuklearnu katastrofu koja se dogodila u Černobilju, u Ukrajini 26.aprila 1986. godine.Priča o najvećoj nesreći jedne države, grada, političkog i državnog uređenja, počinje u trenutku kada se postavljaju temelji za građenje ovog nukelarnog postrojenja 1970. godine i rađanja grada u kome su živjeli ljudi zaposleni na izgradnji, kao i radnici predviđeni da rade u novootvorenoj centrali.U jeku hladnog rata Sovjetski savez se svim silama trudio da ukroti atom, da svijetu podari sliku o naučnim dostignućima bez premca, a ljudi su uživali u plodovima svog rada, bezbrižni, poletni i vjerni državi koja im je stvorila atomski grad Pripjat, obezbjedila udobnost sadašnjosti i velike planove za budućnost.Ali sovjetski naučnici koji su radili pod okriljem jednog zatvorenog i ambicioznog sistema, zatvarali su oči pred bilo kakvim greškama na koje su upozoravani prilikom izrade nuklearnih reaktora RBMK-1000 (koji je i eksplodirao u Černobilju), sve mane koje su nesumnjivo postojale držane su u strogoj tajnosti, a sve, naizgled, male stvari dovele su do katastrofe koja je, prema mnogima, dovela i do raspada SSSR-a.Autor se kroz brojne izvore ovim događajem bavio sa naučnog, političkog, socijalnog i ljudskog aspekta, hirurški precizno kombinujući dešavanja u Černobilju sa sudbinama stanovnika Pripjata, koji nesvjesni onoga što ih je snašlo odlaze iz svojih domova, dok radijacija bjesomučno prekriva kvadratne kilometre gradova, tokove rijeka, dječije igračke, kućne ljubimce i tijela svih koji su učestvovali u saniranju posljedica eksplozije.Usljed loše izrađenog reaktora, kojim su upravljali ambiciozni i često nestručni ljudi, zaslijepljeni egom i grandioznošću, 26.aprila 1986. godine desio se početak kraja jednog doba, zapečanjen sudbinama nekih običnih ljudi koji su na poziv domovine golim rukama uklanjali radioaktivni materijal, koji su u sobama Bolnice broj šest ostavljali svoje živote, koji su gradili sarkofag iznad uništenog reaktora u uslovima visoke radijacije kobne po ljudsko zdravlje.A put kojim se došlo do toga, kao i njegove posljedice Adam Higginbotham predstavio je na opširan, zanimljiv i stručan način, te ostavio još jedno važno svjedočanstvo o ovom događaju.P.S. Ponovo preporučujem da pogledate HBO mini seriju Chernobyl, s obzirom da je nakon gledanja mnogo lakše shvatiti suštinu ove knjige, kao i komplikovane opise načina rada nuklearnog reaktora.''Amid the chaos of the collapsing empire, most of the men and women who had fought the Battle of Chernobyl were forgotten - the final defenders of a nation that had seemingly vanished overnight.''"

I am too young to remember the Chernobyl melt down when the event took place in 1986, but I'm certain it's an event that contributed to my very vague, yet frightening notions of the war grown ups referred to as Cold.Later in life, I discovered pictures of Pripyat -an abandoned and radioactive city. These images captivated and haunted me. Yet, why did Chernobyl really melt down, and could other nuclear power plants face such demise? (An uneasy question for someone who heard a nuclear power plant's monthly test sirens while sitting in her high school classes.)This book delivered a lot of information - from how nuclear fission takes place, to who were the people on the ground before, during, and after the explosions in 1986. For me, the science bits were just enough - explained with clarity, yet never cumbersome or off-putting. (I'm language oriented, so science text books are off-putting for me personally.) But, the heart of this book is the people you meet. The firemen, the young nuclear engineers, an architect mapping out an ideal city, people loyal (albeit, questionably) to their county and the beliefs it strived to uphold. Midnight in Chernobyl portrayed a nuclear power plant, its atomgard, and its people with such distinction, that it was hard to shake any of these elements even when the book was closed. That childhood fear of the Cold War and nuclear weapons crept into my dreams, waking me with fears of radiation exposure and an urgency to find my children. A fleeting moment later, and my comfortable reality reasserted itself; but I wanted to know more, to understand more about an era in history - and about our future.It's quite a read. I'll eagerly offer it up to other readers as a worthy title. **(I already have - my apologies to those who came to my family's cook-out over the weekend who listened to me chatter on about a nuclear meltdown, when all they wanted to do was enjoy some pulled pork and spare ribs. I really do try to keep the overzealous librarian in me at bay during large social events, but alas, this title was just too good.)"

I started it on a Thursday and finished it over the weekend. It is an indictment of a flawed system of government. I watched the Chernobyl mini-series several times. Had not my son given this book to me as a birthday present, I probably wouldn’t have read it but I’m glad I did. A miniseries cannot delve into the details and provide all the interesting backstories and other essential information intrinsic to this story. The reactor was of a flawed design. This disaster was bound to happen sooner or later. Previous accidents had been swept under the rug. Soviet prestige was at stake and this was more important than the safety of the people or the planet. There was no oversight. In fact on page 323, Acadamician Valery Legasov realized “…the true scope of the decay at the heart of the [Soviet] nuclear state: The culture of secrecy and complacency, the arrogance and negligence and the shoddy standards of design and construction.”  On page 327 the author explains that the explosion was the last straw of a failing system:The most destructive forces unleashed by the explosion of Reactor Number Four were not radiological but political and economic. The cloud of radiation that spread out across Europe, making the catastrophe impossible to conceal had forced the touted openness of Gorbachev’s glasnost on even the most reluctant conservatives in the Politburo. Even the nuclear bureaucracy had been undermined by secrecy, incompetence, and stagnation convinced him that the entire state was rotten. Perestroika was launched in a desperate bid to save the Socialist experiment before it was too late. But all this did was to promote discussion on other censored topics such as drug addiction, abortion, Afghan war, and the horrors of Stalinism.Thus the author argues, the Chernobyl disaster brought down an empire. It is a fascinating read."
149,1501134612,http://goodreads.com/user/show/284714-kasandra,4,"This is a fascinating, horrifying, depressing, and enlightening read, with tons of details I'd never heard or learned before. What's most terrifying is how much the chances of this were known inside the former Soviet Union and covered up for years (along with previous accidents). The heroism of many Russians is astounding in dealing with this crisis, as is the callousness of others. A warning for the nuclear energy industry and all of us, about how quickly this technology can spiral out of control without transparency, honesty, readiness for all emergencies, and even with all proper planning - how quickly we can destroy ourselves and our environment due to simple human error and pride. Incredibly well-reported and thorough, and highly recommended."
150,1501134612,http://goodreads.com/user/show/34570157-jenny-jo-weir,4,Wow! This one was a hard read. The whole time I'm thinking about all that radiation and the effects of the explosion. The amount of people affected by this and the cost of this unfortunate event were unprecedented. You can't help but feel bad fro all the people involved and for all the victims. It's something that sticks with you. 
151,1501134612,http://goodreads.com/user/show/38617426-juli,4,"Interest in the Chernobyl nuclear disaster has spiked since the award winning HBO mini-series aired. I watched the show and listened to HBO's accompanying podcast and several other podcast episodes on the accident and its aftermath. Several of the podcasts mentioned this book, so I secured a spot on the library's wait list for the audiobook. I'm glad I did! This book is excellent!Higginbotham outlines the buildup of the soviet power grid and nuclear technology. Along the way there were accidents, cost cutting measures that had disastrous effects, mismanagement, poor training and flawed maintenance. All the mistakes culminated in the explosion at Chernobyl on April 25, 1986.Higginbotham gives details about the people involved, the plant itself, the history of Soviet nuclear power, the accident, the evacuation of Pripyat, and the continuing aftermath of the accident. It's a very interesting, and concerning, story. Many countries have nuclear power plants now. It's an awesome way to generate electricity, unless there is an accident. In recent years, the Fukushima accident shows that an earthquake or other natural event can cause modern nuclear plants to become quite dangerous. But with mismanagement, bad maintenance, lackluster employee training and shoddy parts/construction, any nuclear plant can be potentially dangerous. With more countries around the world turning to nuclear power, the chances of an accident increase.....I remember news reports in 1986 about the event. I can remember initial reports stating that it was known there had been some sort of nuclear event in the Soviet Union but scientists were not sure what had happened and no information was being released by USSR officials. When the full truth came out, it was horrifying. An entire city evacuated. Firemen and emergency response personnel dying. The struggle to prevent a melt-down. 33 years later, many are still interested in the accident and the lasting damage it caused. Pripyat is becoming a tourist attraction even. Yikes! I can think of much better vacation sites than one that is completely irradiated. Pripyat, and the surrounding region, will be not be safely habitable for more than 20,000 years.Nuclear power is safe when handled responsibly by properly trained people. Most plants operating in the modern world are quite safe, and managed/maintained properly. But, a nuclear power plant can be potentially deadly if proper safety protocols are not strictly adhered to and the potential effects of natural disasters and other catastrophes are not properly taken into consideration. I hope it is a very, very long time -- or never -- that our planet ends up with another uninhabitable, radiation soaked region from a nuclear accident. The effects are long lasting, and far reaching.Great book! Lots of highly researched information presented in an interesting manner. The audio book is about 14 hours long and narrated by Jacques Roy. Roy reads at a steady pace. His voice is easily understandable. Very enjoyable listening experience!"
152,1501134612,http://goodreads.com/user/show/352711-leftbanker,5,"I began this book out of desperation from the cliff-hanger of episode 2 of Chernobyl on HBO, one of the best TV dramas I’ve ever watched. Like the series, the pacing and tone of this account reads like the best of thrillers and I literally couldn’t put it down. I’m old enough to have vivid recollections of the event as it was unfolding. My USAF unit stationed in Athens, Greece, received intelligence on the crisis well ahead of the local news. We knew that it was a nuclear accident well before the Soviets admitted to this fact, but what we didn’t know was just how close the world was to a bigger, unspeakable disaster. This news really wasn’t available for years after the events of April 1986. The world had moved on. I had all but forgotten Chernobyl until this brilliant series came over the horizon. A viewer of the series wrote, “The tragedy will live forever because of this haunting masterpiece, what a brilliant creative achievement.” I could say the same for this book. Informative, objective, and written with a breath-taking pace, I couldn’t recommend it more highly to anyone looking to become better informed on the events of Chernobyl, both when it happened, and in the years since.It’s hard to laugh when you’re reading in the fetal position, but this part struck me as the epitome of gallows humor. One nuclear scientist working on cleaning up the disaster gives safety advice to another nuclear scientist just arriving, “If you smell ozone, run!”The big surprise is that the death toll wasn’t tens of times greater than the reality. Of course, we may never know the true results of the accident as Soviet record keeping tended to down-play cancer deaths which may have been related to Chernobyl.The most terrifying aspect of all is to consider how our leaders today would deal with a disaster on this order. Even the monumentally corrupt Soviets of that era had some highly intelligent, rational people among them, which is more than you can say of Putin and Trump, and their flunkies. Trump prevaricates on matters of little or no importance; imagine his response on this sort of travesty."
153,1501134612,http://goodreads.com/user/show/714583-anita-pomerantz,3,"This book is sooo highly rated and was listed as ""best non-fiction"" by numerous sources in 2019. All I have to say is I wish I read Voices from Chernobyl: The Oral History of a Nuclear Disaster instead. This book was just boring unless you like reading a lot about engineering and the technical structure of power plants and buildings. In addition, there are a zillion Russian names, and even with Kindle X-Ray and a guide to who was who, I struggled because the people just were not brought to life for me.This is reporting. It's very strong reporting, and it unveils the type of cover-up that makes you worried about government and implies that conspiracy theories can be true. The story is important. I just did not find it interesting because of the absolute overload of details, many of which were beyond my understanding or ability to picture. Maybe my timing in picking up this one was just way off . . .as we are in the middle of a crisis ourselves, my concentration is pretty shot. So, judge this one by the reviews of others. I just can barely bring myself to give it 3 stars. "
154,1501134612,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5349403-carolyn,4,"The author has written an impressive, comprehensive book of historical importance. It brings to light events surrounding the Chernobyl catastrophe of 1986 which may be unknown to many in the Western world, and even to the Russian people. The author presents a crash course in nuclear physics and energy, simplified as much as possible. This may present difficulties for the average reader without some background knowledge. I thought the human factor surrounding the disaster to be interesting and appreciated that the book included a summary list of the Cast of Characters and their positions and involvement with Chernobyl. The book emphasized the social/political Cold War mentality, economic factors, technical failures, the cut-throat ambition of the politicians and their secrecy which led to public complacency or wild rumours. Reaction time was slow due to uncertainty and arguments about the best course of action. I feel this is the definitive book of situations leading up to the disaster, what happened when Reactor 4 malfunctioned causing a huge surge of radiation, and its aftermath. The history is impeccable and thoroughly researched and stands as a sample for other writers of historical events and will be the definitive book on Chernobyl.The Chernobyl atomic complex was built to produce cheap electricity for a vast surrounded area, and to establish the Soviet Union ’s predominance in nuclear power. The disaster occurred in Reactor #4 on April 26, 1986. A model town, Pripyat, was built in the wilderness area close to the Nuclear Plant to house tens of thousands of workers and their families. From rough, cold shacks inhabited by the early builders, it grew into an impressive town with 3 schools, 35 playgrounds, 3 swimming pools, a library, sports facility and shopping center. Groceries and goods in the stores were more varied and abundant than in cities of origin of most of the workers. No expense was spared in planting trees and importing flowering shrubs to enhance the blocks of apartments. The nuclear accident which occurred resulted in a coverup where plant workers and women and children were not aware of the danger to their lives and health from nuclear fallout.there were cultural and political reasons contributing to lack of safety. Poor building design, shoddy materials, forced deadlines for builders and plant workers to meet, incompetent and negligent staff without knowledge of dangers they faced. There had been a smaller explosion at another plant and plenty of malfunctions but they were ignorant of possible critical problems. After the reactor imploded and seemed to be going into meltdown, releasing radiation far and wide, members of the emergency response team who did know the peril were either forced to stop the leak or went in willingly out of patriotic duty.  Following the disaster, people of Pripyat went about their lives ignorant of dangers from radioactive fallout. During this time a gathering of academics, Generals and politicians argued about the course they needed to take but were mainly concerned with secrecy. Finally, it was decided to evacuate the town of 51,000 people but leaving behind 4,000 essential service workers. People being evacuated were led to believe that they would only be away from home a couple of days and to bring only essentials for a short stay. Immediately after the explosion, there were two deaths of reactor workers.28 died soon of acute radiation sickness.. Evacuation orders soon included 90,000 people within a 30 K radius. High radiation levels soon spread to areas distant from Chernobyl and was detected in Sweden, Belarus and Poland. By May 20, 95,000 people had been hospitalized. High levels of radioactivity had already reached the capital, Kiev. May Day celebrations were carried out in the open air. Soon over 300,000 children were ordered evacuated from Kiev, along with expectant and nursing mothers (about 1/5 of the population). Teams were hired to shoot 20,000 domestic animals left behind.  We will never know how many people died over the years from radiation-induced cancers, as doctors were pressed not to mention a possible connection. Once the danger of a meltdown had eased and the reactor was covered with a dome, it was felt necessary to lay blame. Six plant officials were put on trial resulting in prison sentences. Official statements refused to place blame on faulty building materials, reactor design flaws, or the irresponsibility and poor discipline of the plant workers present when the disaster occurred. They had been conducting a safety inspection to simulate a power failure and did not follow the procedure properly outlined on a checklist. The author emphasizes the social/political Cold War mentality. The secrecy of generals and politicians which led to wild rumours or complacency subsequently caused the people to distrust in their leaders. Economic factors due to the billions of rubles spent on evacuation, housing, pay for thousands of emergency workers, and the deactivating the reactor was a great financial loss for the country. The author feels this was a major factor contributing to the breakup of the Soviet Union Thanks to NetGalley and Simon & Schuster for an advance copy of this important book."
155,1501134612,http://goodreads.com/user/show/53179837-george,4,"This book covers the events from the construction of the plant to the fall of the Soviet Union, but unlike Serhii Plokhy he does it from the perspective of the people who were actually close enough to absorb the radiation. Mostly he focused on the scientists, workers and liquidators, who had to deal with the clean up. He focused so much on these people that at the beginning of the book there was a list of characters, as if it was a play or something. I've never seen that done with a nonfiction book before, but maybe that was just a quirk of my particular edition. Now, because I have read Chernobyl: History of a Tragedy by Serhii Plokhy I couldn't help but compare these two. Serhii Plokhy covered the construction of the plant and the causes of the explosion itself better then Adam Higginbotham, but Adam didn't just brush of the clean up process. After reading them both I find it that they are both necessary to understand this disaster, just to get all the angles.Lastly, on to the Voices of Chernobyl to see what the ordinary people had to say about this whole mess. "
156,1501134612,http://goodreads.com/user/show/17428284-steven-z,5,"March 28, 1979 was an overcast day in Woodbridge, Va. when news arrived of a nuclear accident at Three Mile Island Unit 2 reactor near Middletown, Pa. Feeling totally in the dark when it came to information about the accident, my neighbors and I gathered outside our homes and immediately began testing to see which way the winds were blowing, and should we pack up and head in the opposite direction. Living about two and a half hours from the reactor which would eventually partially melt down, we were scared. Up to that time this would be considered the greatest nuclear accident in history being unaware of the Kyshtym Disaster which was a radioactive contamination accident that occurred on September 29, 1957 at Mayak, a plutonium production site in Russia for nuclear weapons and a nuclear fuel reprocessing plant in the Soviet Union. After reading Adam Higginbotham’s new book, MIDNIGHT IN CHERNOBYL: THE UNTOLD STORY OF THE WORLD’S GREATEST NUCLEAR DISASTER, an excellent account of the explosion and meltdown at Chernobyl the evening of April 25-26, 1986 and the ramifications of that disaster, memories of that March day flashed before my eyes.Higginbotham has written the most informative and insightful description of events and analysis of the meltdown that has yet to appear. It replaces Harvard historian, Serhii Plokhy’s CHERNOBYL: A HISTORY OF A NUCLEAR CATASYTROPHE as the most comprehensive and detailed work that has been written. In dealing with events such as Chernobyl one must ask: What happened, why did it happen, and could it happen again? Higginbotham, a journalist and his research partner Taras Shumeyko interviewed numerous eyewitnesses and conducted a prodigious amount of research that included a small number of declassified documents available, and argues that the fanatical view among Soviet bureaucrats and leadership to maintain secrecy, (for example, information about what occurred at Mayak was kept from the public for thirty years) was the reason the accident was so devastating, but also not surprising that it occurred. Higginbotham recreates the disaster providing a history of Soviet nuclear development, including numerous accidents; the planning and building of Chernobyl; the accident; attempts to remediate the situation after it occurred, the trial of the operators who were blamed for the disaster; and other aspects of the aftermath. The book reads in part as narrative history, but also a terrifying account of an event which could easily be repeated today.The plan to build Chernobyl was hatched in February 1970 as a means of catching up to the west and meet Soviet electricity needs. The Soviet Union would engage in a crash program to build nuclear reactors, but the problem was that the project began during a period of economic stagnation with material and resource shortages everywhere. The reactor was to be completed by 1975 which was totally unrealistic due to the approach taken by the Soviet bureaucracy, party elites, and engineers that did not consider shortages, safety needs, and planning for possible future nuclear accidents. The result is that corners were cut in terms of material, training, design flaws, “cooking the books,” and the stubborn nature of the Soviet bureaucracy in charge of construction. As Higginbotham discusses this aspect of the project, he provides the reader an interesting history of the development of radiation, nuclear development, and their affects on people and society. The author’s approach to complex scientific information and jargon is such that it is very easy to understand for the lay reader as he describes how reactors are supposed to be constructed.According to Higginbotham there were design flaws dealing with a high-power channel reactor labeled RMBK. These flaws would dog designers who would pay little attention to test results because of pressure from the Communist Party and the bureaucracy that flowed from it. This made disaster possible because no one knew how the reactor would react in case of an accident. The reactors colossal size made start up and shut down the most demanding and treacherous stages of RMBK operation. The author follows RMBK’s development and its flaws as it went into production, particularly the AZ-5 emergency protection system whose design took too long to respond in an emergency which came home to roost on April 25, 1986.  A similar plant in Leningrad experienced an accident on November 11, 1975 resulting in the release of radiation into the atmosphere over the Gulf of Finland. However, Sredmash, the Soviet agency in charge of production and construction of nuclear reactors covered up the investigative findings of design flaws related to the accident. On September 9, 1982 there was a partial meltdown at Unit 1 at Chernobyl which took eight months to repair, but the KGB instituted a gag order, and the following year a similar accident took place in a Lithuanian reactor and one in Armenia. But the world knew nothing of these accidents. Further exacerbating Soviet nuclear reactor building was the shoddy workmanship that plagued Soviet industry in general, and that carried over to the construction of Chernobyl.  A major problem that arose once Reactor #4 at Chernobyl exploded is that many of those in charge were unprepared to deal with what occurred and succumbed to wishful thinking and self-delusion in approaching how to deal with what had transpired. Higginbotham describes in detail the lethargic Soviet bureaucracy and their response to disaster. Soviet Prime Minister Mikhail Gorbachev was not notified as to what had occurred until the afternoon of April 26, 1986. The author narrates the debates inside the Commission that was set up to oversee the crisis. He relates the personalities involved and their debates on how to respond and their final decision making, many of which were out of some sort of fantasy. An excellent example apart from how to cool the reactor was whether they should evacuate the city of Pripyat and its 50,000 residents who were in danger of radiation exposure which took until April 27th to accomplish. As the radioactive cloud blew over Scandinavia, Swedish, Finish, and Danish diplomats lodged complaints to Moscow once it was realized where the radiation originated resulting in the Soviet government stonewalling. It would take until April 28th at 8:00pm for Moscow to come clean and announce that “an accident had taken place at the Chernobyl nuclear power plant.…One of the atomic reactors has been damaged.” Soviet citizens were used to this type of response as it was a continuation of the way the state had covered industrial accidents for decades.Higginbotham descriptions of helicopter pilots flying low dumping sand and boron on the reactor are harrowing. The author’s approach as he carefully describes how officials, academics, scientists, fire fighters, guards, and others and what they went through is chilling, especially as he brings the reader to Hospital #6 in Moscow created to treat victims of nuclear accidents and war. The ultimate fear was the “China Syndrome,” the further devastation that would occur if the reactor’s foundation exploded and nuclear material leaked into the earth. Even though Moscow TV announced on May 11, 1986 that the primary threat of explosion was over, scientists remained skeptical.The Central Committee of the Politburo decided against Gorbachev’s new policy of Glasnost and followed the traditional approach and blamed “bourgeois falsification….propaganda and inventions” as its immediate reaction, in addition to dishonesty and declining help from the west. This approach would backfire in terms of containing the accident but also hindering Gorbachev’s hope of nuclear disarmament talks with the United States because how could one negotiate with someone who was so untrustworthy.Higginbotham spends a great deal of time describing what the victims of the disaster experienced. He follows the medical care that victims received and for far too many their ultimate deaths. He recounts the bravery of so many who fought to contain the toxic results of the explosion, and countless men who returned to build the sarcophagus that was designed to seal reactor #4 for at least a hundred years. The narrative of how the newly created refugees, numbering over 116,000 from the exclusion zone is told with sensitivity and insight into their future plight. The scapegoating that dominated the investigation by Soviet authorities was appalling as was the propaganda machine that worked overtime to find blame and paint the accident in the best light as possible. The stories are often poignant and provide a true picture of what can happen on a personal and societal level from a nuclear disaster.Perhaps one of the most destructive results of Chernobyl was the beginning of the end of the Soviet Union. Gorbachev realized that even his own nuclear bureaucracy was rotten to the “core” and as was most of the Soviet state. The launching of perestroika opened debate among Soviet citizens that had been dormant, but slowly the issues of Afghanistan, drug addiction, the abortion epidemic, and the horrors of Stalinism emerged. The Russian people began to realize that they had been lied to for decades and as Higginbotham successfully argues they “faced the realization that their leaders were corrupt and that the Communist dream was a sham.”If wonders if a major nuclear accident could occur in the future remind yourself of Fukushima. In 2011, the Tokyo Electric Power Company’s nuclear plant underwent a process identical to Chernobyl; the loss of coolant that provoked a meltdown. As to what remains of Chernobyl itself, it is part of an “exclusion zone” of 1,000 square miles, a radioactive Eden for new wildlife and vegetation. Higginbotham has done the public a favor by exposing the events of April-May 1986 and give us pause as to how we should approach nuclear power in the future."
157,1501134612,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3357765-jimmy,5,"I have long been fascinated with Russia. Russian dissenters have long been my heroes going all the way back to Alexander Solzhenitsyn up to Pussy Riot and Garry Kasparov. It feels like Russia has an inferiority complex. The government is always trying to look bigger and stronger than they really are. Thus the arms buildups, the Olympic obsession, the meddling. In the case of Chernobyl, it was the cover ups, the refusal to admit mistakes, the effort to make the reactor bigger than anything else no matter how many corners had to be cut. As Higginbotham said, ""Lies and deception were endemic to the system, trafficked in both directions along the chain of management: those lower down passed up reports to their superiors packed with falsified statistics and inflated estimates, of unmet goals triumphantly reached, unfulfilled quotas heroically exceeded. To protect his own position, at every stage, relayed the lies upward or compounded them."" (15) ""Seated at the top of a teetering pyramid of falsehood, poring over reams of figures that had little basis in reality, were the economic mandarins of the State General Planning Committee--Gosplan--in Moscow."" (15) It worries me that Trump and his climate change deniers are setting up something of the same situation here in the US. Facts are not important in this administration. And scientific facts are even less important to the Trumpites. "". . . the plans called for fireproof cables, but when none could be found, the builders simply did the best they could."" (20) ""When the ministry of energy in Moscow learned that the roof of the plant's turbine hall had been covered with highly flammable bitumen, they ordered him to replace it. But the flame-retardent material . . . was not even being manufactured in the USSR, so the Ministry granted Brukhanov an exception, and the bitumen remained."" (20) But when they ordered him to build an ""olympic-sized swimming pool,"" he had to ""hoodwink the state bank"" to build it. He had no choice but to obey the order. Considering all of these facts, it makes me wonder if Chernobyl is the best way to look at nuclear power. The fault lies more with the communist system and its lack of regulatory power. People always think of communist systems as having too many regulations. In reality, communism has few regulations because it is all about the power at the top, like with Trump. The goal was to build ""increasingly gigantic stations throughout the western territories of the Union. By the end of the century, Moscow intended Chernobyl to be one part of a dense network of atomic power megacomplexes."" (20) In spite of ""alarming building faults,"" the work kept on. On pages 62 to 63, the designers saw ""no need to prepare for such a calamity"" in reference to the worst possible scenarios. All warnings about the dangers were ignored. Former Chernobyl chief engineer Nikolai Steinberg said that the origins of the disaster lay in a combination of ""scientific, technological, socioeconomic, and human factors"" unique to the USSR. (347) The Soviet Union ""lacked even rudimentary safety practices."" They ""relied upon its operators to behave with robotic precision night after night."" They were under ""constant pressure to beat deadlines."" All of this made ""disregard for the letter of the regulations almost inevitable."" The deceased operators of Control Room Number Four ""had brought the reactor into an unstable condition, but only on account of the acute pressure they felt to complete the test on the turbine."" (347) ""Some environmentalists argued that humanity could not afford to turn its back on the promise and terrors of the peaceful atom. The global need for electricity was increasing exponentially: humanity was predicted to double the amount of energy it used by 2050. Despite the growing certainty that burning fossil fuels was the cause of devastating climate change--making the stabilization of carbon emissions imperative--coal remained the most widely used source of energy in the world. The fine particulates from fossil fuel plants in the United States killed more than thirteen thousand people a year; worldwide, three million people died annually as a result of air pollution released by coal- and oil-fueled power stations. Even to begin to head off climate change over the coming thirty-five years would have to be clean, yet neither wind, solar, hydroelectric, nor geothermal power--nor any combination of them--had the potential to bridge the gap."" (357 to 358) ""And at last, more than seventy years after the technology's inception, engineers were finally developing reactors with design priorities that lay not in making bombs but in generating electricity. In principle, these fourth-generation reactors would be cheaper, safer, smaller, more efficient, and less poisonous than their predecessors and could yet prove to be the technology that saves the world."" (358) There is a ""liquid fluoride thorium reactor (LFTR)"" developed at Tennessee's Oak Ridge National Laboratory that is fueled by ""thorium. More plentiful and far harder to process into bomb-making material than uranium, thorium also burns more efficiently in a reactor and could produce less hazardous radioactive waste with half-lives of hundreds, not tens of thousands, of years. . . . It does not require a massive containment building to guard against loss-of-coolant accidents or explosions and can be constructed on such a compact scale that every steel mill or small town could have its own microreactor tucked away underground."" (358) ""In 2015, Bill Gates had begun funding research projects similar to these fourth-generation reactors in a quest to create a carbon-neutral power source for the future. By then, the Chinese government had already set seven hundred scientists on a crash program to build the world's first industrial thorium reactor as part of a war on pollution. 'The problem of coal has become clear,' the engineering director of the project said. 'Nuclear power provides the only solution.'"" (358) I was selective in my quotes. The question now is, Must we turn to nuclear power as a last resort to get out of the mess of climate change? I would be interested in your responses. "

It handles an amazingly complicated subject and history, and a massive cast of Soviet names, and somehow keeps it all clear even for non-scientist reader. If you're too young to remember Chernobyl, read this (and watch the HBO miniseries). If you are old enough to remember Chernobyl (and perhaps even Three Mile Island), read this anyway. It's frightening, compelling, brilliant, and vital as we try to ward off climate change and turn to energy sources other than fossil fuels. "

Senior Lieutenant Alexander Logachev loved radiation the way other men loved their wives. Tall and good-looking, twenty-six years old, with close-cropped dark hair and ice-blue eyes, Logachev had joined the Soviet army when he was still a boy. They had trained him well. The instructors from the military academy outside Moscow taught him with lethal poisons and unshielded radiation. He traveled to the testing grounds of Semipalatinsk in Kazakhstan, and to the desolte East Urals Trace, where the fallout from a clandestine radioactive accident still poisoned the landscape; eventually, Logachev’s training took him even to the remote and forbidden islands of Novaya Zemlya, high in the Arctic Circle and ground zero for the detonation of the terrible Tsar Bomba, the largest thermonuclear device in history.
Although I haven’t been born at the time of the Chernobyl disaster, the events of that time have fascinated me for years. This is probable also due to the fact that my parents, who were living in Poland during the catastrophe, were directly affected by the radioactive cloud. I have seen nearly every documentary that exists and I also found the HBO miniseries amazing! So amazing that every day I look skeptically in the direction of the nuclear power plant that stands here around the corner. So, it was clear that I would read this book the moment I heard about it for the first time. And even if, unfortunately, I had little time to read due to university and private courses, in the end it was absolutely worth! __________________________________________In the book, first there are some maps and overviews showing, among other things, Russia and the location of Pripyat and the construction of Unit Four of the Chernobyl Nuclear Plant (Tschernobylska AES im. W. I. Lenina). This is followed by a list of key persons and their function within the catastrophy. Then, the “story” begins.Journalist Higginbotham describes his incredibly well-researched information as far as possible in chronological order, sometimes even to the nearest second. It starts before the catastrophe and provides information on how the nuclear industry has built up in the USSR, how atomgrad* Pripyat was formed and how the nuclear power plant came online, years before the big mistake that was due to humane and machine failures.Within the text numerous, sometimes very scientific information, can be found – for example, how radiation works or that men radiate more than women due to their higher muslce mass. For me, there were actually some new things that I did not know before!In the further process, Higginbotham describes the events from the point of view of the varius persons: Director Brukhanov, scientist Legassov or the firefighters, who were unsuspecting at the scene and sealed their death with their intervention, but prevented a major catastrophe. Personally, this chapter has hit me the most, as I do not want to imagine how they must have felt in this situation.After detailed descriptions of the events at the plant and politics, which among other things led to the collapse of the Soviet Union, Higginbotham gives an insight into the current situation in the Ukraine: Among other things, he conducted interviews with people who vere involved in the disaster and he visits the ghost town of Pripyat. Attached are a glossary with all the important technical terms in the field of nuclear energy and images of the people and places mentioneds in the book. __________________________________________Even though the book requires a lot of concentration and you need a little more time to understand everything, it was absolutely worth to read this book! I would recommend it to anyone – whether he has already experienced the disaster or was born later. The topic is more present after the accident in Japan and should be known to everyone. For those who, like me, are interested in the events during that time, the book is an absolute must have!"

Ma!)Boom. Kablewey. You pick. Things burn. 51,300 comrades 💤 (Ma!) in their beds. It was only a 2 minute flight from Reactor 4 to Pripyat. Maybe 10 minutes by car. The radioactive dust took the car. MA!Are you telling this story, Dorothy? The explosion was mostly vertical, but the damage? The damage was horizontal, soaring on winded wings as far as Sweden and that’s when sh*t really got real - don’t 🙄 at your mother, Dorothy Zbornak! Where do you think Stan got his weirdness?So Gorbachev’s all open door and honesty’s the best policy - well, how do you like them dosimeters? Open door policy, my foot! That’s how some cities knew what happened! They took radioactive readings off the sandals of a lady who just traveled to Pripyat. Gorby didn’t tell them. It was the shoes!Back to my story: So we got bureaucrats on the ground, fires blazing in the central core, 1,200 Kievan buses evac’ing the city and no clue how to stop this giant wildebeest from exploding again, China Syndrome style. Meanwhile: The winds have blown ... now we gotta evac another 116k people in the newly designated “Exclusion Zone” (though later they’d rename it the “Nuclear Reservation” like that helps), but the story of Chernobyl doesn’t stop there! Nope...✋ Now we gotta get Reactors 1-3...back...online?? Isn’t that the reason we’re gonna throw 750,000 bio robots at this sucker to begin with?? Not sure what you call *waves hand dramatically* all this, then. Oh right, “nuclear meltdowns don’t happen in the Soviet Union” (Stellan Skarsgard better get an Emmy for that brilliantly executed meltdown!).So here we are, 30 ish years later (ironic that’s the “official” death toll = 31 souls), two sarcophagi, 800 radioactive waste dumps, 4700 km squared of inhabitable land, hu HUM huh of ARS victims (it’s classified. So, of course, they told me, but I’m Sophia Petrillo! I keep my word! I’ll write it down, you throw it in the fireplace!) and a city built specifically to support the wildebeest dies in 16 years. Don’t worry though, they moved everyone to Slavutych, another atomgrad, and hey, the world makes sense again!That’s how we tell stories in Sicily! Obviously, loved this one! It is a little dry, but as you can see, it’s hard to write without judgement. Higginbotham does just the facts, no sass and still tells the story in a way that’s both completely understandable and emotionally harrowing all at the same time. Very well done!"
161,1501134612,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9981052-nicholereadswithcats,5,Very informative. Some of the scientific information was a little over my head but I enjoyed the mix between facts and personal experience. Shocking the lengths which were taken to attempt to cover up what happened. Loved the pictures at the end.
162,1501134612,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3670585-erin-cataldi,3,"This book has all the info you never knew you needed on Chernobyl - down to the last technical detail. I listened to this rather than reading it and was soon bogged down by the sheer amount of physics detailed; at times I found myself struggling to pay attention. That being said, this was still a fascinating detailed look on the events that caused the accidents and the actions taken afterward. It was a perfect storm of horrible events and it really will get your heart racing as the author gives you a near minute by minute account. Unsettling at moments, and overly technical; this insanely well researched guide is not for the casual reader. This book is heavy; but will change the way you think about Chernobyl forever! "
163,1501134612,http://goodreads.com/user/show/55342889-elizabethanne-olsen,5,Just. Fucking. Fantastic. The descriptions of the destruction seemed so surreal like it was a fictional dystopian novel. So difficult to grasp the enormity of this as a real event. The horrific descriptions of ailments to the ones who suffered exposure was intense and necessary. Everyone should real this book. Everyone. 
164,1501134612,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2168708-marta,5,"Astonishing, thrillingly written, with a lot of new information, including the causes of the accident. I have bought this on audio and listened to it; but I missed so much information that I am listening to it again. It is thrilling the second time as well, and this time I can put the stories of the people more into context. My family was also interested so I bought a print copy as well. I am using it to look up names, and there are pictures as well. I stopped listening second time about halfway through - the pandemic happened and I am tired of bad news. This is a thrilling telling of a cautionary tale about the dangers of arrogance dealing with the forces of nature. The minimizing, denials, trying to cover it up, confused scrambling to stall an even bigger disaster - all echo in the reaction of the US government to the pandemic in the last weeks/months. The arrogance and the wishful thinking that made the disaster so much worse are just as present now. Leaders need to read history - and we elected one that expressly disdains science, reading, and history. This is of course wholly unfair to the people in the Chernobyl catastrophe. There was a lot of heroism, and some ofticials showed remarkable leadership. Which is why I felt most enraged when those operators who gave their lives willingly and performed heroics to save the reactor in the first hours of the disaster, were scapegoated. These people were heroes (well, some, I have no sympathy for plant director Brukhanov), and they were tried as criminals, some declared as such posthumously. The world was told at the time that the accident was caused by careless operators who conducted a test and disabled the safety systems. But in reality, the RBMK reactor had multiple design flaws and the accident was waiting to happen. One of those was in the emergency shutdown. When the Chernobyl operators realized they had trouble, they initiated a shutdown by dropping all safety rods - but instead of shutting down, the reactor went critical - because of the rods were graphite-tipped! The designers have discovered this flaw years before, but they thought it was unlikely to happen. (Arrogance and negligence). It was only an issue if most control rods were withdrawn - which was the case at Chernobyl, due to the other major flaw of the reactor, the positive void coefficient (Google it). This basically made it unsafe to operate the reactor at low power levels, which the designers also discovered, but all they did was sent a new operating manual, without explaining why this was important. Experienced operators did learn that the reactor got unstable at lower power levels, from experience, but did not know that it could be a safety risk. So when the manager of the tests wanted to perform it at low power levels, one protested - but he was overruled and threatened of being fired. Presumably the manager wanted to be safer... and thus the reactor went to overdrive with the lower powerlevel, so they withdrew the rods - then tried to shut down. Boom.All this has been previously detected as a risk, and ignored. Then came the fallout.Read this - but maybe not during a pandemic."
165,1501134612,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8413178-liam,5,"I, like everybody else, have been entranced by HBO's Chernobyl. Watching it, I realised how little I really knew about the disaster despite having spent untold hours wandering around in the fictional version of the Zone in the STALKER games.Much like most people I imagine, I was kind of astounded by how huge a disaster it actually was, and how close it came to being so much worse. I kind of ran under the assumption that the HBO show was dramatised to a certain extent, because how could I have possibly not heard that there was a distinct possibility that Reactor 4 would explode again with the force of several atomic bombs? - but no, this actually occurred.Higginbotham's writing is detached, which somehow makes it all the more impactful - dry descriptions of Pripyat firefighters experiencing 'violent diarrhea' in the days following the initial explosion, which was determined to be 'their intestines liquefying' is one example I'm going to have trouble forgetting.As a companion to the show, Midnight in Chernobyl was excellent. I didn't plan it out that way, but events in the show as I watched it every few nights kind of lined up to the events in the book as I listened to it on my way to and from work, expanding and providing further detail, or refuting the more dramatised parts of the show. Legasov for example is portrayed a lot more heroic in the show, routinely martyring himself before the Communist Party for the good of all - whereas he was far more likely to toe the Party line in real life, and only repented soon before his death.Midnight in Chernobyl is a fantastic in-depth exploration of the disaster - causes and repercussions, and it has certainly sparked interest in the topic for myself. An excellently written book, very well read by Jacques Roy. Highly recommend."

If, instead, you want to know the true story read Higginbotham's fine book, which does an excellent job of not only describing in a blow-by-blow fashion the disaster and it's aftermath, but places the disaster in the broader context of Soviet society and rule. 4-stars."
167,1501134612,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5072847-will-ansbacher,5,"Well written, fast paced and unbelievable action – this would be a terrific disaster thriller if it wasn’t actually all true.Adam Higginbotham has done a simply brilliant job of researching and writing about the world’s worst nuclear disaster, with a style that’s riveting yet balanced and without hyperbole. It opens with a couple of pages describing Civil Defence responders’ panic as they first realize the extent of the radioactive horror they’d been catapulted into. From that initial adrenalin burst, the first part of the story (titled Birth of a City) goes back to the origins of nuclear power development in Russia and the founding of the atomic city of Pripyat, and is interleaved with the events surrounding the explosion of reactor #4 and the immediate after-effects. The longer part two (Death of an Empire) covers the awful radiation effects, the mainly futile clean-up attempts, the cover-ups, denials, excruciating investigations and show trials; at the same time providing insight into the breakup of the USSR. (If Chernobyl wasn’t the catalyst that led to the end of the Soviet Union, then it certainly was a major factor). The story ends with more recent developments, including interviews the author had with those involved - at least, those who still were alive after 2006.This changing focus is a really effective way of dealing with a highly complex subject that could otherwise have been quite dry. Interestingly, I thought, the structure mirrors radiation poisoning itself: the initial terrifying experience of acute exposure and a short period of apparent recovery, but followed by the much longer and agonizing progress of an array of worsening symptoms. I won’t go into the story itself, (this  NY Times review is a great summary). But I was struck by a few recurrent themes:One, the cynical way disasters were suppressed so nobody could ever learn from previous mistakes;Two, the culture of craven compliance that prevented anyone from speaking out about known problems; (Together, these made not only the reactor explosion inevitable but the aftermath about as bad as it could possibly be)Three, the casual attitudes – bordering on macho defiance - to radiation dangers;And four, the sheer resilience of the Russian and Ukrainian people – both workers at the plant and the general population - in the face of all the horrors that were thrown at them. (Though these last two are as much the result of the authorities ruthlessly suppressing information) A ton of authoritative information has become available over the last 30 years, and Higginbotham seems to have read it all - there are 100 pages of end notes alone. However in order not to interrupt the flow he wisely left all the cross-referencing to the end, where a few relevant words in each note point to the text. There is also an extensive bibliography and a short but useful cast of characters ... Ligachev? Logachev? Legasov? ... which I found I had to flip back to often. There is still much we don’t know about Chernobyl, but to understand the disaster and what it means, I don’t think you could do better than this book. It isn’t perfect of course; Higginbotham didn’t explain some of the radiation physics or its effects on humans too well, but for this non-technical account it’s more than good enough."
168,1501134612,http://goodreads.com/user/show/32091911-sallie-dunn,4,"This was an excellent and thoroughly researched telling of the nuclear disaster that happened in Chernobyl in 1986. Despite the scientific leanings (some of which was over my head) it was immensely readable account of the event. There was background relating to the construction of the nuclear reactor and a minute by minute, hour by hour account of the disaster itself as it unfolded on April 26, 1986. Then the aftermath, the world-wide scale of international proportions, the denial, the cover-up, the prosecution and trials that followed were riveting reading. If you’re in the mood for some serious non-fiction, this is it! Four stars from me. "

170,1501134612,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11701608-barbara,5,"10+stars: Oh My Dear Lord, this novel will scare the beejesus out of you. Journalist Adam Higgnbothem has written an amazing documentary of the 1986 catastrophe at the Chernobyl nuclear plant in the USSR. I listened to the audible production that is narrated by Jacques Roy. At the beginning, Roy lists all the important characters in this story. Since I listened to it, I was at a disadvantage keeping all the players straight in my head. If one wants to truly understand the politics, lies, radiation illnesses, etc, that involved each character, one should read the novel. As an American listener, all those Russian names were difficult to keep in my mind.That said, it is an amazing listen. Just getting the timeline of events, the mistakes, the horror of the disaster while listening is enough for me. This tragedy was a culmination of mistakes. Although the USSR wanted to lay blame on separate individuals, Higgenbothem shows that is was straws, that individually wouldn’t be the blame, but added together resulted in a global tragedy. Also, it was the political pressure and the culture of Russia at that time that lead to the explosion. Russia wanted to save face which added layers to the event that cost thousands of lives. The government secrecy magnified mistakes.Higgenbothem exposes the devastating losses and damages to humans, the landscape, and animals. Once the catastrophe made global news, he explains the collective efforts made to find solutions. Nuclear energy seems here to stay. Creating safe nuclear energy is paramount to the safety and survival of the earth. Making worker education a priority is a necessity. We must remain aware and well informed of the cost/benefit of producing nuclear energy. This is an amazing case study."
171,1501134612,http://goodreads.com/user/show/92319245-mona,4,"This is probably one of the most comprehensive books about Cherbobyl disaster. Author and his multiple researchers did a great job going through documentation, books, articles and statements. They also interviewed quite a few people who participated in described events.Book is well written and narrative is concise. Author guides a reader through basics of physics and construction necessary to understand the events properly. I specifically liked the description of research done on the reactor which were conducted few years after the disaster. I was not familiar with those findings.When it comes to shortcomings of this book - it was written by Brit living in the US and this Western point of view is very clear here. I felt the narration had lingering condescending and superior tone to it, what at points became quite annoying. I think the author did not have a good understanding of Russian culture and mentality (particularly noted during his last interview with the plant director) and he undermined the value of some heroic acts done by firefighters and soldiers after the disaster. This is not the first book I read on this topic and I think Russian and Ukrainian writers are much better in this area for obvious reasons.This is a great book for Westerners who know nothing or close to nothing about Charnobyl disaster and would like to have a general overview. Kinda ""all you can eat""..... but not a white cloth."

''But when I went back to Ukraine, they started telling me about people who had died. Was it due to radiation? I don't know. I don't understand anything about statistics. But, when my friends ask me about it, I tell them: the less you think about it, the longer you'll live.''Midnight in Chernobyl autora Adama Higginbothama enciklopedijski je uvid u najveću nuklearnu katastrofu koja se dogodila u Černobilju, u Ukrajini 26.aprila 1986. godine.Priča o najvećoj nesreći jedne države, grada, političkog i državnog uređenja, počinje u trenutku kada se postavljaju temelji za građenje ovog nukelarnog postrojenja 1970. godine i rađanja grada u kome su živjeli ljudi zaposleni na izgradnji, kao i radnici predviđeni da rade u novootvorenoj centrali.U jeku hladnog rata Sovjetski savez se svim silama trudio da ukroti atom, da svijetu podari sliku o naučnim dostignućima bez premca, a ljudi su uživali u plodovima svog rada, bezbrižni, poletni i vjerni državi koja im je stvorila atomski grad Pripjat, obezbjedila udobnost sadašnjosti i velike planove za budućnost.Ali sovjetski naučnici koji su radili pod okriljem jednog zatvorenog i ambicioznog sistema, zatvarali su oči pred bilo kakvim greškama na koje su upozoravani prilikom izrade nuklearnih reaktora RBMK-1000 (koji je i eksplodirao u Černobilju), sve mane koje su nesumnjivo postojale držane su u strogoj tajnosti, a sve, naizgled, male stvari dovele su do katastrofe koja je, prema mnogima, dovela i do raspada SSSR-a.Autor se kroz brojne izvore ovim događajem bavio sa naučnog, političkog, socijalnog i ljudskog aspekta, hirurški precizno kombinujući dešavanja u Černobilju sa sudbinama stanovnika Pripjata, koji nesvjesni onoga što ih je snašlo odlaze iz svojih domova, dok radijacija bjesomučno prekriva kvadratne kilometre gradova, tokove rijeka, dječije igračke, kućne ljubimce i tijela svih koji su učestvovali u saniranju posljedica eksplozije.Usljed loše izrađenog reaktora, kojim su upravljali ambiciozni i često nestručni ljudi, zaslijepljeni egom i grandioznošću, 26.aprila 1986. godine desio se početak kraja jednog doba, zapečanjen sudbinama nekih običnih ljudi koji su na poziv domovine golim rukama uklanjali radioaktivni materijal, koji su u sobama Bolnice broj šest ostavljali svoje živote, koji su gradili sarkofag iznad uništenog reaktora u uslovima visoke radijacije kobne po ljudsko zdravlje.A put kojim se došlo do toga, kao i njegove posljedice Adam Higginbotham predstavio je na opširan, zanimljiv i stručan način, te ostavio još jedno važno svjedočanstvo o ovom događaju.P.S. Ponovo preporučujem da pogledate HBO mini seriju Chernobyl, s obzirom da je nakon gledanja mnogo lakše shvatiti suštinu ove knjige, kao i komplikovane opise načina rada nuklearnog reaktora.''Amid the chaos of the collapsing empire, most of the men and women who had fought the Battle of Chernobyl were forgotten - the final defenders of a nation that had seemingly vanished overnight.''"
177,1501134612,http://goodreads.com/user/show/684704-morgan,5,"It took fourteen days to read, but I was riveted and fascinated the entire time. I am too young to remember the Chernobyl melt down when the event took place in 1986, but I'm certain it's an event that contributed to my very vague, yet frightening notions of the war grown ups referred to as Cold.Later in life, I discovered pictures of Pripyat -an abandoned and radioactive city. These images captivated and haunted me. Yet, why did Chernobyl really melt down, and could other nuclear power plants face such demise? (An uneasy question for someone who heard a nuclear power plant's monthly test sirens while sitting in her high school classes.)This book delivered a lot of information - from how nuclear fission takes place, to who were the people on the ground before, during, and after the explosions in 1986. For me, the science bits were just enough - explained with clarity, yet never cumbersome or off-putting. (I'm language oriented, so science text books are off-putting for me personally.) But, the heart of this book is the people you meet. The firemen, the young nuclear engineers, an architect mapping out an ideal city, people loyal (albeit, questionably) to their county and the beliefs it strived to uphold. Midnight in Chernobyl portrayed a nuclear power plant, its atomgard, and its people with such distinction, that it was hard to shake any of these elements even when the book was closed. That childhood fear of the Cold War and nuclear weapons crept into my dreams, waking me with fears of radiation exposure and an urgency to find my children. A fleeting moment later, and my comfortable reality reasserted itself; but I wanted to know more, to understand more about an era in history - and about our future.It's quite a read. I'll eagerly offer it up to other readers as a worthy title. **(I already have - my apologies to those who came to my family's cook-out over the weekend who listened to me chatter on about a nuclear meltdown, when all they wanted to do was enjoy some pulled pork and spare ribs. I really do try to keep the overzealous librarian in me at bay during large social events, but alas, this title was just too good.)"

I started it on a Thursday and finished it over the weekend. It is an indictment of a flawed system of government. I watched the Chernobyl mini-series several times. Had not my son given this book to me as a birthday present, I probably wouldn’t have read it but I’m glad I did. A miniseries cannot delve into the details and provide all the interesting backstories and other essential information intrinsic to this story. The reactor was of a flawed design. This disaster was bound to happen sooner or later. Previous accidents had been swept under the rug. Soviet prestige was at stake and this was more important than the safety of the people or the planet. There was no oversight. In fact on page 323, Acadamician Valery Legasov realized “…the true scope of the decay at the heart of the [Soviet] nuclear state: The culture of secrecy and complacency, the arrogance and negligence and the shoddy standards of design and construction.”  On page 327 the author explains that the explosion was the last straw of a failing system:The most destructive forces unleashed by the explosion of Reactor Number Four were not radiological but political and economic. The cloud of radiation that spread out across Europe, making the catastrophe impossible to conceal had forced the touted openness of Gorbachev’s glasnost on even the most reluctant conservatives in the Politburo. Even the nuclear bureaucracy had been undermined by secrecy, incompetence, and stagnation convinced him that the entire state was rotten. Perestroika was launched in a desperate bid to save the Socialist experiment before it was too late. But all this did was to promote discussion on other censored topics such as drug addiction, abortion, Afghan war, and the horrors of Stalinism.Thus the author argues, the Chernobyl disaster brought down an empire. It is a fascinating read."

What's most terrifying is how much the chances of this were known inside the former Soviet Union and covered up for years (along with previous accidents). The heroism of many Russians is astounding in dealing with this crisis, as is the callousness of others. A warning for the nuclear energy industry and all of us, about how quickly this technology can spiral out of control without transparency, honesty, readiness for all emergencies, and even with all proper planning - how quickly we can destroy ourselves and our environment due to simple human error and pride. Incredibly well-reported and thorough, and highly recommended."
180,1501134612,http://goodreads.com/user/show/34570157-jenny-jo-weir,4,Wow! This one was a hard read. The whole time I'm thinking about all that radiation and the effects of the explosion. The amount of people affected by this and the cost of this unfortunate event were unprecedented. You can't help but feel bad fro all the people involved and for all the victims. It's something that sticks with you. 
181,1501134612,http://goodreads.com/user/show/38617426-juli,4,"Interest in the Chernobyl nuclear disaster has spiked since the award winning HBO mini-series aired. I watched the show and listened to HBO's accompanying podcast and several other podcast episodes on the accident and its aftermath. Several of the podcasts mentioned this book, so I secured a spot on the library's wait list for the audiobook. I'm glad I did! This book is excellent!Higginbotham outlines the buildup of the soviet power grid and nuclear technology. Along the way there were accidents, cost cutting measures that had disastrous effects, mismanagement, poor training and flawed maintenance. All the mistakes culminated in the explosion at Chernobyl on April 25, 1986.Higginbotham gives details about the people involved, the plant itself, the history of Soviet nuclear power, the accident, the evacuation of Pripyat, and the continuing aftermath of the accident. It's a very interesting, and concerning, story. Many countries have nuclear power plants now. It's an awesome way to generate electricity, unless there is an accident. In recent years, the Fukushima accident shows that an earthquake or other natural event can cause modern nuclear plants to become quite dangerous. But with mismanagement, bad maintenance, lackluster employee training and shoddy parts/construction, any nuclear plant can be potentially dangerous. With more countries around the world turning to nuclear power, the chances of an accident increase.....I remember news reports in 1986 about the event. I can remember initial reports stating that it was known there had been some sort of nuclear event in the Soviet Union but scientists were not sure what had happened and no information was being released by USSR officials. When the full truth came out, it was horrifying. An entire city evacuated. Firemen and emergency response personnel dying. The struggle to prevent a melt-down. 33 years later, many are still interested in the accident and the lasting damage it caused. Pripyat is becoming a tourist attraction even. Yikes! I can think of much better vacation sites than one that is completely irradiated. Pripyat, and the surrounding region, will be not be safely habitable for more than 20,000 years.Nuclear power is safe when handled responsibly by properly trained people. Most plants operating in the modern world are quite safe, and managed/maintained properly. But, a nuclear power plant can be potentially deadly if proper safety protocols are not strictly adhered to and the potential effects of natural disasters and other catastrophes are not properly taken into consideration. I hope it is a very, very long time -- or never -- that our planet ends up with another uninhabitable, radiation soaked region from a nuclear accident. The effects are long lasting, and far reaching.Great book! Lots of highly researched information presented in an interesting manner. The audio book is about 14 hours long and narrated by Jacques Roy. Roy reads at a steady pace. His voice is easily understandable. Very enjoyable listening experience!"
182,1501134612,http://goodreads.com/user/show/352711-leftbanker,5,"I began this book out of desperation from the cliff-hanger of episode 2 of Chernobyl on HBO, one of the best TV dramas I’ve ever watched. Like the series, the pacing and tone of this account reads like the best of thrillers and I literally couldn’t put it down. I’m old enough to have vivid recollections of the event as it was unfolding. My USAF unit stationed in Athens, Greece, received intelligence on the crisis well ahead of the local news. We knew that it was a nuclear accident well before the Soviets admitted to this fact, but what we didn’t know was just how close the world was to a bigger, unspeakable disaster. This news really wasn’t available for years after the events of April 1986. The world had moved on. I had all but forgotten Chernobyl until this brilliant series came over the horizon. A viewer of the series wrote, “The tragedy will live forever because of this haunting masterpiece, what a brilliant creative achievement.” I could say the same for this book. Informative, objective, and written with a breath-taking pace, I couldn’t recommend it more highly to anyone looking to become better informed on the events of Chernobyl, both when it happened, and in the years since.It’s hard to laugh when you’re reading in the fetal position, but this part struck me as the epitome of gallows humor. One nuclear scientist working on cleaning up the disaster gives safety advice to another nuclear scientist just arriving, “If you smell ozone, run!”The big surprise is that the death toll wasn’t tens of times greater than the reality. Of course, we may never know the true results of the accident as Soviet record keeping tended to down-play cancer deaths which may have been related to Chernobyl.The most terrifying aspect of all is to consider how our leaders today would deal with a disaster on this order. Even the monumentally corrupt Soviets of that era had some highly intelligent, rational people among them, which is more than you can say of Putin and Trump, and their flunkies. Trump prevaricates on matters of little or no importance; imagine his response on this sort of travesty."
183,1501134612,http://goodreads.com/user/show/714583-anita-pomerantz,3,"This book is sooo highly rated and was listed as ""best non-fiction"" by numerous sources in 2019. All I have to say is I wish I read Voices from Chernobyl: The Oral History of a Nuclear Disaster instead. This book was just boring unless you like reading a lot about engineering and the technical structure of power plants and buildings. In addition, there are a zillion Russian names, and even with Kindle X-Ray and a guide to who was who, I struggled because the people just were not brought to life for me.This is reporting. It's very strong reporting, and it unveils the type of cover-up that makes you worried about government and implies that conspiracy theories can be true. The story is important. I just did not find it interesting because of the absolute overload of details, many of which were beyond my understanding or ability to picture. Maybe my timing in picking up this one was just way off . . .as we are in the middle of a crisis ourselves, my concentration is pretty shot. So, judge this one by the reviews of others. I just can barely bring myself to give it 3 stars. "
184,1501134612,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5349403-carolyn,4,"The author has written an impressive, comprehensive book of historical importance. It brings to light events surrounding the Chernobyl catastrophe of 1986 which may be unknown to many in the Western world, and even to the Russian people. The author presents a crash course in nuclear physics and energy, simplified as much as possible. This may present difficulties for the average reader without some background knowledge. I thought the human factor surrounding the disaster to be interesting and appreciated that the book included a summary list of the Cast of Characters and their positions and involvement with Chernobyl. The book emphasized the social/political Cold War mentality, economic factors, technical failures, the cut-throat ambition of the politicians and their secrecy which led to public complacency or wild rumours. Reaction time was slow due to uncertainty and arguments about the best course of action. I feel this is the definitive book of situations leading up to the disaster, what happened when Reactor 4 malfunctioned causing a huge surge of radiation, and its aftermath. The history is impeccable and thoroughly researched and stands as a sample for other writers of historical events and will be the definitive book on Chernobyl.The Chernobyl atomic complex was built to produce cheap electricity for a vast surrounded area, and to establish the Soviet Union ’s predominance in nuclear power. The disaster occurred in Reactor #4 on April 26, 1986. A model town, Pripyat, was built in the wilderness area close to the Nuclear Plant to house tens of thousands of workers and their families. From rough, cold shacks inhabited by the early builders, it grew into an impressive town with 3 schools, 35 playgrounds, 3 swimming pools, a library, sports facility and shopping center. Groceries and goods in the stores were more varied and abundant than in cities of origin of most of the workers. No expense was spared in planting trees and importing flowering shrubs to enhance the blocks of apartments. The nuclear accident which occurred resulted in a coverup where plant workers and women and children were not aware of the danger to their lives and health from nuclear fallout.there were cultural and political reasons contributing to lack of safety. Poor building design, shoddy materials, forced deadlines for builders and plant workers to meet, incompetent and negligent staff without knowledge of dangers they faced. There had been a smaller explosion at another plant and plenty of malfunctions but they were ignorant of possible critical problems. After the reactor imploded and seemed to be going into meltdown, releasing radiation far and wide, members of the emergency response team who did know the peril were either forced to stop the leak or went in willingly out of patriotic duty.  Following the disaster, people of Pripyat went about their lives ignorant of dangers from radioactive fallout. During this time a gathering of academics, Generals and politicians argued about the course they needed to take but were mainly concerned with secrecy. Finally, it was decided to evacuate the town of 51,000 people but leaving behind 4,000 essential service workers. People being evacuated were led to believe that they would only be away from home a couple of days and to bring only essentials for a short stay. Immediately after the explosion, there were two deaths of reactor workers.28 died soon of acute radiation sickness.. Evacuation orders soon included 90,000 people within a 30 K radius. High radiation levels soon spread to areas distant from Chernobyl and was detected in Sweden, Belarus and Poland. By May 20, 95,000 people had been hospitalized. High levels of radioactivity had already reached the capital, Kiev. May Day celebrations were carried out in the open air. Soon over 300,000 children were ordered evacuated from Kiev, along with expectant and nursing mothers (about 1/5 of the population). Teams were hired to shoot 20,000 domestic animals left behind.  We will never know how many people died over the years from radiation-induced cancers, as doctors were pressed not to mention a possible connection. Once the danger of a meltdown had eased and the reactor was covered with a dome, it was felt necessary to lay blame. Six plant officials were put on trial resulting in prison sentences. Official statements refused to place blame on faulty building materials, reactor design flaws, or the irresponsibility and poor discipline of the plant workers present when the disaster occurred. They had been conducting a safety inspection to simulate a power failure and did not follow the procedure properly outlined on a checklist. The author emphasizes the social/political Cold War mentality. The secrecy of generals and politicians which led to wild rumours or complacency subsequently caused the people to distrust in their leaders. Economic factors due to the billions of rubles spent on evacuation, housing, pay for thousands of emergency workers, and the deactivating the reactor was a great financial loss for the country. The author feels this was a major factor contributing to the breakup of the Soviet Union Thanks to NetGalley and Simon & Schuster for an advance copy of this important book."
185,1501134612,http://goodreads.com/user/show/53179837-george,4,"This book covers the events from the construction of the plant to the fall of the Soviet Union, but unlike Serhii Plokhy he does it from the perspective of the people who were actually close enough to absorb the radiation. Mostly he focused on the scientists, workers and liquidators, who had to deal with the clean up. He focused so much on these people that at the beginning of the book there was a list of characters, as if it was a play or something. I've never seen that done with a nonfiction book before, but maybe that was just a quirk of my particular edition. Now, because I have read Chernobyl: History of a Tragedy by Serhii Plokhy I couldn't help but compare these two. Serhii Plokhy covered the construction of the plant and the causes of the explosion itself better then Adam Higginbotham, but Adam didn't just brush of the clean up process. After reading them both I find it that they are both necessary to understand this disaster, just to get all the angles.Lastly, on to the Voices of Chernobyl to see what the ordinary people had to say about this whole mess. "
186,1501134612,http://goodreads.com/user/show/17428284-steven-z,5,"March 28, 1979 was an overcast day in Woodbridge, Va. when news arrived of a nuclear accident at Three Mile Island Unit 2 reactor near Middletown, Pa. Feeling totally in the dark when it came to information about the accident, my neighbors and I gathered outside our homes and immediately began testing to see which way the winds were blowing, and should we pack up and head in the opposite direction. Living about two and a half hours from the reactor which would eventually partially melt down, we were scared. Up to that time this would be considered the greatest nuclear accident in history being unaware of the Kyshtym Disaster which was a radioactive contamination accident that occurred on September 29, 1957 at Mayak, a plutonium production site in Russia for nuclear weapons and a nuclear fuel reprocessing plant in the Soviet Union. After reading Adam Higginbotham’s new book, MIDNIGHT IN CHERNOBYL: THE UNTOLD STORY OF THE WORLD’S GREATEST NUCLEAR DISASTER, an excellent account of the explosion and meltdown at Chernobyl the evening of April 25-26, 1986 and the ramifications of that disaster, memories of that March day flashed before my eyes.Higginbotham has written the most informative and insightful description of events and analysis of the meltdown that has yet to appear. It replaces Harvard historian, Serhii Plokhy’s CHERNOBYL: A HISTORY OF A NUCLEAR CATASYTROPHE as the most comprehensive and detailed work that has been written. In dealing with events such as Chernobyl one must ask: What happened, why did it happen, and could it happen again? Higginbotham, a journalist and his research partner Taras Shumeyko interviewed numerous eyewitnesses and conducted a prodigious amount of research that included a small number of declassified documents available, and argues that the fanatical view among Soviet bureaucrats and leadership to maintain secrecy, (for example, information about what occurred at Mayak was kept from the public for thirty years) was the reason the accident was so devastating, but also not surprising that it occurred. Higginbotham recreates the disaster providing a history of Soviet nuclear development, including numerous accidents; the planning and building of Chernobyl; the accident; attempts to remediate the situation after it occurred, the trial of the operators who were blamed for the disaster; and other aspects of the aftermath. The book reads in part as narrative history, but also a terrifying account of an event which could easily be repeated today.The plan to build Chernobyl was hatched in February 1970 as a means of catching up to the west and meet Soviet electricity needs. The Soviet Union would engage in a crash program to build nuclear reactors, but the problem was that the project began during a period of economic stagnation with material and resource shortages everywhere. The reactor was to be completed by 1975 which was totally unrealistic due to the approach taken by the Soviet bureaucracy, party elites, and engineers that did not consider shortages, safety needs, and planning for possible future nuclear accidents. The result is that corners were cut in terms of material, training, design flaws, “cooking the books,” and the stubborn nature of the Soviet bureaucracy in charge of construction. As Higginbotham discusses this aspect of the project, he provides the reader an interesting history of the development of radiation, nuclear development, and their affects on people and society. The author’s approach to complex scientific information and jargon is such that it is very easy to understand for the lay reader as he describes how reactors are supposed to be constructed.According to Higginbotham there were design flaws dealing with a high-power channel reactor labeled RMBK. These flaws would dog designers who would pay little attention to test results because of pressure from the Communist Party and the bureaucracy that flowed from it. This made disaster possible because no one knew how the reactor would react in case of an accident. The reactors colossal size made start up and shut down the most demanding and treacherous stages of RMBK operation. The author follows RMBK’s development and its flaws as it went into production, particularly the AZ-5 emergency protection system whose design took too long to respond in an emergency which came home to roost on April 25, 1986.  A similar plant in Leningrad experienced an accident on November 11, 1975 resulting in the release of radiation into the atmosphere over the Gulf of Finland. However, Sredmash, the Soviet agency in charge of production and construction of nuclear reactors covered up the investigative findings of design flaws related to the accident. On September 9, 1982 there was a partial meltdown at Unit 1 at Chernobyl which took eight months to repair, but the KGB instituted a gag order, and the following year a similar accident took place in a Lithuanian reactor and one in Armenia. But the world knew nothing of these accidents. Further exacerbating Soviet nuclear reactor building was the shoddy workmanship that plagued Soviet industry in general, and that carried over to the construction of Chernobyl.  A major problem that arose once Reactor #4 at Chernobyl exploded is that many of those in charge were unprepared to deal with what occurred and succumbed to wishful thinking and self-delusion in approaching how to deal with what had transpired. Higginbotham describes in detail the lethargic Soviet bureaucracy and their response to disaster. Soviet Prime Minister Mikhail Gorbachev was not notified as to what had occurred until the afternoon of April 26, 1986. The author narrates the debates inside the Commission that was set up to oversee the crisis. He relates the personalities involved and their debates on how to respond and their final decision making, many of which were out of some sort of fantasy. An excellent example apart from how to cool the reactor was whether they should evacuate the city of Pripyat and its 50,000 residents who were in danger of radiation exposure which took until April 27th to accomplish. As the radioactive cloud blew over Scandinavia, Swedish, Finish, and Danish diplomats lodged complaints to Moscow once it was realized where the radiation originated resulting in the Soviet government stonewalling. It would take until April 28th at 8:00pm for Moscow to come clean and announce that “an accident had taken place at the Chernobyl nuclear power plant.…One of the atomic reactors has been damaged.” Soviet citizens were used to this type of response as it was a continuation of the way the state had covered industrial accidents for decades.Higginbotham descriptions of helicopter pilots flying low dumping sand and boron on the reactor are harrowing. The author’s approach as he carefully describes how officials, academics, scientists, fire fighters, guards, and others and what they went through is chilling, especially as he brings the reader to Hospital #6 in Moscow created to treat victims of nuclear accidents and war. The ultimate fear was the “China Syndrome,” the further devastation that would occur if the reactor’s foundation exploded and nuclear material leaked into the earth. Even though Moscow TV announced on May 11, 1986 that the primary threat of explosion was over, scientists remained skeptical.The Central Committee of the Politburo decided against Gorbachev’s new policy of Glasnost and followed the traditional approach and blamed “bourgeois falsification….propaganda and inventions” as its immediate reaction, in addition to dishonesty and declining help from the west. This approach would backfire in terms of containing the accident but also hindering Gorbachev’s hope of nuclear disarmament talks with the United States because how could one negotiate with someone who was so untrustworthy.Higginbotham spends a great deal of time describing what the victims of the disaster experienced. He follows the medical care that victims received and for far too many their ultimate deaths. He recounts the bravery of so many who fought to contain the toxic results of the explosion, and countless men who returned to build the sarcophagus that was designed to seal reactor #4 for at least a hundred years. The narrative of how the newly created refugees, numbering over 116,000 from the exclusion zone is told with sensitivity and insight into their future plight. The scapegoating that dominated the investigation by Soviet authorities was appalling as was the propaganda machine that worked overtime to find blame and paint the accident in the best light as possible. The stories are often poignant and provide a true picture of what can happen on a personal and societal level from a nuclear disaster.Perhaps one of the most destructive results of Chernobyl was the beginning of the end of the Soviet Union. Gorbachev realized that even his own nuclear bureaucracy was rotten to the “core” and as was most of the Soviet state. The launching of perestroika opened debate among Soviet citizens that had been dormant, but slowly the issues of Afghanistan, drug addiction, the abortion epidemic, and the horrors of Stalinism emerged. The Russian people began to realize that they had been lied to for decades and as Higginbotham successfully argues they “faced the realization that their leaders were corrupt and that the Communist dream was a sham.”If wonders if a major nuclear accident could occur in the future remind yourself of Fukushima. In 2011, the Tokyo Electric Power Company’s nuclear plant underwent a process identical to Chernobyl; the loss of coolant that provoked a meltdown. As to what remains of Chernobyl itself, it is part of an “exclusion zone” of 1,000 square miles, a radioactive Eden for new wildlife and vegetation. Higginbotham has done the public a favor by exposing the events of April-May 1986 and give us pause as to how we should approach nuclear power in the future."
187,1501134612,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3357765-jimmy,5,"I have long been fascinated with Russia. Russian dissenters have long been my heroes going all the way back to Alexander Solzhenitsyn up to Pussy Riot and Garry Kasparov. It feels like Russia has an inferiority complex. The government is always trying to look bigger and stronger than they really are. Thus the arms buildups, the Olympic obsession, the meddling. In the case of Chernobyl, it was the cover ups, the refusal to admit mistakes, the effort to make the reactor bigger than anything else no matter how many corners had to be cut. As Higginbotham said, ""Lies and deception were endemic to the system, trafficked in both directions along the chain of management: those lower down passed up reports to their superiors packed with falsified statistics and inflated estimates, of unmet goals triumphantly reached, unfulfilled quotas heroically exceeded. To protect his own position, at every stage, relayed the lies upward or compounded them."" (15) ""Seated at the top of a teetering pyramid of falsehood, poring over reams of figures that had little basis in reality, were the economic mandarins of the State General Planning Committee--Gosplan--in Moscow."" (15) It worries me that Trump and his climate change deniers are setting up something of the same situation here in the US. Facts are not important in this administration. And scientific facts are even less important to the Trumpites. "". . . the plans called for fireproof cables, but when none could be found, the builders simply did the best they could."" (20) ""When the ministry of energy in Moscow learned that the roof of the plant's turbine hall had been covered with highly flammable bitumen, they ordered him to replace it. But the flame-retardent material . . . was not even being manufactured in the USSR, so the Ministry granted Brukhanov an exception, and the bitumen remained."" (20) But when they ordered him to build an ""olympic-sized swimming pool,"" he had to ""hoodwink the state bank"" to build it. He had no choice but to obey the order. Considering all of these facts, it makes me wonder if Chernobyl is the best way to look at nuclear power. The fault lies more with the communist system and its lack of regulatory power. People always think of communist systems as having too many regulations. In reality, communism has few regulations because it is all about the power at the top, like with Trump. The goal was to build ""increasingly gigantic stations throughout the western territories of the Union. By the end of the century, Moscow intended Chernobyl to be one part of a dense network of atomic power megacomplexes."" (20) In spite of ""alarming building faults,"" the work kept on. On pages 62 to 63, the designers saw ""no need to prepare for such a calamity"" in reference to the worst possible scenarios. All warnings about the dangers were ignored. Former Chernobyl chief engineer Nikolai Steinberg said that the origins of the disaster lay in a combination of ""scientific, technological, socioeconomic, and human factors"" unique to the USSR. (347) The Soviet Union ""lacked even rudimentary safety practices."" They ""relied upon its operators to behave with robotic precision night after night."" They were under ""constant pressure to beat deadlines."" All of this made ""disregard for the letter of the regulations almost inevitable."" The deceased operators of Control Room Number Four ""had brought the reactor into an unstable condition, but only on account of the acute pressure they felt to complete the test on the turbine."" (347) ""Some environmentalists argued that humanity could not afford to turn its back on the promise and terrors of the peaceful atom. The global need for electricity was increasing exponentially: humanity was predicted to double the amount of energy it used by 2050. Despite the growing certainty that burning fossil fuels was the cause of devastating climate change--making the stabilization of carbon emissions imperative--coal remained the most widely used source of energy in the world. The fine particulates from fossil fuel plants in the United States killed more than thirteen thousand people a year; worldwide, three million people died annually as a result of air pollution released by coal- and oil-fueled power stations. Even to begin to head off climate change over the coming thirty-five years would have to be clean, yet neither wind, solar, hydroelectric, nor geothermal power--nor any combination of them--had the potential to bridge the gap."" (357 to 358) ""And at last, more than seventy years after the technology's inception, engineers were finally developing reactors with design priorities that lay not in making bombs but in generating electricity. In principle, these fourth-generation reactors would be cheaper, safer, smaller, more efficient, and less poisonous than their predecessors and could yet prove to be the technology that saves the world."" (358) There is a ""liquid fluoride thorium reactor (LFTR)"" developed at Tennessee's Oak Ridge National Laboratory that is fueled by ""thorium. More plentiful and far harder to process into bomb-making material than uranium, thorium also burns more efficiently in a reactor and could produce less hazardous radioactive waste with half-lives of hundreds, not tens of thousands, of years. . . . It does not require a massive containment building to guard against loss-of-coolant accidents or explosions and can be constructed on such a compact scale that every steel mill or small town could have its own microreactor tucked away underground."" (358) ""In 2015, Bill Gates had begun funding research projects similar to these fourth-generation reactors in a quest to create a carbon-neutral power source for the future. By then, the Chinese government had already set seven hundred scientists on a crash program to build the world's first industrial thorium reactor as part of a war on pollution. 'The problem of coal has become clear,' the engineering director of the project said. 'Nuclear power provides the only solution.'"" (358) I was selective in my quotes. The question now is, Must we turn to nuclear power as a last resort to get out of the mess of climate change? I would be interested in your responses. "

It handles an amazingly complicated subject and history, and a massive cast of Soviet names, and somehow keeps it all clear even for non-scientist reader. If you're too young to remember Chernobyl, read this (and watch the HBO miniseries). If you are old enough to remember Chernobyl (and perhaps even Three Mile Island), read this anyway. It's frightening, compelling, brilliant, and vital as we try to ward off climate change and turn to energy sources other than fossil fuels. "

Senior Lieutenant Alexander Logachev loved radiation the way other men loved their wives. Tall and good-looking, twenty-six years old, with close-cropped dark hair and ice-blue eyes, Logachev had joined the Soviet army when he was still a boy. They had trained him well. The instructors from the military academy outside Moscow taught him with lethal poisons and unshielded radiation. He traveled to the testing grounds of Semipalatinsk in Kazakhstan, and to the desolte East Urals Trace, where the fallout from a clandestine radioactive accident still poisoned the landscape; eventually, Logachev’s training took him even to the remote and forbidden islands of Novaya Zemlya, high in the Arctic Circle and ground zero for the detonation of the terrible Tsar Bomba, the largest thermonuclear device in history.
Although I haven’t been born at the time of the Chernobyl disaster, the events of that time have fascinated me for years. This is probable also due to the fact that my parents, who were living in Poland during the catastrophe, were directly affected by the radioactive cloud. I have seen nearly every documentary that exists and I also found the HBO miniseries amazing! So amazing that every day I look skeptically in the direction of the nuclear power plant that stands here around the corner. So, it was clear that I would read this book the moment I heard about it for the first time. And even if, unfortunately, I had little time to read due to university and private courses, in the end it was absolutely worth! __________________________________________In the book, first there are some maps and overviews showing, among other things, Russia and the location of Pripyat and the construction of Unit Four of the Chernobyl Nuclear Plant (Tschernobylska AES im. W. I. Lenina). This is followed by a list of key persons and their function within the catastrophy. Then, the “story” begins.Journalist Higginbotham describes his incredibly well-researched information as far as possible in chronological order, sometimes even to the nearest second. It starts before the catastrophe and provides information on how the nuclear industry has built up in the USSR, how atomgrad* Pripyat was formed and how the nuclear power plant came online, years before the big mistake that was due to humane and machine failures.Within the text numerous, sometimes very scientific information, can be found – for example, how radiation works or that men radiate more than women due to their higher muslce mass. For me, there were actually some new things that I did not know before!In the further process, Higginbotham describes the events from the point of view of the varius persons: Director Brukhanov, scientist Legassov or the firefighters, who were unsuspecting at the scene and sealed their death with their intervention, but prevented a major catastrophe. Personally, this chapter has hit me the most, as I do not want to imagine how they must have felt in this situation.After detailed descriptions of the events at the plant and politics, which among other things led to the collapse of the Soviet Union, Higginbotham gives an insight into the current situation in the Ukraine: Among other things, he conducted interviews with people who vere involved in the disaster and he visits the ghost town of Pripyat. Attached are a glossary with all the important technical terms in the field of nuclear energy and images of the people and places mentioneds in the book. __________________________________________Even though the book requires a lot of concentration and you need a little more time to understand everything, it was absolutely worth to read this book! I would recommend it to anyone – whether he has already experienced the disaster or was born later. The topic is more present after the accident in Japan and should be known to everyone. For those who, like me, are interested in the events during that time, the book is an absolute must have!"
190,1501134612,http://goodreads.com/user/show/47825764-mellie-antoinette,5,"Picture it, Sophia Petrillo style:April 26, 19861:23:45 in the morning (though God knows why anyone was up to notice. Ma!)Boom. Kablewey. You pick. Things burn. 51,300 comrades 💤 (Ma!) in their beds. It was only a 2 minute flight from Reactor 4 to Pripyat. Maybe 10 minutes by car. The radioactive dust took the car. MA!Are you telling this story, Dorothy? The explosion was mostly vertical, but the damage? The damage was horizontal, soaring on winded wings as far as Sweden and that’s when sh*t really got real - don’t 🙄 at your mother, Dorothy Zbornak! Where do you think Stan got his weirdness?So Gorbachev’s all open door and honesty’s the best policy - well, how do you like them dosimeters? Open door policy, my foot! That’s how some cities knew what happened! They took radioactive readings off the sandals of a lady who just traveled to Pripyat. Gorby didn’t tell them. It was the shoes!Back to my story: So we got bureaucrats on the ground, fires blazing in the central core, 1,200 Kievan buses evac’ing the city and no clue how to stop this giant wildebeest from exploding again, China Syndrome style. Meanwhile: The winds have blown ... now we gotta evac another 116k people in the newly designated “Exclusion Zone” (though later they’d rename it the “Nuclear Reservation” like that helps), but the story of Chernobyl doesn’t stop there! Nope...✋ Now we gotta get Reactors 1-3...back...online?? Isn’t that the reason we’re gonna throw 750,000 bio robots at this sucker to begin with?? Not sure what you call *waves hand dramatically* all this, then. Oh right, “nuclear meltdowns don’t happen in the Soviet Union” (Stellan Skarsgard better get an Emmy for that brilliantly executed meltdown!).So here we are, 30 ish years later (ironic that’s the “official” death toll = 31 souls), two sarcophagi, 800 radioactive waste dumps, 4700 km squared of inhabitable land, hu HUM huh of ARS victims (it’s classified. So, of course, they told me, but I’m Sophia Petrillo! I keep my word! I’ll write it down, you throw it in the fireplace!) and a city built specifically to support the wildebeest dies in 16 years. Don’t worry though, they moved everyone to Slavutych, another atomgrad, and hey, the world makes sense again!That’s how we tell stories in Sicily! Obviously, loved this one! It is a little dry, but as you can see, it’s hard to write without judgement. Higginbotham does just the facts, no sass and still tells the story in a way that’s both completely understandable and emotionally harrowing all at the same time. Very well done!"
191,1501134612,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9981052-nicholereadswithcats,5,Very informative. Some of the scientific information was a little over my head but I enjoyed the mix between facts and personal experience. Shocking the lengths which were taken to attempt to cover up what happened. Loved the pictures at the end.
192,1501134612,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3670585-erin-cataldi,3,"This book has all the info you never knew you needed on Chernobyl - down to the last technical detail. I listened to this rather than reading it and was soon bogged down by the sheer amount of physics detailed; at times I found myself struggling to pay attention. That being said, this was still a fascinating detailed look on the events that caused the accidents and the actions taken afterward. It was a perfect storm of horrible events and it really will get your heart racing as the author gives you a near minute by minute account. Unsettling at moments, and overly technical; this insanely well researched guide is not for the casual reader. This book is heavy; but will change the way you think about Chernobyl forever! "
193,1501134612,http://goodreads.com/user/show/55342889-elizabethanne-olsen,5,Just. Fucking. Fantastic. The descriptions of the destruction seemed so surreal like it was a fictional dystopian novel. So difficult to grasp the enormity of this as a real event. The horrific descriptions of ailments to the ones who suffered exposure was intense and necessary. Everyone should real this book. Everyone. 
194,1501134612,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2168708-marta,5,"Astonishing, thrillingly written, with a lot of new information, including the causes of the accident. I have bought this on audio and listened to it; but I missed so much information that I am listening to it again. It is thrilling the second time as well, and this time I can put the stories of the people more into context. My family was also interested so I bought a print copy as well. I am using it to look up names, and there are pictures as well. I stopped listening second time about halfway through - the pandemic happened and I am tired of bad news. This is a thrilling telling of a cautionary tale about the dangers of arrogance dealing with the forces of nature. The minimizing, denials, trying to cover it up, confused scrambling to stall an even bigger disaster - all echo in the reaction of the US government to the pandemic in the last weeks/months. The arrogance and the wishful thinking that made the disaster so much worse are just as present now. Leaders need to read history - and we elected one that expressly disdains science, reading, and history. This is of course wholly unfair to the people in the Chernobyl catastrophe. There was a lot of heroism, and some ofticials showed remarkable leadership. Which is why I felt most enraged when those operators who gave their lives willingly and performed heroics to save the reactor in the first hours of the disaster, were scapegoated. These people were heroes (well, some, I have no sympathy for plant director Brukhanov), and they were tried as criminals, some declared as such posthumously. The world was told at the time that the accident was caused by careless operators who conducted a test and disabled the safety systems. But in reality, the RBMK reactor had multiple design flaws and the accident was waiting to happen. One of those was in the emergency shutdown. When the Chernobyl operators realized they had trouble, they initiated a shutdown by dropping all safety rods - but instead of shutting down, the reactor went critical - because of the rods were graphite-tipped! The designers have discovered this flaw years before, but they thought it was unlikely to happen. (Arrogance and negligence). It was only an issue if most control rods were withdrawn - which was the case at Chernobyl, due to the other major flaw of the reactor, the positive void coefficient (Google it). This basically made it unsafe to operate the reactor at low power levels, which the designers also discovered, but all they did was sent a new operating manual, without explaining why this was important. Experienced operators did learn that the reactor got unstable at lower power levels, from experience, but did not know that it could be a safety risk. So when the manager of the tests wanted to perform it at low power levels, one protested - but he was overruled and threatened of being fired. Presumably the manager wanted to be safer... and thus the reactor went to overdrive with the lower powerlevel, so they withdrew the rods - then tried to shut down. Boom.All this has been previously detected as a risk, and ignored. Then came the fallout.Read this - but maybe not during a pandemic."
195,1501134612,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8413178-liam,5,"I, like everybody else, have been entranced by HBO's Chernobyl. Watching it, I realised how little I really knew about the disaster despite having spent untold hours wandering around in the fictional version of the Zone in the STALKER games.Much like most people I imagine, I was kind of astounded by how huge a disaster it actually was, and how close it came to being so much worse. I kind of ran under the assumption that the HBO show was dramatised to a certain extent, because how could I have possibly not heard that there was a distinct possibility that Reactor 4 would explode again with the force of several atomic bombs? - but no, this actually occurred.Higginbotham's writing is detached, which somehow makes it all the more impactful - dry descriptions of Pripyat firefighters experiencing 'violent diarrhea' in the days following the initial explosion, which was determined to be 'their intestines liquefying' is one example I'm going to have trouble forgetting.As a companion to the show, Midnight in Chernobyl was excellent. I didn't plan it out that way, but events in the show as I watched it every few nights kind of lined up to the events in the book as I listened to it on my way to and from work, expanding and providing further detail, or refuting the more dramatised parts of the show. Legasov for example is portrayed a lot more heroic in the show, routinely martyring himself before the Communist Party for the good of all - whereas he was far more likely to toe the Party line in real life, and only repented soon before his death.Midnight in Chernobyl is a fantastic in-depth exploration of the disaster - causes and repercussions, and it has certainly sparked interest in the topic for myself. An excellently written book, very well read by Jacques Roy. Highly recommend."

If, instead, you want to know the true story read Higginbotham's fine book, which does an excellent job of not only describing in a blow-by-blow fashion the disaster and it's aftermath, but places the disaster in the broader context of Soviet society and rule. 4-stars."
197,1501134612,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5072847-will-ansbacher,5,"Well written, fast paced and unbelievable action – this would be a terrific disaster thriller if it wasn’t actually all true.Adam Higginbotham has done a simply brilliant job of researching and writing about the world’s worst nuclear disaster, with a style that’s riveting yet balanced and without hyperbole. It opens with a couple of pages describing Civil Defence responders’ panic as they first realize the extent of the radioactive horror they’d been catapulted into. From that initial adrenalin burst, the first part of the story (titled Birth of a City) goes back to the origins of nuclear power development in Russia and the founding of the atomic city of Pripyat, and is interleaved with the events surrounding the explosion of reactor #4 and the immediate after-effects. The longer part two (Death of an Empire) covers the awful radiation effects, the mainly futile clean-up attempts, the cover-ups, denials, excruciating investigations and show trials; at the same time providing insight into the breakup of the USSR. (If Chernobyl wasn’t the catalyst that led to the end of the Soviet Union, then it certainly was a major factor). The story ends with more recent developments, including interviews the author had with those involved - at least, those who still were alive after 2006.This changing focus is a really effective way of dealing with a highly complex subject that could otherwise have been quite dry. Interestingly, I thought, the structure mirrors radiation poisoning itself: the initial terrifying experience of acute exposure and a short period of apparent recovery, but followed by the much longer and agonizing progress of an array of worsening symptoms. I won’t go into the story itself, (this  NY Times review is a great summary). But I was struck by a few recurrent themes:One, the cynical way disasters were suppressed so nobody could ever learn from previous mistakes;Two, the culture of craven compliance that prevented anyone from speaking out about known problems; (Together, these made not only the reactor explosion inevitable but the aftermath about as bad as it could possibly be)Three, the casual attitudes – bordering on macho defiance - to radiation dangers;And four, the sheer resilience of the Russian and Ukrainian people – both workers at the plant and the general population - in the face of all the horrors that were thrown at them. (Though these last two are as much the result of the authorities ruthlessly suppressing information) A ton of authoritative information has become available over the last 30 years, and Higginbotham seems to have read it all - there are 100 pages of end notes alone. However in order not to interrupt the flow he wisely left all the cross-referencing to the end, where a few relevant words in each note point to the text. There is also an extensive bibliography and a short but useful cast of characters ... Ligachev? Logachev? Legasov? ... which I found I had to flip back to often. There is still much we don’t know about Chernobyl, but to understand the disaster and what it means, I don’t think you could do better than this book. It isn’t perfect of course; Higginbotham didn’t explain some of the radiation physics or its effects on humans too well, but for this non-technical account it’s more than good enough."
198,1501134612,http://goodreads.com/user/show/32091911-sallie-dunn,4,"This was an excellent and thoroughly researched telling of the nuclear disaster that happened in Chernobyl in 1986. Despite the scientific leanings (some of which was over my head) it was immensely readable account of the event. There was background relating to the construction of the nuclear reactor and a minute by minute, hour by hour account of the disaster itself as it unfolded on April 26, 1986. Then the aftermath, the world-wide scale of international proportions, the denial, the cover-up, the prosecution and trials that followed were riveting reading. If you’re in the mood for some serious non-fiction, this is it! Four stars from me. "

200,1501134612,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11701608-barbara,5,"10+stars: Oh My Dear Lord, this novel will scare the beejesus out of you. Journalist Adam Higgnbothem has written an amazing documentary of the 1986 catastrophe at the Chernobyl nuclear plant in the USSR. I listened to the audible production that is narrated by Jacques Roy. At the beginning, Roy lists all the important characters in this story. Since I listened to it, I was at a disadvantage keeping all the players straight in my head. If one wants to truly understand the politics, lies, radiation illnesses, etc, that involved each character, one should read the novel. As an American listener, all those Russian names were difficult to keep in my mind.That said, it is an amazing listen. Just getting the timeline of events, the mistakes, the horror of the disaster while listening is enough for me. This tragedy was a culmination of mistakes. Although the USSR wanted to lay blame on separate individuals, Higgenbothem shows that is was straws, that individually wouldn’t be the blame, but added together resulted in a global tragedy. Also, it was the political pressure and the culture of Russia at that time that lead to the explosion. Russia wanted to save face which added layers to the event that cost thousands of lives. The government secrecy magnified mistakes.Higgenbothem exposes the devastating losses and damages to humans, the landscape, and animals. Once the catastrophe made global news, he explains the collective efforts made to find solutions. Nuclear energy seems here to stay. Creating safe nuclear energy is paramount to the safety and survival of the earth. Making worker education a priority is a necessity. We must remain aware and well informed of the cost/benefit of producing nuclear energy. This is an amazing case study."
201,1501134612,http://goodreads.com/user/show/92319245-mona,4,"This is probably one of the most comprehensive books about Cherbobyl disaster. Author and his multiple researchers did a great job going through documentation, books, articles and statements. They also interviewed quite a few people who participated in described events.Book is well written and narrative is concise. Author guides a reader through basics of physics and construction necessary to understand the events properly. I specifically liked the description of research done on the reactor which were conducted few years after the disaster. I was not familiar with those findings.When it comes to shortcomings of this book - it was written by Brit living in the US and this Western point of view is very clear here. I felt the narration had lingering condescending and superior tone to it, what at points became quite annoying. I think the author did not have a good understanding of Russian culture and mentality (particularly noted during his last interview with the plant director) and he undermined the value of some heroic acts done by firefighters and soldiers after the disaster. This is not the first book I read on this topic and I think Russian and Ukrainian writers are much better in this area for obvious reasons.This is a great book for Westerners who know nothing or close to nothing about Charnobyl disaster and would like to have a general overview. Kinda ""all you can eat""..... but not a white cloth."

It was as good a read as any gripping thriller with the downside that this is not fiction but reality.

''But when I went back to Ukraine, they started telling me about people who had died. Was it due to radiation? I don't know. I don't understand anything about statistics. But, when my friends ask me about it, I tell them: the less you think about it, the longer you'll live.''Midnight in Chernobyl autora Adama Higginbothama enciklopedijski je uvid u najveću nuklearnu katastrofu koja se dogodila u Černobilju, u Ukrajini 26.aprila 1986. godine.Priča o najvećoj nesreći jedne države, grada, političkog i državnog uređenja, počinje u trenutku kada se postavljaju temelji za građenje ovog nukelarnog postrojenja 1970. godine i rađanja grada u kome su živjeli ljudi zaposleni na izgradnji, kao i radnici predviđeni da rade u novootvorenoj centrali.U jeku hladnog rata Sovjetski savez se svim silama trudio da ukroti atom, da svijetu podari sliku o naučnim dostignućima bez premca, a ljudi su uživali u plodovima svog rada, bezbrižni, poletni i vjerni državi koja im je stvorila atomski grad Pripjat, obezbjedila udobnost sadašnjosti i velike planove za budućnost.Ali sovjetski naučnici koji su radili pod okriljem jednog zatvorenog i ambicioznog sistema, zatvarali su oči pred bilo kakvim greškama na koje su upozoravani prilikom izrade nuklearnih reaktora RBMK-1000 (koji je i eksplodirao u Černobilju), sve mane koje su nesumnjivo postojale držane su u strogoj tajnosti, a sve, naizgled, male stvari dovele su do katastrofe koja je, prema mnogima, dovela i do raspada SSSR-a.Autor se kroz brojne izvore ovim događajem bavio sa naučnog, političkog, socijalnog i ljudskog aspekta, hirurški precizno kombinujući dešavanja u Černobilju sa sudbinama stanovnika Pripjata, koji nesvjesni onoga što ih je snašlo odlaze iz svojih domova, dok radijacija bjesomučno prekriva kvadratne kilometre gradova, tokove rijeka, dječije igračke, kućne ljubimce i tijela svih koji su učestvovali u saniranju posljedica eksplozije.Usljed loše izrađenog reaktora, kojim su upravljali ambiciozni i često nestručni ljudi, zaslijepljeni egom i grandioznošću, 26.aprila 1986. godine desio se početak kraja jednog doba, zapečanjen sudbinama nekih običnih ljudi koji su na poziv domovine golim rukama uklanjali radioaktivni materijal, koji su u sobama Bolnice broj šest ostavljali svoje živote, koji su gradili sarkofag iznad uništenog reaktora u uslovima visoke radijacije kobne po ljudsko zdravlje.A put kojim se došlo do toga, kao i njegove posljedice Adam Higginbotham predstavio je na opširan, zanimljiv i stručan način, te ostavio još jedno važno svjedočanstvo o ovom događaju.P.S. Ponovo preporučujem da pogledate HBO mini seriju Chernobyl, s obzirom da je nakon gledanja mnogo lakše shvatiti suštinu ove knjige, kao i komplikovane opise načina rada nuklearnog reaktora.''Amid the chaos of the collapsing empire, most of the men and women who had fought the Battle of Chernobyl were forgotten - the final defenders of a nation that had seemingly vanished overnight.''"
207,1501134612,http://goodreads.com/user/show/684704-morgan,5,"It took fourteen days to read, but I was riveted and fascinated the entire time. I am too young to remember the Chernobyl melt down when the event took place in 1986, but I'm certain it's an event that contributed to my very vague, yet frightening notions of the war grown ups referred to as Cold.Later in life, I discovered pictures of Pripyat -an abandoned and radioactive city. These images captivated and haunted me. Yet, why did Chernobyl really melt down, and could other nuclear power plants face such demise? (An uneasy question for someone who heard a nuclear power plant's monthly test sirens while sitting in her high school classes.)This book delivered a lot of information - from how nuclear fission takes place, to who were the people on the ground before, during, and after the explosions in 1986. For me, the science bits were just enough - explained with clarity, yet never cumbersome or off-putting. (I'm language oriented, so science text books are off-putting for me personally.) But, the heart of this book is the people you meet. The firemen, the young nuclear engineers, an architect mapping out an ideal city, people loyal (albeit, questionably) to their county and the beliefs it strived to uphold. Midnight in Chernobyl portrayed a nuclear power plant, its atomgard, and its people with such distinction, that it was hard to shake any of these elements even when the book was closed. That childhood fear of the Cold War and nuclear weapons crept into my dreams, waking me with fears of radiation exposure and an urgency to find my children. A fleeting moment later, and my comfortable reality reasserted itself; but I wanted to know more, to understand more about an era in history - and about our future.It's quite a read. I'll eagerly offer it up to other readers as a worthy title. **(I already have - my apologies to those who came to my family's cook-out over the weekend who listened to me chatter on about a nuclear meltdown, when all they wanted to do was enjoy some pulled pork and spare ribs. I really do try to keep the overzealous librarian in me at bay during large social events, but alas, this title was just too good.)"
208,1501134612,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5862503-sweetwilliam,5,"Rarely do I read a book of 385 pages in 3 or 4 sittings but this book was engrossing. I started it on a Thursday and finished it over the weekend. It is an indictment of a flawed system of government. I watched the Chernobyl mini-series several times. Had not my son given this book to me as a birthday present, I probably wouldn’t have read it but I’m glad I did. A miniseries cannot delve into the details and provide all the interesting backstories and other essential information intrinsic to this story. The reactor was of a flawed design. This disaster was bound to happen sooner or later. Previous accidents had been swept under the rug. Soviet prestige was at stake and this was more important than the safety of the people or the planet. There was no oversight. In fact on page 323, Acadamician Valery Legasov realized “…the true scope of the decay at the heart of the [Soviet] nuclear state: The culture of secrecy and complacency, the arrogance and negligence and the shoddy standards of design and construction.”  On page 327 the author explains that the explosion was the last straw of a failing system:The most destructive forces unleashed by the explosion of Reactor Number Four were not radiological but political and economic. The cloud of radiation that spread out across Europe, making the catastrophe impossible to conceal had forced the touted openness of Gorbachev’s glasnost on even the most reluctant conservatives in the Politburo. Even the nuclear bureaucracy had been undermined by secrecy, incompetence, and stagnation convinced him that the entire state was rotten. Perestroika was launched in a desperate bid to save the Socialist experiment before it was too late. But all this did was to promote discussion on other censored topics such as drug addiction, abortion, Afghan war, and the horrors of Stalinism.Thus the author argues, the Chernobyl disaster brought down an empire. It is a fascinating read."
209,1501134612,http://goodreads.com/user/show/284714-kasandra,4,"This is a fascinating, horrifying, depressing, and enlightening read, with tons of details I'd never heard or learned before. What's most terrifying is how much the chances of this were known inside the former Soviet Union and covered up for years (along with previous accidents). The heroism of many Russians is astounding in dealing with this crisis, as is the callousness of others. A warning for the nuclear energy industry and all of us, about how quickly this technology can spiral out of control without transparency, honesty, readiness for all emergencies, and even with all proper planning - how quickly we can destroy ourselves and our environment due to simple human error and pride. Incredibly well-reported and thorough, and highly recommended."
210,1501134612,http://goodreads.com/user/show/34570157-jenny-jo-weir,4,Wow! This one was a hard read. The whole time I'm thinking about all that radiation and the effects of the explosion. The amount of people affected by this and the cost of this unfortunate event were unprecedented. You can't help but feel bad fro all the people involved and for all the victims. It's something that sticks with you. 
211,1501134612,http://goodreads.com/user/show/38617426-juli,4,"Interest in the Chernobyl nuclear disaster has spiked since the award winning HBO mini-series aired. I watched the show and listened to HBO's accompanying podcast and several other podcast episodes on the accident and its aftermath. Several of the podcasts mentioned this book, so I secured a spot on the library's wait list for the audiobook. I'm glad I did! This book is excellent!Higginbotham outlines the buildup of the soviet power grid and nuclear technology. Along the way there were accidents, cost cutting measures that had disastrous effects, mismanagement, poor training and flawed maintenance. All the mistakes culminated in the explosion at Chernobyl on April 25, 1986.Higginbotham gives details about the people involved, the plant itself, the history of Soviet nuclear power, the accident, the evacuation of Pripyat, and the continuing aftermath of the accident. It's a very interesting, and concerning, story. Many countries have nuclear power plants now. It's an awesome way to generate electricity, unless there is an accident. In recent years, the Fukushima accident shows that an earthquake or other natural event can cause modern nuclear plants to become quite dangerous. But with mismanagement, bad maintenance, lackluster employee training and shoddy parts/construction, any nuclear plant can be potentially dangerous. With more countries around the world turning to nuclear power, the chances of an accident increase.....I remember news reports in 1986 about the event. I can remember initial reports stating that it was known there had been some sort of nuclear event in the Soviet Union but scientists were not sure what had happened and no information was being released by USSR officials. When the full truth came out, it was horrifying. An entire city evacuated. Firemen and emergency response personnel dying. The struggle to prevent a melt-down. 33 years later, many are still interested in the accident and the lasting damage it caused. Pripyat is becoming a tourist attraction even. Yikes! I can think of much better vacation sites than one that is completely irradiated. Pripyat, and the surrounding region, will be not be safely habitable for more than 20,000 years.Nuclear power is safe when handled responsibly by properly trained people. Most plants operating in the modern world are quite safe, and managed/maintained properly. But, a nuclear power plant can be potentially deadly if proper safety protocols are not strictly adhered to and the potential effects of natural disasters and other catastrophes are not properly taken into consideration. I hope it is a very, very long time -- or never -- that our planet ends up with another uninhabitable, radiation soaked region from a nuclear accident. The effects are long lasting, and far reaching.Great book! Lots of highly researched information presented in an interesting manner. The audio book is about 14 hours long and narrated by Jacques Roy. Roy reads at a steady pace. His voice is easily understandable. Very enjoyable listening experience!"
212,1501134612,http://goodreads.com/user/show/352711-leftbanker,5,"I began this book out of desperation from the cliff-hanger of episode 2 of Chernobyl on HBO, one of the best TV dramas I’ve ever watched. Like the series, the pacing and tone of this account reads like the best of thrillers and I literally couldn’t put it down. I’m old enough to have vivid recollections of the event as it was unfolding. My USAF unit stationed in Athens, Greece, received intelligence on the crisis well ahead of the local news. We knew that it was a nuclear accident well before the Soviets admitted to this fact, but what we didn’t know was just how close the world was to a bigger, unspeakable disaster. This news really wasn’t available for years after the events of April 1986. The world had moved on. I had all but forgotten Chernobyl until this brilliant series came over the horizon. A viewer of the series wrote, “The tragedy will live forever because of this haunting masterpiece, what a brilliant creative achievement.” I could say the same for this book. Informative, objective, and written with a breath-taking pace, I couldn’t recommend it more highly to anyone looking to become better informed on the events of Chernobyl, both when it happened, and in the years since.It’s hard to laugh when you’re reading in the fetal position, but this part struck me as the epitome of gallows humor. One nuclear scientist working on cleaning up the disaster gives safety advice to another nuclear scientist just arriving, “If you smell ozone, run!”The big surprise is that the death toll wasn’t tens of times greater than the reality. Of course, we may never know the true results of the accident as Soviet record keeping tended to down-play cancer deaths which may have been related to Chernobyl.The most terrifying aspect of all is to consider how our leaders today would deal with a disaster on this order. Even the monumentally corrupt Soviets of that era had some highly intelligent, rational people among them, which is more than you can say of Putin and Trump, and their flunkies. Trump prevaricates on matters of little or no importance; imagine his response on this sort of travesty."

All I have to say is I wish I read Voices from Chernobyl: The Oral History of a Nuclear Disaster instead. This book was just boring unless you like reading a lot about engineering and the technical structure of power plants and buildings. In addition, there are a zillion Russian names, and even with Kindle X-Ray and a guide to who was who, I struggled because the people just were not brought to life for me.This is reporting. It's very strong reporting, and it unveils the type of cover-up that makes you worried about government and implies that conspiracy theories can be true. The story is important. I just did not find it interesting because of the absolute overload of details, many of which were beyond my understanding or ability to picture. Maybe my timing in picking up this one was just way off . . .as we are in the middle of a crisis ourselves, my concentration is pretty shot. So, judge this one by the reviews of others. I just can barely bring myself to give it 3 stars. "
214,1501134612,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5349403-carolyn,4,"The author has written an impressive, comprehensive book of historical importance. It brings to light events surrounding the Chernobyl catastrophe of 1986 which may be unknown to many in the Western world, and even to the Russian people. The author presents a crash course in nuclear physics and energy, simplified as much as possible. This may present difficulties for the average reader without some background knowledge. I thought the human factor surrounding the disaster to be interesting and appreciated that the book included a summary list of the Cast of Characters and their positions and involvement with Chernobyl. The book emphasized the social/political Cold War mentality, economic factors, technical failures, the cut-throat ambition of the politicians and their secrecy which led to public complacency or wild rumours. Reaction time was slow due to uncertainty and arguments about the best course of action. I feel this is the definitive book of situations leading up to the disaster, what happened when Reactor 4 malfunctioned causing a huge surge of radiation, and its aftermath. The history is impeccable and thoroughly researched and stands as a sample for other writers of historical events and will be the definitive book on Chernobyl.The Chernobyl atomic complex was built to produce cheap electricity for a vast surrounded area, and to establish the Soviet Union ’s predominance in nuclear power. The disaster occurred in Reactor #4 on April 26, 1986. A model town, Pripyat, was built in the wilderness area close to the Nuclear Plant to house tens of thousands of workers and their families. From rough, cold shacks inhabited by the early builders, it grew into an impressive town with 3 schools, 35 playgrounds, 3 swimming pools, a library, sports facility and shopping center. Groceries and goods in the stores were more varied and abundant than in cities of origin of most of the workers. No expense was spared in planting trees and importing flowering shrubs to enhance the blocks of apartments. The nuclear accident which occurred resulted in a coverup where plant workers and women and children were not aware of the danger to their lives and health from nuclear fallout.there were cultural and political reasons contributing to lack of safety. Poor building design, shoddy materials, forced deadlines for builders and plant workers to meet, incompetent and negligent staff without knowledge of dangers they faced. There had been a smaller explosion at another plant and plenty of malfunctions but they were ignorant of possible critical problems. After the reactor imploded and seemed to be going into meltdown, releasing radiation far and wide, members of the emergency response team who did know the peril were either forced to stop the leak or went in willingly out of patriotic duty.  Following the disaster, people of Pripyat went about their lives ignorant of dangers from radioactive fallout. During this time a gathering of academics, Generals and politicians argued about the course they needed to take but were mainly concerned with secrecy. Finally, it was decided to evacuate the town of 51,000 people but leaving behind 4,000 essential service workers. People being evacuated were led to believe that they would only be away from home a couple of days and to bring only essentials for a short stay. Immediately after the explosion, there were two deaths of reactor workers.28 died soon of acute radiation sickness.. Evacuation orders soon included 90,000 people within a 30 K radius. High radiation levels soon spread to areas distant from Chernobyl and was detected in Sweden, Belarus and Poland. By May 20, 95,000 people had been hospitalized. High levels of radioactivity had already reached the capital, Kiev. May Day celebrations were carried out in the open air. Soon over 300,000 children were ordered evacuated from Kiev, along with expectant and nursing mothers (about 1/5 of the population). Teams were hired to shoot 20,000 domestic animals left behind.  We will never know how many people died over the years from radiation-induced cancers, as doctors were pressed not to mention a possible connection. Once the danger of a meltdown had eased and the reactor was covered with a dome, it was felt necessary to lay blame. Six plant officials were put on trial resulting in prison sentences. Official statements refused to place blame on faulty building materials, reactor design flaws, or the irresponsibility and poor discipline of the plant workers present when the disaster occurred. They had been conducting a safety inspection to simulate a power failure and did not follow the procedure properly outlined on a checklist. The author emphasizes the social/political Cold War mentality. The secrecy of generals and politicians which led to wild rumours or complacency subsequently caused the people to distrust in their leaders. Economic factors due to the billions of rubles spent on evacuation, housing, pay for thousands of emergency workers, and the deactivating the reactor was a great financial loss for the country. The author feels this was a major factor contributing to the breakup of the Soviet Union Thanks to NetGalley and Simon & Schuster for an advance copy of this important book."
215,1501134612,http://goodreads.com/user/show/53179837-george,4,"This book covers the events from the construction of the plant to the fall of the Soviet Union, but unlike Serhii Plokhy he does it from the perspective of the people who were actually close enough to absorb the radiation. Mostly he focused on the scientists, workers and liquidators, who had to deal with the clean up. He focused so much on these people that at the beginning of the book there was a list of characters, as if it was a play or something. I've never seen that done with a nonfiction book before, but maybe that was just a quirk of my particular edition. Now, because I have read Chernobyl: History of a Tragedy by Serhii Plokhy I couldn't help but compare these two. Serhii Plokhy covered the construction of the plant and the causes of the explosion itself better then Adam Higginbotham, but Adam didn't just brush of the clean up process. After reading them both I find it that they are both necessary to understand this disaster, just to get all the angles.Lastly, on to the Voices of Chernobyl to see what the ordinary people had to say about this whole mess. "
216,1501134612,http://goodreads.com/user/show/17428284-steven-z,5,"March 28, 1979 was an overcast day in Woodbridge, Va. when news arrived of a nuclear accident at Three Mile Island Unit 2 reactor near Middletown, Pa. Feeling totally in the dark when it came to information about the accident, my neighbors and I gathered outside our homes and immediately began testing to see which way the winds were blowing, and should we pack up and head in the opposite direction. Living about two and a half hours from the reactor which would eventually partially melt down, we were scared. Up to that time this would be considered the greatest nuclear accident in history being unaware of the Kyshtym Disaster which was a radioactive contamination accident that occurred on September 29, 1957 at Mayak, a plutonium production site in Russia for nuclear weapons and a nuclear fuel reprocessing plant in the Soviet Union. After reading Adam Higginbotham’s new book, MIDNIGHT IN CHERNOBYL: THE UNTOLD STORY OF THE WORLD’S GREATEST NUCLEAR DISASTER, an excellent account of the explosion and meltdown at Chernobyl the evening of April 25-26, 1986 and the ramifications of that disaster, memories of that March day flashed before my eyes.Higginbotham has written the most informative and insightful description of events and analysis of the meltdown that has yet to appear. It replaces Harvard historian, Serhii Plokhy’s CHERNOBYL: A HISTORY OF A NUCLEAR CATASYTROPHE as the most comprehensive and detailed work that has been written. In dealing with events such as Chernobyl one must ask: What happened, why did it happen, and could it happen again? Higginbotham, a journalist and his research partner Taras Shumeyko interviewed numerous eyewitnesses and conducted a prodigious amount of research that included a small number of declassified documents available, and argues that the fanatical view among Soviet bureaucrats and leadership to maintain secrecy, (for example, information about what occurred at Mayak was kept from the public for thirty years) was the reason the accident was so devastating, but also not surprising that it occurred. Higginbotham recreates the disaster providing a history of Soviet nuclear development, including numerous accidents; the planning and building of Chernobyl; the accident; attempts to remediate the situation after it occurred, the trial of the operators who were blamed for the disaster; and other aspects of the aftermath. The book reads in part as narrative history, but also a terrifying account of an event which could easily be repeated today.The plan to build Chernobyl was hatched in February 1970 as a means of catching up to the west and meet Soviet electricity needs. The Soviet Union would engage in a crash program to build nuclear reactors, but the problem was that the project began during a period of economic stagnation with material and resource shortages everywhere. The reactor was to be completed by 1975 which was totally unrealistic due to the approach taken by the Soviet bureaucracy, party elites, and engineers that did not consider shortages, safety needs, and planning for possible future nuclear accidents. The result is that corners were cut in terms of material, training, design flaws, “cooking the books,” and the stubborn nature of the Soviet bureaucracy in charge of construction. As Higginbotham discusses this aspect of the project, he provides the reader an interesting history of the development of radiation, nuclear development, and their affects on people and society. The author’s approach to complex scientific information and jargon is such that it is very easy to understand for the lay reader as he describes how reactors are supposed to be constructed.According to Higginbotham there were design flaws dealing with a high-power channel reactor labeled RMBK. These flaws would dog designers who would pay little attention to test results because of pressure from the Communist Party and the bureaucracy that flowed from it. This made disaster possible because no one knew how the reactor would react in case of an accident. The reactors colossal size made start up and shut down the most demanding and treacherous stages of RMBK operation. The author follows RMBK’s development and its flaws as it went into production, particularly the AZ-5 emergency protection system whose design took too long to respond in an emergency which came home to roost on April 25, 1986.  A similar plant in Leningrad experienced an accident on November 11, 1975 resulting in the release of radiation into the atmosphere over the Gulf of Finland. However, Sredmash, the Soviet agency in charge of production and construction of nuclear reactors covered up the investigative findings of design flaws related to the accident. On September 9, 1982 there was a partial meltdown at Unit 1 at Chernobyl which took eight months to repair, but the KGB instituted a gag order, and the following year a similar accident took place in a Lithuanian reactor and one in Armenia. But the world knew nothing of these accidents. Further exacerbating Soviet nuclear reactor building was the shoddy workmanship that plagued Soviet industry in general, and that carried over to the construction of Chernobyl.  A major problem that arose once Reactor #4 at Chernobyl exploded is that many of those in charge were unprepared to deal with what occurred and succumbed to wishful thinking and self-delusion in approaching how to deal with what had transpired. Higginbotham describes in detail the lethargic Soviet bureaucracy and their response to disaster. Soviet Prime Minister Mikhail Gorbachev was not notified as to what had occurred until the afternoon of April 26, 1986. The author narrates the debates inside the Commission that was set up to oversee the crisis. He relates the personalities involved and their debates on how to respond and their final decision making, many of which were out of some sort of fantasy. An excellent example apart from how to cool the reactor was whether they should evacuate the city of Pripyat and its 50,000 residents who were in danger of radiation exposure which took until April 27th to accomplish. As the radioactive cloud blew over Scandinavia, Swedish, Finish, and Danish diplomats lodged complaints to Moscow once it was realized where the radiation originated resulting in the Soviet government stonewalling. It would take until April 28th at 8:00pm for Moscow to come clean and announce that “an accident had taken place at the Chernobyl nuclear power plant.…One of the atomic reactors has been damaged.” Soviet citizens were used to this type of response as it was a continuation of the way the state had covered industrial accidents for decades.Higginbotham descriptions of helicopter pilots flying low dumping sand and boron on the reactor are harrowing. The author’s approach as he carefully describes how officials, academics, scientists, fire fighters, guards, and others and what they went through is chilling, especially as he brings the reader to Hospital #6 in Moscow created to treat victims of nuclear accidents and war. The ultimate fear was the “China Syndrome,” the further devastation that would occur if the reactor’s foundation exploded and nuclear material leaked into the earth. Even though Moscow TV announced on May 11, 1986 that the primary threat of explosion was over, scientists remained skeptical.The Central Committee of the Politburo decided against Gorbachev’s new policy of Glasnost and followed the traditional approach and blamed “bourgeois falsification….propaganda and inventions” as its immediate reaction, in addition to dishonesty and declining help from the west. This approach would backfire in terms of containing the accident but also hindering Gorbachev’s hope of nuclear disarmament talks with the United States because how could one negotiate with someone who was so untrustworthy.Higginbotham spends a great deal of time describing what the victims of the disaster experienced. He follows the medical care that victims received and for far too many their ultimate deaths. He recounts the bravery of so many who fought to contain the toxic results of the explosion, and countless men who returned to build the sarcophagus that was designed to seal reactor #4 for at least a hundred years. The narrative of how the newly created refugees, numbering over 116,000 from the exclusion zone is told with sensitivity and insight into their future plight. The scapegoating that dominated the investigation by Soviet authorities was appalling as was the propaganda machine that worked overtime to find blame and paint the accident in the best light as possible. The stories are often poignant and provide a true picture of what can happen on a personal and societal level from a nuclear disaster.Perhaps one of the most destructive results of Chernobyl was the beginning of the end of the Soviet Union. Gorbachev realized that even his own nuclear bureaucracy was rotten to the “core” and as was most of the Soviet state. The launching of perestroika opened debate among Soviet citizens that had been dormant, but slowly the issues of Afghanistan, drug addiction, the abortion epidemic, and the horrors of Stalinism emerged. The Russian people began to realize that they had been lied to for decades and as Higginbotham successfully argues they “faced the realization that their leaders were corrupt and that the Communist dream was a sham.”If wonders if a major nuclear accident could occur in the future remind yourself of Fukushima. In 2011, the Tokyo Electric Power Company’s nuclear plant underwent a process identical to Chernobyl; the loss of coolant that provoked a meltdown. As to what remains of Chernobyl itself, it is part of an “exclusion zone” of 1,000 square miles, a radioactive Eden for new wildlife and vegetation. Higginbotham has done the public a favor by exposing the events of April-May 1986 and give us pause as to how we should approach nuclear power in the future."
217,1501134612,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3357765-jimmy,5,"I have long been fascinated with Russia. Russian dissenters have long been my heroes going all the way back to Alexander Solzhenitsyn up to Pussy Riot and Garry Kasparov. It feels like Russia has an inferiority complex. The government is always trying to look bigger and stronger than they really are. Thus the arms buildups, the Olympic obsession, the meddling. In the case of Chernobyl, it was the cover ups, the refusal to admit mistakes, the effort to make the reactor bigger than anything else no matter how many corners had to be cut. As Higginbotham said, ""Lies and deception were endemic to the system, trafficked in both directions along the chain of management: those lower down passed up reports to their superiors packed with falsified statistics and inflated estimates, of unmet goals triumphantly reached, unfulfilled quotas heroically exceeded. To protect his own position, at every stage, relayed the lies upward or compounded them."" (15) ""Seated at the top of a teetering pyramid of falsehood, poring over reams of figures that had little basis in reality, were the economic mandarins of the State General Planning Committee--Gosplan--in Moscow."" (15) It worries me that Trump and his climate change deniers are setting up something of the same situation here in the US. Facts are not important in this administration. And scientific facts are even less important to the Trumpites. "". . . the plans called for fireproof cables, but when none could be found, the builders simply did the best they could."" (20) ""When the ministry of energy in Moscow learned that the roof of the plant's turbine hall had been covered with highly flammable bitumen, they ordered him to replace it. But the flame-retardent material . . . was not even being manufactured in the USSR, so the Ministry granted Brukhanov an exception, and the bitumen remained."" (20) But when they ordered him to build an ""olympic-sized swimming pool,"" he had to ""hoodwink the state bank"" to build it. He had no choice but to obey the order. Considering all of these facts, it makes me wonder if Chernobyl is the best way to look at nuclear power. The fault lies more with the communist system and its lack of regulatory power. People always think of communist systems as having too many regulations. In reality, communism has few regulations because it is all about the power at the top, like with Trump. The goal was to build ""increasingly gigantic stations throughout the western territories of the Union. By the end of the century, Moscow intended Chernobyl to be one part of a dense network of atomic power megacomplexes."" (20) In spite of ""alarming building faults,"" the work kept on. On pages 62 to 63, the designers saw ""no need to prepare for such a calamity"" in reference to the worst possible scenarios. All warnings about the dangers were ignored. Former Chernobyl chief engineer Nikolai Steinberg said that the origins of the disaster lay in a combination of ""scientific, technological, socioeconomic, and human factors"" unique to the USSR. (347) The Soviet Union ""lacked even rudimentary safety practices."" They ""relied upon its operators to behave with robotic precision night after night."" They were under ""constant pressure to beat deadlines."" All of this made ""disregard for the letter of the regulations almost inevitable."" The deceased operators of Control Room Number Four ""had brought the reactor into an unstable condition, but only on account of the acute pressure they felt to complete the test on the turbine."" (347) ""Some environmentalists argued that humanity could not afford to turn its back on the promise and terrors of the peaceful atom. The global need for electricity was increasing exponentially: humanity was predicted to double the amount of energy it used by 2050. Despite the growing certainty that burning fossil fuels was the cause of devastating climate change--making the stabilization of carbon emissions imperative--coal remained the most widely used source of energy in the world. The fine particulates from fossil fuel plants in the United States killed more than thirteen thousand people a year; worldwide, three million people died annually as a result of air pollution released by coal- and oil-fueled power stations. Even to begin to head off climate change over the coming thirty-five years would have to be clean, yet neither wind, solar, hydroelectric, nor geothermal power--nor any combination of them--had the potential to bridge the gap."" (357 to 358) ""And at last, more than seventy years after the technology's inception, engineers were finally developing reactors with design priorities that lay not in making bombs but in generating electricity. In principle, these fourth-generation reactors would be cheaper, safer, smaller, more efficient, and less poisonous than their predecessors and could yet prove to be the technology that saves the world."" (358) There is a ""liquid fluoride thorium reactor (LFTR)"" developed at Tennessee's Oak Ridge National Laboratory that is fueled by ""thorium. More plentiful and far harder to process into bomb-making material than uranium, thorium also burns more efficiently in a reactor and could produce less hazardous radioactive waste with half-lives of hundreds, not tens of thousands, of years. . . . It does not require a massive containment building to guard against loss-of-coolant accidents or explosions and can be constructed on such a compact scale that every steel mill or small town could have its own microreactor tucked away underground."" (358) ""In 2015, Bill Gates had begun funding research projects similar to these fourth-generation reactors in a quest to create a carbon-neutral power source for the future. By then, the Chinese government had already set seven hundred scientists on a crash program to build the world's first industrial thorium reactor as part of a war on pollution. 'The problem of coal has become clear,' the engineering director of the project said. 'Nuclear power provides the only solution.'"" (358) I was selective in my quotes. The question now is, Must we turn to nuclear power as a last resort to get out of the mess of climate change? I would be interested in your responses. "

It handles an amazingly complicated subject and history, and a massive cast of Soviet names, and somehow keeps it all clear even for non-scientist reader. If you're too young to remember Chernobyl, read this (and watch the HBO miniseries). If you are old enough to remember Chernobyl (and perhaps even Three Mile Island), read this anyway. It's frightening, compelling, brilliant, and vital as we try to ward off climate change and turn to energy sources other than fossil fuels. "

Senior Lieutenant Alexander Logachev loved radiation the way other men loved their wives. Tall and good-looking, twenty-six years old, with close-cropped dark hair and ice-blue eyes, Logachev had joined the Soviet army when he was still a boy. They had trained him well. The instructors from the military academy outside Moscow taught him with lethal poisons and unshielded radiation. He traveled to the testing grounds of Semipalatinsk in Kazakhstan, and to the desolte East Urals Trace, where the fallout from a clandestine radioactive accident still poisoned the landscape; eventually, Logachev’s training took him even to the remote and forbidden islands of Novaya Zemlya, high in the Arctic Circle and ground zero for the detonation of the terrible Tsar Bomba, the largest thermonuclear device in history.
Although I haven’t been born at the time of the Chernobyl disaster, the events of that time have fascinated me for years. This is probable also due to the fact that my parents, who were living in Poland during the catastrophe, were directly affected by the radioactive cloud. I have seen nearly every documentary that exists and I also found the HBO miniseries amazing! So amazing that every day I look skeptically in the direction of the nuclear power plant that stands here around the corner. So, it was clear that I would read this book the moment I heard about it for the first time. And even if, unfortunately, I had little time to read due to university and private courses, in the end it was absolutely worth! __________________________________________In the book, first there are some maps and overviews showing, among other things, Russia and the location of Pripyat and the construction of Unit Four of the Chernobyl Nuclear Plant (Tschernobylska AES im. W. I. Lenina). This is followed by a list of key persons and their function within the catastrophy. Then, the “story” begins.Journalist Higginbotham describes his incredibly well-researched information as far as possible in chronological order, sometimes even to the nearest second. It starts before the catastrophe and provides information on how the nuclear industry has built up in the USSR, how atomgrad* Pripyat was formed and how the nuclear power plant came online, years before the big mistake that was due to humane and machine failures.Within the text numerous, sometimes very scientific information, can be found – for example, how radiation works or that men radiate more than women due to their higher muslce mass. For me, there were actually some new things that I did not know before!In the further process, Higginbotham describes the events from the point of view of the varius persons: Director Brukhanov, scientist Legassov or the firefighters, who were unsuspecting at the scene and sealed their death with their intervention, but prevented a major catastrophe. Personally, this chapter has hit me the most, as I do not want to imagine how they must have felt in this situation.After detailed descriptions of the events at the plant and politics, which among other things led to the collapse of the Soviet Union, Higginbotham gives an insight into the current situation in the Ukraine: Among other things, he conducted interviews with people who vere involved in the disaster and he visits the ghost town of Pripyat. Attached are a glossary with all the important technical terms in the field of nuclear energy and images of the people and places mentioneds in the book. __________________________________________Even though the book requires a lot of concentration and you need a little more time to understand everything, it was absolutely worth to read this book! I would recommend it to anyone – whether he has already experienced the disaster or was born later. The topic is more present after the accident in Japan and should be known to everyone. For those who, like me, are interested in the events during that time, the book is an absolute must have!"

The damage was horizontal, soaring on winded wings as far as Sweden and that’s when sh*t really got real - don’t 🙄 at your mother, Dorothy Zbornak! Where do you think Stan got his weirdness?So Gorbachev’s all open door and honesty’s the best policy - well, how do you like them dosimeters? Open door policy, my foot! That’s how some cities knew what happened! They took radioactive readings off the sandals of a lady who just traveled to Pripyat. Gorby didn’t tell them. It was the shoes!Back to my story: So we got bureaucrats on the ground, fires blazing in the central core, 1,200 Kievan buses evac’ing the city and no clue how to stop this giant wildebeest from exploding again, China Syndrome style. Meanwhile: The winds have blown ... now we gotta evac another 116k people in the newly designated “Exclusion Zone” (though later they’d rename it the “Nuclear Reservation” like that helps), but the story of Chernobyl doesn’t stop there!

Don’t worry though, they moved everyone to Slavutych, another atomgrad, and hey, the world makes sense again!That’s how we tell stories in Sicily! Obviously, loved this one! It is a little dry, but as you can see, it’s hard to write without judgement. Higginbotham does just the facts, no sass and still tells the story in a way that’s both completely understandable and emotionally harrowing all at the same time. Very well done!"

That being said, this was still a fascinating detailed look on the events that caused the accidents and the actions taken afterward. It was a perfect storm of horrible events and it really will get your heart racing as the author gives you a near minute by minute account.

So difficult to grasp the enormity of this as a real event. The horrific descriptions of ailments to the ones who suffered exposure was intense and necessary. Everyone should real this book. Everyone. 
224,1501134612,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2168708-marta,5,"Astonishing, thrillingly written, with a lot of new information, including the causes of the accident. I have bought this on audio and listened to it; but I missed so much information that I am listening to it again. It is thrilling the second time as well, and this time I can put the stories of the people more into context. My family was also interested so I bought a print copy as well. I am using it to look up names, and there are pictures as well. I stopped listening second time about halfway through - the pandemic happened and I am tired of bad news. This is a thrilling telling of a cautionary tale about the dangers of arrogance dealing with the forces of nature. The minimizing, denials, trying to cover it up, confused scrambling to stall an even bigger disaster - all echo in the reaction of the US government to the pandemic in the last weeks/months. The arrogance and the wishful thinking that made the disaster so much worse are just as present now. Leaders need to read history - and we elected one that expressly disdains science, reading, and history. This is of course wholly unfair to the people in the Chernobyl catastrophe. There was a lot of heroism, and some ofticials showed remarkable leadership. Which is why I felt most enraged when those operators who gave their lives willingly and performed heroics to save the reactor in the first hours of the disaster, were scapegoated. These people were heroes (well, some, I have no sympathy for plant director Brukhanov), and they were tried as criminals, some declared as such posthumously. The world was told at the time that the accident was caused by careless operators who conducted a test and disabled the safety systems. But in reality, the RBMK reactor had multiple design flaws and the accident was waiting to happen. One of those was in the emergency shutdown. When the Chernobyl operators realized they had trouble, they initiated a shutdown by dropping all safety rods - but instead of shutting down, the reactor went critical - because of the rods were graphite-tipped! The designers have discovered this flaw years before, but they thought it was unlikely to happen. (Arrogance and negligence). It was only an issue if most control rods were withdrawn - which was the case at Chernobyl, due to the other major flaw of the reactor, the positive void coefficient (Google it). This basically made it unsafe to operate the reactor at low power levels, which the designers also discovered, but all they did was sent a new operating manual, without explaining why this was important. Experienced operators did learn that the reactor got unstable at lower power levels, from experience, but did not know that it could be a safety risk. So when the manager of the tests wanted to perform it at low power levels, one protested - but he was overruled and threatened of being fired. Presumably the manager wanted to be safer... and thus the reactor went to overdrive with the lower powerlevel, so they withdrew the rods - then tried to shut down. Boom.All this has been previously detected as a risk, and ignored. Then came the fallout.Read this - but maybe not during a pandemic."
225,1501134612,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8413178-liam,5,"I, like everybody else, have been entranced by HBO's Chernobyl. Watching it, I realised how little I really knew about the disaster despite having spent untold hours wandering around in the fictional version of the Zone in the STALKER games.Much like most people I imagine, I was kind of astounded by how huge a disaster it actually was, and how close it came to being so much worse. I kind of ran under the assumption that the HBO show was dramatised to a certain extent, because how could I have possibly not heard that there was a distinct possibility that Reactor 4 would explode again with the force of several atomic bombs? - but no, this actually occurred.Higginbotham's writing is detached, which somehow makes it all the more impactful - dry descriptions of Pripyat firefighters experiencing 'violent diarrhea' in the days following the initial explosion, which was determined to be 'their intestines liquefying' is one example I'm going to have trouble forgetting.As a companion to the show, Midnight in Chernobyl was excellent. I didn't plan it out that way, but events in the show as I watched it every few nights kind of lined up to the events in the book as I listened to it on my way to and from work, expanding and providing further detail, or refuting the more dramatised parts of the show. Legasov for example is portrayed a lot more heroic in the show, routinely martyring himself before the Communist Party for the good of all - whereas he was far more likely to toe the Party line in real life, and only repented soon before his death.Midnight in Chernobyl is a fantastic in-depth exploration of the disaster - causes and repercussions, and it has certainly sparked interest in the topic for myself. An excellently written book, very well read by Jacques Roy. Highly recommend."
226,1501134612,http://goodreads.com/user/show/23195904-radiantflux,4,"72nd book for 2019.Friends have told me lots of good things about the HBO series on Chernobyl, too bad that many of its details are inaccurate, and will become fact in many people's minds. If, instead, you want to know the true story read Higginbotham's fine book, which does an excellent job of not only describing in a blow-by-blow fashion the disaster and it's aftermath, but places the disaster in the broader context of Soviet society and rule. 4-stars."
227,1501134612,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5072847-will-ansbacher,5,"Well written, fast paced and unbelievable action – this would be a terrific disaster thriller if it wasn’t actually all true.Adam Higginbotham has done a simply brilliant job of researching and writing about the world’s worst nuclear disaster, with a style that’s riveting yet balanced and without hyperbole. It opens with a couple of pages describing Civil Defence responders’ panic as they first realize the extent of the radioactive horror they’d been catapulted into. From that initial adrenalin burst, the first part of the story (titled Birth of a City) goes back to the origins of nuclear power development in Russia and the founding of the atomic city of Pripyat, and is interleaved with the events surrounding the explosion of reactor #4 and the immediate after-effects. The longer part two (Death of an Empire) covers the awful radiation effects, the mainly futile clean-up attempts, the cover-ups, denials, excruciating investigations and show trials; at the same time providing insight into the breakup of the USSR. (If Chernobyl wasn’t the catalyst that led to the end of the Soviet Union, then it certainly was a major factor). The story ends with more recent developments, including interviews the author had with those involved - at least, those who still were alive after 2006.This changing focus is a really effective way of dealing with a highly complex subject that could otherwise have been quite dry. Interestingly, I thought, the structure mirrors radiation poisoning itself: the initial terrifying experience of acute exposure and a short period of apparent recovery, but followed by the much longer and agonizing progress of an array of worsening symptoms. I won’t go into the story itself, (this  NY Times review is a great summary). But I was struck by a few recurrent themes:One, the cynical way disasters were suppressed so nobody could ever learn from previous mistakes;Two, the culture of craven compliance that prevented anyone from speaking out about known problems; (Together, these made not only the reactor explosion inevitable but the aftermath about as bad as it could possibly be)Three, the casual attitudes – bordering on macho defiance - to radiation dangers;And four, the sheer resilience of the Russian and Ukrainian people – both workers at the plant and the general population - in the face of all the horrors that were thrown at them. (Though these last two are as much the result of the authorities ruthlessly suppressing information) A ton of authoritative information has become available over the last 30 years, and Higginbotham seems to have read it all - there are 100 pages of end notes alone. However in order not to interrupt the flow he wisely left all the cross-referencing to the end, where a few relevant words in each note point to the text. There is also an extensive bibliography and a short but useful cast of characters ... Ligachev? Logachev? Legasov? ... which I found I had to flip back to often. There is still much we don’t know about Chernobyl, but to understand the disaster and what it means, I don’t think you could do better than this book. It isn’t perfect of course; Higginbotham didn’t explain some of the radiation physics or its effects on humans too well, but for this non-technical account it’s more than good enough."

Despite the scientific leanings (some of which was over my head) it was immensely readable account of the event. There was background relating to the construction of the nuclear reactor and a minute by minute, hour by hour account of the disaster itself as it unfolded on April 26, 1986. Then the aftermath, the world-wide scale of international proportions, the denial, the cover-up, the prosecution and trials that followed were riveting reading. If you’re in the mood for some serious non-fiction, this is it! Four stars from me. "

230,1501134612,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11701608-barbara,5,"10+stars: Oh My Dear Lord, this novel will scare the beejesus out of you. Journalist Adam Higgnbothem has written an amazing documentary of the 1986 catastrophe at the Chernobyl nuclear plant in the USSR. I listened to the audible production that is narrated by Jacques Roy. At the beginning, Roy lists all the important characters in this story. Since I listened to it, I was at a disadvantage keeping all the players straight in my head. If one wants to truly understand the politics, lies, radiation illnesses, etc, that involved each character, one should read the novel. As an American listener, all those Russian names were difficult to keep in my mind.That said, it is an amazing listen. Just getting the timeline of events, the mistakes, the horror of the disaster while listening is enough for me. This tragedy was a culmination of mistakes. Although the USSR wanted to lay blame on separate individuals, Higgenbothem shows that is was straws, that individually wouldn’t be the blame, but added together resulted in a global tragedy. Also, it was the political pressure and the culture of Russia at that time that lead to the explosion. Russia wanted to save face which added layers to the event that cost thousands of lives. The government secrecy magnified mistakes.Higgenbothem exposes the devastating losses and damages to humans, the landscape, and animals. Once the catastrophe made global news, he explains the collective efforts made to find solutions. Nuclear energy seems here to stay. Creating safe nuclear energy is paramount to the safety and survival of the earth. Making worker education a priority is a necessity. We must remain aware and well informed of the cost/benefit of producing nuclear energy. This is an amazing case study."
231,1501134612,http://goodreads.com/user/show/92319245-mona,4,"This is probably one of the most comprehensive books about Cherbobyl disaster. Author and his multiple researchers did a great job going through documentation, books, articles and statements. They also interviewed quite a few people who participated in described events.Book is well written and narrative is concise. Author guides a reader through basics of physics and construction necessary to understand the events properly. I specifically liked the description of research done on the reactor which were conducted few years after the disaster. I was not familiar with those findings.When it comes to shortcomings of this book - it was written by Brit living in the US and this Western point of view is very clear here. I felt the narration had lingering condescending and superior tone to it, what at points became quite annoying. I think the author did not have a good understanding of Russian culture and mentality (particularly noted during his last interview with the plant director) and he undermined the value of some heroic acts done by firefighters and soldiers after the disaster. This is not the first book I read on this topic and I think Russian and Ukrainian writers are much better in this area for obvious reasons.This is a great book for Westerners who know nothing or close to nothing about Charnobyl disaster and would like to have a general overview. Kinda ""all you can eat""..... but not a white cloth."

It was as good a read as any gripping thriller with the downside that this is not fiction but reality. The details that went into the descriptions, the inclusion of all the main witnesses and victims of the accident was astounding. What a great achievement and testament to a horrific event!"

''But when I went back to Ukraine, they started telling me about people who had died. Was it due to radiation? I don't know. I don't understand anything about statistics. But, when my friends ask me about it, I tell them: the less you think about it, the longer you'll live.''Midnight in Chernobyl autora Adama Higginbothama enciklopedijski je uvid u najveću nuklearnu katastrofu koja se dogodila u Černobilju, u Ukrajini 26.aprila 1986. godine.Priča o najvećoj nesreći jedne države, grada, političkog i državnog uređenja, počinje u trenutku kada se postavljaju temelji za građenje ovog nukelarnog postrojenja 1970. godine i rađanja grada u kome su živjeli ljudi zaposleni na izgradnji, kao i radnici predviđeni da rade u novootvorenoj centrali.U jeku hladnog rata Sovjetski savez se svim silama trudio da ukroti atom, da svijetu podari sliku o naučnim dostignućima bez premca, a ljudi su uživali u plodovima svog rada, bezbrižni, poletni i vjerni državi koja im je stvorila atomski grad Pripjat, obezbjedila udobnost sadašnjosti i velike planove za budućnost.Ali sovjetski naučnici koji su radili pod okriljem jednog zatvorenog i ambicioznog sistema, zatvarali su oči pred bilo kakvim greškama na koje su upozoravani prilikom izrade nuklearnih reaktora RBMK-1000 (koji je i eksplodirao u Černobilju), sve mane koje su nesumnjivo postojale držane su u strogoj tajnosti, a sve, naizgled, male stvari dovele su do katastrofe koja je, prema mnogima, dovela i do raspada SSSR-a.Autor se kroz brojne izvore ovim događajem bavio sa naučnog, političkog, socijalnog i ljudskog aspekta, hirurški precizno kombinujući dešavanja u Černobilju sa sudbinama stanovnika Pripjata, koji nesvjesni onoga što ih je snašlo odlaze iz svojih domova, dok radijacija bjesomučno prekriva kvadratne kilometre gradova, tokove rijeka, dječije igračke, kućne ljubimce i tijela svih koji su učestvovali u saniranju posljedica eksplozije.Usljed loše izrađenog reaktora, kojim su upravljali ambiciozni i često nestručni ljudi, zaslijepljeni egom i grandioznošću, 26.aprila 1986. godine desio se početak kraja jednog doba, zapečanjen sudbinama nekih običnih ljudi koji su na poziv domovine golim rukama uklanjali radioaktivni materijal, koji su u sobama Bolnice broj šest ostavljali svoje živote, koji su gradili sarkofag iznad uništenog reaktora u uslovima visoke radijacije kobne po ljudsko zdravlje.A put kojim se došlo do toga, kao i njegove posljedice Adam Higginbotham predstavio je na opširan, zanimljiv i stručan način, te ostavio još jedno važno svjedočanstvo o ovom događaju.P.S. Ponovo preporučujem da pogledate HBO mini seriju Chernobyl, s obzirom da je nakon gledanja mnogo lakše shvatiti suštinu ove knjige, kao i komplikovane opise načina rada nuklearnog reaktora.''Amid the chaos of the collapsing empire, most of the men and women who had fought the Battle of Chernobyl were forgotten - the final defenders of a nation that had seemingly vanished overnight.''"
237,1501134612,http://goodreads.com/user/show/684704-morgan,5,"It took fourteen days to read, but I was riveted and fascinated the entire time. I am too young to remember the Chernobyl melt down when the event took place in 1986, but I'm certain it's an event that contributed to my very vague, yet frightening notions of the war grown ups referred to as Cold.Later in life, I discovered pictures of Pripyat -an abandoned and radioactive city. These images captivated and haunted me. Yet, why did Chernobyl really melt down, and could other nuclear power plants face such demise? (An uneasy question for someone who heard a nuclear power plant's monthly test sirens while sitting in her high school classes.)This book delivered a lot of information - from how nuclear fission takes place, to who were the people on the ground before, during, and after the explosions in 1986. For me, the science bits were just enough - explained with clarity, yet never cumbersome or off-putting. (I'm language oriented, so science text books are off-putting for me personally.) But, the heart of this book is the people you meet. The firemen, the young nuclear engineers, an architect mapping out an ideal city, people loyal (albeit, questionably) to their county and the beliefs it strived to uphold. Midnight in Chernobyl portrayed a nuclear power plant, its atomgard, and its people with such distinction, that it was hard to shake any of these elements even when the book was closed. That childhood fear of the Cold War and nuclear weapons crept into my dreams, waking me with fears of radiation exposure and an urgency to find my children. A fleeting moment later, and my comfortable reality reasserted itself; but I wanted to know more, to understand more about an era in history - and about our future.It's quite a read. I'll eagerly offer it up to other readers as a worthy title. **(I already have - my apologies to those who came to my family's cook-out over the weekend who listened to me chatter on about a nuclear meltdown, when all they wanted to do was enjoy some pulled pork and spare ribs. I really do try to keep the overzealous librarian in me at bay during large social events, but alas, this title was just too good.)"
238,1501134612,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5862503-sweetwilliam,5,"Rarely do I read a book of 385 pages in 3 or 4 sittings but this book was engrossing. I started it on a Thursday and finished it over the weekend. It is an indictment of a flawed system of government. I watched the Chernobyl mini-series several times. Had not my son given this book to me as a birthday present, I probably wouldn’t have read it but I’m glad I did. A miniseries cannot delve into the details and provide all the interesting backstories and other essential information intrinsic to this story. The reactor was of a flawed design. This disaster was bound to happen sooner or later. Previous accidents had been swept under the rug. Soviet prestige was at stake and this was more important than the safety of the people or the planet. There was no oversight. In fact on page 323, Acadamician Valery Legasov realized “…the true scope of the decay at the heart of the [Soviet] nuclear state: The culture of secrecy and complacency, the arrogance and negligence and the shoddy standards of design and construction.”  On page 327 the author explains that the explosion was the last straw of a failing system:The most destructive forces unleashed by the explosion of Reactor Number Four were not radiological but political and economic. The cloud of radiation that spread out across Europe, making the catastrophe impossible to conceal had forced the touted openness of Gorbachev’s glasnost on even the most reluctant conservatives in the Politburo. Even the nuclear bureaucracy had been undermined by secrecy, incompetence, and stagnation convinced him that the entire state was rotten. Perestroika was launched in a desperate bid to save the Socialist experiment before it was too late. But all this did was to promote discussion on other censored topics such as drug addiction, abortion, Afghan war, and the horrors of Stalinism.Thus the author argues, the Chernobyl disaster brought down an empire. It is a fascinating read."
239,1501134612,http://goodreads.com/user/show/284714-kasandra,4,"This is a fascinating, horrifying, depressing, and enlightening read, with tons of details I'd never heard or learned before. What's most terrifying is how much the chances of this were known inside the former Soviet Union and covered up for years (along with previous accidents). The heroism of many Russians is astounding in dealing with this crisis, as is the callousness of others. A warning for the nuclear energy industry and all of us, about how quickly this technology can spiral out of control without transparency, honesty, readiness for all emergencies, and even with all proper planning - how quickly we can destroy ourselves and our environment due to simple human error and pride. Incredibly well-reported and thorough, and highly recommended."
240,1501134612,http://goodreads.com/user/show/34570157-jenny-jo-weir,4,Wow! This one was a hard read. The whole time I'm thinking about all that radiation and the effects of the explosion. The amount of people affected by this and the cost of this unfortunate event were unprecedented. You can't help but feel bad fro all the people involved and for all the victims. It's something that sticks with you. 
241,1501134612,http://goodreads.com/user/show/38617426-juli,4,"Interest in the Chernobyl nuclear disaster has spiked since the award winning HBO mini-series aired. I watched the show and listened to HBO's accompanying podcast and several other podcast episodes on the accident and its aftermath. Several of the podcasts mentioned this book, so I secured a spot on the library's wait list for the audiobook. I'm glad I did! This book is excellent!Higginbotham outlines the buildup of the soviet power grid and nuclear technology. Along the way there were accidents, cost cutting measures that had disastrous effects, mismanagement, poor training and flawed maintenance. All the mistakes culminated in the explosion at Chernobyl on April 25, 1986.Higginbotham gives details about the people involved, the plant itself, the history of Soviet nuclear power, the accident, the evacuation of Pripyat, and the continuing aftermath of the accident. It's a very interesting, and concerning, story. Many countries have nuclear power plants now. It's an awesome way to generate electricity, unless there is an accident. In recent years, the Fukushima accident shows that an earthquake or other natural event can cause modern nuclear plants to become quite dangerous. But with mismanagement, bad maintenance, lackluster employee training and shoddy parts/construction, any nuclear plant can be potentially dangerous. With more countries around the world turning to nuclear power, the chances of an accident increase.....I remember news reports in 1986 about the event. I can remember initial reports stating that it was known there had been some sort of nuclear event in the Soviet Union but scientists were not sure what had happened and no information was being released by USSR officials. When the full truth came out, it was horrifying. An entire city evacuated. Firemen and emergency response personnel dying. The struggle to prevent a melt-down. 33 years later, many are still interested in the accident and the lasting damage it caused. Pripyat is becoming a tourist attraction even. Yikes! I can think of much better vacation sites than one that is completely irradiated. Pripyat, and the surrounding region, will be not be safely habitable for more than 20,000 years.Nuclear power is safe when handled responsibly by properly trained people. Most plants operating in the modern world are quite safe, and managed/maintained properly. But, a nuclear power plant can be potentially deadly if proper safety protocols are not strictly adhered to and the potential effects of natural disasters and other catastrophes are not properly taken into consideration. I hope it is a very, very long time -- or never -- that our planet ends up with another uninhabitable, radiation soaked region from a nuclear accident. The effects are long lasting, and far reaching.Great book! Lots of highly researched information presented in an interesting manner. The audio book is about 14 hours long and narrated by Jacques Roy. Roy reads at a steady pace. His voice is easily understandable. Very enjoyable listening experience!"
242,1501134612,http://goodreads.com/user/show/352711-leftbanker,5,"I began this book out of desperation from the cliff-hanger of episode 2 of Chernobyl on HBO, one of the best TV dramas I’ve ever watched. Like the series, the pacing and tone of this account reads like the best of thrillers and I literally couldn’t put it down. I’m old enough to have vivid recollections of the event as it was unfolding. My USAF unit stationed in Athens, Greece, received intelligence on the crisis well ahead of the local news. We knew that it was a nuclear accident well before the Soviets admitted to this fact, but what we didn’t know was just how close the world was to a bigger, unspeakable disaster. This news really wasn’t available for years after the events of April 1986. The world had moved on. I had all but forgotten Chernobyl until this brilliant series came over the horizon. A viewer of the series wrote, “The tragedy will live forever because of this haunting masterpiece, what a brilliant creative achievement.” I could say the same for this book. Informative, objective, and written with a breath-taking pace, I couldn’t recommend it more highly to anyone looking to become better informed on the events of Chernobyl, both when it happened, and in the years since.It’s hard to laugh when you’re reading in the fetal position, but this part struck me as the epitome of gallows humor. One nuclear scientist working on cleaning up the disaster gives safety advice to another nuclear scientist just arriving, “If you smell ozone, run!”The big surprise is that the death toll wasn’t tens of times greater than the reality. Of course, we may never know the true results of the accident as Soviet record keeping tended to down-play cancer deaths which may have been related to Chernobyl.The most terrifying aspect of all is to consider how our leaders today would deal with a disaster on this order. Even the monumentally corrupt Soviets of that era had some highly intelligent, rational people among them, which is more than you can say of Putin and Trump, and their flunkies. Trump prevaricates on matters of little or no importance; imagine his response on this sort of travesty."
243,1501134612,http://goodreads.com/user/show/714583-anita-pomerantz,3,"This book is sooo highly rated and was listed as ""best non-fiction"" by numerous sources in 2019. All I have to say is I wish I read Voices from Chernobyl: The Oral History of a Nuclear Disaster instead. This book was just boring unless you like reading a lot about engineering and the technical structure of power plants and buildings. In addition, there are a zillion Russian names, and even with Kindle X-Ray and a guide to who was who, I struggled because the people just were not brought to life for me.This is reporting. It's very strong reporting, and it unveils the type of cover-up that makes you worried about government and implies that conspiracy theories can be true. The story is important. I just did not find it interesting because of the absolute overload of details, many of which were beyond my understanding or ability to picture. Maybe my timing in picking up this one was just way off . . .as we are in the middle of a crisis ourselves, my concentration is pretty shot. So, judge this one by the reviews of others. I just can barely bring myself to give it 3 stars. "
244,1501134612,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5349403-carolyn,4,"The author has written an impressive, comprehensive book of historical importance. It brings to light events surrounding the Chernobyl catastrophe of 1986 which may be unknown to many in the Western world, and even to the Russian people. The author presents a crash course in nuclear physics and energy, simplified as much as possible. This may present difficulties for the average reader without some background knowledge. I thought the human factor surrounding the disaster to be interesting and appreciated that the book included a summary list of the Cast of Characters and their positions and involvement with Chernobyl. The book emphasized the social/political Cold War mentality, economic factors, technical failures, the cut-throat ambition of the politicians and their secrecy which led to public complacency or wild rumours. Reaction time was slow due to uncertainty and arguments about the best course of action. I feel this is the definitive book of situations leading up to the disaster, what happened when Reactor 4 malfunctioned causing a huge surge of radiation, and its aftermath. The history is impeccable and thoroughly researched and stands as a sample for other writers of historical events and will be the definitive book on Chernobyl.The Chernobyl atomic complex was built to produce cheap electricity for a vast surrounded area, and to establish the Soviet Union ’s predominance in nuclear power. The disaster occurred in Reactor #4 on April 26, 1986. A model town, Pripyat, was built in the wilderness area close to the Nuclear Plant to house tens of thousands of workers and their families. From rough, cold shacks inhabited by the early builders, it grew into an impressive town with 3 schools, 35 playgrounds, 3 swimming pools, a library, sports facility and shopping center. Groceries and goods in the stores were more varied and abundant than in cities of origin of most of the workers. No expense was spared in planting trees and importing flowering shrubs to enhance the blocks of apartments. The nuclear accident which occurred resulted in a coverup where plant workers and women and children were not aware of the danger to their lives and health from nuclear fallout.there were cultural and political reasons contributing to lack of safety. Poor building design, shoddy materials, forced deadlines for builders and plant workers to meet, incompetent and negligent staff without knowledge of dangers they faced. There had been a smaller explosion at another plant and plenty of malfunctions but they were ignorant of possible critical problems. After the reactor imploded and seemed to be going into meltdown, releasing radiation far and wide, members of the emergency response team who did know the peril were either forced to stop the leak or went in willingly out of patriotic duty.  Following the disaster, people of Pripyat went about their lives ignorant of dangers from radioactive fallout. During this time a gathering of academics, Generals and politicians argued about the course they needed to take but were mainly concerned with secrecy. Finally, it was decided to evacuate the town of 51,000 people but leaving behind 4,000 essential service workers. People being evacuated were led to believe that they would only be away from home a couple of days and to bring only essentials for a short stay. Immediately after the explosion, there were two deaths of reactor workers.28 died soon of acute radiation sickness.. Evacuation orders soon included 90,000 people within a 30 K radius. High radiation levels soon spread to areas distant from Chernobyl and was detected in Sweden, Belarus and Poland. By May 20, 95,000 people had been hospitalized. High levels of radioactivity had already reached the capital, Kiev. May Day celebrations were carried out in the open air. Soon over 300,000 children were ordered evacuated from Kiev, along with expectant and nursing mothers (about 1/5 of the population). Teams were hired to shoot 20,000 domestic animals left behind.  We will never know how many people died over the years from radiation-induced cancers, as doctors were pressed not to mention a possible connection. Once the danger of a meltdown had eased and the reactor was covered with a dome, it was felt necessary to lay blame. Six plant officials were put on trial resulting in prison sentences. Official statements refused to place blame on faulty building materials, reactor design flaws, or the irresponsibility and poor discipline of the plant workers present when the disaster occurred. They had been conducting a safety inspection to simulate a power failure and did not follow the procedure properly outlined on a checklist. The author emphasizes the social/political Cold War mentality. The secrecy of generals and politicians which led to wild rumours or complacency subsequently caused the people to distrust in their leaders. Economic factors due to the billions of rubles spent on evacuation, housing, pay for thousands of emergency workers, and the deactivating the reactor was a great financial loss for the country. The author feels this was a major factor contributing to the breakup of the Soviet Union Thanks to NetGalley and Simon & Schuster for an advance copy of this important book."
245,1501134612,http://goodreads.com/user/show/53179837-george,4,"This book covers the events from the construction of the plant to the fall of the Soviet Union, but unlike Serhii Plokhy he does it from the perspective of the people who were actually close enough to absorb the radiation. Mostly he focused on the scientists, workers and liquidators, who had to deal with the clean up. He focused so much on these people that at the beginning of the book there was a list of characters, as if it was a play or something. I've never seen that done with a nonfiction book before, but maybe that was just a quirk of my particular edition. Now, because I have read Chernobyl: History of a Tragedy by Serhii Plokhy I couldn't help but compare these two. Serhii Plokhy covered the construction of the plant and the causes of the explosion itself better then Adam Higginbotham, but Adam didn't just brush of the clean up process. After reading them both I find it that they are both necessary to understand this disaster, just to get all the angles.Lastly, on to the Voices of Chernobyl to see what the ordinary people had to say about this whole mess.

Feeling totally in the dark when it came to information about the accident, my neighbors and I gathered outside our homes and immediately began testing to see which way the winds were blowing, and should we pack up and head in the opposite direction. Living about two and a half hours from the reactor which would eventually partially melt down, we were scared. Up to that time this would be considered the greatest nuclear accident in history being unaware of the Kyshtym Disaster which was a radioactive contamination accident that occurred on September 29, 1957 at Mayak, a plutonium production site in Russia for nuclear weapons and a nuclear fuel reprocessing plant in the Soviet Union. After reading Adam Higginbotham’s new book, MIDNIGHT IN CHERNOBYL: THE UNTOLD STORY OF THE WORLD’S GREATEST NUCLEAR DISASTER, an excellent account of the explosion and meltdown at Chernobyl the evening of April 25-26, 1986 and the ramifications of that disaster, memories of that March day flashed before my eyes.Higginbotham has written the most informative and insightful description of events and analysis of the meltdown that has yet to appear. It replaces Harvard historian, Serhii Plokhy’s CHERNOBYL: A HISTORY OF A NUCLEAR CATASYTROPHE as the most comprehensive and detailed work that has been written. In dealing with events such as Chernobyl one must ask: What happened, why did it happen, and could it happen again? Higginbotham, a journalist and his research partner Taras Shumeyko interviewed numerous eyewitnesses and conducted a prodigious amount of research that included a small number of declassified documents available, and argues that the fanatical view among Soviet bureaucrats and leadership to maintain secrecy, (for example, information about what occurred at Mayak was kept from the public for thirty years) was the reason the accident was so devastating, but also not surprising that it occurred. Higginbotham recreates the disaster providing a history of Soviet nuclear development, including numerous accidents; the planning and building of Chernobyl; the accident; attempts to remediate the situation after it occurred, the trial of the operators who were blamed for the disaster; and other aspects of the aftermath. The book reads in part as narrative history, but also a terrifying account of an event which could easily be repeated today.The plan to build Chernobyl was hatched in February 1970 as a means of catching up to the west and meet Soviet electricity needs. The Soviet Union would engage in a crash program to build nuclear reactors, but the problem was that the project began during a period of economic stagnation with material and resource shortages everywhere. The reactor was to be completed by 1975 which was totally unrealistic due to the approach taken by the Soviet bureaucracy, party elites, and engineers that did not consider shortages, safety needs, and planning for possible future nuclear accidents. The result is that corners were cut in terms of material, training, design flaws, “cooking the books,” and the stubborn nature of the Soviet bureaucracy in charge of construction. As Higginbotham discusses this aspect of the project, he provides the reader an interesting history of the development of radiation, nuclear development, and their affects on people and society. The author’s approach to complex scientific information and jargon is such that it is very easy to understand for the lay reader as he describes how reactors are supposed to be constructed.According to Higginbotham there were design flaws dealing with a high-power channel reactor labeled RMBK. These flaws would dog designers who would pay little attention to test results because of pressure from the Communist Party and the bureaucracy that flowed from it. This made disaster possible because no one knew how the reactor would react in case of an accident. The reactors colossal size made start up and shut down the most demanding and treacherous stages of RMBK operation. The author follows RMBK’s development and its flaws as it went into production, particularly the AZ-5 emergency protection system whose design took too long to respond in an emergency which came home to roost on April 25, 1986.  A similar plant in Leningrad experienced an accident on November 11, 1975 resulting in the release of radiation into the atmosphere over the Gulf of Finland. However, Sredmash, the Soviet agency in charge of production and construction of nuclear reactors covered up the investigative findings of design flaws related to the accident. On September 9, 1982 there was a partial meltdown at Unit 1 at Chernobyl which took eight months to repair, but the KGB instituted a gag order, and the following year a similar accident took place in a Lithuanian reactor and one in Armenia. But the world knew nothing of these accidents. Further exacerbating Soviet nuclear reactor building was the shoddy workmanship that plagued Soviet industry in general, and that carried over to the construction of Chernobyl.  A major problem that arose once Reactor #4 at Chernobyl exploded is that many of those in charge were unprepared to deal with what occurred and succumbed to wishful thinking and self-delusion in approaching how to deal with what had transpired. Higginbotham describes in detail the lethargic Soviet bureaucracy and their response to disaster. Soviet Prime Minister Mikhail Gorbachev was not notified as to what had occurred until the afternoon of April 26, 1986. The author narrates the debates inside the Commission that was set up to oversee the crisis. He relates the personalities involved and their debates on how to respond and their final decision making, many of which were out of some sort of fantasy. An excellent example apart from how to cool the reactor was whether they should evacuate the city of Pripyat and its 50,000 residents who were in danger of radiation exposure which took until April 27th to accomplish. As the radioactive cloud blew over Scandinavia, Swedish, Finish, and Danish diplomats lodged complaints to Moscow once it was realized where the radiation originated resulting in the Soviet government stonewalling. It would take until April 28th at 8:00pm for Moscow to come clean and announce that “an accident had taken place at the Chernobyl nuclear power plant.…One of the atomic reactors has been damaged.” Soviet citizens were used to this type of response as it was a continuation of the way the state had covered industrial accidents for decades.Higginbotham descriptions of helicopter pilots flying low dumping sand and boron on the reactor are harrowing. The author’s approach as he carefully describes how officials, academics, scientists, fire fighters, guards, and others and what they went through is chilling, especially as he brings the reader to Hospital #6 in Moscow created to treat victims of nuclear accidents and war. The ultimate fear was the “China Syndrome,” the further devastation that would occur if the reactor’s foundation exploded and nuclear material leaked into the earth. Even though Moscow TV announced on May 11, 1986 that the primary threat of explosion was over, scientists remained skeptical.The Central Committee of the Politburo decided against Gorbachev’s new policy of Glasnost and followed the traditional approach and blamed “bourgeois falsification….propaganda and inventions” as its immediate reaction, in addition to dishonesty and declining help from the west. This approach would backfire in terms of containing the accident but also hindering Gorbachev’s hope of nuclear disarmament talks with the United States because how could one negotiate with someone who was so untrustworthy.Higginbotham spends a great deal of time describing what the victims of the disaster experienced. He follows the medical care that victims received and for far too many their ultimate deaths. He recounts the bravery of so many who fought to contain the toxic results of the explosion, and countless men who returned to build the sarcophagus that was designed to seal reactor #4 for at least a hundred years. The narrative of how the newly created refugees, numbering over 116,000 from the exclusion zone is told with sensitivity and insight into their future plight. The scapegoating that dominated the investigation by Soviet authorities was appalling as was the propaganda machine that worked overtime to find blame and paint the accident in the best light as possible. The stories are often poignant and provide a true picture of what can happen on a personal and societal level from a nuclear disaster.Perhaps one of the most destructive results of Chernobyl was the beginning of the end of the Soviet Union. Gorbachev realized that even his own nuclear bureaucracy was rotten to the “core” and as was most of the Soviet state. The launching of perestroika opened debate among Soviet citizens that had been dormant, but slowly the issues of Afghanistan, drug addiction, the abortion epidemic, and the horrors of Stalinism emerged. The Russian people began to realize that they had been lied to for decades and as Higginbotham successfully argues they “faced the realization that their leaders were corrupt and that the Communist dream was a sham.”If wonders if a major nuclear accident could occur in the future remind yourself of Fukushima. In 2011, the Tokyo Electric Power Company’s nuclear plant underwent a process identical to Chernobyl; the loss of coolant that provoked a meltdown. As to what remains of Chernobyl itself, it is part of an “exclusion zone” of 1,000 square miles, a radioactive Eden for new wildlife and vegetation. Higginbotham has done the public a favor by exposing the events of April-May 1986 and give us pause as to how we should approach nuclear power in the future."
247,1501134612,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3357765-jimmy,5,"I have long been fascinated with Russia. Russian dissenters have long been my heroes going all the way back to Alexander Solzhenitsyn up to Pussy Riot and Garry Kasparov. It feels like Russia has an inferiority complex. The government is always trying to look bigger and stronger than they really are. Thus the arms buildups, the Olympic obsession, the meddling. In the case of Chernobyl, it was the cover ups, the refusal to admit mistakes, the effort to make the reactor bigger than anything else no matter how many corners had to be cut. As Higginbotham said, ""Lies and deception were endemic to the system, trafficked in both directions along the chain of management: those lower down passed up reports to their superiors packed with falsified statistics and inflated estimates, of unmet goals triumphantly reached, unfulfilled quotas heroically exceeded. To protect his own position, at every stage, relayed the lies upward or compounded them."" (15) ""Seated at the top of a teetering pyramid of falsehood, poring over reams of figures that had little basis in reality, were the economic mandarins of the State General Planning Committee--Gosplan--in Moscow."" (15) It worries me that Trump and his climate change deniers are setting up something of the same situation here in the US. Facts are not important in this administration. And scientific facts are even less important to the Trumpites. "". . . the plans called for fireproof cables, but when none could be found, the builders simply did the best they could."" (20) ""When the ministry of energy in Moscow learned that the roof of the plant's turbine hall had been covered with highly flammable bitumen, they ordered him to replace it. But the flame-retardent material . . . was not even being manufactured in the USSR, so the Ministry granted Brukhanov an exception, and the bitumen remained."" (20) But when they ordered him to build an ""olympic-sized swimming pool,"" he had to ""hoodwink the state bank"" to build it. He had no choice but to obey the order. Considering all of these facts, it makes me wonder if Chernobyl is the best way to look at nuclear power. The fault lies more with the communist system and its lack of regulatory power. People always think of communist systems as having too many regulations. In reality, communism has few regulations because it is all about the power at the top, like with Trump. The goal was to build ""increasingly gigantic stations throughout the western territories of the Union. By the end of the century, Moscow intended Chernobyl to be one part of a dense network of atomic power megacomplexes."" (20) In spite of ""alarming building faults,"" the work kept on. On pages 62 to 63, the designers saw ""no need to prepare for such a calamity"" in reference to the worst possible scenarios. All warnings about the dangers were ignored. Former Chernobyl chief engineer Nikolai Steinberg said that the origins of the disaster lay in a combination of ""scientific, technological, socioeconomic, and human factors"" unique to the USSR. (347) The Soviet Union ""lacked even rudimentary safety practices."" They ""relied upon its operators to behave with robotic precision night after night."" They were under ""constant pressure to beat deadlines."" All of this made ""disregard for the letter of the regulations almost inevitable."" The deceased operators of Control Room Number Four ""had brought the reactor into an unstable condition, but only on account of the acute pressure they felt to complete the test on the turbine."" (347) ""Some environmentalists argued that humanity could not afford to turn its back on the promise and terrors of the peaceful atom. The global need for electricity was increasing exponentially: humanity was predicted to double the amount of energy it used by 2050. Despite the growing certainty that burning fossil fuels was the cause of devastating climate change--making the stabilization of carbon emissions imperative--coal remained the most widely used source of energy in the world. The fine particulates from fossil fuel plants in the United States killed more than thirteen thousand people a year; worldwide, three million people died annually as a result of air pollution released by coal- and oil-fueled power stations. Even to begin to head off climate change over the coming thirty-five years would have to be clean, yet neither wind, solar, hydroelectric, nor geothermal power--nor any combination of them--had the potential to bridge the gap."" (357 to 358) ""And at last, more than seventy years after the technology's inception, engineers were finally developing reactors with design priorities that lay not in making bombs but in generating electricity. In principle, these fourth-generation reactors would be cheaper, safer, smaller, more efficient, and less poisonous than their predecessors and could yet prove to be the technology that saves the world."" (358) There is a ""liquid fluoride thorium reactor (LFTR)"" developed at Tennessee's Oak Ridge National Laboratory that is fueled by ""thorium. More plentiful and far harder to process into bomb-making material than uranium, thorium also burns more efficiently in a reactor and could produce less hazardous radioactive waste with half-lives of hundreds, not tens of thousands, of years. . . . It does not require a massive containment building to guard against loss-of-coolant accidents or explosions and can be constructed on such a compact scale that every steel mill or small town could have its own microreactor tucked away underground."" (358) ""In 2015, Bill Gates had begun funding research projects similar to these fourth-generation reactors in a quest to create a carbon-neutral power source for the future. By then, the Chinese government had already set seven hundred scientists on a crash program to build the world's first industrial thorium reactor as part of a war on pollution. 'The problem of coal has become clear,' the engineering director of the project said. 'Nuclear power provides the only solution.'"" (358) I was selective in my quotes. The question now is, Must we turn to nuclear power as a last resort to get out of the mess of climate change? I would be interested in your responses. "
248,1501134612,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1863589-robert-sheard,5,"This is without question my top nonfiction read of 2019. It handles an amazingly complicated subject and history, and a massive cast of Soviet names, and somehow keeps it all clear even for non-scientist reader. If you're too young to remember Chernobyl, read this (and watch the HBO miniseries). If you are old enough to remember Chernobyl (and perhaps even Three Mile Island), read this anyway. It's frightening, compelling, brilliant, and vital as we try to ward off climate change and turn to energy sources other than fossil fuels. "

Senior Lieutenant Alexander Logachev loved radiation the way other men loved their wives. Tall and good-looking, twenty-six years old, with close-cropped dark hair and ice-blue eyes, Logachev had joined the Soviet army when he was still a boy. They had trained him well. The instructors from the military academy outside Moscow taught him with lethal poisons and unshielded radiation. He traveled to the testing grounds of Semipalatinsk in Kazakhstan, and to the desolte East Urals Trace, where the fallout from a clandestine radioactive accident still poisoned the landscape; eventually, Logachev’s training took him even to the remote and forbidden islands of Novaya Zemlya, high in the Arctic Circle and ground zero for the detonation of the terrible Tsar Bomba, the largest thermonuclear device in history.
Although I haven’t been born at the time of the Chernobyl disaster, the events of that time have fascinated me for years. This is probable also due to the fact that my parents, who were living in Poland during the catastrophe, were directly affected by the radioactive cloud. I have seen nearly every documentary that exists and I also found the HBO miniseries amazing! So amazing that every day I look skeptically in the direction of the nuclear power plant that stands here around the corner. So, it was clear that I would read this book the moment I heard about it for the first time. And even if, unfortunately, I had little time to read due to university and private courses, in the end it was absolutely worth! __________________________________________In the book, first there are some maps and overviews showing, among other things, Russia and the location of Pripyat and the construction of Unit Four of the Chernobyl Nuclear Plant (Tschernobylska AES im. W. I. Lenina). This is followed by a list of key persons and their function within the catastrophy. Then, the “story” begins.Journalist Higginbotham describes his incredibly well-researched information as far as possible in chronological order, sometimes even to the nearest second. It starts before the catastrophe and provides information on how the nuclear industry has built up in the USSR, how atomgrad* Pripyat was formed and how the nuclear power plant came online, years before the big mistake that was due to humane and machine failures.Within the text numerous, sometimes very scientific information, can be found – for example, how radiation works or that men radiate more than women due to their higher muslce mass. For me, there were actually some new things that I did not know before!In the further process, Higginbotham describes the events from the point of view of the varius persons: Director Brukhanov, scientist Legassov or the firefighters, who were unsuspecting at the scene and sealed their death with their intervention, but prevented a major catastrophe. Personally, this chapter has hit me the most, as I do not want to imagine how they must have felt in this situation.After detailed descriptions of the events at the plant and politics, which among other things led to the collapse of the Soviet Union, Higginbotham gives an insight into the current situation in the Ukraine: Among other things, he conducted interviews with people who vere involved in the disaster and he visits the ghost town of Pripyat. Attached are a glossary with all the important technical terms in the field of nuclear energy and images of the people and places mentioneds in the book. __________________________________________Even though the book requires a lot of concentration and you need a little more time to understand everything, it was absolutely worth to read this book! I would recommend it to anyone – whether he has already experienced the disaster or was born later. The topic is more present after the accident in Japan and should be known to everyone. For those who, like me, are interested in the events during that time, the book is an absolute must have!"

Ma!)Boom. Kablewey. You pick. Things burn. 51,300 comrades 💤 (Ma!) in their beds. It was only a 2 minute flight from Reactor 4 to Pripyat. Maybe 10 minutes by car. The radioactive dust took the car. MA!Are you telling this story, Dorothy? The explosion was mostly vertical, but the damage? The damage was horizontal, soaring on winded wings as far as Sweden and that’s when sh*t really got real - don’t 🙄 at your mother, Dorothy Zbornak! Where do you think Stan got his weirdness?So Gorbachev’s all open door and honesty’s the best policy - well, how do you like them dosimeters? Open door policy, my foot! That’s how some cities knew what happened! They took radioactive readings off the sandals of a lady who just traveled to Pripyat. Gorby didn’t tell them. It was the shoes!Back to my story: So we got bureaucrats on the ground, fires blazing in the central core, 1,200 Kievan buses evac’ing the city and no clue how to stop this giant wildebeest from exploding again, China Syndrome style. Meanwhile: The winds have blown ... now we gotta evac another 116k people in the newly designated “Exclusion Zone” (though later they’d rename it the “Nuclear Reservation” like that helps), but the story of Chernobyl doesn’t stop there! Nope...✋ Now we gotta get Reactors 1-3...back...online?? Isn’t that the reason we’re gonna throw 750,000 bio robots at this sucker to begin with?? Not sure what you call *waves hand dramatically* all this, then. Oh right, “nuclear meltdowns don’t happen in the Soviet Union” (Stellan Skarsgard better get an Emmy for that brilliantly executed meltdown!).So here we are, 30 ish years later (ironic that’s the “official” death toll = 31 souls), two sarcophagi, 800 radioactive waste dumps, 4700 km squared of inhabitable land, hu HUM huh of ARS victims (it’s classified. So, of course, they told me, but I’m Sophia Petrillo! I keep my word! I’ll write it down, you throw it in the fireplace!) and a city built specifically to support the wildebeest dies in 16 years. Don’t worry though, they moved everyone to Slavutych, another atomgrad, and hey, the world makes sense again!That’s how we tell stories in Sicily! Obviously, loved this one! It is a little dry, but as you can see, it’s hard to write without judgement. Higginbotham does just the facts, no sass and still tells the story in a way that’s both completely understandable and emotionally harrowing all at the same time. Very well done!"
251,1501134612,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9981052-nicholereadswithcats,5,Very informative. Some of the scientific information was a little over my head but I enjoyed the mix between facts and personal experience. Shocking the lengths which were taken to attempt to cover up what happened. Loved the pictures at the end.

I listened to this rather than reading it and was soon bogged down by the sheer amount of physics detailed; at times I found myself struggling to pay attention. That being said, this was still a fascinating detailed look on the events that caused the accidents and the actions taken afterward. It was a perfect storm of horrible events and it really will get your heart racing as the author gives you a near minute by minute account. Unsettling at moments, and overly technical; this insanely well researched guide is not for the casual reader. This book is heavy; but will change the way you think about Chernobyl forever! "
253,1501134612,http://goodreads.com/user/show/55342889-elizabethanne-olsen,5,Just. Fucking. Fantastic. The descriptions of the destruction seemed so surreal like it was a fictional dystopian novel. So difficult to grasp the enormity of this as a real event. The horrific descriptions of ailments to the ones who suffered exposure was intense and necessary. Everyone should real this book. Everyone. 
254,1501134612,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2168708-marta,5,"Astonishing, thrillingly written, with a lot of new information, including the causes of the accident. I have bought this on audio and listened to it; but I missed so much information that I am listening to it again. It is thrilling the second time as well, and this time I can put the stories of the people more into context. My family was also interested so I bought a print copy as well. I am using it to look up names, and there are pictures as well. I stopped listening second time about halfway through - the pandemic happened and I am tired of bad news. This is a thrilling telling of a cautionary tale about the dangers of arrogance dealing with the forces of nature. The minimizing, denials, trying to cover it up, confused scrambling to stall an even bigger disaster - all echo in the reaction of the US government to the pandemic in the last weeks/months. The arrogance and the wishful thinking that made the disaster so much worse are just as present now. Leaders need to read history - and we elected one that expressly disdains science, reading, and history. This is of course wholly unfair to the people in the Chernobyl catastrophe. There was a lot of heroism, and some ofticials showed remarkable leadership. Which is why I felt most enraged when those operators who gave their lives willingly and performed heroics to save the reactor in the first hours of the disaster, were scapegoated. These people were heroes (well, some, I have no sympathy for plant director Brukhanov), and they were tried as criminals, some declared as such posthumously. The world was told at the time that the accident was caused by careless operators who conducted a test and disabled the safety systems. But in reality, the RBMK reactor had multiple design flaws and the accident was waiting to happen. One of those was in the emergency shutdown. When the Chernobyl operators realized they had trouble, they initiated a shutdown by dropping all safety rods - but instead of shutting down, the reactor went critical - because of the rods were graphite-tipped! The designers have discovered this flaw years before, but they thought it was unlikely to happen. (Arrogance and negligence). It was only an issue if most control rods were withdrawn - which was the case at Chernobyl, due to the other major flaw of the reactor, the positive void coefficient (Google it). This basically made it unsafe to operate the reactor at low power levels, which the designers also discovered, but all they did was sent a new operating manual, without explaining why this was important. Experienced operators did learn that the reactor got unstable at lower power levels, from experience, but did not know that it could be a safety risk. So when the manager of the tests wanted to perform it at low power levels, one protested - but he was overruled and threatened of being fired. Presumably the manager wanted to be safer... and thus the reactor went to overdrive with the lower powerlevel, so they withdrew the rods - then tried to shut down. Boom.All this has been previously detected as a risk, and ignored. Then came the fallout.Read this - but maybe not during a pandemic."
255,1501134612,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8413178-liam,5,"I, like everybody else, have been entranced by HBO's Chernobyl. Watching it, I realised how little I really knew about the disaster despite having spent untold hours wandering around in the fictional version of the Zone in the STALKER games.Much like most people I imagine, I was kind of astounded by how huge a disaster it actually was, and how close it came to being so much worse. I kind of ran under the assumption that the HBO show was dramatised to a certain extent, because how could I have possibly not heard that there was a distinct possibility that Reactor 4 would explode again with the force of several atomic bombs? - but no, this actually occurred.Higginbotham's writing is detached, which somehow makes it all the more impactful - dry descriptions of Pripyat firefighters experiencing 'violent diarrhea' in the days following the initial explosion, which was determined to be 'their intestines liquefying' is one example I'm going to have trouble forgetting.As a companion to the show, Midnight in Chernobyl was excellent. I didn't plan it out that way, but events in the show as I watched it every few nights kind of lined up to the events in the book as I listened to it on my way to and from work, expanding and providing further detail, or refuting the more dramatised parts of the show. Legasov for example is portrayed a lot more heroic in the show, routinely martyring himself before the Communist Party for the good of all - whereas he was far more likely to toe the Party line in real life, and only repented soon before his death.Midnight in Chernobyl is a fantastic in-depth exploration of the disaster - causes and repercussions, and it has certainly sparked interest in the topic for myself. An excellently written book, very well read by Jacques Roy. Highly recommend."

If, instead, you want to know the true story read Higginbotham's fine book, which does an excellent job of not only describing in a blow-by-blow fashion the disaster and it's aftermath, but places the disaster in the broader context of Soviet society and rule. 4-stars."
257,1501134612,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5072847-will-ansbacher,5,"Well written, fast paced and unbelievable action – this would be a terrific disaster thriller if it wasn’t actually all true.Adam Higginbotham has done a simply brilliant job of researching and writing about the world’s worst nuclear disaster, with a style that’s riveting yet balanced and without hyperbole. It opens with a couple of pages describing Civil Defence responders’ panic as they first realize the extent of the radioactive horror they’d been catapulted into. From that initial adrenalin burst, the first part of the story (titled Birth of a City) goes back to the origins of nuclear power development in Russia and the founding of the atomic city of Pripyat, and is interleaved with the events surrounding the explosion of reactor #4 and the immediate after-effects. The longer part two (Death of an Empire) covers the awful radiation effects, the mainly futile clean-up attempts, the cover-ups, denials, excruciating investigations and show trials; at the same time providing insight into the breakup of the USSR. (If Chernobyl wasn’t the catalyst that led to the end of the Soviet Union, then it certainly was a major factor). The story ends with more recent developments, including interviews the author had with those involved - at least, those who still were alive after 2006.This changing focus is a really effective way of dealing with a highly complex subject that could otherwise have been quite dry. Interestingly, I thought, the structure mirrors radiation poisoning itself: the initial terrifying experience of acute exposure and a short period of apparent recovery, but followed by the much longer and agonizing progress of an array of worsening symptoms. I won’t go into the story itself, (this  NY Times review is a great summary). But I was struck by a few recurrent themes:One, the cynical way disasters were suppressed so nobody could ever learn from previous mistakes;Two, the culture of craven compliance that prevented anyone from speaking out about known problems; (Together, these made not only the reactor explosion inevitable but the aftermath about as bad as it could possibly be)Three, the casual attitudes – bordering on macho defiance - to radiation dangers;And four, the sheer resilience of the Russian and Ukrainian people – both workers at the plant and the general population - in the face of all the horrors that were thrown at them. (Though these last two are as much the result of the authorities ruthlessly suppressing information) A ton of authoritative information has become available over the last 30 years, and Higginbotham seems to have read it all - there are 100 pages of end notes alone. However in order not to interrupt the flow he wisely left all the cross-referencing to the end, where a few relevant words in each note point to the text. There is also an extensive bibliography and a short but useful cast of characters ... Ligachev? Logachev? Legasov? ... which I found I had to flip back to often. There is still much we don’t know about Chernobyl, but to understand the disaster and what it means, I don’t think you could do better than this book. It isn’t perfect of course; Higginbotham didn’t explain some of the radiation physics or its effects on humans too well, but for this non-technical account it’s more than good enough."

Despite the scientific leanings (some of which was over my head) it was immensely readable account of the event. There was background relating to the construction of the nuclear reactor and a minute by minute, hour by hour account of the disaster itself as it unfolded on April 26, 1986. Then the aftermath, the world-wide scale of international proportions, the denial, the cover-up, the prosecution and trials that followed were riveting reading.

Since I listened to it, I was at a disadvantage keeping all the players straight in my head. If one wants to truly understand the politics, lies, radiation illnesses, etc, that involved each character, one should read the novel. As an American listener, all those Russian names were difficult to keep in my mind.That said, it is an amazing listen. Just getting the timeline of events, the mistakes, the horror of the disaster while listening is enough for me. This tragedy was a culmination of mistakes. Although the USSR wanted to lay blame on separate individuals, Higgenbothem shows that is was straws, that individually wouldn’t be the blame, but added together resulted in a global tragedy. Also, it was the political pressure and the culture of Russia at that time that lead to the explosion. Russia wanted to save face which added layers to the event that cost thousands of lives. The government secrecy magnified mistakes.Higgenbothem exposes the devastating losses and damages to humans, the landscape, and animals. Once the catastrophe made global news, he explains the collective efforts made to find solutions. Nuclear energy seems here to stay. Creating safe nuclear energy is paramount to the safety and survival of the earth. Making worker education a priority is a necessity. We must remain aware and well informed of the cost/benefit of producing nuclear energy. This is an amazing case study."

Author and his multiple researchers did a great job going through documentation, books, articles and statements. They also interviewed quite a few people who participated in described events.Book is well written and narrative is concise. Author guides a reader through basics of physics and construction necessary to understand the events properly. I specifically liked the description of research done on the reactor which were conducted few years after the disaster. I was not familiar with those findings.When it comes to shortcomings of this book - it was written by Brit living in the US and this Western point of view is very clear here. I felt the narration had lingering condescending and superior tone to it, what at points became quite annoying. I think the author did not have a good understanding of Russian culture and mentality (particularly noted during his last interview with the plant director) and he undermined the value of some heroic acts done by firefighters and soldiers after the disaster. This is not the first book I read on this topic and I think Russian and Ukrainian writers are much better in this area for obvious reasons.This is a great book for Westerners who know nothing or close to nothing about Charnobyl disaster and would like to have a general overview. Kinda ""all you can eat""..... but not a white cloth."
262,1501134612,http://goodreads.com/user/show/56337479-h-a-leuschel,5,"This book is an incredibly well researched documentary of one of the great disasters of the twentieth century. It was as good a read as any gripping thriller with the downside that this is not fiction but reality. The details that went into the descriptions, the inclusion of all the main witnesses and victims of the accident was astounding. What a great achievement and testament to a horrific event!"
263,1501134612,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11658499-dalana-dailey,4,"If the miniseries on HBO piqued your interest, this book will whet your whistle. By the end of it, you'll know all you wanted to know about the disaster and your curiosity will be satisfied. Contains very illuminating information on socialist Russia, nuclear technology, crisis management, and the environmental/public health effects of radiation exposure."
264,1501134612,http://goodreads.com/user/show/12087691-wendyb,5,"Very, very good but not always an easy book to read. So many horrifying moments when I just had to close the book, grieve for the people of Chernobyl, and feel grateful I didn't live in the Soviet Union (Russia).Highly recommended."

''But when I went back to Ukraine, they started telling me about people who had died. Was it due to radiation? I don't know. I don't understand anything about statistics. But, when my friends ask me about it, I tell them: the less you think about it, the longer you'll live.''Midnight in Chernobyl autora Adama Higginbothama enciklopedijski je uvid u najveću nuklearnu katastrofu koja se dogodila u Černobilju, u Ukrajini 26.aprila 1986. godine.Priča o najvećoj nesreći jedne države, grada, političkog i državnog uređenja, počinje u trenutku kada se postavljaju temelji za građenje ovog nukelarnog postrojenja 1970. godine i rađanja grada u kome su živjeli ljudi zaposleni na izgradnji, kao i radnici predviđeni da rade u novootvorenoj centrali.U jeku hladnog rata Sovjetski savez se svim silama trudio da ukroti atom, da svijetu podari sliku o naučnim dostignućima bez premca, a ljudi su uživali u plodovima svog rada, bezbrižni, poletni i vjerni državi koja im je stvorila atomski grad Pripjat, obezbjedila udobnost sadašnjosti i velike planove za budućnost.Ali sovjetski naučnici koji su radili pod okriljem jednog zatvorenog i ambicioznog sistema, zatvarali su oči pred bilo kakvim greškama na koje su upozoravani prilikom izrade nuklearnih reaktora RBMK-1000 (koji je i eksplodirao u Černobilju), sve mane koje su nesumnjivo postojale držane su u strogoj tajnosti, a sve, naizgled, male stvari dovele su do katastrofe koja je, prema mnogima, dovela i do raspada SSSR-a.Autor se kroz brojne izvore ovim događajem bavio sa naučnog, političkog, socijalnog i ljudskog aspekta, hirurški precizno kombinujući dešavanja u Černobilju sa sudbinama stanovnika Pripjata, koji nesvjesni onoga što ih je snašlo odlaze iz svojih domova, dok radijacija bjesomučno prekriva kvadratne kilometre gradova, tokove rijeka, dječije igračke, kućne ljubimce i tijela svih koji su učestvovali u saniranju posljedica eksplozije.Usljed loše izrađenog reaktora, kojim su upravljali ambiciozni i često nestručni ljudi, zaslijepljeni egom i grandioznošću, 26.aprila 1986. godine desio se početak kraja jednog doba, zapečanjen sudbinama nekih običnih ljudi koji su na poziv domovine golim rukama uklanjali radioaktivni materijal, koji su u sobama Bolnice broj šest ostavljali svoje živote, koji su gradili sarkofag iznad uništenog reaktora u uslovima visoke radijacije kobne po ljudsko zdravlje.A put kojim se došlo do toga, kao i njegove posljedice Adam Higginbotham predstavio je na opširan, zanimljiv i stručan način, te ostavio još jedno važno svjedočanstvo o ovom događaju.P.S. Ponovo preporučujem da pogledate HBO mini seriju Chernobyl, s obzirom da je nakon gledanja mnogo lakše shvatiti suštinu ove knjige, kao i komplikovane opise načina rada nuklearnog reaktora.''Amid the chaos of the collapsing empire, most of the men and women who had fought the Battle of Chernobyl were forgotten - the final defenders of a nation that had seemingly vanished overnight.''"
267,1501134612,http://goodreads.com/user/show/684704-morgan,5,"It took fourteen days to read, but I was riveted and fascinated the entire time. I am too young to remember the Chernobyl melt down when the event took place in 1986, but I'm certain it's an event that contributed to my very vague, yet frightening notions of the war grown ups referred to as Cold.Later in life, I discovered pictures of Pripyat -an abandoned and radioactive city. These images captivated and haunted me. Yet, why did Chernobyl really melt down, and could other nuclear power plants face such demise? (An uneasy question for someone who heard a nuclear power plant's monthly test sirens while sitting in her high school classes.)This book delivered a lot of information - from how nuclear fission takes place, to who were the people on the ground before, during, and after the explosions in 1986. For me, the science bits were just enough - explained with clarity, yet never cumbersome or off-putting. (I'm language oriented, so science text books are off-putting for me personally.) But, the heart of this book is the people you meet. The firemen, the young nuclear engineers, an architect mapping out an ideal city, people loyal (albeit, questionably) to their county and the beliefs it strived to uphold. Midnight in Chernobyl portrayed a nuclear power plant, its atomgard, and its people with such distinction, that it was hard to shake any of these elements even when the book was closed. That childhood fear of the Cold War and nuclear weapons crept into my dreams, waking me with fears of radiation exposure and an urgency to find my children. A fleeting moment later, and my comfortable reality reasserted itself; but I wanted to know more, to understand more about an era in history - and about our future.It's quite a read. I'll eagerly offer it up to other readers as a worthy title. **(I already have - my apologies to those who came to my family's cook-out over the weekend who listened to me chatter on about a nuclear meltdown, when all they wanted to do was enjoy some pulled pork and spare ribs. I really do try to keep the overzealous librarian in me at bay during large social events, but alas, this title was just too good.)"
268,1501134612,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5862503-sweetwilliam,5,"Rarely do I read a book of 385 pages in 3 or 4 sittings but this book was engrossing. I started it on a Thursday and finished it over the weekend. It is an indictment of a flawed system of government. I watched the Chernobyl mini-series several times. Had not my son given this book to me as a birthday present, I probably wouldn’t have read it but I’m glad I did. A miniseries cannot delve into the details and provide all the interesting backstories and other essential information intrinsic to this story. The reactor was of a flawed design. This disaster was bound to happen sooner or later. Previous accidents had been swept under the rug. Soviet prestige was at stake and this was more important than the safety of the people or the planet. There was no oversight. In fact on page 323, Acadamician Valery Legasov realized “…the true scope of the decay at the heart of the [Soviet] nuclear state: The culture of secrecy and complacency, the arrogance and negligence and the shoddy standards of design and construction.”  On page 327 the author explains that the explosion was the last straw of a failing system:The most destructive forces unleashed by the explosion of Reactor Number Four were not radiological but political and economic. The cloud of radiation that spread out across Europe, making the catastrophe impossible to conceal had forced the touted openness of Gorbachev’s glasnost on even the most reluctant conservatives in the Politburo. Even the nuclear bureaucracy had been undermined by secrecy, incompetence, and stagnation convinced him that the entire state was rotten. Perestroika was launched in a desperate bid to save the Socialist experiment before it was too late. But all this did was to promote discussion on other censored topics such as drug addiction, abortion, Afghan war, and the horrors of Stalinism.Thus the author argues, the Chernobyl disaster brought down an empire. It is a fascinating read."
269,1501134612,http://goodreads.com/user/show/284714-kasandra,4,"This is a fascinating, horrifying, depressing, and enlightening read, with tons of details I'd never heard or learned before. What's most terrifying is how much the chances of this were known inside the former Soviet Union and covered up for years (along with previous accidents). The heroism of many Russians is astounding in dealing with this crisis, as is the callousness of others. A warning for the nuclear energy industry and all of us, about how quickly this technology can spiral out of control without transparency, honesty, readiness for all emergencies, and even with all proper planning - how quickly we can destroy ourselves and our environment due to simple human error and pride. Incredibly well-reported and thorough, and highly recommended."
270,1501134612,http://goodreads.com/user/show/34570157-jenny-jo-weir,4,Wow! This one was a hard read. The whole time I'm thinking about all that radiation and the effects of the explosion. The amount of people affected by this and the cost of this unfortunate event were unprecedented. You can't help but feel bad fro all the people involved and for all the victims. It's something that sticks with you. 
271,1501134612,http://goodreads.com/user/show/38617426-juli,4,"Interest in the Chernobyl nuclear disaster has spiked since the award winning HBO mini-series aired. I watched the show and listened to HBO's accompanying podcast and several other podcast episodes on the accident and its aftermath. Several of the podcasts mentioned this book, so I secured a spot on the library's wait list for the audiobook. I'm glad I did! This book is excellent!Higginbotham outlines the buildup of the soviet power grid and nuclear technology. Along the way there were accidents, cost cutting measures that had disastrous effects, mismanagement, poor training and flawed maintenance. All the mistakes culminated in the explosion at Chernobyl on April 25, 1986.Higginbotham gives details about the people involved, the plant itself, the history of Soviet nuclear power, the accident, the evacuation of Pripyat, and the continuing aftermath of the accident. It's a very interesting, and concerning, story. Many countries have nuclear power plants now. It's an awesome way to generate electricity, unless there is an accident. In recent years, the Fukushima accident shows that an earthquake or other natural event can cause modern nuclear plants to become quite dangerous. But with mismanagement, bad maintenance, lackluster employee training and shoddy parts/construction, any nuclear plant can be potentially dangerous. With more countries around the world turning to nuclear power, the chances of an accident increase.....I remember news reports in 1986 about the event. I can remember initial reports stating that it was known there had been some sort of nuclear event in the Soviet Union but scientists were not sure what had happened and no information was being released by USSR officials. When the full truth came out, it was horrifying. An entire city evacuated. Firemen and emergency response personnel dying. The struggle to prevent a melt-down. 33 years later, many are still interested in the accident and the lasting damage it caused. Pripyat is becoming a tourist attraction even. Yikes! I can think of much better vacation sites than one that is completely irradiated. Pripyat, and the surrounding region, will be not be safely habitable for more than 20,000 years.Nuclear power is safe when handled responsibly by properly trained people. Most plants operating in the modern world are quite safe, and managed/maintained properly. But, a nuclear power plant can be potentially deadly if proper safety protocols are not strictly adhered to and the potential effects of natural disasters and other catastrophes are not properly taken into consideration. I hope it is a very, very long time -- or never -- that our planet ends up with another uninhabitable, radiation soaked region from a nuclear accident. The effects are long lasting, and far reaching.Great book! Lots of highly researched information presented in an interesting manner. The audio book is about 14 hours long and narrated by Jacques Roy. Roy reads at a steady pace. His voice is easily understandable. Very enjoyable listening experience!"
272,1501134612,http://goodreads.com/user/show/352711-leftbanker,5,"I began this book out of desperation from the cliff-hanger of episode 2 of Chernobyl on HBO, one of the best TV dramas I’ve ever watched. Like the series, the pacing and tone of this account reads like the best of thrillers and I literally couldn’t put it down. I’m old enough to have vivid recollections of the event as it was unfolding. My USAF unit stationed in Athens, Greece, received intelligence on the crisis well ahead of the local news. We knew that it was a nuclear accident well before the Soviets admitted to this fact, but what we didn’t know was just how close the world was to a bigger, unspeakable disaster. This news really wasn’t available for years after the events of April 1986. The world had moved on. I had all but forgotten Chernobyl until this brilliant series came over the horizon. A viewer of the series wrote, “The tragedy will live forever because of this haunting masterpiece, what a brilliant creative achievement.” I could say the same for this book. Informative, objective, and written with a breath-taking pace, I couldn’t recommend it more highly to anyone looking to become better informed on the events of Chernobyl, both when it happened, and in the years since.It’s hard to laugh when you’re reading in the fetal position, but this part struck me as the epitome of gallows humor. One nuclear scientist working on cleaning up the disaster gives safety advice to another nuclear scientist just arriving, “If you smell ozone, run!”The big surprise is that the death toll wasn’t tens of times greater than the reality. Of course, we may never know the true results of the accident as Soviet record keeping tended to down-play cancer deaths which may have been related to Chernobyl.The most terrifying aspect of all is to consider how our leaders today would deal with a disaster on this order. Even the monumentally corrupt Soviets of that era had some highly intelligent, rational people among them, which is more than you can say of Putin and Trump, and their flunkies. Trump prevaricates on matters of little or no importance; imagine his response on this sort of travesty."
273,1501134612,http://goodreads.com/user/show/714583-anita-pomerantz,3,"This book is sooo highly rated and was listed as ""best non-fiction"" by numerous sources in 2019. All I have to say is I wish I read Voices from Chernobyl: The Oral History of a Nuclear Disaster instead. This book was just boring unless you like reading a lot about engineering and the technical structure of power plants and buildings. In addition, there are a zillion Russian names, and even with Kindle X-Ray and a guide to who was who, I struggled because the people just were not brought to life for me.This is reporting. It's very strong reporting, and it unveils the type of cover-up that makes you worried about government and implies that conspiracy theories can be true. The story is important. I just did not find it interesting because of the absolute overload of details, many of which were beyond my understanding or ability to picture. Maybe my timing in picking up this one was just way off . . .as we are in the middle of a crisis ourselves, my concentration is pretty shot. So, judge this one by the reviews of others. I just can barely bring myself to give it 3 stars. "
274,1501134612,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5349403-carolyn,4,"The author has written an impressive, comprehensive book of historical importance. It brings to light events surrounding the Chernobyl catastrophe of 1986 which may be unknown to many in the Western world, and even to the Russian people. The author presents a crash course in nuclear physics and energy, simplified as much as possible. This may present difficulties for the average reader without some background knowledge. I thought the human factor surrounding the disaster to be interesting and appreciated that the book included a summary list of the Cast of Characters and their positions and involvement with Chernobyl. The book emphasized the social/political Cold War mentality, economic factors, technical failures, the cut-throat ambition of the politicians and their secrecy which led to public complacency or wild rumours. Reaction time was slow due to uncertainty and arguments about the best course of action. I feel this is the definitive book of situations leading up to the disaster, what happened when Reactor 4 malfunctioned causing a huge surge of radiation, and its aftermath. The history is impeccable and thoroughly researched and stands as a sample for other writers of historical events and will be the definitive book on Chernobyl.The Chernobyl atomic complex was built to produce cheap electricity for a vast surrounded area, and to establish the Soviet Union ’s predominance in nuclear power. The disaster occurred in Reactor #4 on April 26, 1986. A model town, Pripyat, was built in the wilderness area close to the Nuclear Plant to house tens of thousands of workers and their families. From rough, cold shacks inhabited by the early builders, it grew into an impressive town with 3 schools, 35 playgrounds, 3 swimming pools, a library, sports facility and shopping center. Groceries and goods in the stores were more varied and abundant than in cities of origin of most of the workers. No expense was spared in planting trees and importing flowering shrubs to enhance the blocks of apartments. The nuclear accident which occurred resulted in a coverup where plant workers and women and children were not aware of the danger to their lives and health from nuclear fallout.there were cultural and political reasons contributing to lack of safety. Poor building design, shoddy materials, forced deadlines for builders and plant workers to meet, incompetent and negligent staff without knowledge of dangers they faced. There had been a smaller explosion at another plant and plenty of malfunctions but they were ignorant of possible critical problems. After the reactor imploded and seemed to be going into meltdown, releasing radiation far and wide, members of the emergency response team who did know the peril were either forced to stop the leak or went in willingly out of patriotic duty.  Following the disaster, people of Pripyat went about their lives ignorant of dangers from radioactive fallout. During this time a gathering of academics, Generals and politicians argued about the course they needed to take but were mainly concerned with secrecy. Finally, it was decided to evacuate the town of 51,000 people but leaving behind 4,000 essential service workers. People being evacuated were led to believe that they would only be away from home a couple of days and to bring only essentials for a short stay. Immediately after the explosion, there were two deaths of reactor workers.28 died soon of acute radiation sickness.. Evacuation orders soon included 90,000 people within a 30 K radius. High radiation levels soon spread to areas distant from Chernobyl and was detected in Sweden, Belarus and Poland. By May 20, 95,000 people had been hospitalized. High levels of radioactivity had already reached the capital, Kiev. May Day celebrations were carried out in the open air. Soon over 300,000 children were ordered evacuated from Kiev, along with expectant and nursing mothers (about 1/5 of the population). Teams were hired to shoot 20,000 domestic animals left behind.  We will never know how many people died over the years from radiation-induced cancers, as doctors were pressed not to mention a possible connection. Once the danger of a meltdown had eased and the reactor was covered with a dome, it was felt necessary to lay blame. Six plant officials were put on trial resulting in prison sentences. Official statements refused to place blame on faulty building materials, reactor design flaws, or the irresponsibility and poor discipline of the plant workers present when the disaster occurred. They had been conducting a safety inspection to simulate a power failure and did not follow the procedure properly outlined on a checklist. The author emphasizes the social/political Cold War mentality. The secrecy of generals and politicians which led to wild rumours or complacency subsequently caused the people to distrust in their leaders. Economic factors due to the billions of rubles spent on evacuation, housing, pay for thousands of emergency workers, and the deactivating the reactor was a great financial loss for the country. The author feels this was a major factor contributing to the breakup of the Soviet Union Thanks to NetGalley and Simon & Schuster for an advance copy of this important book."
275,1501134612,http://goodreads.com/user/show/53179837-george,4,"This book covers the events from the construction of the plant to the fall of the Soviet Union, but unlike Serhii Plokhy he does it from the perspective of the people who were actually close enough to absorb the radiation. Mostly he focused on the scientists, workers and liquidators, who had to deal with the clean up. He focused so much on these people that at the beginning of the book there was a list of characters, as if it was a play or something. I've never seen that done with a nonfiction book before, but maybe that was just a quirk of my particular edition. Now, because I have read Chernobyl: History of a Tragedy by Serhii Plokhy I couldn't help but compare these two. Serhii Plokhy covered the construction of the plant and the causes of the explosion itself better then Adam Higginbotham, but Adam didn't just brush of the clean up process. After reading them both I find it that they are both necessary to understand this disaster, just to get all the angles.Lastly, on to the Voices of Chernobyl to see what the ordinary people had to say about this whole mess. "
276,1501134612,http://goodreads.com/user/show/17428284-steven-z,5,"March 28, 1979 was an overcast day in Woodbridge, Va. when news arrived of a nuclear accident at Three Mile Island Unit 2 reactor near Middletown, Pa. Feeling totally in the dark when it came to information about the accident, my neighbors and I gathered outside our homes and immediately began testing to see which way the winds were blowing, and should we pack up and head in the opposite direction. Living about two and a half hours from the reactor which would eventually partially melt down, we were scared. Up to that time this would be considered the greatest nuclear accident in history being unaware of the Kyshtym Disaster which was a radioactive contamination accident that occurred on September 29, 1957 at Mayak, a plutonium production site in Russia for nuclear weapons and a nuclear fuel reprocessing plant in the Soviet Union. After reading Adam Higginbotham’s new book, MIDNIGHT IN CHERNOBYL: THE UNTOLD STORY OF THE WORLD’S GREATEST NUCLEAR DISASTER, an excellent account of the explosion and meltdown at Chernobyl the evening of April 25-26, 1986 and the ramifications of that disaster, memories of that March day flashed before my eyes.Higginbotham has written the most informative and insightful description of events and analysis of the meltdown that has yet to appear. It replaces Harvard historian, Serhii Plokhy’s CHERNOBYL: A HISTORY OF A NUCLEAR CATASYTROPHE as the most comprehensive and detailed work that has been written. In dealing with events such as Chernobyl one must ask: What happened, why did it happen, and could it happen again? Higginbotham, a journalist and his research partner Taras Shumeyko interviewed numerous eyewitnesses and conducted a prodigious amount of research that included a small number of declassified documents available, and argues that the fanatical view among Soviet bureaucrats and leadership to maintain secrecy, (for example, information about what occurred at Mayak was kept from the public for thirty years) was the reason the accident was so devastating, but also not surprising that it occurred. Higginbotham recreates the disaster providing a history of Soviet nuclear development, including numerous accidents; the planning and building of Chernobyl; the accident; attempts to remediate the situation after it occurred, the trial of the operators who were blamed for the disaster; and other aspects of the aftermath. The book reads in part as narrative history, but also a terrifying account of an event which could easily be repeated today.The plan to build Chernobyl was hatched in February 1970 as a means of catching up to the west and meet Soviet electricity needs. The Soviet Union would engage in a crash program to build nuclear reactors, but the problem was that the project began during a period of economic stagnation with material and resource shortages everywhere. The reactor was to be completed by 1975 which was totally unrealistic due to the approach taken by the Soviet bureaucracy, party elites, and engineers that did not consider shortages, safety needs, and planning for possible future nuclear accidents. The result is that corners were cut in terms of material, training, design flaws, “cooking the books,” and the stubborn nature of the Soviet bureaucracy in charge of construction. As Higginbotham discusses this aspect of the project, he provides the reader an interesting history of the development of radiation, nuclear development, and their affects on people and society. The author’s approach to complex scientific information and jargon is such that it is very easy to understand for the lay reader as he describes how reactors are supposed to be constructed.According to Higginbotham there were design flaws dealing with a high-power channel reactor labeled RMBK. These flaws would dog designers who would pay little attention to test results because of pressure from the Communist Party and the bureaucracy that flowed from it. This made disaster possible because no one knew how the reactor would react in case of an accident. The reactors colossal size made start up and shut down the most demanding and treacherous stages of RMBK operation. The author follows RMBK’s development and its flaws as it went into production, particularly the AZ-5 emergency protection system whose design took too long to respond in an emergency which came home to roost on April 25, 1986.  A similar plant in Leningrad experienced an accident on November 11, 1975 resulting in the release of radiation into the atmosphere over the Gulf of Finland. However, Sredmash, the Soviet agency in charge of production and construction of nuclear reactors covered up the investigative findings of design flaws related to the accident. On September 9, 1982 there was a partial meltdown at Unit 1 at Chernobyl which took eight months to repair, but the KGB instituted a gag order, and the following year a similar accident took place in a Lithuanian reactor and one in Armenia. But the world knew nothing of these accidents. Further exacerbating Soviet nuclear reactor building was the shoddy workmanship that plagued Soviet industry in general, and that carried over to the construction of Chernobyl.  A major problem that arose once Reactor #4 at Chernobyl exploded is that many of those in charge were unprepared to deal with what occurred and succumbed to wishful thinking and self-delusion in approaching how to deal with what had transpired. Higginbotham describes in detail the lethargic Soviet bureaucracy and their response to disaster. Soviet Prime Minister Mikhail Gorbachev was not notified as to what had occurred until the afternoon of April 26, 1986. The author narrates the debates inside the Commission that was set up to oversee the crisis. He relates the personalities involved and their debates on how to respond and their final decision making, many of which were out of some sort of fantasy. An excellent example apart from how to cool the reactor was whether they should evacuate the city of Pripyat and its 50,000 residents who were in danger of radiation exposure which took until April 27th to accomplish. As the radioactive cloud blew over Scandinavia, Swedish, Finish, and Danish diplomats lodged complaints to Moscow once it was realized where the radiation originated resulting in the Soviet government stonewalling. It would take until April 28th at 8:00pm for Moscow to come clean and announce that “an accident had taken place at the Chernobyl nuclear power plant.…One of the atomic reactors has been damaged.” Soviet citizens were used to this type of response as it was a continuation of the way the state had covered industrial accidents for decades.Higginbotham descriptions of helicopter pilots flying low dumping sand and boron on the reactor are harrowing. The author’s approach as he carefully describes how officials, academics, scientists, fire fighters, guards, and others and what they went through is chilling, especially as he brings the reader to Hospital #6 in Moscow created to treat victims of nuclear accidents and war. The ultimate fear was the “China Syndrome,” the further devastation that would occur if the reactor’s foundation exploded and nuclear material leaked into the earth. Even though Moscow TV announced on May 11, 1986 that the primary threat of explosion was over, scientists remained skeptical.The Central Committee of the Politburo decided against Gorbachev’s new policy of Glasnost and followed the traditional approach and blamed “bourgeois falsification….propaganda and inventions” as its immediate reaction, in addition to dishonesty and declining help from the west. This approach would backfire in terms of containing the accident but also hindering Gorbachev’s hope of nuclear disarmament talks with the United States because how could one negotiate with someone who was so untrustworthy.Higginbotham spends a great deal of time describing what the victims of the disaster experienced. He follows the medical care that victims received and for far too many their ultimate deaths. He recounts the bravery of so many who fought to contain the toxic results of the explosion, and countless men who returned to build the sarcophagus that was designed to seal reactor #4 for at least a hundred years. The narrative of how the newly created refugees, numbering over 116,000 from the exclusion zone is told with sensitivity and insight into their future plight. The scapegoating that dominated the investigation by Soviet authorities was appalling as was the propaganda machine that worked overtime to find blame and paint the accident in the best light as possible. The stories are often poignant and provide a true picture of what can happen on a personal and societal level from a nuclear disaster.Perhaps one of the most destructive results of Chernobyl was the beginning of the end of the Soviet Union. Gorbachev realized that even his own nuclear bureaucracy was rotten to the “core” and as was most of the Soviet state. The launching of perestroika opened debate among Soviet citizens that had been dormant, but slowly the issues of Afghanistan, drug addiction, the abortion epidemic, and the horrors of Stalinism emerged. The Russian people began to realize that they had been lied to for decades and as Higginbotham successfully argues they “faced the realization that their leaders were corrupt and that the Communist dream was a sham.”If wonders if a major nuclear accident could occur in the future remind yourself of Fukushima. In 2011, the Tokyo Electric Power Company’s nuclear plant underwent a process identical to Chernobyl; the loss of coolant that provoked a meltdown. As to what remains of Chernobyl itself, it is part of an “exclusion zone” of 1,000 square miles, a radioactive Eden for new wildlife and vegetation. Higginbotham has done the public a favor by exposing the events of April-May 1986 and give us pause as to how we should approach nuclear power in the future."
277,1501134612,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3357765-jimmy,5,"I have long been fascinated with Russia. Russian dissenters have long been my heroes going all the way back to Alexander Solzhenitsyn up to Pussy Riot and Garry Kasparov. It feels like Russia has an inferiority complex. The government is always trying to look bigger and stronger than they really are. Thus the arms buildups, the Olympic obsession, the meddling. In the case of Chernobyl, it was the cover ups, the refusal to admit mistakes, the effort to make the reactor bigger than anything else no matter how many corners had to be cut. As Higginbotham said, ""Lies and deception were endemic to the system, trafficked in both directions along the chain of management: those lower down passed up reports to their superiors packed with falsified statistics and inflated estimates, of unmet goals triumphantly reached, unfulfilled quotas heroically exceeded. To protect his own position, at every stage, relayed the lies upward or compounded them."" (15) ""Seated at the top of a teetering pyramid of falsehood, poring over reams of figures that had little basis in reality, were the economic mandarins of the State General Planning Committee--Gosplan--in Moscow."" (15) It worries me that Trump and his climate change deniers are setting up something of the same situation here in the US. Facts are not important in this administration. And scientific facts are even less important to the Trumpites. "". . . the plans called for fireproof cables, but when none could be found, the builders simply did the best they could."" (20) ""When the ministry of energy in Moscow learned that the roof of the plant's turbine hall had been covered with highly flammable bitumen, they ordered him to replace it. But the flame-retardent material . . . was not even being manufactured in the USSR, so the Ministry granted Brukhanov an exception, and the bitumen remained."" (20) But when they ordered him to build an ""olympic-sized swimming pool,"" he had to ""hoodwink the state bank"" to build it. He had no choice but to obey the order. Considering all of these facts, it makes me wonder if Chernobyl is the best way to look at nuclear power. The fault lies more with the communist system and its lack of regulatory power. People always think of communist systems as having too many regulations. In reality, communism has few regulations because it is all about the power at the top, like with Trump. The goal was to build ""increasingly gigantic stations throughout the western territories of the Union. By the end of the century, Moscow intended Chernobyl to be one part of a dense network of atomic power megacomplexes."" (20) In spite of ""alarming building faults,"" the work kept on. On pages 62 to 63, the designers saw ""no need to prepare for such a calamity"" in reference to the worst possible scenarios. All warnings about the dangers were ignored. Former Chernobyl chief engineer Nikolai Steinberg said that the origins of the disaster lay in a combination of ""scientific, technological, socioeconomic, and human factors"" unique to the USSR. (347) The Soviet Union ""lacked even rudimentary safety practices."" They ""relied upon its operators to behave with robotic precision night after night."" They were under ""constant pressure to beat deadlines."" All of this made ""disregard for the letter of the regulations almost inevitable."" The deceased operators of Control Room Number Four ""had brought the reactor into an unstable condition, but only on account of the acute pressure they felt to complete the test on the turbine."" (347) ""Some environmentalists argued that humanity could not afford to turn its back on the promise and terrors of the peaceful atom. The global need for electricity was increasing exponentially: humanity was predicted to double the amount of energy it used by 2050. Despite the growing certainty that burning fossil fuels was the cause of devastating climate change--making the stabilization of carbon emissions imperative--coal remained the most widely used source of energy in the world. The fine particulates from fossil fuel plants in the United States killed more than thirteen thousand people a year; worldwide, three million people died annually as a result of air pollution released by coal- and oil-fueled power stations. Even to begin to head off climate change over the coming thirty-five years would have to be clean, yet neither wind, solar, hydroelectric, nor geothermal power--nor any combination of them--had the potential to bridge the gap."" (357 to 358) ""And at last, more than seventy years after the technology's inception, engineers were finally developing reactors with design priorities that lay not in making bombs but in generating electricity. In principle, these fourth-generation reactors would be cheaper, safer, smaller, more efficient, and less poisonous than their predecessors and could yet prove to be the technology that saves the world."" (358) There is a ""liquid fluoride thorium reactor (LFTR)"" developed at Tennessee's Oak Ridge National Laboratory that is fueled by ""thorium. More plentiful and far harder to process into bomb-making material than uranium, thorium also burns more efficiently in a reactor and could produce less hazardous radioactive waste with half-lives of hundreds, not tens of thousands, of years. . . . It does not require a massive containment building to guard against loss-of-coolant accidents or explosions and can be constructed on such a compact scale that every steel mill or small town could have its own microreactor tucked away underground."" (358) ""In 2015, Bill Gates had begun funding research projects similar to these fourth-generation reactors in a quest to create a carbon-neutral power source for the future. By then, the Chinese government had already set seven hundred scientists on a crash program to build the world's first industrial thorium reactor as part of a war on pollution. 'The problem of coal has become clear,' the engineering director of the project said. 'Nuclear power provides the only solution.'"" (358) I was selective in my quotes. The question now is, Must we turn to nuclear power as a last resort to get out of the mess of climate change? I would be interested in your responses. "

It handles an amazingly complicated subject and history, and a massive cast of Soviet names, and somehow keeps it all clear even for non-scientist reader. If you're too young to remember Chernobyl, read this (and watch the HBO miniseries). If you are old enough to remember Chernobyl (and perhaps even Three Mile Island), read this anyway. It's frightening, compelling, brilliant, and vital as we try to ward off climate change and turn to energy sources other than fossil fuels. "

Senior Lieutenant Alexander Logachev loved radiation the way other men loved their wives. Tall and good-looking, twenty-six years old, with close-cropped dark hair and ice-blue eyes, Logachev had joined the Soviet army when he was still a boy. They had trained him well. The instructors from the military academy outside Moscow taught him with lethal poisons and unshielded radiation. He traveled to the testing grounds of Semipalatinsk in Kazakhstan, and to the desolte East Urals Trace, where the fallout from a clandestine radioactive accident still poisoned the landscape; eventually, Logachev’s training took him even to the remote and forbidden islands of Novaya Zemlya, high in the Arctic Circle and ground zero for the detonation of the terrible Tsar Bomba, the largest thermonuclear device in history.
Although I haven’t been born at the time of the Chernobyl disaster, the events of that time have fascinated me for years. This is probable also due to the fact that my parents, who were living in Poland during the catastrophe, were directly affected by the radioactive cloud. I have seen nearly every documentary that exists and I also found the HBO miniseries amazing! So amazing that every day I look skeptically in the direction of the nuclear power plant that stands here around the corner. So, it was clear that I would read this book the moment I heard about it for the first time. And even if, unfortunately, I had little time to read due to university and private courses, in the end it was absolutely worth! __________________________________________In the book, first there are some maps and overviews showing, among other things, Russia and the location of Pripyat and the construction of Unit Four of the Chernobyl Nuclear Plant (Tschernobylska AES im. W. I. Lenina). This is followed by a list of key persons and their function within the catastrophy. Then, the “story” begins.Journalist Higginbotham describes his incredibly well-researched information as far as possible in chronological order, sometimes even to the nearest second. It starts before the catastrophe and provides information on how the nuclear industry has built up in the USSR, how atomgrad* Pripyat was formed and how the nuclear power plant came online, years before the big mistake that was due to humane and machine failures.Within the text numerous, sometimes very scientific information, can be found – for example, how radiation works or that men radiate more than women due to their higher muslce mass. For me, there were actually some new things that I did not know before!In the further process, Higginbotham describes the events from the point of view of the varius persons: Director Brukhanov, scientist Legassov or the firefighters, who were unsuspecting at the scene and sealed their death with their intervention, but prevented a major catastrophe. Personally, this chapter has hit me the most, as I do not want to imagine how they must have felt in this situation.After detailed descriptions of the events at the plant and politics, which among other things led to the collapse of the Soviet Union, Higginbotham gives an insight into the current situation in the Ukraine: Among other things, he conducted interviews with people who vere involved in the disaster and he visits the ghost town of Pripyat. Attached are a glossary with all the important technical terms in the field of nuclear energy and images of the people and places mentioneds in the book. __________________________________________Even though the book requires a lot of concentration and you need a little more time to understand everything, it was absolutely worth to read this book! I would recommend it to anyone – whether he has already experienced the disaster or was born later. The topic is more present after the accident in Japan and should be known to everyone. For those who, like me, are interested in the events during that time, the book is an absolute must have!"
280,1501134612,http://goodreads.com/user/show/47825764-mellie-antoinette,5,"Picture it, Sophia Petrillo style:April 26, 19861:23:45 in the morning (though God knows why anyone was up to notice. Ma!)Boom. Kablewey. You pick. Things burn. 51,300 comrades 💤 (Ma!) in their beds. It was only a 2 minute flight from Reactor 4 to Pripyat. Maybe 10 minutes by car. The radioactive dust took the car. MA!Are you telling this story, Dorothy? The explosion was mostly vertical, but the damage? The damage was horizontal, soaring on winded wings as far as Sweden and that’s when sh*t really got real - don’t 🙄 at your mother, Dorothy Zbornak! Where do you think Stan got his weirdness?So Gorbachev’s all open door and honesty’s the best policy - well, how do you like them dosimeters? Open door policy, my foot! That’s how some cities knew what happened! They took radioactive readings off the sandals of a lady who just traveled to Pripyat. Gorby didn’t tell them. It was the shoes!Back to my story: So we got bureaucrats on the ground, fires blazing in the central core, 1,200 Kievan buses evac’ing the city and no clue how to stop this giant wildebeest from exploding again, China Syndrome style. Meanwhile: The winds have blown ... now we gotta evac another 116k people in the newly designated “Exclusion Zone” (though later they’d rename it the “Nuclear Reservation” like that helps), but the story of Chernobyl doesn’t stop there! Nope...✋ Now we gotta get Reactors 1-3...back...online?? Isn’t that the reason we’re gonna throw 750,000 bio robots at this sucker to begin with?? Not sure what you call *waves hand dramatically* all this, then. Oh right, “nuclear meltdowns don’t happen in the Soviet Union” (Stellan Skarsgard better get an Emmy for that brilliantly executed meltdown!).So here we are, 30 ish years later (ironic that’s the “official” death toll = 31 souls), two sarcophagi, 800 radioactive waste dumps, 4700 km squared of inhabitable land, hu HUM huh of ARS victims (it’s classified. So, of course, they told me, but I’m Sophia Petrillo! I keep my word! I’ll write it down, you throw it in the fireplace!) and a city built specifically to support the wildebeest dies in 16 years. Don’t worry though, they moved everyone to Slavutych, another atomgrad, and hey, the world makes sense again!That’s how we tell stories in Sicily! Obviously, loved this one! It is a little dry, but as you can see, it’s hard to write without judgement. Higginbotham does just the facts, no sass and still tells the story in a way that’s both completely understandable and emotionally harrowing all at the same time. Very well done!"
281,1501134612,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9981052-nicholereadswithcats,5,Very informative. Some of the scientific information was a little over my head but I enjoyed the mix between facts and personal experience. Shocking the lengths which were taken to attempt to cover up what happened. Loved the pictures at the end.
282,1501134612,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3670585-erin-cataldi,3,"This book has all the info you never knew you needed on Chernobyl - down to the last technical detail. I listened to this rather than reading it and was soon bogged down by the sheer amount of physics detailed; at times I found myself struggling to pay attention. That being said, this was still a fascinating detailed look on the events that caused the accidents and the actions taken afterward. It was a perfect storm of horrible events and it really will get your heart racing as the author gives you a near minute by minute account. Unsettling at moments, and overly technical; this insanely well researched guide is not for the casual reader. This book is heavy; but will change the way you think about Chernobyl forever! "
283,1501134612,http://goodreads.com/user/show/55342889-elizabethanne-olsen,5,Just. Fucking. Fantastic. The descriptions of the destruction seemed so surreal like it was a fictional dystopian novel. So difficult to grasp the enormity of this as a real event. The horrific descriptions of ailments to the ones who suffered exposure was intense and necessary. Everyone should real this book. Everyone. 
284,1501134612,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2168708-marta,5,"Astonishing, thrillingly written, with a lot of new information, including the causes of the accident. I have bought this on audio and listened to it; but I missed so much information that I am listening to it again. It is thrilling the second time as well, and this time I can put the stories of the people more into context. My family was also interested so I bought a print copy as well. I am using it to look up names, and there are pictures as well. I stopped listening second time about halfway through - the pandemic happened and I am tired of bad news. This is a thrilling telling of a cautionary tale about the dangers of arrogance dealing with the forces of nature. The minimizing, denials, trying to cover it up, confused scrambling to stall an even bigger disaster - all echo in the reaction of the US government to the pandemic in the last weeks/months. The arrogance and the wishful thinking that made the disaster so much worse are just as present now. Leaders need to read history - and we elected one that expressly disdains science, reading, and history. This is of course wholly unfair to the people in the Chernobyl catastrophe. There was a lot of heroism, and some ofticials showed remarkable leadership. Which is why I felt most enraged when those operators who gave their lives willingly and performed heroics to save the reactor in the first hours of the disaster, were scapegoated. These people were heroes (well, some, I have no sympathy for plant director Brukhanov), and they were tried as criminals, some declared as such posthumously. The world was told at the time that the accident was caused by careless operators who conducted a test and disabled the safety systems. But in reality, the RBMK reactor had multiple design flaws and the accident was waiting to happen. One of those was in the emergency shutdown. When the Chernobyl operators realized they had trouble, they initiated a shutdown by dropping all safety rods - but instead of shutting down, the reactor went critical - because of the rods were graphite-tipped! The designers have discovered this flaw years before, but they thought it was unlikely to happen. (Arrogance and negligence). It was only an issue if most control rods were withdrawn - which was the case at Chernobyl, due to the other major flaw of the reactor, the positive void coefficient (Google it). This basically made it unsafe to operate the reactor at low power levels, which the designers also discovered, but all they did was sent a new operating manual, without explaining why this was important. Experienced operators did learn that the reactor got unstable at lower power levels, from experience, but did not know that it could be a safety risk. So when the manager of the tests wanted to perform it at low power levels, one protested - but he was overruled and threatened of being fired. Presumably the manager wanted to be safer... and thus the reactor went to overdrive with the lower powerlevel, so they withdrew the rods - then tried to shut down. Boom.All this has been previously detected as a risk, and ignored. Then came the fallout.Read this - but maybe not during a pandemic."
285,1501134612,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8413178-liam,5,"I, like everybody else, have been entranced by HBO's Chernobyl. Watching it, I realised how little I really knew about the disaster despite having spent untold hours wandering around in the fictional version of the Zone in the STALKER games.Much like most people I imagine, I was kind of astounded by how huge a disaster it actually was, and how close it came to being so much worse. I kind of ran under the assumption that the HBO show was dramatised to a certain extent, because how could I have possibly not heard that there was a distinct possibility that Reactor 4 would explode again with the force of several atomic bombs? - but no, this actually occurred.Higginbotham's writing is detached, which somehow makes it all the more impactful - dry descriptions of Pripyat firefighters experiencing 'violent diarrhea' in the days following the initial explosion, which was determined to be 'their intestines liquefying' is one example I'm going to have trouble forgetting.As a companion to the show, Midnight in Chernobyl was excellent. I didn't plan it out that way, but events in the show as I watched it every few nights kind of lined up to the events in the book as I listened to it on my way to and from work, expanding and providing further detail, or refuting the more dramatised parts of the show. Legasov for example is portrayed a lot more heroic in the show, routinely martyring himself before the Communist Party for the good of all - whereas he was far more likely to toe the Party line in real life, and only repented soon before his death.Midnight in Chernobyl is a fantastic in-depth exploration of the disaster - causes and repercussions, and it has certainly sparked interest in the topic for myself. An excellently written book, very well read by Jacques Roy. Highly recommend."

If, instead, you want to know the true story read Higginbotham's fine book, which does an excellent job of not only describing in a blow-by-blow fashion the disaster and it's aftermath, but places the disaster in the broader context of Soviet society and rule. 4-stars."
287,1501134612,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5072847-will-ansbacher,5,"Well written, fast paced and unbelievable action – this would be a terrific disaster thriller if it wasn’t actually all true.Adam Higginbotham has done a simply brilliant job of researching and writing about the world’s worst nuclear disaster, with a style that’s riveting yet balanced and without hyperbole. It opens with a couple of pages describing Civil Defence responders’ panic as they first realize the extent of the radioactive horror they’d been catapulted into. From that initial adrenalin burst, the first part of the story (titled Birth of a City) goes back to the origins of nuclear power development in Russia and the founding of the atomic city of Pripyat, and is interleaved with the events surrounding the explosion of reactor #4 and the immediate after-effects. The longer part two (Death of an Empire) covers the awful radiation effects, the mainly futile clean-up attempts, the cover-ups, denials, excruciating investigations and show trials; at the same time providing insight into the breakup of the USSR. (If Chernobyl wasn’t the catalyst that led to the end of the Soviet Union, then it certainly was a major factor). The story ends with more recent developments, including interviews the author had with those involved - at least, those who still were alive after 2006.This changing focus is a really effective way of dealing with a highly complex subject that could otherwise have been quite dry. Interestingly, I thought, the structure mirrors radiation poisoning itself: the initial terrifying experience of acute exposure and a short period of apparent recovery, but followed by the much longer and agonizing progress of an array of worsening symptoms. I won’t go into the story itself, (this  NY Times review is a great summary). But I was struck by a few recurrent themes:One, the cynical way disasters were suppressed so nobody could ever learn from previous mistakes;Two, the culture of craven compliance that prevented anyone from speaking out about known problems; (Together, these made not only the reactor explosion inevitable but the aftermath about as bad as it could possibly be)Three, the casual attitudes – bordering on macho defiance - to radiation dangers;And four, the sheer resilience of the Russian and Ukrainian people – both workers at the plant and the general population - in the face of all the horrors that were thrown at them. (Though these last two are as much the result of the authorities ruthlessly suppressing information) A ton of authoritative information has become available over the last 30 years, and Higginbotham seems to have read it all - there are 100 pages of end notes alone. However in order not to interrupt the flow he wisely left all the cross-referencing to the end, where a few relevant words in each note point to the text. There is also an extensive bibliography and a short but useful cast of characters ... Ligachev? Logachev? Legasov? ... which I found I had to flip back to often. There is still much we don’t know about Chernobyl, but to understand the disaster and what it means, I don’t think you could do better than this book. It isn’t perfect of course; Higginbotham didn’t explain some of the radiation physics or its effects on humans too well, but for this non-technical account it’s more than good enough."

Despite the scientific leanings (some of which was over my head) it was immensely readable account of the event. There was background relating to the construction of the nuclear reactor and a minute by minute, hour by hour account of the disaster itself as it unfolded on April 26, 1986. Then the aftermath, the world-wide scale of international proportions, the denial, the cover-up, the prosecution and trials that followed were riveting reading.

290,1501134612,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11701608-barbara,5,"10+stars: Oh My Dear Lord, this novel will scare the beejesus out of you. Journalist Adam Higgnbothem has written an amazing documentary of the 1986 catastrophe at the Chernobyl nuclear plant in the USSR. I listened to the audible production that is narrated by Jacques Roy. At the beginning, Roy lists all the important characters in this story. Since I listened to it, I was at a disadvantage keeping all the players straight in my head. If one wants to truly understand the politics, lies, radiation illnesses, etc, that involved each character, one should read the novel. As an American listener, all those Russian names were difficult to keep in my mind.That said, it is an amazing listen. Just getting the timeline of events, the mistakes, the horror of the disaster while listening is enough for me. This tragedy was a culmination of mistakes. Although the USSR wanted to lay blame on separate individuals, Higgenbothem shows that is was straws, that individually wouldn’t be the blame, but added together resulted in a global tragedy. Also, it was the political pressure and the culture of Russia at that time that lead to the explosion. Russia wanted to save face which added layers to the event that cost thousands of lives. The government secrecy magnified mistakes.Higgenbothem exposes the devastating losses and damages to humans, the landscape, and animals. Once the catastrophe made global news, he explains the collective efforts made to find solutions. Nuclear energy seems here to stay. Creating safe nuclear energy is paramount to the safety and survival of the earth. Making worker education a priority is a necessity. We must remain aware and well informed of the cost/benefit of producing nuclear energy. This is an amazing case study."
291,1501134612,http://goodreads.com/user/show/92319245-mona,4,"This is probably one of the most comprehensive books about Cherbobyl disaster. Author and his multiple researchers did a great job going through documentation, books, articles and statements. They also interviewed quite a few people who participated in described events.Book is well written and narrative is concise. Author guides a reader through basics of physics and construction necessary to understand the events properly. I specifically liked the description of research done on the reactor which were conducted few years after the disaster. I was not familiar with those findings.When it comes to shortcomings of this book - it was written by Brit living in the US and this Western point of view is very clear here. I felt the narration had lingering condescending and superior tone to it, what at points became quite annoying. I think the author did not have a good understanding of Russian culture and mentality (particularly noted during his last interview with the plant director) and he undermined the value of some heroic acts done by firefighters and soldiers after the disaster. This is not the first book I read on this topic and I think Russian and Ukrainian writers are much better in this area for obvious reasons.This is a great book for Westerners who know nothing or close to nothing about Charnobyl disaster and would like to have a general overview. Kinda ""all you can eat""..... but not a white cloth."

But, when my friends ask me about it, I tell them: the less you think about it, the longer you'll live.''Midnight in Chernobyl autora Adama Higginbothama enciklopedijski je uvid u najveću nuklearnu katastrofu koja se dogodila u Černobilju, u Ukrajini 26.aprila 1986. godine.Priča o najvećoj nesreći jedne države, grada, političkog i državnog uređenja, počinje u trenutku kada se postavljaju temelji za građenje ovog nukelarnog postrojenja 1970. godine i rađanja grada u kome su živjeli ljudi zaposleni na izgradnji, kao i radnici predviđeni da rade u novootvorenoj centrali.U jeku hladnog rata Sovjetski savez se svim silama trudio da ukroti atom, da svijetu podari sliku o naučnim dostignućima bez premca, a ljudi su uživali u plodovima svog rada, bezbrižni, poletni i vjerni državi koja im je stvorila atomski grad Pripjat, obezbjedila udobnost sadašnjosti i velike planove za budućnost.Ali sovjetski naučnici koji su radili pod okriljem jednog zatvorenog i ambicioznog sistema, zatvarali su oči pred bilo kakvim greškama na koje su upozoravani prilikom izrade nuklearnih reaktora RBMK-1000 (koji je i eksplodirao u Černobilju), sve mane koje su nesumnjivo postojale držane su u strogoj tajnosti, a sve, naizgled, male stvari dovele su do katastrofe koja je, prema mnogima, dovela i do raspada SSSR-a.Autor se kroz brojne izvore ovim događajem bavio sa naučnog, političkog, socijalnog i ljudskog aspekta, hirurški precizno kombinujući dešavanja u Černobilju sa sudbinama stanovnika Pripjata, koji nesvjesni onoga što ih je snašlo odlaze iz svojih domova, dok radijacija bjesomučno prekriva kvadratne kilometre gradova, tokove rijeka, dječije igračke, kućne ljubimce i tijela svih koji su učestvovali u saniranju posljedica eksplozije.Usljed loše izrađenog reaktora, kojim su upravljali ambiciozni i često nestručni ljudi, zaslijepljeni egom i grandioznošću, 26.aprila 1986. godine desio se početak kraja jednog doba, zapečanjen sudbinama nekih običnih ljudi koji su na poziv domovine golim rukama uklanjali radioaktivni materijal, koji su u sobama Bolnice broj šest ostavljali svoje živote, koji su gradili sarkofag iznad uništenog reaktora u uslovima visoke radijacije kobne po ljudsko zdravlje.A put kojim se došlo do toga, kao i njegove posljedice Adam Higginbotham predstavio je na opširan, zanimljiv i stručan način, te ostavio još jedno važno svjedočanstvo o ovom događaju.P.S. Ponovo preporučujem da pogledate HBO mini seriju Chernobyl, s obzirom da je nakon gledanja mnogo lakše shvatiti suštinu ove knjige, kao i komplikovane opise načina rada nuklearnog reaktora.''Amid the chaos of the collapsing empire, most of the men and women who had fought the Battle of Chernobyl were forgotten - the final defenders of a nation that had seemingly vanished overnight.''"

I am too young to remember the Chernobyl melt down when the event took place in 1986, but I'm certain it's an event that contributed to my very vague, yet frightening notions of the war grown ups referred to as Cold.Later in life, I discovered pictures of Pripyat -an abandoned and radioactive city. These images captivated and haunted me. Yet, why did Chernobyl really melt down, and could other nuclear power plants face such demise? (An uneasy question for someone who heard a nuclear power plant's monthly test sirens while sitting in her high school classes.)This book delivered a lot of information - from how nuclear fission takes place, to who were the people on the ground before, during, and after the explosions in 1986. For me, the science bits were just enough - explained with clarity, yet never cumbersome or off-putting. (I'm language oriented, so science text books are off-putting for me personally.) But, the heart of this book is the people you meet. The firemen, the young nuclear engineers, an architect mapping out an ideal city, people loyal (albeit, questionably) to their county and the beliefs it strived to uphold. Midnight in Chernobyl portrayed a nuclear power plant, its atomgard, and its people with such distinction, that it was hard to shake any of these elements even when the book was closed. That childhood fear of the Cold War and nuclear weapons crept into my dreams, waking me with fears of radiation exposure and an urgency to find my children. A fleeting moment later, and my comfortable reality reasserted itself; but I wanted to know more, to understand more about an era in history - and about our future.It's quite a read. I'll eagerly offer it up to other readers as a worthy title. **(I already have - my apologies to those who came to my family's cook-out over the weekend who listened to me chatter on about a nuclear meltdown, when all they wanted to do was enjoy some pulled pork and spare ribs. I really do try to keep the overzealous librarian in me at bay during large social events, but alas, this title was just too good.)"

I started it on a Thursday and finished it over the weekend. It is an indictment of a flawed system of government. I watched the Chernobyl mini-series several times. Had not my son given this book to me as a birthday present, I probably wouldn’t have read it but I’m glad I did. A miniseries cannot delve into the details and provide all the interesting backstories and other essential information intrinsic to this story. The reactor was of a flawed design. This disaster was bound to happen sooner or later. Previous accidents had been swept under the rug. Soviet prestige was at stake and this was more important than the safety of the people or the planet. There was no oversight. In fact on page 323, Acadamician Valery Legasov realized “…the true scope of the decay at the heart of the [Soviet] nuclear state: The culture of secrecy and complacency, the arrogance and negligence and the shoddy standards of design and construction.”  On page 327 the author explains that the explosion was the last straw of a failing system:The most destructive forces unleashed by the explosion of Reactor Number Four were not radiological but political and economic. The cloud of radiation that spread out across Europe, making the catastrophe impossible to conceal had forced the touted openness of Gorbachev’s glasnost on even the most reluctant conservatives in the Politburo. Even the nuclear bureaucracy had been undermined by secrecy, incompetence, and stagnation convinced him that the entire state was rotten. Perestroika was launched in a desperate bid to save the Socialist experiment before it was too late. But all this did was to promote discussion on other censored topics such as drug addiction, abortion, Afghan war, and the horrors of Stalinism.Thus the author argues, the Chernobyl disaster brought down an empire. It is a fascinating read."

What's most terrifying is how much the chances of this were known inside the former Soviet Union and covered up for years (along with previous accidents). The heroism of many Russians is astounding in dealing with this crisis, as is the callousness of others. A warning for the nuclear energy industry and all of us, about how quickly this technology can spiral out of control without transparency, honesty, readiness for all emergencies, and even with all proper planning - how quickly we can destroy ourselves and our environment due to simple human error and pride. Incredibly well-reported and thorough, and highly recommended."
