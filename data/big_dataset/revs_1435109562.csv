0,1435109562,http://goodreads.com/user/show/30785064-harry-doble,4,"I am a fan of this series. Here we have a collection of fifty scientific theories explained as concisely as possible through text and illustrations. The book is divided into seven broad sections: the macrocosm, the microcosm, human evolution, mind & body, planet Earth, the universe, and 'the knowledge', along with a few biographies on famous scientists like Stephen Hawking and James Lovelock. Cosmology and physics figure heavily, but there is also geology, biology, psychology, and information theory. As someone who is largely illiterate in science I can't evaluate how well it meets its goal, but each entry piqued my curiosity and left me with an impression nonetheless, which is all a book like this should really set out to achieve. "
1,1435109562,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4699981-tom-pappalardo,0,"I am so stupid that I couldn't even digest these super-simplified overviews. I liked the pictures, though."
2,1435109562,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2892211-jason-mills,2,"This is a pretty book and a good idea, but it doesn't amount to much. Each theory is presented in around 300 words of text with afterthoughts in sidebars. It seeks to cover physics, cosmology, the Earth, biology, the mind, etc. The text is written by relevant scientists: John Gribbin, Sue Blackmore, Mark Ridley, etc. The content is generally okay, but it can't give more than the most superficial glimpse of what each field is concerned with.I had quibbles with the text; here's a couple of examples:* Gribbin, describing panspermia, asserts: ""It seems certain that some [prebiotic chemicals]... fell on to the young Earth and kick-started life."" Certain? Since when?* Jim Al-Khalili says that the Uncertainty Principle allows one property (speed or position) to be ""measured to infinite accuracy"", when in fact the UP imposes a finite limit on the accuracy obtainable.* We are informed that in the film ""A Beautiful Mind"" the ""mathematical content... was greatly simplified."" This is a bit rich in a science book that only dares include one equation in the entire text, and that's E=mc^2!However, my biggest beef with this book was the illustrations, which occupy the facing page beside each theory. Here was an opportunity to enrich the text with informative diagrams providing clear and practical insight into each subject: perhaps the Hertzsprung–Russell diagram, or RNA transcription at work. Instead, each illustration is little more than a decorative collage of clip-art, with inane captions: ""if you believe in quantum theory"" (as if 'belief' were an appropriate concept in this context). The one accompanying the article on Selfish Genes is incoherent rubbish. Beside Global Warming is not a graph but a travesty of a graph, by an illustrator who has evidently not grasped that the units on a linear axis must be evenly spaced!Whilst its overviews are broadly okay, there is little to be learnt here if you're moderately familiar with science, and little that will stick in your mind if you aren't. There are other books that seek to provide an overview (Bryson's, for instance), and I should think most would do a better job than this one. It's barely coffee-table science."
3,1435109562,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4764429-liz,4,"I am constantly skeptical of science and math books that have an introduction like “I wrote this for the everyday person who doesn’t have a math/science degree! Someone with high school math and science could understand this!” Because all too often...they are not. I know this because I interact with high schoolers daily and I know where their math and science understanding is at. This one, though, at the very least gets close. I also love the layout of the pages and the minimalist graphics. I love the 3 second, 30 second, 3 minute delvings into each theory or idea. I could see this being used by a high school science teacher as an introduction to certain topics or as review, and it was certainly interesting for me to read. I was already familiar with some theories because I do have a bit of a math science background, but others I had not heard of and felt I understood the explanations, maybe occasionally having to read one twice through. In short, I was impressed with this one. The science communicators they gathered to write all the summaries should be proud. "
4,1435109562,http://goodreads.com/user/show/15722652-sehrin,5,Amazing kickstart to expand scientific knowledge. Recommended.
5,1435109562,http://goodreads.com/user/show/16423892-willow-redd,4,"A very intriguing reference to ""the 50 most thought-provoking theories in Science."" Containing a series of brief synopses of some very interesting and indeed thought-provoking theories from the more well known Theory of Relativity, Laws of Motion, and Global Warming; to the lesser known (at least to me) Out of Africa theory, Gaia theory, and the Small World hypothesis (which is now a study I wish to be a part of).This book is an excellent reference for some pretty big ideas that can be delved into with more depth for those interested. There is even a list of resources including books, magazines/articles, and websites the reader can visit for more information.Definitely worth it for the armchair scientist."
6,1435109562,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6919380-icon-books,5,"When it comes to big science, very few things are conclusively known. From Quantum Mechanics to Natural Selection, what we have instead are theories - ideas explain why things happen the way they do. We don't know for certain these are correct - no one ever saw the Big Bang - but with them we can paint beautiful, breathtaking pictures of everything from human behaviour to what the future may hold. Profiling the key scientists behind each theory, ""30-Second Theories"" presents each entry in a unique, eye-catching full-colour design, with thought-provoking extras and stylish illustrations. It is essential for anyone keen on expanding their mind with science's most thrilling ideas. "
7,1435109562,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5772928-aysun,2,"Personally I like my science related books to be 100% objective, this book failed to meet that criteria. I really don't think we needed the author's opinions, mere facts and results of experiments are enough on their own. It was a pretty basic book about main theories in various branches of science, all the information was kept simple and brief, which is probably the aim of the author but that didn't appeal to me and I found it to be rather boring. I guess I wasn't a part of the targeted reader type, oh well.This book got 2 stars instead of 3 only because, considering its price, the illustrations were disappointing too. "
8,1435109562,http://goodreads.com/user/show/35090771-guat-n,3,"I must say the three stars are deceiving. The theories are presented in a very brief and simple way, which makes this book perfect for leaving it by the living room table, so guests can entertain themselves while you are away. It also serves as an entrance door to popular science, since you can always look for more complex books on the subjects you are more interested in."
9,1435109562,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5902222-rene,3,"While I really enjoyed the book, it was quite shallow. To be fair, any deeper expectation towards a book that tries to convey the idea of a modern scientific theory in 30 seconds are bound to not be met."
10,1435109562,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6799663-susan,4,This one is definitely now a part of the permanent reference collection. 
11,1435109562,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9375586-dirk,5,"Very informative, interesting format with the short text formats. I read the Dutch translation. "
12,1435109562,http://goodreads.com/user/show/35382819-mizrob-a,1,"It's my second book from 30-Second series, and the last one. The first book in this series i read was 30-Second Brain edited by Anil Seth, which contained a lot of information (I learned a lot of interesting stuff about the brain) but was very dull overall. This one is worse. This book simplifies the concepts so much that nothing left in the end. I was more disappointed, because Mark Ridley, Jim Al-Khalili, Susan Blackmore, John Gribbin, Bill McGuire were among the contributors in this book. The only useful idea that i got out of this book is this: 'Science shouldn't be communicated in soundbites'."
13,1435109562,http://goodreads.com/user/show/71260686-kim,4,"Though covering 50 theories using one page each resulted in high level overviews, it still introduced me to new pieces of information in the text that I found interesting enough to further research on my own. Plus it was good to brush up on all these items and bring some definitions to things I've only vaguely heard of before."
14,1435109562,http://goodreads.com/user/show/78945623-alan-newton,5,"An excellent short book providing insight into a whole host of complex and more well known theories about humans, knowledge, evolution, earth, the universe. It’s an easy read and a book that will remain a useful reference material for quickly familiarising oneself with key principles across a range of these topics "
15,1435109562,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3130865-daniel-currie,3,"There is a lot of info here, even if is being condensed to a great degree. It is interesting, but I'd be lying if I said I could repeat anything here in it's entirety. It is still much too dense to have a real handle on all of it. Maybe it would work better as a reference book but my puny brain isn't holding onto much of it after reading it, I gotta say.I read this entirely on my Kindle."
16,1435109562,http://goodreads.com/user/show/111925432-ameya,3,"Interesting but not really that simple to understand. I probably would not have understood as much as I did had I not had prior knowledge on some of these topics. The graphics are funky but some of them are cool. The black backgrounds on some of the pages make the text hard to read. Overall, not bad. Covers a lot of different science topics."

18,1435109562,http://goodreads.com/user/show/14014240-alison-whiteman,0,I love science so of course I loved this book. I love it for the simplicity of the illustrations and explanations. 
19,1435109562,http://goodreads.com/user/show/74496863-anthony,3,Very concise.
20,1435109562,http://goodreads.com/user/show/40473382-ibrahim-niftiyev,4,"https://niftiyevibrahim.blogspot.com/ENG: This book helped me to understand a lot of scientific theories which were uncertain to me for a long time. If you have a little time but you have a great aspiration to learn or clarify 50 scientific theories for yourself, I think ""30-Second Theories: The 50 Most Thought-provoking Theories in Science, Each Explained in Half a Minute"" is a great choice. There are a lot of good illustrations and very interesting text communication, so I think a lot of people will love the book. However, don't think that book goes deeper dive into the mentioned 50 scientific theories. The book is the only introduction and if you will continue to show your spectacular aspiration towards the science, then just research more about the exact theories. --------------------------------------------AZE: Məsələ elmə gəlib çıxanda, çox az şey geniş oxucu kütləsi üçün məlum vəziyyətdə olur. Bizim kvant mexanikasından tutmuş, təbii seçməyədək növbənöv nəzəriyyələrimiz var və onlar hadisələrin niyə görə məhz müşahidə olunduğu kimi baş verdiyini izah etməyə çalışır. Onlardan hansının düz, hansının səhv olduğunu deyə bilməsək də, ""Böyük partlayış"" kimi nəzəriyyələr bizə nəfəskəsən hadisələr haqqında ümumi mənzərəni görməyə vasitəçi ola bilir. ""30 saniyə ərzində elmi nəzəriyyələr"" bizə parlaq illüstrasiyalar, maraqlı izah metodları və elmi yanaşma ilə fərqli bir kitabın mövcud ola biləcəyini sübut edir. Elmi nəzəriyyələrlə maraqlanan, onları indiyədək bulanıq bilən insanlar üçün ""30 saniyə ərzində elmi nəzəriyyələr"" kitabı əsl hədiyyə olacaq.50 ədəd elmi nəzəriyyənin şəkilli və rahat mətn formatında birləşməsindən ibarət olan kitab çox maraqlı bir məqsədə xidmət edir: cəmisi 30 saniyə ərzində, başqa sözlə mümkün ola biləcək ən qısa vaxt və konkret üslubda hər hansısa elmi nəzəriyyənin istənilən oxucuya çatdırılması. Buraya fizika, astronomiya, biologiya, kosmologiya, tibb və psixologiya kimi elm sahələri aiddir. Xüsusilə yarıintellektual insanlar vardır ki, onlar həmişə nəyisə bilirlər, amma onların bilik səviyyəsi kifayət qədər qənaətbəxş dərəcədə olmur. Bunun səbəbləri çox ola bilər və onlardan biri də odur ki, insanlar çox vaxt öz peşəkar və şəxsi həyatları ilə bir o qədər də kəsişməyən sahələr haqqında öyrənməyə can atmırlar. Aydın məsələdir ki, bu vaxt və digər resursların yüksək miqdarda istifadəsini tələb edir. ""30 saniyə ərzində elmi nəzəriyyələr"" isə bu problemin həllini öz üzərinə götürüb.Maraqlı bir faktı qeyd edim ki, kitabı ""Əli və Nino"" kitab dükanında olduqca yüksək qiymətə (həmişə olduğu kimi) görmüşdüm və diqqətimi hələ o vaxt cəlb etmişdi. 30 saniyə çərçivəsində fəlsəfə, iqtisadiyyat, əsatir və miflər, eləcə də dinlər kimi başqa silsilə kitablar da var. Başqa sözlə, bu kitablar müxtəlif müəlliflər tərəfindən yazılan, lakin eyni məqsədi, cəmisi 30 saniyə ərzində oxucuya seçilmiş istiqamət üzrə verilə biləcək məlumatları maksimumlaşdıran formata malikdir. ""30 saniyə ərzində elmi nəzəriyyələr"" mənim bu silsilədən tanış olduğum ilk kitab oldu və digər kitabları da böyük məmnuniyyətlə gələcəkdə mütaliə edəcəm. Buna baxmayaraq, ""30 saniyə ərzində elmi nəzəriyyələr"" kitabını səhv anlamaq lazım deyil. Nəzərə almaq lazımdır ki, kitab, məsələn, kosmologiyaya aid elmi nəzəriyyələrin ətraflı və dərinləməsinə təhlillərini çatdırmağı özünə hədəf etməyib. Bu daha çox həmin nəzəriyyələrə giriş xarakterini daşıyan təqdimedici xarakterə malikdir. Yəni, oxu, əgər xoşun gəldisə, marağını çəkdisə, deməli daha da dərinlərə enmək üçün araşdırmalara başlamağa səbəblərin var. Bu baxımdan kitabdan qeyri-real gözləntilərdə olmaq məntiqsizdir. Adı ilə daxili bir-birinə tamamilə uyğun gəlir. Əminəm ki, digər silsilə kitalar da bu qəbildəndir. Kitab haqqında uzun-uzadı deyiləsi əlavə söz yoxdur. Elmin özü kimi qısa və konkret, lakonik və məntiqlidir. Odur ki, vaxtınız azdırsa, lakin əsas şeyləri öyrənməkdə israrlısınızsa, o zaman ""30 saniyə ərzində elmi nəzəriyyələr"" sizə görə bir kitabdır. https://niftiyevibrahim.blogspot.com/"
21,1435109562,http://goodreads.com/user/show/55832278-harrison,3,"It was good, but there's nothing new here for anyone with at least a working knowledge of the sciences, such as University students or above.At most, I can recommend this book to high schoolers interested in science, but even then, they'll know some of this stuff already."
22,1435109562,http://goodreads.com/user/show/343169-anne,5,"My science education was quite lacking during school. I loved it, but often had to choose between art and science. I believe that the answers of life live in the intersections of science and art. With that said, this book is a great way for me to brush up on a lot of the understandings of the universe that I missed in school. It breaks down complex theories into a short explanation- even though the explanations are somewhat incomplete... the short overall ideas are rich for a short justification of a scientific theory. If you see a theory that interests you, you could always go and study it further to get a better understanding. But for the basics of current scientific theories that are driving current thought and research, it's a great intro that's well designed with fun illustrations and is easy to read in short bursts - which is perfect for artists like me who want to maximize their creative thinking and creation time, but still like to keep up on the larger understandings of science. ;-)"
23,1435109562,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3386253-george,2,"A book that explains quickly the 50 most thought provoking theories in science. Unfortunately some of them are known to be in error by even the contributors. The diagrams accompanying the text is basic, and features some theories which are questionable at best to be amongst the most 'thought provoking'.As an example I cite 'Complimentary medicine' which even the contributor Robert Matthews dismisses as 'hocus pocus'. It also includes theories that have been discredited by recent evidence such as 'Snowball Earth', though it could be argued that its inclusion has some merit.That being said, reading up on the uncertainty principle, quantum entanglement, panspermia and of course schrodinger's cat was interesting, if brief.The book certainly highlighted theories to research in more detail as well as given enough of an understanding to get more of the jokes on The Big Bang Theory. ;)http://briefcasebooks.wordpress.com/2..."
24,1435109562,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11020538-cheylianie,4,"A friend lent me this book a few days ago, so I put `Demon-Haunted World’ on-hold for a while. Like the cover says, this book contains 50 of the most popular theories in physics, psychology, geology, evolution, astronomy, and biology explained in a small paragraph of just 300 words. It's a very ambitious idea, and so you get a very simplified summary of the theories, but it's a great place to start. And if, like me, you are already familiar with some of them, it will be a fun memory refresher. My favorites were The Theory of Relativity, Out of Africa, Natural Selection, The Origin of Language, Continental Drift, The Big Bang, Dark Matter, Parallel Worlds, and The Fate of the Universe. It's a short book of less than 200 pages, and it's full of pictures, so it's a very quick read. I especially recommend the sections: Human Evolution, Planet Earth, and The Universe."
25,1435109562,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7191275-claire,3,"I love the idea of this book, and it's a nice little introduction to some famous scientific theories, but it seems to me that some of these theories, particularly the ones involving the wacky world of quantum mechanics, simply cannot be adequately explained in thirty seconds, and the illustrations, while cute, did not add to or expand upon any of the information given.Nevertheless, this book did it's job pretty well; it has inspired an unscientific person like me to learn more about these theories and pick up more science books that aren't about animals, which certainly counts for something. And this would also make a pretty interesting coffee table book, sure to spark up some deeper conversations when company's over."
26,1435109562,http://goodreads.com/user/show/81463-shane,3,"This was cool. A little insight on 50 ""theories"" each explained in half a minute. Perfect for bathroom readers. I was hoping that the theories would be more out there and controversial but they were mostly well known theories like Global Warming, The Big Bang, Ockham's Razor, Chaos Theory etc... There was definitely a bunch of stuff I hadn't heard of before and some that I knew about but never knew what they were called. More than a couple of these made me want to get books that covered the theories in depth. \"

The illustrations were entertaining though, i asked my 5-year old to read the caption about Dark Energy and he freaked, highly amused and we ended up discussing it --- ""“Don’t panic but 96 percent of the Universe is missing!” So i add one more star because i could leave the book lying in the coffee table to draw interest from my kids. :)Anyhow, any material that stirs the mind to go wiki more, or to even challenge the content is good.

Such a book is just a mediocre interpretation of science intended for a general and young audience. How can you understand something about the theory written there in about 200 words? If you want to know about the world of science through popularization you can read Isaak Asimov  or Stephen Hawking books, as an example. "
