The book covers a range of mistakes, including bridge failures, space exploration disasters, game show cheats, financial algorithms gone rogue, and so much more.I pretty much loved this book from start to finish. I found it thoroughly fascinating and often hilarious. Parker has a great way with explaining technical subjects, distilling it down to layman terms while retaining his humor. Even on events I already know about, Parker's explanations provided a new and interesting take.The book is organized so that similar themes are grouped together into chapters, but each incident is only a few pages long, so it never feels bogged down or boring. I found it best to read with the internet handy, so I could zip on and find out more whenever it interested me.It's been a while since I've been this riveted by a nonfiction book. I was tearing through it, chuckling to myself and stopping only to look up videos of Michael Larson on Press Your Luck and Galloping Gertie as it came down. I'm so glad I happened across this book. It totally spoke to the inner engineer nerd in me. After all, the only thing more fascinating than how something works is when it doesn't."

That many people actually did die as a result of many of the errors is tragic and definitely takes most of fun from the comedy. The unfortunate book name aside, it's a magnificent read into how maths go bump in everywhere.Q:‘Plaintiff’s insistence that the commercial appears to be a serious offer requires the Court to explain why the commercial is funny. Explaining why a joke is funny is a daunting task.’ (c)Q:I went with my favourite method of comparing big numbers to time. We know a million, a billion and a trillion are different sizes, but we often don’t appreciate the staggering increases between them. A million seconds from now is just shy of eleven days and fourteen hours. Not so bad. I could wait that long. It’s within two weeks. A billion seconds is over thirty-one years.A trillion seconds from now is after the year 33700CE.Those surprising numbers actually make perfect sense after a moment’s thought. Million, billion and trillion are each a thousand times bigger than each other. A million seconds is roughly a third of a month, so a billion seconds is on the order of 330 (a third of a thousand) months. And if a billion is around thirty-one years, then of course a trillion is around 31,000 years. (c)Q:Even after a lifetime of education dealing with small numbers there is a vestigial instinct that larger numbers are logarithmic; that the gap between a trillion and a billion feels about the same as the jump between a million and a billion – because both are a thousand times bigger. In reality, the jump to a trillion is much bigger: the difference between living to your early thirties and a time when humankind may no longer exist. (c)Q:I believe that ‘regardless of flight phase’ is official FAA speak for ‘This could go down mid-flight.’ Their official line on airworthiness was the requirement of ‘repetitive maintenance tasks for electrical power deactivation’. That is to say, anyone with a Boeing 787 had to remember to turn it off and on again. (с)Q:A political committee is rarely a good solution to a mathematical problem. (c)Q:To get everything back into alignment in the first place, the year 46BCE had a possible-world-record 445 days. (c)Q:The building at 20 Fenchurch Street in London … By all measures, it’s a successful building. Except, during the summer of 2013, it started setting things on fire. …The exterior of the building was designed by architect Rafael Viñoly to have a sweeping curve, but this meant that all the reflective glass windows accidentally became a massive concave mirror – a kind of giant lens in the sky able to focus sunlight on a tiny area. It’s not often sunny in London, but when a sun-filled day in summer 2013 lined up with the recently completed windows, a death heat-ray swept across London. Okay, it wasn’t that bad. But it was producing temperatures of around 90°C, which was enough to scorch the doormat at a nearby barber’s shop. A parked car was a bit melted and someone claimed it burned their lemon (that’s not cockney rhyming slang; it was an actual lemon). A local reporter with a flair for the dramatic took the opportunity to fry some eggs by placing a pan in the hotspot. (c)Q:In July 2011 a thirty-nine-storey shopping centre in South Korea had to be evacuated because resonance was vibrating the building. People at the top of the building felt it start to shake, as if someone had banged the bass and turned up the treble. Which was exactly the problem. After the official investigation had ruled out an earthquake, they found the culprit was an exercise class on the twelfth floor.On 5 July 2011 they had decided to work out to Snap’s ‘The Power’, and everyone jumped around harder than they usually did. Could the rhythm of ‘The Power’ match a resonant frequency of the building? During the investigation, about twenty people were crammed back into that room to recreate the exercise class and, sure enough, they did have the power. When the exercise class on the twelfth floor had ‘The Power’, the thirty-eighth floor started shaking around ten times more than it normally did. (c)Q:When it was reopened, the Millennium Bridge was described as ‘probably the most complex passively-damped structure in the world’. Not an epithet most of us would aspire to. (c)Q:… British engineers prided themselves on their stiff upper bridges. (c)Q:Obviously, we should do whatever we can to avoid engineering mistakes, but when engineers are pushing the boundaries of what is possible, occasionally a new aspect of mathematical behaviour will unexpectedly emerge. Sometimes the addition of a little bit more mass is all it takes to change the mathematics of how a structure behaves.This is a common theme in human progress. We make things beyond what we understand, and we always have done. …When theory lags behind application, there will always be mathematical surprises lying in wait. The important thing is that we learn from these inevitable mistakes and don’t repeat them. (c)Q:In the mid-1990s a new employee of Sun Microsystems in California kept disappearing from their database. Every time his details were entered, the system seemed to eat him whole; he would disappear without a trace. No one in HR could work out why poor Steve Null was database kryptonite. (c)Q:Carrying on in the same vein as Steve Null, I’d like you to meet Brian Test, Avery Blank and Jeff Sample. The Null problem can be fixed by encoding names in a format for only character data, so that it doesn’t get confused with the data value of NULL. But Avery Blank has a bigger problem: humans. When Avery Blank was at law school she had difficulty getting an internship because her applications were not taken seriously. People would see ‘Blank’ in the surname field and assume it was an incomplete application. She always had to get in touch and convince the selection committee that she was a real human.Brian Test and Jeff Sample fell foul of the same problem, but for slightly different reasons. When you set up a new database, or a way to input data, it’s good practice to test it and make sure it’s all working. So you feed through some dummy data to check the pipeline. I run a lot of projects with schools, and they often sign up online. I’ve just opened my most recent such database and scrolled to the top. The first entry is from a Ms Teacher who works at Test High School on Test Road in the county of Fakenham. She’s probably a relation of Mr Teacher from St Fakington’s Grammar School, who seems to sign up for everything I do.To avoid being deleted as unwanted test data, when Brian Test started a new job, he brought in a cake for all his new colleagues to enjoy. Printed on the cake was a picture of his face, with the following words written in icing: ‘I’m Brian Test and I’m real.’ Like a lot of office problems, the issue was solved with free cake, and he was not deleted again. (c)Q:So, when it comes to names, if you inherit a database-killing last name, you can either wear it as a badge of honour or take some deed-poll action. But if you are a parent, please don’t give your child a first name which will set them up for a lifetime of battling computers. And given that over three hundred children in the USA since 1990 have been named Abcde, it’s worth spelling this out: don’t name your child anything like Fake, Null or DECLARE. (c)Q:In Los Angeles there is a block of land on the corner of West 1st Street and South Spring Street which houses the offices of the LA Times. It is just down the street from City Hall and directly over the road from the LA Police Department. There may be some rough areas of LA best avoided by tourists, but this is certainly not one of them. The area looks as safe as safe can be … until you check the LAPD’s online map of reported crime locations. Between October 2008 and March 2009 there were 1,380 crimes on that block. That’s around 4 per cent of all crimes marked on the map.When the LA Times noticed this, it politely asked the LAPD what was going on. … If the computer is unable to work out the location, it simply logs the default location for Los Angeles: the front doorstep of the LAPD headquarters. (c)Q:Whenever a computer cannot decipher a location, it still has to fill something in, and so 0,0 became the default location. The island where bad data goes to die. (c)Q:For a start, just because something walks like a number and quacks like a number does not mean it is a number. (c)Q:For generations, cartographers have been sneaking fictitious places into real maps (often as a way to expose people plagiarizing their work), and it was inevitable that Null Island would take on a life of its own. So, they literally put it on the map. (c)Q:So the signs remain incorrect. But at least now I have a framed letter from the UK government saying that they don’t think accurate maths is important and they don’t believe street signs should have to follow the laws of geometry. (c)Q:Never put ‘teamwork cogs’ as a search term into a stock image website. For a start, if you’re not used to the cheese-tastic world of inspirational work posters, what you see will come as a shock. The next shock is that a lot of the diagrams supposed to be showing a team working like a well-oiled machine use a mechanism which would be permanently seized in place. …The longer I think about it, the more I’m convinced that this does actually make a great analogy for workplace teamwork. (c)Q:I don’t complain that Picasso’s works are biologically implausible or send Salvador Dalí angry letters about the melting point of clocks. (c)Q:It seems they used to do their upper- and lower-body workouts on alternate days but now, due to a lack of time, they wanted to know if there was any risk in doing it all on the same day, making for fewer trips to the gym. I know how they feel: I split my days between geometry and algebra. (c)Q:The game designers had deliberately given Gandhi the lowest non-zero aggression rating possible: a score of 1. Classic Gandhi. But later in the game, when all the civilizations were becoming more, well, civilized, every leader had their aggression rating dropped by two. For Gandhi, starting from 1, this calculation played out as 1 − 2 = 255, suddenly setting him to maximum aggression. Even though this error has since been fixed, later versions of the game have kept Gandhi as the most nuke-happy leader as a tradition. (с)Q:If you want something unlikely to occur, you simply need the patience to create enough opportunities to allow it to happen. (c)Q:The managers and high-up people in NASA were saying that each shuttle launch had only a one in 100,000 chance of disaster. But, to Feynman’s ears, that did not sound right. He realized it would mean there could be a shuttle launch every day for three hundred years with only one disaster. (с)Q:What counts as a mistake in finance? Of course, there are the obvious ones, where people simply get the numbers wrong. On 8 December 2005 the Japanese investment firm Mizuho Securities sent an order to the Tokyo Stock Exchange to sell a single share in the company J-COM Co. Ltd for ¥610,000 (around £3,000 at the time). Well, they thought they were selling one share for ¥610,000 but the person typing in the order accidentally swapped the numbers and put in an order to sell 610,000 shares for ¥1 each.They frantically tried to cancel it, but the Tokyo Stock Exchange was proving resistant. Other firms were snapping up the discount shares and, by the time trading was suspended the following day, Mizuho Securities were looking at a minimum of ¥27 billion in losses (well over £100 million at the time). It was described as a ‘fat fingers’ error. I would have gone with something more like ‘distracted fingers’ or ‘should learn to double-check all important data entry but is probably now fired anyway fingers’. The wake of the error was wide-reaching: confidence dropped in the Tokyo Stock Exchange as a whole, and the Nikkei Index fell 1.95 per cent in one day. Some, but not all, of the firms which bought the discount stock offered to give them back. A later ruling by the Tokyo District Court put some of the blame on the Tokyo Stock Exchange because their system did not allow Mizuho to cancel the erroneous order. This only serves to confirm my theory that everything is better with an undo button.This is the numerical equivalent of a typo. (c)Q:Some of the ancient Sumerian records were written by a person seemingly named Kushim and signed off by their supervisor, Nisa. Some historians have argued that Kushim is the earliest human whose name we know. It seems the first human whose name has been passed down through millennia of history was not a ruler, a warrior or a priest … but an accountant. The eighteen existing clay tablets which are signed Kushim indicate that their job was to control the stock levels in a warehouse which held the raw materials for brewing beer. I mean, that is still a thing; a friend of mine manages a brewery and does exactly that for a living. (His name is Rich, by the way, just in case this book is one of the few objects to survive the apocalypse and he becomes the new oldest-named human.) (c)Q:A salami-slicing rounding-down attack was part of the plot of the 1999 film Office Space (just like Superman III). The main characters altered the computer code at a company so that, whenever interest was being calculated, instead of being rounded to the nearest penny the value would be truncated and the remaining fractions of a penny deposited into their account. Like the Vancouver Stock Exchange Index, this could theoretically carry on unnoticed as those fractions of pennies gradually added up.Most real-world salami-slicing scams seem to use amounts greater than fractions of a penny but still operate below the threshold where people will notice and complain. One embezzler within a bank wrote software to take twenty or thirty cents out of accounts at random, never hitting the same account more than three times in a year. Two programmers in a New York firm increased the tax withheld on all company pay cheques by two cents each week but sent the money to their own tax-withholding accounts so they received it all as a tax refund at the end of the year. There are rumours that an employee of a Canadian bank implemented the interest-rounding scam to net $70,000 (and was discovered only when the bank looked for the most active account to give them an award), but I cannot find any evidence to back that up. (c)Q:Precision and accuracy often get jumbled together, but they are two very different things. Precision is the level of detail given, and accuracy is how true something is. I can accurately say I was born on Earth, but it’s not very precise. I can precisely say I was born at latitude 37.229N, longitude 115.811W, but that is not at all accurate. Which gives you a lot of wriggle-room when answering questions if people don’t demand that you be accurate and precise. Accurately, I can say that someone drank all the beer. Precisely, I can say that an Albanian who holds several Tetris world records drank all the beer. But I’d rather not be precise and accurate at the same time, as it may incriminate me. (c)Q:In 2017 it was reported that if the US switched all of its coal power production to be solar power it would save 51,999 lives every year, an oddly specific number. It clearly looks like it has not been rounded; check out all those nines! But to my eye it looks like two numbers of different sizes have been combined and have produced an unnecessary level of precision as a result. I’ve mentioned in this book that the universe is 13,800 million years old. But if you’re reading it three years after it was published, that does not mean that the universe is now 13,800,000,003 years old. Numbers with different orders of magnitude (sizes of the numbers) cannot always be added and subtracted from each other in a meaningful way. The figure of 51,999 was the difference between lives saved not using coal and deaths caused by solar. Previous research in 2013 had established that the emissions from coal-burning power stations caused about 52,000 deaths a year. The solar photovoltaic industry was still too small to have any recorded deaths. So the researchers used statistics from the semiconductor industry (which has very similar manufacturing processes and utilizes dangerous chemicals) to estimate that solar-panel manufacture would cause one death per year. So 51,999 lives saved per year. Easy.The problem was that the starting value of 52,000 was a rounded figure with only two significant figures and now, suddenly, it had five. I went back to the 2013 research, and the original figure was 52,200 deaths a year. And that was already a bit of a guess (for all you stats fans, the value of 52,200 had a 90 per cent confidence interval of 23,400 to 94,300). The 2013 research into coal-power deaths had rounded this figure to 52,000 but, if we un-round it back to 52,200, then solar power can save 52,199 lives! We just saved an extra two hundred people!I can see why, for political reasons, the figure of 51,999 was used – to draw attention to the single expected death from solar-panel production and so to emphasize how safe it is. And that extra precision does make a number look more authoritative. The reduced precision in a rounded number makes them also feel less accurate, even though that is often not the case. Those zeros on the end may also be part of the precision. One in a million people will unknowingly live exactly a whole number of kilometres (door to door) from work, accurate to the nearest millimetre. (c)Q:In February 2017 the BBC reported a recent Office for National Statistics (ONS) report that in the last three months of 2016 ‘UK unemployment fell by 7,000 to 1.6 million people.’ But this change of seven thousand is well below what the number 1.6 million had been rounded to. Mathematician Matthew Scroggs was quick to point out that the BBC was basically saying that unemployment had gone from 1.6 million to 1.6 million. (c)Q:Simply telling people not to make any mistakes is a naive way to try to avoid accidents and disasters. James Reason is an Emeritus Professor of Psychology at the University of Manchester whose research is on human error. He put forward the Swiss Cheese model of disasters, which looks at the whole system, instead of focusing on individual people.The Swiss Cheese model looks at how ‘defenses, barriers, and safeguards may be penetrated by an accident trajectory’. This accident trajectory imagines accidents as similar to a barrage of stones being thrown at a system: only the ones which make it all the way through result in a disaster. Within the system are multiple layers, each with their own defences and safeguards to slow mistakes. But each layer has holes. They are like slices of Swiss cheese.I love this view of accident management because it acknowledges that people will inevitably make mistakes a certain percentage of the time. The pragmatic approach is to acknowledge this and build a system robust enough to filter mistakes out before they become disasters. When a disaster occurs, it is a system-wide failure and it may not be fair to find a single human to take the blame. (c)Q:It is my uninformed impression that in some industries, such as medicine and finance, which do tend to blame the individual, ignoring the whole system can lead to a culture of not admitting mistakes when they happen. Which, ironically, makes the system less able to deal with them. (c)"
2,0241360196,http://goodreads.com/user/show/17237503-eilonwy,4,"I really enjoyed this book! I'm one of those people who got labelled ""bad at math"" at a young age because I struggled with arithmetic (and still do). That resulted in my getting handed a lot of books of ""math is fun!"" type puzzles when I was a kid, which were definitely much more fun than math class. I learned to differentiate ""math"" from ""arithmetic"" and stubbornly took math classes up through calculus, which was fascinating, but which I've sadly never had any occasion to put to use. To make this long story short, I recommend this book to people who think they hate math or who found/find math difficult, as well as technically-inclined types who use math all the time. The topics covered in this book are wide-ranging, and a lot of them are things you might not even think of as being mathematical (putting a padlock on a door properly, for instance, or people with names that get ignored by computer code). Matt Parker's voice is witty without ever talking down to his audience. He just really loves anything even tangentially mathematical, and loves sharing it with everyone else. And this book made me laugh out loud many times! It's possibly all nerd humor, but it was great. There are three math errors in this book which I did not catch (but also didn't look for very hard). So this book has a math game in it! Also, it's numbered backwards, which made it tricky to track my process through it here, since Goodreads won't let you update to Page 141 when you started on Page 316. There's also a trick to the index that I didn't figure out (but the index is worth reading for itself, as well). I may reread this sometime and actually try to find the errors and solve the indexing. But there was a waiting list for it at the library, so I zoomed it back as soon as I finished it. This is some of the most fun I've had reading in quite a while. So seriously, even if your knee-jerk reaction is to recoil in horror from the thought of reading a math book, try it anyway. "
3,0241360196,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4761375-ed,4,"Knew I was going to love this book when I opened it and immediately saw the page numbers going the wrong way.It is a lot of fun the whole way through. Parker takes us through some of his favourite, or some of the more noteworthy, cases of maths going wrong across a variety of applications. We're talking engineering and computing, from bridges to spacecraft to calendars to ancient sumerian tablets. His enthusiam shines brightly through, and it's hard to not be infected by it. His writing is infused with a dry wit and a good sprinkling of genuine laugh-out-loud humour, which hopefully would make this a fun read ever for those who aren't already invested in the maths stories.My major criticism is that despite the clear over-arching theme of maths problems, the book still does not feel that cohesive. It has the feeling of a series of articles, and just never quite manages to tie them all together or raise a greater point. This ultimately doesn't matter too much though as it is still a very engaging and enjoyable read. Definitely learnt a new thing or two!"
4,0241360196,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7116232-tgv,2,"Summary: not very interesting, and it's not about maths errors.This book is a collection of anecdotes that you can read anywhere: most of them I had read before, and you can find them on the internet, too. They're bundled by theme here, which is convenient, but the writer tries too hard to make them appear connected, and more often than not that results in uninspired paragraphs. Here's an example from a random page:""But what happens when computers try to divide by zero? Unless they've been explicitly told that they can't divide by zero, they naively give it a go. And the results can be terrifying.""You can almost hear that in that slick documentary voice-over style, where everything spells doom: ""Will the team find a way out, ... or will they fail?"" And in this case (really, I picked a random page), the writer is wrong. There has been no ""naively"" dividing by zero for quite some time now. What happens is well defined, and in many languages requires explicit handling. There are more cases where the writer follows this loose, ""journalistic"" style, almost as if he expects the reader would lose interest without such casual segues.And that leads me to the next problem: most of the book is not about math errors. Instead, it's about not understanding or not properly modelling the subject matter (physics mostly), not measuring correctly, and not implementing properly. And quite a bit of text is dedicated to explaining probability calculus. Only a small part is about actual mathematical errors.So, if you want some entertaining reading with a technical streak, this can be your book, provided you've never read about the Challenger report, and don't know anything about collapsing bridges or programming errors that crash rockets. Otherwise, you might want to look for something else."
5,0241360196,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10691769-mark-loughridge,3,"I love maths. I enjoy finding out about mathematical and statistical errors. I was thinking some of my maths teacher friends might enjoy it and find it useful for illustrations in class. Thats where the plot breaks down a little.I enjoyed the book but was a little disappointed that so much was taken from fields of computing and engineering, where the issue wasn't strictly a mathematical failure, but a failure, for example, to understand the limits of binary, or load-bearing, or resonant frequency. Many of the examples could easily have found themselves in books subtitled ""A Comedy of Engineering Errors"" or ""A Comedy of Programming Errors""The book is fine if you are looking for a book that shows how mathematics in its many practical applications goes wrong. Having said that there are chapters that are more maths/number/statistics oriented than others. But not as many as I would have liked.The book is reasonably well written, but a few too many asides to the reader for my liking."
6,0241360196,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6100646-brian-clegg,4,"Matt Parker had me thoroughly enjoying this collection of situations where maths and numbers go wrong in everyday life. I think the book's title is a little weak - 'Humble Pi' doesn't really convey what it's about, but that subtitle 'a comedy of maths errors' is far more informative.With his delightful conversational style, honed in his stand-up maths shows, it feels as if Parker is a friend down the pub, relating the story of some technical disaster driven by maths and computing, or regaling us with a numerical cock-up. These range from the spectacular - wobbling and collapsing bridges, for example - to the small but beautifully formed, such as Excel's rounding errors.Sometimes it's Parker's little asides that are particularly attractive. I loved his rant on why phone numbers aren't numbers at all (would it be meaningful for someone to ask you what half your phone number is?). We discover the trials and tribulations of getting calendars right, explore some of the oddities of probability, enjoy a bit of impossible geometry and see how getting units right (or wrong) can make all the difference. Of course there are the big stories, from NASA disasters to the risks of trying to crash onboard systems on planes mid-flight. But it's often those little details like the phone numbers that tickled me. I loved, for example, Parker's attempts to get the footballs on UK signs geometrically correct - totally misunderstood by the bureaucracy - or when Parker points out the problems of graphics featuring multiple cogs interlocked with each other in a way that will lock them solid - not to mention his combinatorial struggles with the McDonald's McChoice menu.The only thing I did find - and this is the only reason the book doesn't get five stars - is that the final couple of chapters seemed a little samey. Rather than save the best to last, Parker resorts to revisiting rather familiar feeling computer problems, which are interesting (but perhaps more to me, with a background in computing, than many readers), but by now not quite as original and fresh feeling.However, this is an excellent read, managing to be light and meaty at the same time, and highly recommended for anyone interested in maths, business or computing."
7,0241360196,http://goodreads.com/user/show/65398513-steve,3,"A Christmas present book from a relative in recognition of my past technical career.Each chapter a nugget of information about some ‘maths’ error that has caused us problems in everyday life. I put ‘maths’ in inverted commas as many of the issues may be a poor engineering implementation of some analysis. As each chapter is independent of others it’s easy to dip in and out of the book when one fancies light relief from the more serious business of reading fiction!Not normally a book I’d review on here. I don’t go for popular science of this type, anecdotal though informed, commentary on technical mistakes. I’ve found that in the modern era many science bloggers online can provide up to date light or serious reviews of technical problems in a digestible and easy to understand form. Books on the same topic seem to me too frozen when a lively discussion online, something interactive, is often a better way to understand the problem. Just my view though.This book is better than most popular ‘wow, isn’t that silly scientists did this’ books. About half of the chapters I did find genuinely interesting (eg how clocks in computer operating systems can be designed to count down from some very high number on the assumption that time zero will be well beyond the expected operating life of the system - guess what?!). Some, such as how numbers placed in spreadsheets in a text format can lead to errors interpreting spreadsheet outputs, had me yawning! But if you’re prepared to ditch out of chapters quickly that you don’t enjoy and move onto the next it’s generally an interesting read.I think the author has great talent for popularising some difficult science and maths concepts (he does well with probability) and he’s easy to read but it’d be better to see it used for one grand concept in a book rather than this mish mash of the interesting and mundane. I know it’ll be a matter of a reader’s interests but about half of the book covered topics I regarded as dull, so you’ll need to work to find the ones that interest you.If you get it as a present then worth a read but I wouldn’t go out of my way to recommend it for a purchase, if you want an interesting popular science read."

One of my quarantine changes is that I now have a dedicated reading hour each morning with my daughter. When she went to school in person, her school practiced this post lunch and suggested incorporating it into her school at home schedule. I mention this specifically, because to be honest, in a pre-COVID-19 world, I would have 100% thought about finishing this, but never done it, and returned it 15% read to the library with the intention to finish it someday. With the schedule change, I read a chapter or so of this each weekday (I rotate through 3 books for reading hour), and I was delighted to find that I was enjoying it more than I really thought I would. I ended up reading out some of the anecdotes to my daughter and sharing the pictures with her as well as explaining some of the concepts to her.

Matt is a mathematician and you can easily tell that even if you don't have much background about him, by his style of writing.The book's 11th Chapter in particular was so breathtakingly gripping, that I finished it in one go. Even the other parts of the book read like an epic collection of short stories, each of which, combined with excellent writing skills, provide for am exhilerating experience.Disclaimer: I realized that I was often laughing like a madman while commuting in Auckland Metro, so if you spotted me at it, I apologize for the inconvenience. But seriously, this book is legit funny so beware, you would find yourself stupidly chuckling for no reason whatsoever, quite often."
13,0241360196,http://goodreads.com/user/show/16212136-peter-pete-mcloughlin,4, Because people don't have a good intuitive mathematical and number sense they make engineering and computer science mistakes that are quite dangerous. Mathematics sense is artificial and cultivated in people it isn't natural at all as you can ask any trig student. This book shows where our blind spots in this area get us in trouble especially in technical fields with lots of mathematical moving parts. Good stuff.
14,0241360196,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5924440-girish,4,"Not so much a comedy since most errors ended up as tragedy. And yet, it is an important book to be written - what with mushrooming engineering colleges churning out supposed engineers every year!The author doesn't dumb it down and hence some of the places are tough to comprehend. At the same time, the errors which were non-tragic and even funny (like Gandhi going all nuclear thanks to math error) were explained with so much passion that make your trivia quotient.Some of the concepts were high school physics and yet it seemed like an oversight from the engineer. And it is scary given how much we are dependent on maths, how trivial we take it. Computers are a hope, but that too in the hands of coders who are watching netflix in office.It's not a rant. Just a scary thought. Good book of trivia. Wish it was structured slightly better."
15,0241360196,http://goodreads.com/user/show/110076534-cameron-aird,5,"Matt Parker is an Australian mathematician, author and comedian. A former maths teacher, he has made a living for himself popularising maths tours and videos in real life and online. He has previously written one book on the topic of mathematics, Things to Make and Do in the Fourth Dimension, as well as co-writing Hacking the Kinect. The book of his I will be reviewing is non-fiction, Humble Pi, A Comedy of Maths Errors, published in 2019. The book focuses on many mistakes in real life consequence of bad mathematics in an interesting and often comedic way. It explores the relationship between the human brain and its ability to process and handle the complex processes of modern day mathematics. While cheeky and childish at times, the book also dwells into a more serious point of views in which the consequences of poorly done calculations can result in drastic cases of enormous economic loss and fatal accidents. Many themes are brought up throughout the book, many of which expand beyond the literal confines of mathematics. I thoroughly enjoyed this book. Some of its most likeable characteristics included humour, jest and larrikin, which provided a warm contrast to some of the darker themes brought up in the read. It can become slightly complicated in some areas, and some advanced mathematical knowledge may be required for some readers. I sometimes struggled to get my head around some of the topics provided in the book. However, I don’t think this will stop most people from turning away from this book. Most of the time it is an easy to read, lightweight book that takes the reader on an enjoyable ride around the world of mathematics.One of the very many potent themes in this book is the claim that maths is ignored or disregarded in everyday life and there is a significant disrespect from those who believe maths is unimportant. Parker exclaims “My main point was that there is a general feeling in society that maths is not that important; that it’s okay not to be good at it. But so much of our economy and technology requires people who are good at maths.” Parker presents an interesting idea to explore about the relationship between society and maths. The idea that when maths is quickly pushed aside as inessential or inconsequential, it creates a message in society that it doesn’t provide any meaningful contribution in everyday life. Even as young as primary school, students wonder how maths will be of use of them in the future. And for years 11 & 12 at my school, english is compulsory while mathematics is not. Parker amplifies this idea as well by incorporating real life consequences in his book. He reports “Both mistakes together resulted in the deaths of 114 people...The vast majority of the time, people cross bridges and walk across walkways blissfully unaware of how much engineering has gone into making it possible. We only really notice when it goes wrong.” This quote is on a more serious level to the previous one, as it includes a real life consequence of maths errors. The mathematics error responsible for the deaths of 114 in the Kansas Hyatt Walkway Collapse in 1981 was the result of a simple one extra nut added to each of the walkway beams. Parker includes this example to show the reader real issues with bad mathematics, and how a more concrete understanding of it could greatly improve safety in the areas of industrial physics and maths. I would recommend this book to anyone that has even a mild passion for mathematics. It does a tremendous job at exploring a wide range of mathematical quandaries, and suggesting ways they could have been improved. It takes the reader on a journey through time and space to events and experiences I thought not possible to be communicated through the written word. It takes you all around the world, to famous locations and events to exploit mathematical errors, including the Sydney Harbour Bridge and some of NASA’s failed projects. Overall, I think it is a very good book, 9/10. "
16,0241360196,http://goodreads.com/user/show/18906322-joanne,0,"Before I retired, I worked in a government department that no one ever noticed because it had a low profile. This wasn't nefarious, it just wasn't a department that got press, such as education, health or highways maintenance. What this department did have was a whole world of very specific acronyms and jargon that meant absolutely nothing to anyone not working there. Sometimes when a group of us got together socially, we would inevitably end up talking about work and this would lead to knee-slapper jokes in which this jargon played a central role. (You really had to be there to see this in action). Then we'd look around and see the blank faces on our spouses and friends and realize ""Oh no, they just don't get the joke."" Cue the sheepish chagrin. This is a long-winded opening for a review of a book that feels very much like my workplace. Math lovers would probably be rolling in the aisles with some of this material and eating up the details of how many seconds there are left in the life of their computers. Me, not so much. I tried to follow along but the overwhelming feeling for me was that I was never going to get it. So I stopped trying. I don't want to assign any stars to this book because that would be unfair. It's not the author's fault that I'm just not there. I'll never ""get"" math, but that's OK. I appreciate what it does for me, just not how it works. Now back to my poetry books."

Humble Pi (love both the title and the cover design) talks about mathematical errors that happen or happened in the past. From MS Excel being too smart for its own good to programmers taking intended or unintended shortcuts that cause everything from annoyance to death, this book covers most of it.Unlike Things to Make and Do in the Fourth Dimension, Matt's other book, this one will not make your head hurt and brain seep out of your skull through your ears if you read it too quickly - in that sense it's a very ""popular"" popular book. This might actually be a reason of my less-than-perfect score - once you've seen the abyss of the fun maths from the Fourth Dimension, reading about a mild annoyance of excel changing your enzyme names into dates is fun but the excitement is somewhat diminished. Maybe like ending a heroin bender with a glass of nice whisky - fun but somehwat of a different scale.This however also means that Humble Pi is a much easier book to recommend to your friends and relatives and stand a decent chance they'll enjoy it as well."

What if the reason the shuttle crashed was not narrowly due to brittle o-rings but because the estimates of reliability themselves were fundamentally flawed? Parker takes the reader on a fun tour of our societal reliance on robust arithmetic (""maths"" in his quaintly Queen's own rendition) and the degree to which our 'maths' are riddled with error. Although his search for humor tends toward trying too hard the work really doesn't suffer from his playful pondering through applied math and statistics. Simply a fun, informative book. That said, in the same genre and slightly more artfully executed, two books by John Allen Paulos might offer a more enjoyable beginning. Both ""Innumeracy"" and ""A Mathematician Reads the Newspaper"" are benchmark offerings."

It is fascinating and very funny in places.Matt Parker is both a mathematician and a comedian, both of which show strongly here. He gives us a book crammed with extremely interesting examples of the importance of maths in our world and of what can go wrong when the maths isn’t done right. These extend from bridge disasters and medical tragedies to glitches in computer games, financial fiddles and so on. It sounds like the sort of book where I’d normally expect to read a couple of chapters, take a break and come back to it, but it is so interesting and so entertaining that I read the whole thing from start to finish with great pleasure. Parker writes with flair and real wit, with the odd laugh-out-loud one-liner, too. I found it an absolute joy and even if you’re not very interested in maths, I can recommend this very warmly indeed.(My thanks to Penguin Books for an ARC via NetGalley.)"

Sometimes funny, sometimes deadly, sometimes just strange, Parker shows how so much of the background of our computer programs, medical equipment, bridges, and work revolve around math, even if we don't realize it."
27,0241360196,http://goodreads.com/user/show/22356256-kyle,5,"This is a fun read. Parker does a good job of maintaining a humorous story while also giving the mistakes the seriousness they are due. The book is also not overly technical. It has math in it, but I don't think any of it should serve as a deterrent to anyone with some curiosity and basic mathematical skills. If you do not like a light-hearted style, then this will not be a book for you. I rather like a humorous style, and so I found it to be hard to put down. I also like learning how the mistakes were (or likely were) made, and what we can learn from them.There are some of the well-known stories in here, such as the Mars Climate Orbiter crash, but a lot more of them were entirely new to me. Also, the cases are (or from all my checks, seem to be) well researched. The mistakes made are usually multi-faceted, and so the simplest tale and story usually hides the real details. Parker explains the entirety of the mistake extremely well. I was especially impressed (as a physicist) with his coverage of the Tacoma Narrows bridge accident. Having heard about this case as a resonance frequency of wind gusts multiple times (and having looked up the real story and learning it was not simply a resonant frequency with wind gusts), I appreciate Parker getting the details right and explaining what really happened well."
28,0241360196,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1717479-terry,4,"Matt Parker takes a tour of cases where mathematical errors led to some consequence. There isn't much a central conceit except to do the math, have other people check it, and find a way to do some sort of sniff test if possible. Some of the cases are hilarious and others tragic and the author does a good job of avoiding every chapter being another catastrophe. The author is also generally self-effacing which is nice.Enjoyable for any fan of recreation mathematics."
29,0241360196,http://goodreads.com/user/show/12355114-sarah,4,"Why I read the Book:  I watch Matt Parker’s YouTube channel, and he plugged the American version of his book.Format:  Kindle, borrowed from the library.Synopsis:  Matt explores the consequences of math gone wrong, points out where the math went wrong, and explains the correct (or in some cases a better) solution. Humble Pi contains an assortment of humorous, expensive, and sometimes fatal math conundrums. The topics range from architecture, telling time, aeronautics, video games, aviation, computer coding, and more!What I Thought: Confession: Math was my worst subject in school. I second guess my math skills nearly every time I use them for important things.Weird thing: despite my math struggles, I am able to loosely grasp the concepts involved in what I think of as higher math, and find them fascinating.I started watching Matt Parker’s YouTube channel because he explains math in a way that I can (mostly) follow and understand. Additionally, he makes it interesting. Matt writes the way he talks; it was almost like reading his YouTube channel, instead of watching and listening to it. I got a bit lost in the stock market chapter, but everything else made sense to me. Humble Pi could have been a 5 star book for me. Unfortunately, Matt decided to throw in a few sociopolitical jabs, and evolutionary references. (Creationist here!) While I understand that the latter can be unavoidable since evolution is taught as fact these days, the former really seemed unnecessary to me. My only other complaint is entirely preference based - I was a bit annoyed that all the ‘*’ references were in the back of the book. I prefer them at the bottom of the page, or at the end of the chapter. After finishing the book, I did accidentally discover that they are tap-able and the Kindle will jump between the explanation and the page the ‘*’ is on.The Bottom Line: If political jabs and an evolutionary worldview don’t bother you, and math causing weird problems interests you, you should read this book! If it weren’t for the aforementioned things, I would probably purchase a copy of this book. While I wasn’t offended by them, they really seemed unnecessary, and possibly even there for the shock value, which I did not appreciate. "
30,0241360196,http://goodreads.com/user/show/89824648-harold,3,"I really wanted to like Humble Pi, but at the end of the day, it just didn't clicked with me.A comedy of maths errors, like the author says, it's not a real comedy. It's a compilation of many disasters, accidents, and errors that through the years have been of public knowledge, but not necessarily analysed as a math error, or how deep the error goes.Math Parker does a great job explaining every piece of mathematics, programming, and several other topics so the reader has a broad understanding of how everything is supposed to work and subsequently what went wrong.At the end of the day this compilation ended up being a bit tedious and in moments I just asked myself: ""Do I need to know all this? I don't really care about this"". Don't get me wrong, I'm a math nerd just like anyone interested in reading this book, but maybe the knowing of the basics and many of the stories depicted in this book didn't help for my engagement to the book."
31,0241360196,http://goodreads.com/user/show/77279852-will,4,"A fun, easy-to-read book about maths in everyday life and some mistakes that come with it.It's full of fun stuff that makes for great small anecdotes. I'd often be reading this and then turn to someone next to me and say 'did you know...'.A couple of my favourites:1. The search for a woman in Germany whose DNA was found at 40 crimespots, including 6 murders. She had a 300,000 euro bounty on her head. Turns out, she worked in a factory where they make cotton swabs, used for DNA testing.2. The signs for football stadiums in the UK, which are footballs made up entirely of white & black hexagons. They actually have black pentagons and white hexagons. It's impossible to make a hexagon-only sphere. The damned DfT rejected his campaign to correct these.3. The common use of 3 cogs as a symbol of something working together. As seen with promotion of NAFTA, with one cog each for the US, Mexico and Canada. Cogs don't actually function with an odd number of cogs all in contact with each other. So this symbol of collaboration was actually one of gridlock (lol).There are loads more, it's a great read. The author's enthusiasm really shines through, as does his humour (check out his youtube videos if you want a taster).4.1 / 5"
32,0241360196,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3093693-angie-boyter,5,"My husband is SO glad I have finished this book! Ever since I started it I have been interrupting his own occupations with my laughter and my ""oh, wow""'s and my ""Oh, no""'s. I really laughed at the trouble the poor BBC got into when they tried to express a temperature rise in both Farenheit and Celsius. Ultimately they just gave up and left it solely in Celsius! Unfortunately, not all of the mistakes are amusing---some of them have caused unnecessary deaths. The errors come from many sources, and the book talks of some of the things that can be done to prevent them but acknowledges that we can never prevent all of them. Humble Pi is an excellent reminder how things can go wrong in math, engineering, medicine, computer programming, and other analytic fields, but Parker also reminds us of all the math that works faultlessly around us"

I had a feeling that too many stories were recycled from well known and popular sources - especially in the 1st half of the book. It felt like the author is going for the (very) low hanging fruit. Fortunately, the 2nd half compensated for that."
34,0241360196,http://goodreads.com/user/show/55031185-lauren,4,"Pretty informative and covers a large range of topics. Lots of gripping math error related stories, and Parker was funny throughout. Only problems I had with it weren't particularly big.The main problems I had were that I had some trouble understanding a few sections (mostly with the stock related stories) and that the section about random numbers didn't have a lot of new info for me (I do have a computer science degree to be fair, and some of that info is taught in class). I think some sections may be confusing to a layperson, especially if math scares you, but overall I think Parker does a very good job explaining his points while keeping it entertaining."

It taught me tons of random but fascinating things about math and I was entertained all the while. Well, almost all the while: A few chapters went over my head, like the one about probability and the other one about the stock market — however even that had it's benefits because I was so confused I ended up researching the stock market elsewhere and learning at least the basics of how it works. Other chapters deal with coding, geometry, statistics, and so forth. I'd highly recommend this book for anyone who loves math even if, like me, you aren't a math genius by any means."

The author also interviewed Emily Blank, who had to call every law school she applied to so she could tell them she was a real person, and a guy with the last name of Sample who got a new job and brought in a cake with his face and name in it, just so his coworkers understood he was an actual person."

I'm over here like Disaster Chloe, simply enjoying watching the calendar fail, the bridge closed, the buildings toast pigeons with its glare, employees gets erased from the HRIS, you know, the fun part. Throughout the entire reading journey, I wish the explanation can be visual. I imaging Parker running around like a mad scientist with all sort of apparatus, explaining how things go wrong with inappropriate amount of excitement. Thanks to YouTube, wish granted! I saw couple lectures and speaking events Matt Parker put on to promote the book and oh man, I wish Parker was my math teacher. He is enthusiastic and HILARIOUS, such an entertainer. I would've totally went with STEM instead of the liberal arts path. I would recommend watching Parker live before reading the book, he really makes math exciting!

I'd often be reading this and then turn to someone next to me and say 'did you know...'.A couple of my favourites:1. The search for a woman in Germany whose DNA was found at 40 crimespots, including 6 murders. She had a 300,000 euro bounty on her head. Turns out, she worked in a factory where they make cotton swabs, used for DNA testing.2. The signs for football stadiums in the UK, which are footballs made up entirely of white & black hexagons. They actually have black pentagons and white hexagons. It's impossible to make a hexagon-only sphere. The damned DfT rejected his campaign to correct these.3. The common use of 3 cogs as a symbol of something working together. As seen with promotion of NAFTA, with one cog each for the US, Mexico and Canada. Cogs don't actually function with an odd number of cogs all in contact with each other. So this symbol of collaboration was actually one of gridlock (lol).There are loads more, it's a great read.

I'd often be reading this and then turn to someone next to me and say 'did you know...'.A couple of my favourites:1. The search for a woman in Germany whose DNA was found at 40 crimespots, including 6 murders. She had a 300,000 euro bounty on her head. Turns out, she worked in a factory where they make cotton swabs, used for DNA testing.2. The signs for football stadiums in the UK, which are footballs made up entirely of white & black hexagons. They actually have black pentagons and white hexagons. It's impossible to make a hexagon-only sphere. The damned DfT rejected his campaign to correct these.3. The common use of 3 cogs as a symbol of something working together. As seen with promotion of NAFTA, with one cog each for the US, Mexico and Canada. Cogs don't actually function with an odd number of cogs all in contact with each other. So this symbol of collaboration was actually one of gridlock (lol).There are loads more, it's a great read.

The search for a woman in Germany whose DNA was found at 40 crimespots, including 6 murders. She had a 300,000 euro bounty on her head. Turns out, she worked in a factory where they make cotton swabs, used for DNA testing.2. The signs for football stadiums in the UK, which are footballs made up entirely of white & black hexagons. They actually have black pentagons and white hexagons. It's impossible to make a hexagon-only sphere. The damned DfT rejected his campaign to correct these.3. The common use of 3 cogs as a symbol of something working together. As seen with promotion of NAFTA, with one cog each for the US, Mexico and Canada. Cogs don't actually function with an odd number of cogs all in contact with each other. So this symbol of collaboration was actually one of gridlock (lol).There are loads more, it's a great read.

Parker knows his stuff and has researched comprehensively. The result is a good-humoured and remarkably accessible book that informs and entertains while campaigning for better understanding.

The writing style was engaging, not dry in the least for a book focused on math, and the tone focused on the fact that everybody makes mistakes (but also we should be more careful) rather than condemning anyone. Reading this overall was pure fun and joy for me. The chapter on spreadsheets tickled me so much that I had to take pictures of the text to send to coworkers."
284,0241360196,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7102822-mykhailo-kozik,5,"This book is a collection of real-life stories (maybe with some fictional details to make them sound more interesting) about math, and casualties, which may be caused by math errors.Broken bridges, overdosed patients, missed missiles, crashed satellites and day-to-day misconceptions are beautifully explained by author, with a good amount of jokes.Recommend to read."
285,0241360196,http://goodreads.com/user/show/936861-megs,5,"This is a fantastic book. I laughed or snorted throughout and learned a lot about both maths and when maths go wrong. Please note: read this book in the paper form. The footnotes and images are priceless and key to the flow of the story. I've heard it's also available in audiobook form, but my suggestion is stick to the old school print on paper. Also, if you are born circa 1980 (as the author was) you will especially appreciate some of the references to the olden days of the internet. "
286,0241360196,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1509023-austin,5,"A very fun and interesting read, especially if you like math, engineering, and/or coding. What elevated it from just a 4-star fun read to a 5-star great read was the real insight about why mistakes happen and how we can learn from them, as well as thoughts on how to prevent them (and why that's a complicated task too). Also, the author is quite funny (in a slightly corny/punny way, aka right up my alley)."
287,0241360196,http://goodreads.com/user/show/60830593-ilia,3,"It is an easy read which is quite hilarious. Despite the author is sometimes being too shallow on particular topics, I learned some new interesting facts and I can now definitely talk about bridges of all sorts."

289,0241360196,http://goodreads.com/user/show/15755662-philip-bergander,5,"Matt’s hilarious, and listening to him reading the book was a blast. He’s half laughing at his own jokes all the time which is great. "

293,0241360196,http://goodreads.com/user/show/115288884-arifah,5,Now I know why my math teacher can't tolerate a bit mistake. I hope I will never screw this world with my calculation. 😆
294,0241360196,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1006288-donna,4,"I never thought I would use ""clever, ""funny"" or ""entertaining"" to describe a book about math, but this book is all three (maybe because it is a book about math mistakes). Well worth the time."

297,0241360196,http://goodreads.com/user/show/42929186-kes,3,"Good for someone new to maths storiesThis is a definitely a good book if you haven't heard it all before. As someone who is a programmer and interested in maths and science, I've heard a lot of these stories before. Plus Matt has made videos on many of these things which I've previously watched. An enjoyable evening read however."

299,0241360196,http://goodreads.com/user/show/82473630-clarissa,3,"Not my favorite ""pop math"" book and there was a lot more on engineering than I expected, but overall still fun."
