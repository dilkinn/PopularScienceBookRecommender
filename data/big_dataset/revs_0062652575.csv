 Before the imprecision of the natural world, all will falter, none shall survive—no matter how precise.
But we will certainly give it our best shot. “Where did we come from?” is not only a religious question. It is also question of history. Simon Winchester is always a most welcome Virgil escorting us through the circles of historical knowledge, illuminating the unknown, or only slightly suspected, with the light of his explorer’s torch. We have trailed him on some of his many prior journeys. In Pacific, Atlantic, and Krakatoa, he looked at geographic places, some of the important events that have occurred there and how those events have affected the world. The Man Who Loved China may have focused on an individual, but its content had to do, again, with a place and how events that occurred there resonated forward. The Map That Changed the World and The Professor and the Madman concern themselves with particular steps in the growth of human knowledge. While having place as a factor, geographic place was not, per se, a focus. The Map concerned an inspiration to the understanding of Geology and The Professor and the Madman concerned the creation of the Oxford English Dictionary. The Perfectionists falls into this latter camp. Winchester looks at a select group of advances in the art of precision over the last several centuries, and shows how those advances impacted the world of their time, and helped create the one we live in now. It is a cornucopia of interesting historical and scientific detail and insight. One might say that The Perfectionists is comprised of diverse parts that have been finely milled to work perfectly together. I wouldn’t, but one might.Simon Winchester - image from The Berkshire EagleIt is not surprising that Winchester tilts toward things mechanical. His father was an engineer, who inspired his son with his love for the beauty of well-made things. More specifically, he was encouraged in pursuing the particular notion of this book by a fan who urged him to write about a subject that was hidden in plain sight, but was a cornerstone of civilization, precision, and so he did.The first Royce (before Rolls) – 1904 - image from Rolls Royce Enthusiasts ClubWinchester takes on a handful of specific tech/product areas, and examines where particular levels of advancement in precision have re-made them. These include clocks, the steam engine, machine tools, weapons (specifically cannons and rifles), automobiles, jet engines, lenses, GPS, locks and maybe most importantly, metrics themselves. Each trip down memory lane is fascinating and revelatory in its own way. There is a theme here that while precision is wonderful in hand-crafted products, it is the easy replicability of that precision that has allowed boutique technical upgrades to become world-spanning and revolutionary. The author allows for some sidetrips here and there to events and objects that were more narrowly focused.Henry Royce and Charles Rolls - image from AutomotiveHistory.comBut the title of the book is The Perfectionists not The Perfections. For each technological breakthrough Winchester examines, there is a person responsible for the work, some one individual who persisted, despite discouragement that often lasted for many years, holding to his core vision until reaching the Voila! of success. Of course, there were a few who seemed to come by their triumphs much more easily. We grudgingly recognize them with a fine, whatever. And, of course, others whose inspiration proved beneficial to mankind, but for which they received little or no reward. The strong personalities of the men described here shine through, for good or ill. Not all of them would make for pleasant company. A household-name inventor is revealed as a notorious con man. This cheerful sort is John Wilkinson - inventor of a boring machine (not that sort of boring) that is considered the first machine tool (or would that be Megatron?)There are core questions that underlie all our technology, queries we do not think about at all. But that is because someone, or many someones, thought of them long ago, and sought answers. For example, keeping proper time is at the core of pretty much everything. Even operations that focus on other physical measurements have time as part of the equation. How do we measure time? How long is a second, and who gets to decide? How can you know your timepiece is accurate, and what is the significance of that to determining where you are, during, say, the 18th century? How long is a meter? How was that core metric arrived at? What was measured, and what arbitrary decisions went into establishing what a meter is based on? What is the significance of flatness on industrial production? What is the importance of tolerance in manufacturing? How did the first notion of a GPS system come about? Sir Joseph Whitworth designed a method for manufacturing rifles to one-millionth of an inch accuracy. The Whitworth Rifle is considered the first sniper rifle. - image from ArtUK.orgThere is a fascinating chapter that compares and contrasts two Henrys, Ford and Royce, and follows their similar early lives, and subsequent diversion of approach to making the best automobiles they could. Winchester also looks at the development of the world’s most accurate lenses, (including those in orbit) and how their diverse limitations (and sometimes significant flaws) were addressed. He offers a chapter on the tools used for making modern computer chips. Another begins with the explosion, in flight, of a jet engine, and proceeds to look at not only the history of the jet engine, but how it is constructed, and how this one literally flew to pieces. And there are some lesser items as well, like an explanation for why New England rifles tended to be longer than rifles from elsewhere, and how Royce got Rolled, and what The Dark Side refers to in the development of technology. (No, Luke, not that.) Frank Whittle, an English pilot and engineer, patented a design for a turbojet engine in 1930 – image from WikipediaWinchester has a droll sense of humor, which is applied sparingly, but sometimes to great effect. In one instance, he describes a place being used for the testing of experimental jet engines
[the engine] was taken by truck to the Gloster test airfield near the Cotswold village of Brockworth, a town better known today for its annual midsummer cheese-rolling contest, when drunken locals try to pursue a huge round cheese as it is set thundering down a local hill.
I will now always associate jet engines with inebriated English townies chasing giant wheels of cheese over hill and dale. The chapter also includes a wonderfully dry report, by one of the principals, of staff involved in an experiment desperately fleeing for their lives as the engine in question, it is clear, is about to explode. ROFL material, well, for me, anyway. Roger Lee Easton (third from left) with astronauts Eugene Cernan, Ken Mattingly, Ronald Evans, Robert Crippen and Joseph Kerwin at the Naval Research Laboratory in 1975) is generally credited as the inventor of what is now called the GPS system – image from CollectSpace.comHe looks at the ever-increasing demands for precision in our increasingly high-tech tools, and what that means for actual human production of things. Luddites are mentioned, of course, as players in the Industrial Revolution. With the increasing automation of production, can the externalization of human labor that it entails generate another such movement?Gripes are few here. Mainly, I wished that there were more and better illustrations of the technical designs Winchester writes about. And occasionally there are passages that seemed a bit too geared for technical minds.
The tools held on the slide rest can then be moved across the path of travel dictated by the leadscrew, thereby allowing the tools to make holes in the workpiece, or to chamfer it or (in due course, once milling had been invented, a process of related in the next chapter) mill it or otherwise shape it to the degree that the lathe operator demands.
 Ummmm…huh? Really, there are very few of these. Kintaro Hattori - the founder of Seiko revolutionized timekeeping with the introduction of the quartz watchYou will learn all sorts of things in The Perfectionists, and you will gain a much greater understanding of how the industrial revolution began, and advanced, an appreciation for some of the core concepts of manufacturing at a large scale, and a sense of wonder at how some of the magic that passes for science today actually works. You will also get to know some names that should be common knowledge, but have faded from familiarity with time. I am not sure that The Perfectionists will be snapped up by a broad readership. But for any with an interest in engineering, in the history of industrial and scientific advancement, and in the history of technology, it is nothing less than mother’s milk.

1,0062652575,http://goodreads.com/user/show/929238-hbalikov,5,"Simon Winchester and I usually make a good pair. I like his topics and his narrative style. Truth be told, if I had real writer’s talent, I would love to have the freedom to roam the world writing about the fascinating things that our world contains and that people do. To that extent, I envy the author.Here, Winchester is discussing a matter dear to his heart, “how precision engineers created the modern world.” This is so because Winchester’s own father was one of this group.Words that are key to this book include “accuracy,” “precision,” and “tolerance.” In fact, a discussion of these terms precedes Winchester’s panorama of devices, which he puts in order of tolerance.I found that his joy and fascination drove this book, much to my delight. Each device and its significance was a teachable moment and I was an apt student.From the canon to the steam engine to Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory the stories behind the devices were eye-opening and entertaining.Winchester does a fine job of placing the engineering feats within a historical context. He doesn’t ignore the effects on culture and society, including the workers displaced by machines. In fact, he questions whether our ability to create precise devices demands manufacturing and inspection techniques that are beyond human skills.Finally, I learned about “flatness.” It is one of the most important concepts and I will leave it to you to discover why.PS: In finishing Winchester's book, one thought has been coalescing in my mind. If or when a massive catastrophic event affects our species, it is likely that all the centuries of work chronicled in this book will be lost or, at least, humankind will be stuck with many precision devices but not the people or the tools or the science to keep them working. To what level will we fall back?"
2,0062652575,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4728718-algernon-darth-anyan,3," The aim of science is not to open the door to infinite wisdom, but to set a limit to infinite error. Fine quotation from Bertold Brecht to set the mood for a popular science tome. I really came with high hopes to this history of precision work, but I walked out with (mostly) empty hands. I would have been more informed on the subject by browsing wikipedia for a couple of hours than by reading this rambling and often off-topic attempt by Simon Winchester. This is my first read from his output, but I have often heard his name referenced as one of the very best researchers and narrators on a given theme. That might be so, on history or geography or something else, but for me he is clueless about engineering. Winchester actually blew it right from the prologue, with his attempt to tell a personal story about his father bringing home a box of gauge blocks from his office and doing a kind of magic trick of metal bonding. All fine and dandy, except for the fact that gauge blocks are finely machined on two sides, and not on six, and they should be handled with cotton gloves and not touch skin directly, as even transpiration can lead to corrosion, measuring errors and eventually ruin of a very expensive equipment. It’s not a toy for children. I happen to know this, and a lot more on the subject, as I worked for more than two decades in the field of precision mechanical repairs and metrology, with the last three years as a trainer in industrial skills both in the metric and in the imperial system. And, frankly, I could not use this book in the classroom in any capacity, except for amusing trivia related to the history of the progress of technology.Even this history smells fishy in the account by Winchester, who seems to go to great lengths to rewrite it in favour of British and American entrepreneurs, dismissing previous concepts and implementations from other countries in footnotes or brief paragraphs that grudgingly mentions some French or German or Russian inventor. I had numerous examples bookmarked, but one of the most egregious is Pierre Vernier, a staple of every serious mechanical workshop who barely merits two lines in a seven hundred pages book on precision. By far the most annoying aspect of the book is the pay-to-play scheme where the author’s sponsors (Rolls-Royce, Ford, Boeing, Microsoft, Leica, Seiko, etc) get dozens of pages of unrelated history of the company and of its products, while the actual precision aspect discussed in the chapter is once again dismissed in a couple of barely stitched together paragraphs. For example, the chapter on car engines discusses everything related to Rolls-Royce and Ford and production-line increase in productivity, while giving the impression that all parts need to be manufactured to the same high standards of precision. In fact, only three or four components in that engine are very high tolerance. To make all of them with the same precision would drive the price up to exorbitant values. Not to mention the fact that key concepts like tolerance and traceability are introduced abruptly and used indiscriminately in places where they don’t apply.In any case, each chapter starts with good intentions of introducing progressively more precise measurements, not only of length or shape, but also of time, weight, optics (probably my favorite in the book). Very soon though, the authors returns to his penchant for praising the sponsors instead of discussing the key aspects of technology, dedicating almost 9 out of any 10 pages to company history and trivia, a result probably of his visits to said centers of industry where he found these historical aspects more interesting than the engineering ones. This is quite obvious in the numerous footnotes who refer not to the subject of the chapter, but to unrelated facts about the founders of these companies.I had similar notes about detours and mis-atributions in the chapter on jet propulsion where no mention is made of one of the pioneers in the field, a Romanian named Henri Coanda, or of the German efforts predating those of Frank Wittle, lionized here by Winchester. The actual relevant precision information (numeric control centers) is again resumed to only a couple of pages out of 50 filled with irrelevant trivia. I would have been extremely interested to read more about electrical discharge machining (EDM) used to obtain high precision jet engine parts, but they are only named in passing.The structure of the chapters if forced to comply with an artificial scale of increased precision, which leads to some curious decisions of, for example discussing jet engine failure and the importance of blades with less than a thousandth of a millimeter tolerance, when the actual error was a half-millimeter off-center hole in a pipeline. Once again, the author fails to visualize the difference in tolerance between various parts of an engine. Not all of them could be designed to the same high standards.Later chapters, discussing optics and electronics instead of mechanical workshops are a bit more tolerable, although still filled with off-topic trivia or improbable anecdotes like the one about enhancing a magazine photo to impossible levels of detail, given the normal resolution of an industrial printer (I am also a photographer, not only a mechanical engineer). Probably the author wanted something similar to the movie Blow-Up and made up a story to match. Nevertheless, the chapter of lenses for astronomy and its related interference pattern measurement units was probably the best in the present book. Actually, we have used interference patterns for the most precise surfaces in mechanical seals for refinery in one of my previous jobs.The chapter on GPS and atomic clocks also had a lot of potential, but unfortunately the discussion is focused on military trivia and GPS history instead of explaining how atomic clocks are built. The chapter about miniaturization of transistors and the machines used for it is also interesting, with the usual filler pages and sponsored company references.On the plus side, in the conclusion there are some good observations about the need to preserve artisan traditions in an industrial world dominated by automation. On the minus side, the end chapter on the International System of Units is still trying to prove the English and not the French invented the system. Oh, well! For somebody who works in the field of precision this book is a waste of time. For general information purposes, it has its merits. I might read some other books by Winchester in the future, probably the one about the Atlantic, provided he doesn’t try to explain technology to me."
3,0062652575,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8101737-peter-tillman,4,"Another polished performance by the old pro. If you like stories of heroic engineers (and some not so heroic), and how our technical civilization has developed since the early Days of Steam, you will have fun with this. He has something fresh to say about even topics I know pretty well, and I learned a lot about the early days of satellite navigation, and how the Age of Silicon is likely to reach its limits soon. It's a pretty quick and easy read; he lost me only with a superfluous trip to Japan (Seiko watches) and one on weights and measures. These are the last two chapters, so easy to skim over. Very good book: 4 stars or better.I saw Mr. Winchester give a book talk at Kepler's in Palo Alto. A couple of snippets from the talk: he said the book was sparked by a letter from a stranger in Florida, a scientific glass-blower -- and he showed off a glass piece the man had sent him as a thank-you: a little Klein bottle. I was one of the few in the (full house) audience who knew what it was (show of hands), and he mentioned that hardly anyone in his Houston talk recognized it. Which is amusing, since that's where I first saw a Klein bottle, long long ago, when I was in school at Rice, in Houston.He pulled out his new iphone and told us that its Apple-designed chipset has 8 billion[!] transistors, and that someone at Intel said that there are now more transistors in electronics than all the leaves on all the world's trees. Something like 15 quintillion of them!"
4,0062652575,http://goodreads.com/user/show/46667560-robert-irish,2,"I should probably give this a rating of 3, but ...There is ample historical research that makes this book. Winchester can weave a narrative and a story out of the various pieces of his story and kind of hold them together. Specific stories are excellent. However, the book could have been about 30% shorter. Winchester becomes tedious with his over-interest in too much detail. Also, he is quite tedious in his personal insertions into the story--I don't care that he collected stamps and had a magnifying glass to do it. The story of the Hubble telescope and its failing and reclaim was excellent, perhaps the highlight of the book. The ""Afterword"" on 'metrology' was perhaps the low point in its tediousness. "
5,0062652575,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11951948-paul,5,"Engineers are probably some of the least appreciated people in the UK and yet if you think about it everything is dependent on them. If there were no engineers you would not have items like your phone, your car, bicycles, kitchen gadgets, computers, electricity and even the very infrastructure that means that you can live life in the modern way. Things are much better built now too, compared to even twenty years ago, that extra precision we have got makes for better quality products. But, what is the difference is between accuracy and precision? And how is that making a difference in our modern world.Beginning with the machines that started the industrial revolution off, steam engines and the rapid improvements that were made in the tolerance and efficiency of them, to the world's first unpickable lock, and the precision engineering from horologists that made clocks and timepieces more accurate, and people much later than ever before. All of these incremental advances made the things that people were buying a better each time and coupled with new inventions by the likes of  John `Iron-Mad' Wilkinson and Joseph Whitworth made making things so much easier and made repeatable manufacture possible.His stories of the way that engineers have made the modern world moves from the open road, where we learn how the Ford Model T was more precisely made than a Rolls-Royce. Each Rolls-Royce was handcrafted and when the men assembling it came across the odd part that didn't fit they would file and adjust to ensure that it did. Ford did not have the luxury of time to make things fit, each part had to fit, first time, every time. Cars are easy though, compared to aeroplanes, just to get several hundred tonnes of plane, passengers and luggage and off the ground requires another level of engineering expertise. Form the earliest planes that were held together with rivets, modern aircraft are glued together and the jet engines that can lift the great weights into the sky are some of the most powerful machines ever made. The finest engineers have developed turbine blades that can operate in an environment that is actually hotter than the melting temperature of the single crystal titanium alloy that they are made from. Each blade produces more power that an F1 car and they are spinning at around 10,000 rpm. They are reliable too, only very rarely does one of these engines fail, and he describes a flight that had to undertake an emergency landing when one component that was a fraction of a millimetre out self-destructed.Silicone is immensely important to the modern world. Not only has it been used to fill the gaps in the wall so we can see through them, but its use in lenses have opened up miniature worlds and the wonders of the solar system to us. You are probably carrying around a lot of silicone too; its use in electronics has revolutionised the modern world and the machines that are used to make these ubiquitous microchips that are found in almost everything from coffee machines to watches that can tell you exactly where you are on the planet. These work from the GPS system, a technology that relies on the accurate time as measured using caesium clocks. It is time too that defines our most common measurements like the metre and the kilogramme and rendering the finely made platinum standard items a relic of the museum.I may have a slight bias in reading and reviewing this as I am an engineer who is qualified in both electronics and mechanical engineering and I have designed things as varied as defence equipment to lighting to speaker cables. I thought that this was a really well-written book about the engineers that have made modern society what it is nowadays. It is well researched and full of interesting and anecdotal tales such as how we can now measure light years to within the width of a human hair that add so much to the story of precision over the years.  I liked the way at the beginning of each chapter the tolerance increases for each change in technology and the precision required to achieve the next level up. Excellent book and can highly recommend."
6,0062652575,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9898018-jonathan,3,"Despite the excellent premise and all the fascinating stories, which I enjoyed very much, I can't help feeling a little disappointed with this book. Winchester cranks out his books in a way that feels a bit rushed to me. The Man Who Loved China and The Map that Changed the World both spent a lot of time saying how wonderful/ incredible/revolutionary the respective subjects of the books were but little time explaining WHY, perhaps because that would have taken a lot more work. I get the feeling that I could have found a lot of this out by spending the same amount of time reading wikipedia and other articles although Winchester is obviously a pretty good story teller."
7,0062652575,http://goodreads.com/user/show/18168312-aaron-calkins,2,"This book started off great, but I oddly found it later to be rather rambling. After the first few chapters, the author seem to be unable to decide whether he wanted the book to be a first hand account of his own experiences or a brief overview of important events and people in science and engineering. I found the last two-thirds of the book to be very hit or miss."
8,0062652575,http://goodreads.com/user/show/80316998-howard,5,5 Stars for The Perfectionists: How Precision Engineers Created The Modern World (audiobook) by Simon Winchester read by the author. This is a must read for anybody that’s interested in engineering. Simon Winchester does an amazing job bringing this topic to life. I also really enjoy his narration.
9,0062652575,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4828849-michael-burnam-fink,5,"The popular image of the industrial revolution is of titanic forces unleashed by steam, of dark satanic mills and choking clouds of smog. But the machines did not spring into being, fully formed. Behind our modern age lies an obsession with precision, with exactitude in measurement and cutting that a medieval master craftsman would find extremely odd, and which we find extremely normal. Winchester chronicles 250 years of precision engineering, starting with John ""Iron-Mad"" Wilkinson, a cannon manufacturer who armed the fleets that won Britain 100 years of empire, and who's technology, adopted in partnership with James Watt, created the first useful steam engine. Wilkinson's bores erred by no more than 1/10th of an inch, and in a few generations this would seem to be incredibly imprecise, as various engineers chased ever finer exactitude in manufacturing and measurement in the service of more reliable machines, economies of mass production, and eventually the atomic level precision of computer chips, GPS satellites, and LIGO, the gravity wave detecting observatory.Winchester blends a love of precision equipment, such as Rolls-Royce cars, his father's Jo blocks, mechanical watches, and Leica camera lenses, with an a charming professionalism as a writer, leaping through centuries, biographical sketches, and ever finer tolerances. This is as good as popular history of technology gets!"
10,0062652575,http://goodreads.com/user/show/974210-erik-graff,3,"Dad was an electrical engineer with the heating and controls division of Honeywell. He'd wired the cottage in Michigan himself, done his own car maintenance and repairs and helped others with theirs, maintained a shop of sorts in our basement, building bicycles from parts found in the alley and just generally tinkering as a means of relaxation. If he didn't know how to fix something, he'd get a book and learn how. I was quite different, much to his chagrin. I read this history of precision engineering, in some part, with him in mind. If he were still alive it would have served as a welcome present."

13,0062652575,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1659159-edward,5,"Reading this book could turn you into a nervous wreck. When, for example, you step on a plane and consider the incredibly hot temperatures of the turbine engines, so hot that the entire plane and all of its passengers would melt down into a molten puddle, were it not for thousands of tiny cooling holes in the blades. Any one of which, even infinitesimally out of sync, would mean disaster. Fortunately, we don’t think of such matters, we just take for granted that thousands of intricate parts will work perfectly together and get us where we want to go.  Winchester in this fascinating book explains how many other modern inventions that make our world what it is today work. Because of our casual familiarity, we are incurious about them, but what Winchester does is make them interesting in almost wondrous ways.  His approach is an historical one, starting with the invention of the steam engine and the advent of the Industrial revolution which shapes modern history in every conceivable way. The steam engine was successful only because of decreasing space between moving parts, what is called tolerance. Precise measurements, originally not easy to create, were necessary to fully enclose the power of steam, and keep it from escaping. From here, he goes to weaponry, clocks and timepieces, the development of the automobile, the airplane, space travel, all of which depend upon the development of micro technology. It’s also given us radio, telephones, motion pictures, television computers, cell phones, the gps, and more devices than we can even think of.  One absolutely essential key to all of these developments is to have precision measurements and the machinery and equipment to be able to replicate, exactly, the same precision in multiple copies, all of which make mass production possible. Incredibly, human error is absolutely minimized by tools which do the measuring and creation of these instruments on which we depend. Yes, accidents do occur, but they are extremely rare and are due to human actions which interfere with the technically perfect instruments of creation.  Much of the last chapters are devoted to what could be called miniaturization, tolerances that become incredibly fine, in the millionths of millionths of inches to the point of atomic structure. Is there a limit to this process? Probably, but it hasn't been reached yet, and it’s what enables, for example, our cell phones to handle ever increasing amounts of processing capability.  Are there any problems with precision engineering? Winchester writes, “Philosophically, morally, psychologically, intellectually and – dare one say it - spiritually there are troubling aspects to humankind’s ever-greater reliance on devices and techniques of ever-enhanced precision.”  About these concerns, I wish Winchester would have said more, but the problem might be that we don’t know what is going to be the downside of all of these “improvements”. A loss of intimacy, irrelevance of traditional forms of government, a paralysis in a breakdown due to war or an ecological disaster? We don’t know. All of this, though, may be outside the scope of Winchester’s marvelously descriptive book."
14,0062652575,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8530205-marty-fried,5,"This book was surprisingly good, to me. To someone who is non-technical and not interested in the technical history of precision machinery, it might be mostly boring. There is probably something here for everyone, though, such as the story of the Hubble telescope and its rescue from total failure after being launched into orbit. The story starts out with the author recounting an experience when he was young, and his father brought out a heavy oak box with a brass tag on the outside. Inside were about a hundred metal tiles of various sizes, with numeric labels. These tiles were so precisely flat that when one was placed on top of another, they could not be pulled apart, only slid apart like strong magnets. They didn't even seem to be two objects, because the line where they joined was so precise that it looked like the two tiles were fused together. The tiles are used for measuring things to very tight tolerances. Engineers, and people like me see the beauty in something like this. His mother, on the other hand, was not too happy about these oily pieces of metal on her clean tablecloth.The book goes on to tell all about things like rifles, steam engines, cannons, etc, back in the mid 19th century. Rifles were hand-made, and didn't have interchangeable parts. If a part broke, the rifle could not be used until it was returned to have a new part made for it. Cannons were made in a way that produced variations in the size of the bore, so cannon balls didn't always fit correctly. The author tells about the people who solved these problems, while explaining along the way how they worked and why problems arose. Along the way, men devised machines to help make the products, because machines could make things exactly the same every time. Craftsmen were insulted by this, but they couldn't really change it, because it was true.I learned a lot from the book, as it explained steam engines, gasoline engines, Rolls-Royces and Fords, fountain pens and watches, jet engines, rockets, the development of the Hubble telescope, all the while showing how precision got more and more exact. It explains how standards were created and improved, how measuring units went from an inch that was the size of someone's thumb up to being a standard meter that was a fraction of the distance from the north pole to the equator along a particular meridian, how even that wasn't enough because it turned out to be off by 2/10ths of a millimeter, so they came up with a new standard, which was simply “the length equal to 1,650,763.73 wavelengths in vacuum of the radiation corresponding to the transition between the levels 2p10 and 5d5 of the krypton-86 atom.” I tried to calibrate my metric ruler, but gave up pretty quickly.Even the lowly second has been calibrated using an atomic clock that's so accurate that it would neither lose nor gain a second in 138 million years. Wind it once, and you're done.After all this talk about super precision, there was a chapter on Japan, and their fondness for both precision and ancient hand-made imprecision. He included a visit to the Seiko factory which at one time had the most accurate timepieces in the world based on their quartz crystal technology. They make some very high precision watches. When the author offered to trade his special Rolex for a Seiko, they laughed and declined. Not far away is a place famous for its hand-hammered metallic teapots, etc, that are considered equally valuable to the people around there."

I enjoyed his research, prose and velvet hammer like reading during August 2018. “The Perfectionists” reels the reader in, making us think more deeply about our everyday lives, and the hardware that makes it possible. The science, the drive, the sheer sweat and toil of a few noted and countless forgotten people that have fashioned this successful society makes for an easy-to-relate-to journey.One lesson I see reinforced throughout is that the power of perfection, and only perfect precision, will achieve the stated goal. This standard is driven home with examples of mistakes, both small and mighty. Human error is a relentless weak link.This vaunted society of ours, with globe girdling technology at our fingertips, (like writing this book review on the World Wide Web) has drilled down to lots of small things. Printed inside Apple’s 2017 model A11 Bionic chip there are 4,300,000,000 transistors. I recall being excited when a birthday gift AM radio had seven.Winchester offers effective nonfiction portrayed with accurate wordsmithing."
16,0062652575,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4592109-lori-l-she-treads-softly,5,"The Perfectionists: How Precision Engineers Created the Modern World by Simon Winchester is a very highly recommended examination of the history, science, and work of precision engineers along with biographical sketches of some of the influential engineers that helped develop technology to take us from the Industrial Age to the Digital Age.The early attention to precision, accuracy, and degrees of tolerance ushered in the the Industrial Revolution, Scientific Revolution, and the Technological Revolution. What truly changed the way things were made was the creation of a machine tool - a machine to make a machine - along with standardized measurements. This allowed exact, multiple items to be made that worked identically in the machine application they were made for, thus ushering in the industrial revolution and assembly lines. All these machined parts must be potentially interchangeable one for any other. This potential for interchangeable parts requires precision in many areas: mass, density, hardness, temperature tolerance, length, height, depth, and width; measurable degrees of straightness, flatness, circularity, cylindricity, perpendicularity, symmetry, parallelism, and position - and there is even more to consider.The man who can be said to be the father of precision and the Industrial Revolution is John “Iron Mad” Wilkinson. Some of the others whose contributions are covered are: Henry Maudslay, Joseph Bramah, Jesse Ramsden, Joseph Whitworth, James Clerk Maxwell, Prince Albert, Honoré Blanc, Eli Whitney, Henry Whittle, Henry Ford, Roger Lee Easton, Kintaro Hattori, and Thomas Jefferson, who saw the potential of machine tools and brought the idea to the USA, introducing the concepts that would allow manufacturing to take off.Those who have read other nonfiction by Winchester (Krakatoa, The Map That Changed the World, The Professor and the Madman, Pacific, Atlantic, etc.) will appreciate this new educational and entertaining work that includes great stories along with scientific insight and his consistent attention to detail. As is expected, The Perfectionists is extremely well-written. Winchester takes a subject that, well, could be considered dull, and might be in lesser hands, but he makes it a compelling, engrossing subject, entertaining while giving us the history and the innovations. This is written for average people, not necessarily engineers (although engineers will appreciate it), which means even I could follow along and understand the scientific importance. The Perfectionists includes Illustrations, a Glossary, Bibliography and an Index.Disclosure: My review copy was courtesy of HarperCollins.http://www.shetreadssoftly.com/2018/0..."
17,0062652575,http://goodreads.com/user/show/388772-sharlene,4,"The topic - precision engineering - isn’t something that immediately draws me in. But having read Winchester’s books before, I know them to be well-written and thoroughly researched. And when I listened to the sample of the first pages, which he reads, I was drawn in to the story because he began with how his father used to work as an engineer in a factory and one day brought home some machined metal tiles called gauge blocks used for measuring things. And I liked how Winchester talked fondly about visiting his father in the factory and watching the machines and how Winchester started writing this book about precision. 🛠And in the end, this book was full of fascinating insights into the world of precision - from cars to guns to airplane engines. It’s not easy to make notes while listening to an audiobook and part of me wishes I had had a printed copy alongside but I quite liked that Winchester, in his sore-throaty voice, read the book himself. 🛠The Perfectionists is full of facts and insights that I had never thought to think about, all these big and small things that make our world go round, that enables me to type this sentence out on my phone, for eg. How our world has changed so much in what is just a few decades. You don’t have to love science or engineering to read or listen to this fascinating book. You just need a little bit of curiosity about how this world is as it is today."
18,0062652575,http://goodreads.com/user/show/80247437-thomas,5,"This is one of my favourite kinds of books: a history book that takes me on a fun multi-story journey through time and space. In this case, measuring them both with increasing precision as we go along. Here we learn a lot about the importance of precision while meeting a host of interesting perfectionists along the way.This is history and science in the most pleasing of mixtures. Mr. Winchester doesn’t overload us with endless facts and figures, as if he were presenting his results for peer review. Instead he educates us and entertains us so, by the end the book, we have gained a deeper understanding of the world we live in without paying any price at all in tedium. That is talent.This book is a good one."
19,0062652575,http://goodreads.com/user/show/13091714-anna,4,"Fascinating! I never really thought about a concept like precision having a history but it does and a very interesting one it is. There is a lot of science here particularly as you get to the latter end of the book and some of it went rather over my head, but I still enjoyed the journey."
20,0062652575,http://goodreads.com/user/show/44658719-james-giammona,3,"Overall, I learned a lot about many of the important figures in the history of increasing manufacturing precision. I found the early stories from the 1800 and 1900s from cannon boring to steam engines, the creation of the first precise machine tools and the construction of automobiles to be fascinating! I also liked learning more about jet engines and turbines. However, I was unsatisfied with the brevity and lack of depth that some of these topics were explored with. I was hoping for WAY more detail with many of these stories, something closer to Making of the Atomic Bomb. I realize this would make the book at least twice as long and more intimidating to pick up, but that's what I would want. Also, I thought the philosophical digressions on whether we now have too much precision or what time is to be too long and meandering and overall uninteresting. I'm much more interested in understanding the bootstrapping of increased precision. I got hints when discussing the three plate method for flatness and making high thread screws for micrometers, but I want to know how this continued.Even with the last chapter on redefining the SI units, he completely leaves out how these measurements are done and why certain constants were used as fundamental (Planck's constant) vs others (Newton's constant) because of differences in measurement precision. Overall, I thought there was too much fluffy narrative and not enough meaty explanation."
21,0062652575,http://goodreads.com/user/show/50329706-kevin,4,"I won a free advanced copy of this book through Goodreads giveaways. As someone who knows basically nothing about engineering it comes as a bit of a surprise that I enjoyed this book as much as I did. I never felt it got bogged down into too much detail of engineering itself, rather, the book shows the history of engineering, specifically, precision engineering. From humble beginnings to the quite absurd present computing technology, this books shows the growth of precision and what it has meant for various industries and companies. I found the chapter on the Hubble telescope and computer chips particularly interesting. A good read no matter what your level of engineering know-how."
22,0062652575,http://goodreads.com/user/show/67951314-phrodrick,4,"Bottom Line first: Simon Winchester’s The Perfectionists: How Precision Engineers Created the Modern World is a sometimes-exciting survey history of the people who made the machines that make our tools and technology possible. This is my fourth book by Winchester and while I now realize he has about a shelf of titles in print I can speak to all I have read as interesting titles specializing in the nooks of history and biography where many of us might not think to look. The Perfectionists is survey history and unlikely to satisfy specialists. I learned things worth knowing, and thinking about, and chapters I especially enjoyed were those that clearly fired the author.My copy is a signed first edition hard back. It was a posthumous thank you gift from a classmate who had been very nice to me and mine. I had given some books to him and via his widow this was given over to me as a common interest we could still share.The Perfectionists is the fourth title I have read by Simon Winchester. All are histories or biographies and all were good reads. This is not academic level research. There may be points where his research could have been deeper. However, for the armchair enthusiast he always delivers on unusual people and topics that I find enjoyable and mind expanding. To put this another way, I might not want to repeatedly cite him in a bibliography backing post graduate research. But he is far more readable than most of the material one might see referenced in PG research. Some time back I was reading a time travel book that had the protagonist, a modern person attempting to advise Vikings on small things they could do to improve their long boats. At some point he realizes that these people lacked the technology to make the tools to make the tools that make the things. That is the theme behind The Perfectionists. If you are going to build, for example, a steam engine, what must you build to make that steam engine into a steam locomotive? Or for the enthusiast of modern examples, what has to be in place before you can have a GPS capability in your smart phone?Among the differences between a steam engine and a steam locomotive are the clearances, that is the tolerances between the piston and the piston cylinder. What makes it possible to make a GPS system accurate down to feet or inches is the tolerances in accurately counting minute passages in time.The scales of tolerances by which we can measure space, weight and time in turn control the tools we can design to make the tools that in turn produce engines, and electronic devices. Jumping to one of my favorite chapters, all of the gee whiz engineering that make it possible to safely depend on a modern passenger jet. Some may find it unsettling to know that the temperatures in all jet engines are well above melting point for its parts. We passengers depend on tiny holes, drilled into the small to large blades that are in every jet engine. The tolerances on these holes are in the neighborhood of .000000000001 meters, or about 1 millionth of a 1millimeter (If I have my decimals right). These holes are engineered to create a relatively cool space around each blade and carry away the very high combustion temperatures needed to operate the single moving part that is a jet engine.That is a lot to absorb in one go, but Winchester gets us there. In this chapter among the people we meet is British Royal Air-force officer and engineer James Whittle who developed a workable jet engine before World War Two. That his research and working prototypes were not converted into squadrons of British fighter jets before Germany placed such jets into their battle line is a reminder of how much history depends on bureaucracy, sometime cantankerous or mild personalities and the ability of decision-makers to see what the engineer is making possible.It is not enough for an engineer to develop the ability to make the tools that will make the tool. Some one needs to be able to under stand the potential and how to convert this potential into new objects.The cautionary history that travels with this point is that charlatans a working along parallel lines. It was in my history book that the inventor of the cotton gin, the machine that kept southern slavery profitable, also invented modern industrialization by designing the jigs that turned gun making from an inefficient handmade craft into interchangeable parts that made the modern factory possible. Eli Whitney did invent the cotton gin. Never mind that Thomas Jefferson among others were taken in the rest of Whitney’s claims and demonstrations of interchangeable gun parts were a fraud. The Perfectionist could have been a recitation of only the wonderment and adulation, except that Winchester continues to notice that advancements come with costs. Many of these new machines discount the value of craftsmanship. Many converted journeymen skilled laborers into semi-skilled factory hands performing endless repetitions of mind-numbing tasks. Cheaper goods fuel consumerism with its mixed bag of results. Efficiency at the manufacturing level moves costs onto the body politic and the environment. Winchester rarely has answers to these implied questions but he raises awareness of the costs as well as the fun of the ever-newer finer gadgetry. "
23,0062652575,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1411444-ed-erwin,4,"Lots of interesting information about why precision is necessary and how it is achieved, at more and more precise levels. Many of the technologies were developed to support military applications, starting with cannons, pulley blocks for sailing ships, and moving on to guns with interchangeable parts and later GPS systems. Other topics include steam engines, locks, cars, jets, cameras, telescopes and clocks.Discussion of the Hubble telescope and a 2010 jet crash were particularly interesting.One point only barely touched on here is that while we have become very precise in making mechanical things by using other machines, our software systems are still made by humans. While they may do precisely what the humans told them to do, the humans might not be as precise as necessary in defining the task. So while that 2010 jet crashed due to a tiny mechanical defect from a human-crafted part, today's jets may be crashing due to imprecise software or human pilots.Winchester has a distinct style of writing which I like only up to a point. (But not a point that I can precisely define.) Here he is describing the guy who created ""gauge blocks"" (which were new to me): Johansson was, by all accounts, a modest, retiring, unassuming, private, pipe-smoking, mustachioed, patient, formal, stooped, eternally avuncular son of the croft.... No, I don't think that all accounts say that; only Winchester would describe anyone in that way. I had to look up avuncular and croft. Technical terms are defined in an appendix, but still I'm sure there are rare words in here that would stump just about anyone. "
24,0062652575,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1609754-amy,5,"Truly outstanding!Read by the author in his clear and authoritative English-accented voice, Winchester explains in amazingly interesting detail the progress made, using better and better measuring devices, towards more perfect engineering. Every chapter begins with a story that draws you in to the subject. The history of various aspects of manufacturing and engineering for things like block and tackle, autos, the jet engine, computers, and other scientific equipment is quite enlightening. Enjoy!"
25,0062652575,http://goodreads.com/user/show/23137241-mengyi,4,"The book exhibits a grand collection of human's pursuit of precision on various scale. I especially enjoyed reading the afterwords, and came to a surprising realisation that all units of measurements (length, mass, temperature etc.) depend on time, and perfecting the accuracy of a second is yet an example of human's relentless pursuit of precision.The book however is a big hard to read for me, with a lot of technical words and very long sentence."
26,0062652575,http://goodreads.com/user/show/81155555-adam-merrifield,5,"As a former machinist and metrologist and someone who is obsessed with precision, this book was absolutely up my alley. From the intro, where I knew exactly what his father had brought home and rung together, to the history of precision, to measurement by quantum standard, I completely geeked out on The Perfectionists. I will likely return to this book couple more times in the future."
27,0062652575,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5277674-rachel-pollock,3,I probably would have liked this more as a paper book. The author read the audiobook and his voice is so scratchy and haggard-sounding that I found it distracted me from the content. 
28,0062652575,http://goodreads.com/user/show/21126957-hind,5,This is a wonderful book that gave me a newfound appreciation for engineering. I learned a lot. I will say that this book should be read and not listened to.

30,0062652575,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5937558-lynn,2,"I received a copy of this book from Harper Collins in exchange for an honest review.Today’s Nonfiction post is on The Perfectionists: How Precision Engineers Created the Modern World by Simon Winchester. It is 416 pages long and is published by Harper Collins. The cover is blue and white with a gear on top and the universe on the bottom. The intended reader is someone who is interested in engineers and engineering. There is no foul language, no sex, and no violence in this book. There Be Spoilers Ahead.From the back of the book- The revered New York Times bestselling author traces the development of technology from the Industrial Age to the Digital Age to explore the single component crucial to advancement—precision—in a superb history that is both an homage and a warning for our future.The rise of manufacturing could not have happened without an attention to precision. At the dawn of the Industrial Revolution in eighteenth-century England, standards of measurement were established, giving way to the development of machine tools—machines that make machines. Eventually, the application of precision tools and methods resulted in the creation and mass production of items from guns and glass to mirrors, lenses, and cameras—and eventually gave way to further breakthroughs, including gene splicing, microchips, and the Hadron Collider.Simon Winchester takes us back to origins of the Industrial Age, to England where he introduces the scientific minds that helped usher in modern production: John Wilkinson, Henry Maudslay, Joseph Bramah, Jesse Ramsden, and Joseph Whitworth. It was Thomas Jefferson who later exported their discoveries to the fledgling United States, setting the nation on its course to become a manufacturing titan. Winchester moves forward through time, to today’s cutting-edge developments occurring around the world, from America to Western Europe to Asia.As he introduces the minds and methods that have changed the modern world, Winchester explores fundamental questions. Why is precision important? What are the different tools we use to measure it? Who has invented and perfected it? Has the pursuit of the ultra-precise in so many facets of human life blinded us to other things of equal value, such as an appreciation for the age-old traditions of craftsmanship, art, and high culture? Are we missing something that reflects the world as it is, rather than the world as we think we would wish it to be? And can the precise and the natural co-exist in society?Review- This is a difficult book to read. Winchester has a potentially interesting student but it is weighted down by slow pacing and almost endless details that do not add to the narrative only make the story move slower. I wanted to like this book, the topic is interesting, the history of how the world became mechanical and so may interesting characters who helped make it so. But instead we get a slow, plodding story that is very difficult to engage with. Perhaps I just do not have the right mindset to read this book but I was so bored as I read it. I cannot recommend this book.I give this book a Two out of Five stars."
31,0062652575,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3677821-pete,5,"Exactly : How Precision Engineers Created the Modern World (2018) by Simon Winchester is an insightful book that looks at just how important the gradual improvements in precision have been in creating the modern world. Winchester is a master of modern non-fiction and with precision he's picked a topic that is ideal for his writing style.Each chapter of the book has an increasing magnitude of precision starting from 0.1 and finishing with many, many more orders of magnitude. The book starts with the precision required for good steam engines, then how more precision was created to build locks, then make better screws and then how to make guns where the parts were really interchangeable that made the weapons much more reliable. Winchester then has a very clever chapter that compares the precision required for mass production of cars against methods of hand manufacturing for expensive cars. The next chapter is fantastic, looking at the incredible precision and quality control required for manufacturing jet engines. Then the book moves on to look the precision required for optics, then precision required for GPS and then a chapter on the incredible precision needed for making chips. The last numbered chapter is on the glorious precision of modern watches. Finally Winchester adds a chapter on how the SI measurements are maintained. Exactly is a really fine book. Somehow it doesn't seem quite as good as the best of some of Winchester's earlier books but it's certainly an excellent read. It may be that familiarity with his style makes his books a bit less appealing with time. But that said the book gives a really superb account of how important precision is in modern life and should make the reader appreciate even more just how incredible the world is that humans have shaped and an appreciation for the awesome skills of the engineers and scientists who have contributed to it. "
32,0062652575,http://goodreads.com/user/show/13717595-jake,5,"At first I found myself annoyed.I couldnt quite put my finger on it but something about the book irritated me. There were moments where I had thought. Ok. Time to just put this down and forget about it. And well. Clearly I didnt. And im quite happy that I made the choice to complete it. What I think irritated me in retrospect was the writing. It is not written within my exact dialect of English - Northeastern American English. Rather it has the stylistic, at times, circumlocutions, of none other than the beautiful wondrous pomp of British English. ....wellEventually I became acclimated to his style and stopped really caring. This is a wonderful book. It is a history book on engineering which is exact, and precise and how it is we went from simple tools, to clocks, cars and computers. A precisely made object is one in where detail is imposed to create a complex tool. Douglas Adams joked in his ""last chance to see"" that all tools stem from twig technology. We started with these small sticks. At first we used them to wack each other. Or wack another animal. Eventually somehow our tools moved to the level of civilizations (yea yea yea we all know jane Goodall showed humans arent the only animals to use tools)And here comes in this book. A history of how this occurred. It gave me an appreciation of the thought that went into many of our tools that seem simple.This is why I give it 5 stars.Recommended for those interested in :- how things went from simple tools to more complex- mechanical engineering Also- Everyone else"
33,0062652575,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9310118-jeimy,5,"This was an exceptional book that explains the importance of precision in technological advances.

34,0062652575,http://goodreads.com/user/show/29680088-mary-whitton,5,"Another great read from Simon Winchester. (Two other favorites are: The Professor and the Madman about the making of the OED; and The map that changed the world about the making of the first geological subsurface map showing strata of materials underground. It was based on observations of materials (in layers) in the cuts made to create the canal system covering England)I’ve seen this new book on Amazon with two titles. #1. Exactly: how precision engineers created the modern worldAnd. #2. (Without the Exactly.). How precision .....Exactly is organized in chapters on devices with increasing precision. Since precision increased as time went on, the book advanced chronologically, too. It starts with boring rifle barrels and, later, steam engine cylinders and ends discussing the changes over time in the way a second is specified. Winchester’s love of words, and probably informed by his work on OED, leads to many fine short diversions into word origins and meaning. This was one of those books that I several times wanted to select a word by poking it with my finger, a la Kindle, to learn more. Quite enjoyable. "
35,0062652575,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5608032-cedricsmom,5,"I loved this book. I listened to it during my daily commute for work and enjoyed all of it. It answered questions I had like how do we know that a measuring instrument itself is accurate? What is the greatest thing by which we can measure all others? I highly recommend this book to students, tinkerers, historians, teachers, and those who simply enjoy good storytelling. Winchester has a way of humanizing topics that would normally put most folks out cold and he makes the topics relevant and relatable. This was my first Winchester but it won’t be my last. "

38,0062652575,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5917740-nilesh,3,"The Perfectionists is a rare book about unheralded engineers, who have truly built the modern society around us. Like in the popular TV series Big Bang Theory, theoreticians like Sheldon Cooper get the limelight while directly and indirectly undermining the contributions of every Wolowitz. We often forget that the armchair thinkers genuinely struggle if they have to change even a lightbulb. Real-life innovations require different skills that have had as much impact on humanity as the ideas of their celebrated counterparts. Here is a popular book that talks about the men who changed the world without ever mentioning a Plato or an Einstein or a Darwin. While conceptually perfect, the book proves why certain topics - however important - do not make good reading for a common man. Specific laws of any nation, a handbook on the gene identification, or a detailed history of evolutions of a pin are examples of such topics. The author tries hard to infuse excitement and continuity in the tale of engineers and their creations, but mostly in vain.Timepieces to the GPS, through rifles, automobiles, and to the measurement systems, do not make a well-related, compelling history. The disconnectedness of the chapters is equally present within them. The attempts to generate interest through the incidents surrounding innovations or involving the innovators are mostly humdrum. Even more annoying are the engineering details interspersed throughout. They are the subject matter, but their laborious presentations are unlikely to inspire anyone but the most devoted. In fact, the true geeks may find plentiful misrepresentations and errors when the author gets technical, while the rest gloss over.The truth is that many theoreticians - Galileo, Einstein, Darwin, to name a few - have had lives full of narratable incidents. The barebones of their discoveries are understandable; they inspire thoughts or discussions of profound importance even in the minds of most novice amateurs. The same does not apply to the characters and their subject matters here. We should express our admiration to these less-heralded innovators for their immense contributions for sure. And pointing that is the book's most significant achievement. "
39,0062652575,http://goodreads.com/user/show/48051175-casey,5,"A great book by Simon Winchester, even better listening to the author read the audio edition. Winchester, whose wit, depth of writing, and ability to tell sidebar nuggets of information without losing the central focus ranks him ahead of his peers, does not disappoint. On the surface this is a history of mankind’s search for ever greater precision, but beyond that it can also read as a formal turnover between mankind’s Industrial and Information ages. Starting with the development of efficient steam engines and ending with the current search for atomic level precision in the drive for ever greater computing power, Winchester steps through the dynamic story of precision. He covers topics as varied as the Royal Navy’s need for efficient block-and-tackle manufacturing, the dichotomy between Rolls-Royce’s handmade precision and that of Ford’s manufactured variety, and the overly large imprecision of the Hubble Telescope’s microscopically precise mirrors. Told with Winchester’s usual detail and humor, I learned a lot about both the methods of obtaining ever greater precision and the economic pressures which forced their development. The juxtaposition between the concepts of precision and accuracy is also a strong and useful theme. Highly recommended for those wanting a good overview of measurement in industrial history. "
40,0062652575,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4332892-scottsdale-public-library,0,"I discovered this author a few years ago and he is one of my favorite authors. Mr. Winchester does his research and writes fascinating books about a wide range of subjects. I found him when my attention was captured by a title ""The Professor And The Madman"" A fabulous book about the creation of the Oxford English Dictionary. You should read it!  But more about ""The Perfectionists"". This book takes us through eleven chapters of examples of ever increasing perfection in the tools and machines that we have used to create the things around us and the inventions that we have depended on since the eighteenth century. The thing that I love about this author is that he brings all kinds of facts about all kinds of things together in his chapters and shows how they are linked to create a whole. By the time you finish this book you will have learned a wide range of information about history, living conditions, types of material, politics, inventors, innovators, and yes a few madmen with brilliant ideas and dreams. Best of all you will see how these things and a montage of other information and sources come together to make a captivating story. I highly recommend this book and author. -Thomas D."
41,0062652575,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1587323-robin,5,"Wow! I’ve just finished listening to this book read by the author in his proper British accent. I’ve read several other books of his and probably given them all 5 stars. Evoking my inner engineer, the book covers the inventors of quite a few areas and the contributions which increased precision moving toward perfection. Steam engines, weaponry, automobiles, lenses, jet engines, GPS, locks, machine tools, and clocks are brought to life through the thinkers and inventors who have brought knowledge to the present day. I’d recommend the book to anyone with an insatiable appetite for the history of engineering. "
42,0062652575,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1054712-kent-winward,4,"So many things tend to escape our attention that we miss the areas of science that have been critical to technological advancement. Precision isn't the first thing that pops into the head when you are contemplating advancement, but it has been critical as Winchester points out. My biggest regret is the lack of time he spent on the counter example of a natural lack of precision exemplified by the concept of wabi-sabi, although he raises the issue at the end. It felt imprecise to treat the idea so lightly. "
43,0062652575,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4968433-rob-saunders,5,"This is another excellent book by Simon Winchester. In The Perfectionists (2018) Winchester condenses technical and historical details into wonderfully interesting stories. The rise and increasing exactitude of precise measurement launched the Industrial Revolution and has affected virtually every technological and scientific advancement since.The blend of Winchester's journalistic acumen to distill science, history, and people into ""the rest of the story"" along with his clear and elegant writing style makes this book highly readable. Very enjoyable. Good reference. Highly recommended. "
44,0062652575,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2592514-mark,4,"As is typical of his books, Simon Winchester is much more concerned with telling good stories than offering a comprehensive view of his subject, making for an excellent read.

It is 416 pages long and is published by Harper Collins. The cover is blue and white with a gear on top and the universe on the bottom. The intended reader is someone who is interested in engineers and engineering. There is no foul language, no sex, and no violence in this book. There Be Spoilers Ahead.From the back of the book- The revered New York Times bestselling author traces the development of technology from the Industrial Age to the Digital Age to explore the single component crucial to advancement—precision—in a superb history that is both an homage and a warning for our future.The rise of manufacturing could not have happened without an attention to precision. At the dawn of the Industrial Revolution in eighteenth-century England, standards of measurement were established, giving way to the development of machine tools—machines that make machines. Eventually, the application of precision tools and methods resulted in the creation and mass production of items from guns and glass to mirrors, lenses, and cameras—and eventually gave way to further breakthroughs, including gene splicing, microchips, and the Hadron Collider.Simon Winchester takes us back to origins of the Industrial Age, to England where he introduces the scientific minds that helped usher in modern production: John Wilkinson, Henry Maudslay, Joseph Bramah, Jesse Ramsden, and Joseph Whitworth. It was Thomas Jefferson who later exported their discoveries to the fledgling United States, setting the nation on its course to become a manufacturing titan. Winchester moves forward through time, to today’s cutting-edge developments occurring around the world, from America to Western Europe to Asia.As he introduces the minds and methods that have changed the modern world, Winchester explores fundamental questions. Why is precision important? What are the different tools we use to measure it? Who has invented and perfected it? Has the pursuit of the ultra-precise in so many facets of human life blinded us to other things of equal value, such as an appreciation for the age-old traditions of craftsmanship, art, and high culture? Are we missing something that reflects the world as it is, rather than the world as we think we would wish it to be? And can the precise and the natural co-exist in society?Review- This is a difficult book to read. Winchester has a potentially interesting student but it is weighted down by slow pacing and almost endless details that do not add to the narrative only make the story move slower. I wanted to like this book, the topic is interesting, the history of how the world became mechanical and so may interesting characters who helped make it so. But instead we get a slow, plodding story that is very difficult to engage with. Perhaps I just do not have the right mindset to read this book but I was so bored as I read it. I cannot recommend this book.I give this book a Two out of Five stars."
61,0062652575,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3677821-pete,5,"Exactly : How Precision Engineers Created the Modern World (2018) by Simon Winchester is an insightful book that looks at just how important the gradual improvements in precision have been in creating the modern world. Winchester is a master of modern non-fiction and with precision he's picked a topic that is ideal for his writing style.Each chapter of the book has an increasing magnitude of precision starting from 0.1 and finishing with many, many more orders of magnitude. The book starts with the precision required for good steam engines, then how more precision was created to build locks, then make better screws and then how to make guns where the parts were really interchangeable that made the weapons much more reliable. Winchester then has a very clever chapter that compares the precision required for mass production of cars against methods of hand manufacturing for expensive cars. The next chapter is fantastic, looking at the incredible precision and quality control required for manufacturing jet engines. Then the book moves on to look the precision required for optics, then precision required for GPS and then a chapter on the incredible precision needed for making chips. The last numbered chapter is on the glorious precision of modern watches. Finally Winchester adds a chapter on how the SI measurements are maintained. Exactly is a really fine book. Somehow it doesn't seem quite as good as the best of some of Winchester's earlier books but it's certainly an excellent read. It may be that familiarity with his style makes his books a bit less appealing with time. But that said the book gives a really superb account of how important precision is in modern life and should make the reader appreciate even more just how incredible the world is that humans have shaped and an appreciation for the awesome skills of the engineers and scientists who have contributed to it. "
62,0062652575,http://goodreads.com/user/show/13717595-jake,5,"At first I found myself annoyed.I couldnt quite put my finger on it but something about the book irritated me. There were moments where I had thought. Ok. Time to just put this down and forget about it. And well. Clearly I didnt. And im quite happy that I made the choice to complete it. What I think irritated me in retrospect was the writing. It is not written within my exact dialect of English - Northeastern American English. Rather it has the stylistic, at times, circumlocutions, of none other than the beautiful wondrous pomp of British English. ....wellEventually I became acclimated to his style and stopped really caring. This is a wonderful book. It is a history book on engineering which is exact, and precise and how it is we went from simple tools, to clocks, cars and computers. A precisely made object is one in where detail is imposed to create a complex tool. Douglas Adams joked in his ""last chance to see"" that all tools stem from twig technology. We started with these small sticks. At first we used them to wack each other. Or wack another animal. Eventually somehow our tools moved to the level of civilizations (yea yea yea we all know jane Goodall showed humans arent the only animals to use tools)And here comes in this book. A history of how this occurred. It gave me an appreciation of the thought that went into many of our tools that seem simple.This is why I give it 5 stars.Recommended for those interested in :- how things went from simple tools to more complex- mechanical engineering Also- Everyone else"
63,0062652575,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9310118-jeimy,5,"This was an exceptional book that explains the importance of precision in technological advances. I read it months ago, and remember enjoying how it is organized: the technology described in each chapter requires more precision than the one in the previous chapter."
64,0062652575,http://goodreads.com/user/show/29680088-mary-whitton,5,"Another great read from Simon Winchester. (Two other favorites are: The Professor and the Madman about the making of the OED; and The map that changed the world about the making of the first geological subsurface map showing strata of materials underground. It was based on observations of materials (in layers) in the cuts made to create the canal system covering England)I’ve seen this new book on Amazon with two titles. #1. Exactly: how precision engineers created the modern worldAnd. #2. (Without the Exactly.). How precision .....Exactly is organized in chapters on devices with increasing precision. Since precision increased as time went on, the book advanced chronologically, too. It starts with boring rifle barrels and, later, steam engine cylinders and ends discussing the changes over time in the way a second is specified. Winchester’s love of words, and probably informed by his work on OED, leads to many fine short diversions into word origins and meaning. This was one of those books that I several times wanted to select a word by poking it with my finger, a la Kindle, to learn more. Quite enjoyable. "
65,0062652575,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5608032-cedricsmom,5,"I loved this book. I listened to it during my daily commute for work and enjoyed all of it. It answered questions I had like how do we know that a measuring instrument itself is accurate? What is the greatest thing by which we can measure all others? I highly recommend this book to students, tinkerers, historians, teachers, and those who simply enjoy good storytelling. Winchester has a way of humanizing topics that would normally put most folks out cold and he makes the topics relevant and relatable. This was my first Winchester but it won’t be my last. "
66,0062652575,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5568913-anders-h-eg-nissen,5,"Quite simply one of the best popular science books I’ve ever read.A fantastic tour de force through industrial history to the present day, with many delightful insights into the ideas that drove us to ever higher degrees of precision in everything from cannons to atomic clocks, and much more.All is explained in as much detail as needed - but no more - and in a delightful and playful, almost musical, prose.Very much recommended."
67,0062652575,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3546937-mad-russian-the-traveller,4,Fantastic writing and very interesting subject. Will write a review if every get enough time.
68,0062652575,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5917740-nilesh,3,"The Perfectionists is a rare book about unheralded engineers, who have truly built the modern society around us. Like in the popular TV series Big Bang Theory, theoreticians like Sheldon Cooper get the limelight while directly and indirectly undermining the contributions of every Wolowitz. We often forget that the armchair thinkers genuinely struggle if they have to change even a lightbulb. Real-life innovations require different skills that have had as much impact on humanity as the ideas of their celebrated counterparts. Here is a popular book that talks about the men who changed the world without ever mentioning a Plato or an Einstein or a Darwin. While conceptually perfect, the book proves why certain topics - however important - do not make good reading for a common man. Specific laws of any nation, a handbook on the gene identification, or a detailed history of evolutions of a pin are examples of such topics. The author tries hard to infuse excitement and continuity in the tale of engineers and their creations, but mostly in vain.Timepieces to the GPS, through rifles, automobiles, and to the measurement systems, do not make a well-related, compelling history. The disconnectedness of the chapters is equally present within them. The attempts to generate interest through the incidents surrounding innovations or involving the innovators are mostly humdrum. Even more annoying are the engineering details interspersed throughout. They are the subject matter, but their laborious presentations are unlikely to inspire anyone but the most devoted. In fact, the true geeks may find plentiful misrepresentations and errors when the author gets technical, while the rest gloss over.The truth is that many theoreticians - Galileo, Einstein, Darwin, to name a few - have had lives full of narratable incidents. The barebones of their discoveries are understandable; they inspire thoughts or discussions of profound importance even in the minds of most novice amateurs. The same does not apply to the characters and their subject matters here. We should express our admiration to these less-heralded innovators for their immense contributions for sure. And pointing that is the book's most significant achievement. "
69,0062652575,http://goodreads.com/user/show/48051175-casey,5,"A great book by Simon Winchester, even better listening to the author read the audio edition. Winchester, whose wit, depth of writing, and ability to tell sidebar nuggets of information without losing the central focus ranks him ahead of his peers, does not disappoint. On the surface this is a history of mankind’s search for ever greater precision, but beyond that it can also read as a formal turnover between mankind’s Industrial and Information ages. Starting with the development of efficient steam engines and ending with the current search for atomic level precision in the drive for ever greater computing power, Winchester steps through the dynamic story of precision. He covers topics as varied as the Royal Navy’s need for efficient block-and-tackle manufacturing, the dichotomy between Rolls-Royce’s handmade precision and that of Ford’s manufactured variety, and the overly large imprecision of the Hubble Telescope’s microscopically precise mirrors. Told with Winchester’s usual detail and humor, I learned a lot about both the methods of obtaining ever greater precision and the economic pressures which forced their development. The juxtaposition between the concepts of precision and accuracy is also a strong and useful theme. Highly recommended for those wanting a good overview of measurement in industrial history. "
70,0062652575,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4332892-scottsdale-public-library,0,"I discovered this author a few years ago and he is one of my favorite authors. Mr. Winchester does his research and writes fascinating books about a wide range of subjects. I found him when my attention was captured by a title ""The Professor And The Madman"" A fabulous book about the creation of the Oxford English Dictionary. You should read it!  But more about ""The Perfectionists"". This book takes us through eleven chapters of examples of ever increasing perfection in the tools and machines that we have used to create the things around us and the inventions that we have depended on since the eighteenth century. The thing that I love about this author is that he brings all kinds of facts about all kinds of things together in his chapters and shows how they are linked to create a whole. By the time you finish this book you will have learned a wide range of information about history, living conditions, types of material, politics, inventors, innovators, and yes a few madmen with brilliant ideas and dreams. Best of all you will see how these things and a montage of other information and sources come together to make a captivating story. I highly recommend this book and author. -Thomas D."
71,0062652575,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1587323-robin,5,"Wow! I’ve just finished listening to this book read by the author in his proper British accent. I’ve read several other books of his and probably given them all 5 stars. Evoking my inner engineer, the book covers the inventors of quite a few areas and the contributions which increased precision moving toward perfection. Steam engines, weaponry, automobiles, lenses, jet engines, GPS, locks, machine tools, and clocks are brought to life through the thinkers and inventors who have brought knowledge to the present day. I’d recommend the book to anyone with an insatiable appetite for the history of engineering. "
72,0062652575,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1054712-kent-winward,4,"So many things tend to escape our attention that we miss the areas of science that have been critical to technological advancement. Precision isn't the first thing that pops into the head when you are contemplating advancement, but it has been critical as Winchester points out. My biggest regret is the lack of time he spent on the counter example of a natural lack of precision exemplified by the concept of wabi-sabi, although he raises the issue at the end. It felt imprecise to treat the idea so lightly. "

I found him when my attention was captured by a title ""The Professor And The Madman"" A fabulous book about the creation of the Oxford English Dictionary. You should read it!  But more about ""The Perfectionists"". This book takes us through eleven chapters of examples of ever increasing perfection in the tools and machines that we have used to create the things around us and the inventions that we have depended on since the eighteenth century. The thing that I love about this author is that he brings all kinds of facts about all kinds of things together in his chapters and shows how they are linked to create a whole.

120,0062652575,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5937558-lynn,2,"I received a copy of this book from Harper Collins in exchange for an honest review.Today’s Nonfiction post is on The Perfectionists: How Precision Engineers Created the Modern World by Simon Winchester. It is 416 pages long and is published by Harper Collins. The cover is blue and white with a gear on top and the universe on the bottom. The intended reader is someone who is interested in engineers and engineering. There is no foul language, no sex, and no violence in this book. There Be Spoilers Ahead.From the back of the book- The revered New York Times bestselling author traces the development of technology from the Industrial Age to the Digital Age to explore the single component crucial to advancement—precision—in a superb history that is both an homage and a warning for our future.The rise of manufacturing could not have happened without an attention to precision. At the dawn of the Industrial Revolution in eighteenth-century England, standards of measurement were established, giving way to the development of machine tools—machines that make machines. Eventually, the application of precision tools and methods resulted in the creation and mass production of items from guns and glass to mirrors, lenses, and cameras—and eventually gave way to further breakthroughs, including gene splicing, microchips, and the Hadron Collider.Simon Winchester takes us back to origins of the Industrial Age, to England where he introduces the scientific minds that helped usher in modern production: John Wilkinson, Henry Maudslay, Joseph Bramah, Jesse Ramsden, and Joseph Whitworth. It was Thomas Jefferson who later exported their discoveries to the fledgling United States, setting the nation on its course to become a manufacturing titan. Winchester moves forward through time, to today’s cutting-edge developments occurring around the world, from America to Western Europe to Asia.As he introduces the minds and methods that have changed the modern world, Winchester explores fundamental questions. Why is precision important? What are the different tools we use to measure it? Who has invented and perfected it? Has the pursuit of the ultra-precise in so many facets of human life blinded us to other things of equal value, such as an appreciation for the age-old traditions of craftsmanship, art, and high culture? Are we missing something that reflects the world as it is, rather than the world as we think we would wish it to be? And can the precise and the natural co-exist in society?Review- This is a difficult book to read. Winchester has a potentially interesting student but it is weighted down by slow pacing and almost endless details that do not add to the narrative only make the story move slower. I wanted to like this book, the topic is interesting, the history of how the world became mechanical and so may interesting characters who helped make it so. But instead we get a slow, plodding story that is very difficult to engage with. Perhaps I just do not have the right mindset to read this book but I was so bored as I read it. I cannot recommend this book.I give this book a Two out of Five stars."
121,0062652575,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3677821-pete,5,"Exactly : How Precision Engineers Created the Modern World (2018) by Simon Winchester is an insightful book that looks at just how important the gradual improvements in precision have been in creating the modern world. Winchester is a master of modern non-fiction and with precision he's picked a topic that is ideal for his writing style.Each chapter of the book has an increasing magnitude of precision starting from 0.1 and finishing with many, many more orders of magnitude. The book starts with the precision required for good steam engines, then how more precision was created to build locks, then make better screws and then how to make guns where the parts were really interchangeable that made the weapons much more reliable. Winchester then has a very clever chapter that compares the precision required for mass production of cars against methods of hand manufacturing for expensive cars. The next chapter is fantastic, looking at the incredible precision and quality control required for manufacturing jet engines. Then the book moves on to look the precision required for optics, then precision required for GPS and then a chapter on the incredible precision needed for making chips. The last numbered chapter is on the glorious precision of modern watches. Finally Winchester adds a chapter on how the SI measurements are maintained. Exactly is a really fine book. Somehow it doesn't seem quite as good as the best of some of Winchester's earlier books but it's certainly an excellent read. It may be that familiarity with his style makes his books a bit less appealing with time. But that said the book gives a really superb account of how important precision is in modern life and should make the reader appreciate even more just how incredible the world is that humans have shaped and an appreciation for the awesome skills of the engineers and scientists who have contributed to it. "

There were moments where I had thought. Ok. Time to just put this down and forget about it. And well. Clearly I didnt. And im quite happy that I made the choice to complete it. What I think irritated me in retrospect was the writing. It is not written within my exact dialect of English - Northeastern American English. Rather it has the stylistic, at times, circumlocutions, of none other than the beautiful wondrous pomp of British English. ....wellEventually I became acclimated to his style and stopped really caring. This is a wonderful book. It is a history book on engineering which is exact, and precise and how it is we went from simple tools, to clocks, cars and computers. A precisely made object is one in where detail is imposed to create a complex tool. Douglas Adams joked in his ""last chance to see"" that all tools stem from twig technology. We started with these small sticks. At first we used them to wack each other. Or wack another animal. Eventually somehow our tools moved to the level of civilizations (yea yea yea we all know jane Goodall showed humans arent the only animals to use tools)And here comes in this book.

It is 416 pages long and is published by Harper Collins. The cover is blue and white with a gear on top and the universe on the bottom. The intended reader is someone who is interested in engineers and engineering. There is no foul language, no sex, and no violence in this book. There Be Spoilers Ahead.From the back of the book- The revered New York Times bestselling author traces the development of technology from the Industrial Age to the Digital Age to explore the single component crucial to advancement—precision—in a superb history that is both an homage and a warning for our future.The rise of manufacturing could not have happened without an attention to precision. At the dawn of the Industrial Revolution in eighteenth-century England, standards of measurement were established, giving way to the development of machine tools—machines that make machines. Eventually, the application of precision tools and methods resulted in the creation and mass production of items from guns and glass to mirrors, lenses, and cameras—and eventually gave way to further breakthroughs, including gene splicing, microchips, and the Hadron Collider.Simon Winchester takes us back to origins of the Industrial Age, to England where he introduces the scientific minds that helped usher in modern production: John Wilkinson, Henry Maudslay, Joseph Bramah, Jesse Ramsden, and Joseph Whitworth. It was Thomas Jefferson who later exported their discoveries to the fledgling United States, setting the nation on its course to become a manufacturing titan. Winchester moves forward through time, to today’s cutting-edge developments occurring around the world, from America to Western Europe to Asia.As he introduces the minds and methods that have changed the modern world, Winchester explores fundamental questions. Why is precision important? What are the different tools we use to measure it? Who has invented and perfected it? Has the pursuit of the ultra-precise in so many facets of human life blinded us to other things of equal value, such as an appreciation for the age-old traditions of craftsmanship, art, and high culture? Are we missing something that reflects the world as it is, rather than the world as we think we would wish it to be? And can the precise and the natural co-exist in society?Review- This is a difficult book to read. Winchester has a potentially interesting student but it is weighted down by slow pacing and almost endless details that do not add to the narrative only make the story move slower. I wanted to like this book, the topic is interesting, the history of how the world became mechanical and so may interesting characters who helped make it so. But instead we get a slow, plodding story that is very difficult to engage with. Perhaps I just do not have the right mindset to read this book but I was so bored as I read it. I cannot recommend this book.I give this book a Two out of Five stars."
151,0062652575,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3677821-pete,5,"Exactly : How Precision Engineers Created the Modern World (2018) by Simon Winchester is an insightful book that looks at just how important the gradual improvements in precision have been in creating the modern world. Winchester is a master of modern non-fiction and with precision he's picked a topic that is ideal for his writing style.Each chapter of the book has an increasing magnitude of precision starting from 0.1 and finishing with many, many more orders of magnitude. The book starts with the precision required for good steam engines, then how more precision was created to build locks, then make better screws and then how to make guns where the parts were really interchangeable that made the weapons much more reliable. Winchester then has a very clever chapter that compares the precision required for mass production of cars against methods of hand manufacturing for expensive cars. The next chapter is fantastic, looking at the incredible precision and quality control required for manufacturing jet engines. Then the book moves on to look the precision required for optics, then precision required for GPS and then a chapter on the incredible precision needed for making chips. The last numbered chapter is on the glorious precision of modern watches. Finally Winchester adds a chapter on how the SI measurements are maintained. Exactly is a really fine book. Somehow it doesn't seem quite as good as the best of some of Winchester's earlier books but it's certainly an excellent read. It may be that familiarity with his style makes his books a bit less appealing with time. But that said the book gives a really superb account of how important precision is in modern life and should make the reader appreciate even more just how incredible the world is that humans have shaped and an appreciation for the awesome skills of the engineers and scientists who have contributed to it. "

Winchester’s love of words, and probably informed by his work on OED, leads to many fine short diversions into word origins and meaning.

It answered questions I had like how do we know that a measuring instrument itself is accurate? What is the greatest thing by which we can measure all others? I highly recommend this book to students, tinkerers, historians, teachers, and those who simply enjoy good storytelling. Winchester has a way of humanizing topics that would normally put most folks out cold and he makes the topics relevant and relatable. This was my first Winchester but it won’t be my last. "

158,0062652575,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5917740-nilesh,3,"The Perfectionists is a rare book about unheralded engineers, who have truly built the modern society around us. Like in the popular TV series Big Bang Theory, theoreticians like Sheldon Cooper get the limelight while directly and indirectly undermining the contributions of every Wolowitz. We often forget that the armchair thinkers genuinely struggle if they have to change even a lightbulb. Real-life innovations require different skills that have had as much impact on humanity as the ideas of their celebrated counterparts. Here is a popular book that talks about the men who changed the world without ever mentioning a Plato or an Einstein or a Darwin. While conceptually perfect, the book proves why certain topics - however important - do not make good reading for a common man. Specific laws of any nation, a handbook on the gene identification, or a detailed history of evolutions of a pin are examples of such topics. The author tries hard to infuse excitement and continuity in the tale of engineers and their creations, but mostly in vain.Timepieces to the GPS, through rifles, automobiles, and to the measurement systems, do not make a well-related, compelling history. The disconnectedness of the chapters is equally present within them. The attempts to generate interest through the incidents surrounding innovations or involving the innovators are mostly humdrum. Even more annoying are the engineering details interspersed throughout. They are the subject matter, but their laborious presentations are unlikely to inspire anyone but the most devoted. In fact, the true geeks may find plentiful misrepresentations and errors when the author gets technical, while the rest gloss over.The truth is that many theoreticians - Galileo, Einstein, Darwin, to name a few - have had lives full of narratable incidents. The barebones of their discoveries are understandable; they inspire thoughts or discussions of profound importance even in the minds of most novice amateurs. The same does not apply to the characters and their subject matters here. We should express our admiration to these less-heralded innovators for their immense contributions for sure. And pointing that is the book's most significant achievement. "
159,0062652575,http://goodreads.com/user/show/48051175-casey,5,"A great book by Simon Winchester, even better listening to the author read the audio edition. Winchester, whose wit, depth of writing, and ability to tell sidebar nuggets of information without losing the central focus ranks him ahead of his peers, does not disappoint. On the surface this is a history of mankind’s search for ever greater precision, but beyond that it can also read as a formal turnover between mankind’s Industrial and Information ages. Starting with the development of efficient steam engines and ending with the current search for atomic level precision in the drive for ever greater computing power, Winchester steps through the dynamic story of precision. He covers topics as varied as the Royal Navy’s need for efficient block-and-tackle manufacturing, the dichotomy between Rolls-Royce’s handmade precision and that of Ford’s manufactured variety, and the overly large imprecision of the Hubble Telescope’s microscopically precise mirrors. Told with Winchester’s usual detail and humor, I learned a lot about both the methods of obtaining ever greater precision and the economic pressures which forced their development. The juxtaposition between the concepts of precision and accuracy is also a strong and useful theme. Highly recommended for those wanting a good overview of measurement in industrial history. "
160,0062652575,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4332892-scottsdale-public-library,0,"I discovered this author a few years ago and he is one of my favorite authors. Mr. Winchester does his research and writes fascinating books about a wide range of subjects. I found him when my attention was captured by a title ""The Professor And The Madman"" A fabulous book about the creation of the Oxford English Dictionary. You should read it!  But more about ""The Perfectionists"". This book takes us through eleven chapters of examples of ever increasing perfection in the tools and machines that we have used to create the things around us and the inventions that we have depended on since the eighteenth century. The thing that I love about this author is that he brings all kinds of facts about all kinds of things together in his chapters and shows how they are linked to create a whole. By the time you finish this book you will have learned a wide range of information about history, living conditions, types of material, politics, inventors, innovators, and yes a few madmen with brilliant ideas and dreams. Best of all you will see how these things and a montage of other information and sources come together to make a captivating story. I highly recommend this book and author. -Thomas D."
161,0062652575,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1587323-robin,5,"Wow! I’ve just finished listening to this book read by the author in his proper British accent. I’ve read several other books of his and probably given them all 5 stars. Evoking my inner engineer, the book covers the inventors of quite a few areas and the contributions which increased precision moving toward perfection. Steam engines, weaponry, automobiles, lenses, jet engines, GPS, locks, machine tools, and clocks are brought to life through the thinkers and inventors who have brought knowledge to the present day. I’d recommend the book to anyone with an insatiable appetite for the history of engineering. "
162,0062652575,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1054712-kent-winward,4,"So many things tend to escape our attention that we miss the areas of science that have been critical to technological advancement. Precision isn't the first thing that pops into the head when you are contemplating advancement, but it has been critical as Winchester points out. My biggest regret is the lack of time he spent on the counter example of a natural lack of precision exemplified by the concept of wabi-sabi, although he raises the issue at the end. It felt imprecise to treat the idea so lightly. "

In The Perfectionists (2018) Winchester condenses technical and historical details into wonderfully interesting stories. The rise and increasing exactitude of precise measurement launched the Industrial Revolution and has affected virtually every technological and scientific advancement since.The blend of Winchester's journalistic acumen to distill science, history, and people into ""the rest of the story"" along with his clear and elegant writing style makes this book highly readable. Very enjoyable. Good reference. Highly recommended. "
164,0062652575,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2592514-mark,4,"As is typical of his books, Simon Winchester is much more concerned with telling good stories than offering a comprehensive view of his subject, making for an excellent read. There a few chapters - for example, those on the jet engine and the Hubble Telescope - where Winchester truly knocks it out of the park. And the rest of the book is ""merely"" very good. My one gripe is that I wish the publisher had shelled out for some original drawings that illustrate some of the engineering that Winchester describes."
165,0062652575,http://goodreads.com/user/show/20598546-smitesh-bakrania,5,"For an engineer, this is a fascinating history of precision machining. From Locks and Steam Engines to Jet Engines there is appreciate in the form of where industrial revolution began and how it was fueled by the need to economical production methods that scaled. The stories of Henry Maudslay, James Watt, and Joseph Whitworth are captivating along with the resilience of Frank Whittle. There are also great examples where impression led to disasters including the Qantas crash and the Hubble Space Telescope. The afterward is equally engaging with the story of units and how standards were created. Let us not forget the jo blocks. A great companion to engineering quality and reliability."

Starting with the development of efficient steam engines and ending with the current search for atomic level precision in the drive for ever greater computing power, Winchester steps through the dynamic story of precision. He covers topics as varied as the Royal Navy’s need for efficient block-and-tackle manufacturing, the dichotomy between Rolls-Royce’s handmade precision and that of Ford’s manufactured variety, and the overly large imprecision of the Hubble Telescope’s microscopically precise mirrors. Told with Winchester’s usual detail and humor, I learned a lot about both the methods of obtaining ever greater precision and the economic pressures which forced their development. The juxtaposition between the concepts of precision and accuracy is also a strong and useful theme. Highly recommended for those wanting a good overview of measurement in industrial history. "

Mr. Winchester does his research and writes fascinating books about a wide range of subjects. I found him when my attention was captured by a title ""The Professor And The Madman"" A fabulous book about the creation of the Oxford English Dictionary. You should read it!  But more about ""The Perfectionists"". This book takes us through eleven chapters of examples of ever increasing perfection in the tools and machines that we have used to create the things around us and the inventions that we have depended on since the eighteenth century. The thing that I love about this author is that he brings all kinds of facts about all kinds of things together in his chapters and shows how they are linked to create a whole. By the time you finish this book you will have learned a wide range of information about history, living conditions, types of material, politics, inventors, innovators, and yes a few madmen with brilliant ideas and dreams.

210,0062652575,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5937558-lynn,2,"I received a copy of this book from Harper Collins in exchange for an honest review.Today’s Nonfiction post is on The Perfectionists: How Precision Engineers Created the Modern World by Simon Winchester. It is 416 pages long and is published by Harper Collins. The cover is blue and white with a gear on top and the universe on the bottom. The intended reader is someone who is interested in engineers and engineering. There is no foul language, no sex, and no violence in this book. There Be Spoilers Ahead.From the back of the book- The revered New York Times bestselling author traces the development of technology from the Industrial Age to the Digital Age to explore the single component crucial to advancement—precision—in a superb history that is both an homage and a warning for our future.The rise of manufacturing could not have happened without an attention to precision. At the dawn of the Industrial Revolution in eighteenth-century England, standards of measurement were established, giving way to the development of machine tools—machines that make machines. Eventually, the application of precision tools and methods resulted in the creation and mass production of items from guns and glass to mirrors, lenses, and cameras—and eventually gave way to further breakthroughs, including gene splicing, microchips, and the Hadron Collider.Simon Winchester takes us back to origins of the Industrial Age, to England where he introduces the scientific minds that helped usher in modern production: John Wilkinson, Henry Maudslay, Joseph Bramah, Jesse Ramsden, and Joseph Whitworth. It was Thomas Jefferson who later exported their discoveries to the fledgling United States, setting the nation on its course to become a manufacturing titan. Winchester moves forward through time, to today’s cutting-edge developments occurring around the world, from America to Western Europe to Asia.As he introduces the minds and methods that have changed the modern world, Winchester explores fundamental questions. Why is precision important? What are the different tools we use to measure it? Who has invented and perfected it? Has the pursuit of the ultra-precise in so many facets of human life blinded us to other things of equal value, such as an appreciation for the age-old traditions of craftsmanship, art, and high culture? Are we missing something that reflects the world as it is, rather than the world as we think we would wish it to be? And can the precise and the natural co-exist in society?Review- This is a difficult book to read. Winchester has a potentially interesting student but it is weighted down by slow pacing and almost endless details that do not add to the narrative only make the story move slower. I wanted to like this book, the topic is interesting, the history of how the world became mechanical and so may interesting characters who helped make it so. But instead we get a slow, plodding story that is very difficult to engage with. Perhaps I just do not have the right mindset to read this book but I was so bored as I read it. I cannot recommend this book.I give this book a Two out of Five stars."
211,0062652575,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3677821-pete,5,"Exactly : How Precision Engineers Created the Modern World (2018) by Simon Winchester is an insightful book that looks at just how important the gradual improvements in precision have been in creating the modern world. Winchester is a master of modern non-fiction and with precision he's picked a topic that is ideal for his writing style.Each chapter of the book has an increasing magnitude of precision starting from 0.1 and finishing with many, many more orders of magnitude. The book starts with the precision required for good steam engines, then how more precision was created to build locks, then make better screws and then how to make guns where the parts were really interchangeable that made the weapons much more reliable. Winchester then has a very clever chapter that compares the precision required for mass production of cars against methods of hand manufacturing for expensive cars. The next chapter is fantastic, looking at the incredible precision and quality control required for manufacturing jet engines. Then the book moves on to look the precision required for optics, then precision required for GPS and then a chapter on the incredible precision needed for making chips. The last numbered chapter is on the glorious precision of modern watches. Finally Winchester adds a chapter on how the SI measurements are maintained. Exactly is a really fine book. Somehow it doesn't seem quite as good as the best of some of Winchester's earlier books but it's certainly an excellent read. It may be that familiarity with his style makes his books a bit less appealing with time. But that said the book gives a really superb account of how important precision is in modern life and should make the reader appreciate even more just how incredible the world is that humans have shaped and an appreciation for the awesome skills of the engineers and scientists who have contributed to it. "

There were moments where I had thought. Ok. Time to just put this down and forget about it. And well. Clearly I didnt. And im quite happy that I made the choice to complete it. What I think irritated me in retrospect was the writing. It is not written within my exact dialect of English - Northeastern American English. Rather it has the stylistic, at times, circumlocutions, of none other than the beautiful wondrous pomp of British English. ....wellEventually I became acclimated to his style and stopped really caring. This is a wonderful book. It is a history book on engineering which is exact, and precise and how it is we went from simple tools, to clocks, cars and computers. A precisely made object is one in where detail is imposed to create a complex tool. Douglas Adams joked in his ""last chance to see"" that all tools stem from twig technology. We started with these small sticks. At first we used them to wack each other. Or wack another animal. Eventually somehow our tools moved to the level of civilizations (yea yea yea we all know jane Goodall showed humans arent the only animals to use tools)And here comes in this book. A history of how this occurred. It gave me an appreciation of the thought that went into many of our tools that seem simple.This is why I give it 5 stars.Recommended for those interested in :- how things went from simple tools to more complex- mechanical engineering Also- Everyone else"

It is 416 pages long and is published by Harper Collins. The cover is blue and white with a gear on top and the universe on the bottom. The intended reader is someone who is interested in engineers and engineering. There is no foul language, no sex, and no violence in this book. There Be Spoilers Ahead.From the back of the book- The revered New York Times bestselling author traces the development of technology from the Industrial Age to the Digital Age to explore the single component crucial to advancement—precision—in a superb history that is both an homage and a warning for our future.The rise of manufacturing could not have happened without an attention to precision. At the dawn of the Industrial Revolution in eighteenth-century England, standards of measurement were established, giving way to the development of machine tools—machines that make machines. Eventually, the application of precision tools and methods resulted in the creation and mass production of items from guns and glass to mirrors, lenses, and cameras—and eventually gave way to further breakthroughs, including gene splicing, microchips, and the Hadron Collider.Simon Winchester takes us back to origins of the Industrial Age, to England where he introduces the scientific minds that helped usher in modern production: John Wilkinson, Henry Maudslay, Joseph Bramah, Jesse Ramsden, and Joseph Whitworth. It was Thomas Jefferson who later exported their discoveries to the fledgling United States, setting the nation on its course to become a manufacturing titan. Winchester moves forward through time, to today’s cutting-edge developments occurring around the world, from America to Western Europe to Asia.As he introduces the minds and methods that have changed the modern world, Winchester explores fundamental questions. Why is precision important? What are the different tools we use to measure it? Who has invented and perfected it? Has the pursuit of the ultra-precise in so many facets of human life blinded us to other things of equal value, such as an appreciation for the age-old traditions of craftsmanship, art, and high culture? Are we missing something that reflects the world as it is, rather than the world as we think we would wish it to be? And can the precise and the natural co-exist in society?Review- This is a difficult book to read. Winchester has a potentially interesting student but it is weighted down by slow pacing and almost endless details that do not add to the narrative only make the story move slower. I wanted to like this book, the topic is interesting, the history of how the world became mechanical and so may interesting characters who helped make it so. But instead we get a slow, plodding story that is very difficult to engage with. Perhaps I just do not have the right mindset to read this book but I was so bored as I read it. I cannot recommend this book.I give this book a Two out of Five stars."
241,0062652575,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3677821-pete,5,"Exactly : How Precision Engineers Created the Modern World (2018) by Simon Winchester is an insightful book that looks at just how important the gradual improvements in precision have been in creating the modern world. Winchester is a master of modern non-fiction and with precision he's picked a topic that is ideal for his writing style.Each chapter of the book has an increasing magnitude of precision starting from 0.1 and finishing with many, many more orders of magnitude. The book starts with the precision required for good steam engines, then how more precision was created to build locks, then make better screws and then how to make guns where the parts were really interchangeable that made the weapons much more reliable. Winchester then has a very clever chapter that compares the precision required for mass production of cars against methods of hand manufacturing for expensive cars. The next chapter is fantastic, looking at the incredible precision and quality control required for manufacturing jet engines. Then the book moves on to look the precision required for optics, then precision required for GPS and then a chapter on the incredible precision needed for making chips. The last numbered chapter is on the glorious precision of modern watches. Finally Winchester adds a chapter on how the SI measurements are maintained. Exactly is a really fine book. Somehow it doesn't seem quite as good as the best of some of Winchester's earlier books but it's certainly an excellent read. It may be that familiarity with his style makes his books a bit less appealing with time. But that said the book gives a really superb account of how important precision is in modern life and should make the reader appreciate even more just how incredible the world is that humans have shaped and an appreciation for the awesome skills of the engineers and scientists who have contributed to it. "

I highly recommend this book to students, tinkerers, historians, teachers, and those who simply enjoy good storytelling. Winchester has a way of humanizing topics that would normally put most folks out cold and he makes the topics relevant and relatable. This was my first Winchester but it won’t be my last. "

248,0062652575,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5917740-nilesh,3,"The Perfectionists is a rare book about unheralded engineers, who have truly built the modern society around us. Like in the popular TV series Big Bang Theory, theoreticians like Sheldon Cooper get the limelight while directly and indirectly undermining the contributions of every Wolowitz. We often forget that the armchair thinkers genuinely struggle if they have to change even a lightbulb. Real-life innovations require different skills that have had as much impact on humanity as the ideas of their celebrated counterparts. Here is a popular book that talks about the men who changed the world without ever mentioning a Plato or an Einstein or a Darwin. While conceptually perfect, the book proves why certain topics - however important - do not make good reading for a common man. Specific laws of any nation, a handbook on the gene identification, or a detailed history of evolutions of a pin are examples of such topics. The author tries hard to infuse excitement and continuity in the tale of engineers and their creations, but mostly in vain.Timepieces to the GPS, through rifles, automobiles, and to the measurement systems, do not make a well-related, compelling history. The disconnectedness of the chapters is equally present within them. The attempts to generate interest through the incidents surrounding innovations or involving the innovators are mostly humdrum. Even more annoying are the engineering details interspersed throughout. They are the subject matter, but their laborious presentations are unlikely to inspire anyone but the most devoted. In fact, the true geeks may find plentiful misrepresentations and errors when the author gets technical, while the rest gloss over.The truth is that many theoreticians - Galileo, Einstein, Darwin, to name a few - have had lives full of narratable incidents. The barebones of their discoveries are understandable; they inspire thoughts or discussions of profound importance even in the minds of most novice amateurs. The same does not apply to the characters and their subject matters here. We should express our admiration to these less-heralded innovators for their immense contributions for sure. And pointing that is the book's most significant achievement. "
249,0062652575,http://goodreads.com/user/show/48051175-casey,5,"A great book by Simon Winchester, even better listening to the author read the audio edition. Winchester, whose wit, depth of writing, and ability to tell sidebar nuggets of information without losing the central focus ranks him ahead of his peers, does not disappoint. On the surface this is a history of mankind’s search for ever greater precision, but beyond that it can also read as a formal turnover between mankind’s Industrial and Information ages. Starting with the development of efficient steam engines and ending with the current search for atomic level precision in the drive for ever greater computing power, Winchester steps through the dynamic story of precision. He covers topics as varied as the Royal Navy’s need for efficient block-and-tackle manufacturing, the dichotomy between Rolls-Royce’s handmade precision and that of Ford’s manufactured variety, and the overly large imprecision of the Hubble Telescope’s microscopically precise mirrors. Told with Winchester’s usual detail and humor, I learned a lot about both the methods of obtaining ever greater precision and the economic pressures which forced their development. The juxtaposition between the concepts of precision and accuracy is also a strong and useful theme. Highly recommended for those wanting a good overview of measurement in industrial history. "
250,0062652575,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4332892-scottsdale-public-library,0,"I discovered this author a few years ago and he is one of my favorite authors. Mr. Winchester does his research and writes fascinating books about a wide range of subjects. I found him when my attention was captured by a title ""The Professor And The Madman"" A fabulous book about the creation of the Oxford English Dictionary. You should read it!  But more about ""The Perfectionists"". This book takes us through eleven chapters of examples of ever increasing perfection in the tools and machines that we have used to create the things around us and the inventions that we have depended on since the eighteenth century. The thing that I love about this author is that he brings all kinds of facts about all kinds of things together in his chapters and shows how they are linked to create a whole. By the time you finish this book you will have learned a wide range of information about history, living conditions, types of material, politics, inventors, innovators, and yes a few madmen with brilliant ideas and dreams. Best of all you will see how these things and a montage of other information and sources come together to make a captivating story. I highly recommend this book and author. -Thomas D."
251,0062652575,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1587323-robin,5,"Wow! I’ve just finished listening to this book read by the author in his proper British accent. I’ve read several other books of his and probably given them all 5 stars. Evoking my inner engineer, the book covers the inventors of quite a few areas and the contributions which increased precision moving toward perfection. Steam engines, weaponry, automobiles, lenses, jet engines, GPS, locks, machine tools, and clocks are brought to life through the thinkers and inventors who have brought knowledge to the present day. I’d recommend the book to anyone with an insatiable appetite for the history of engineering. "
252,0062652575,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1054712-kent-winward,4,"So many things tend to escape our attention that we miss the areas of science that have been critical to technological advancement. Precision isn't the first thing that pops into the head when you are contemplating advancement, but it has been critical as Winchester points out. My biggest regret is the lack of time he spent on the counter example of a natural lack of precision exemplified by the concept of wabi-sabi, although he raises the issue at the end. It felt imprecise to treat the idea so lightly. "

In The Perfectionists (2018) Winchester condenses technical and historical details into wonderfully interesting stories. The rise and increasing exactitude of precise measurement launched the Industrial Revolution and has affected virtually every technological and scientific advancement since.The blend of Winchester's journalistic acumen to distill science, history, and people into ""the rest of the story"" along with his clear and elegant writing style makes this book highly readable. Very enjoyable. Good reference. Highly recommended. "
254,0062652575,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2592514-mark,4,"As is typical of his books, Simon Winchester is much more concerned with telling good stories than offering a comprehensive view of his subject, making for an excellent read. There a few chapters - for example, those on the jet engine and the Hubble Telescope - where Winchester truly knocks it out of the park. And the rest of the book is ""merely"" very good. My one gripe is that I wish the publisher had shelled out for some original drawings that illustrate some of the engineering that Winchester describes."
255,0062652575,http://goodreads.com/user/show/20598546-smitesh-bakrania,5,"For an engineer, this is a fascinating history of precision machining. From Locks and Steam Engines to Jet Engines there is appreciate in the form of where industrial revolution began and how it was fueled by the need to economical production methods that scaled. The stories of Henry Maudslay, James Watt, and Joseph Whitworth are captivating along with the resilience of Frank Whittle. There are also great examples where impression led to disasters including the Qantas crash and the Hubble Space Telescope. The afterward is equally engaging with the story of units and how standards were created. Let us not forget the jo blocks. A great companion to engineering quality and reliability."

It answered questions I had like how do we know that a measuring instrument itself is accurate? What is the greatest thing by which we can measure all others? I highly recommend this book to students, tinkerers, historians, teachers, and those who simply enjoy good storytelling. Winchester has a way of humanizing topics that would normally put most folks out cold and he makes the topics relevant and relatable. This was my first Winchester but it won’t be my last. "

278,0062652575,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5917740-nilesh,3,"The Perfectionists is a rare book about unheralded engineers, who have truly built the modern society around us. Like in the popular TV series Big Bang Theory, theoreticians like Sheldon Cooper get the limelight while directly and indirectly undermining the contributions of every Wolowitz. We often forget that the armchair thinkers genuinely struggle if they have to change even a lightbulb. Real-life innovations require different skills that have had as much impact on humanity as the ideas of their celebrated counterparts. Here is a popular book that talks about the men who changed the world without ever mentioning a Plato or an Einstein or a Darwin. While conceptually perfect, the book proves why certain topics - however important - do not make good reading for a common man. Specific laws of any nation, a handbook on the gene identification, or a detailed history of evolutions of a pin are examples of such topics. The author tries hard to infuse excitement and continuity in the tale of engineers and their creations, but mostly in vain.Timepieces to the GPS, through rifles, automobiles, and to the measurement systems, do not make a well-related, compelling history. The disconnectedness of the chapters is equally present within them. The attempts to generate interest through the incidents surrounding innovations or involving the innovators are mostly humdrum. Even more annoying are the engineering details interspersed throughout. They are the subject matter, but their laborious presentations are unlikely to inspire anyone but the most devoted. In fact, the true geeks may find plentiful misrepresentations and errors when the author gets technical, while the rest gloss over.The truth is that many theoreticians - Galileo, Einstein, Darwin, to name a few - have had lives full of narratable incidents. The barebones of their discoveries are understandable; they inspire thoughts or discussions of profound importance even in the minds of most novice amateurs. The same does not apply to the characters and their subject matters here. We should express our admiration to these less-heralded innovators for their immense contributions for sure. And pointing that is the book's most significant achievement. "

Winchester, whose wit, depth of writing, and ability to tell sidebar nuggets of information without losing the central focus ranks him ahead of his peers, does not disappoint. On the surface this is a history of mankind’s search for ever greater precision, but beyond that it can also read as a formal turnover between mankind’s Industrial and Information ages. Starting with the development of efficient steam engines and ending with the current search for atomic level precision in the drive for ever greater computing power, Winchester steps through the dynamic story of precision. He covers topics as varied as the Royal Navy’s need for efficient block-and-tackle manufacturing, the dichotomy between Rolls-Royce’s handmade precision and that of Ford’s manufactured variety, and the overly large imprecision of the Hubble Telescope’s microscopically precise mirrors. Told with Winchester’s usual detail and humor, I learned a lot about both the methods of obtaining ever greater precision and the economic pressures which forced their development. The juxtaposition between the concepts of precision and accuracy is also a strong and useful theme. Highly recommended for those wanting a good overview of measurement in industrial history. "
280,0062652575,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4332892-scottsdale-public-library,0,"I discovered this author a few years ago and he is one of my favorite authors. Mr. Winchester does his research and writes fascinating books about a wide range of subjects. I found him when my attention was captured by a title ""The Professor And The Madman"" A fabulous book about the creation of the Oxford English Dictionary. You should read it!  But more about ""The Perfectionists"". This book takes us through eleven chapters of examples of ever increasing perfection in the tools and machines that we have used to create the things around us and the inventions that we have depended on since the eighteenth century. The thing that I love about this author is that he brings all kinds of facts about all kinds of things together in his chapters and shows how they are linked to create a whole. By the time you finish this book you will have learned a wide range of information about history, living conditions, types of material, politics, inventors, innovators, and yes a few madmen with brilliant ideas and dreams. Best of all you will see how these things and a montage of other information and sources come together to make a captivating story. I highly recommend this book and author. -Thomas D."
281,0062652575,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1587323-robin,5,"Wow! I’ve just finished listening to this book read by the author in his proper British accent. I’ve read several other books of his and probably given them all 5 stars. Evoking my inner engineer, the book covers the inventors of quite a few areas and the contributions which increased precision moving toward perfection. Steam engines, weaponry, automobiles, lenses, jet engines, GPS, locks, machine tools, and clocks are brought to life through the thinkers and inventors who have brought knowledge to the present day. I’d recommend the book to anyone with an insatiable appetite for the history of engineering. "
282,0062652575,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1054712-kent-winward,4,"So many things tend to escape our attention that we miss the areas of science that have been critical to technological advancement. Precision isn't the first thing that pops into the head when you are contemplating advancement, but it has been critical as Winchester points out. My biggest regret is the lack of time he spent on the counter example of a natural lack of precision exemplified by the concept of wabi-sabi, although he raises the issue at the end. It felt imprecise to treat the idea so lightly. "
283,0062652575,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4968433-rob-saunders,5,"This is another excellent book by Simon Winchester. In The Perfectionists (2018) Winchester condenses technical and historical details into wonderfully interesting stories. The rise and increasing exactitude of precise measurement launched the Industrial Revolution and has affected virtually every technological and scientific advancement since.The blend of Winchester's journalistic acumen to distill science, history, and people into ""the rest of the story"" along with his clear and elegant writing style makes this book highly readable. Very enjoyable. Good reference. Highly recommended. "
284,0062652575,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2592514-mark,4,"As is typical of his books, Simon Winchester is much more concerned with telling good stories than offering a comprehensive view of his subject, making for an excellent read. There a few chapters - for example, those on the jet engine and the Hubble Telescope - where Winchester truly knocks it out of the park. And the rest of the book is ""merely"" very good. My one gripe is that I wish the publisher had shelled out for some original drawings that illustrate some of the engineering that Winchester describes."
285,0062652575,http://goodreads.com/user/show/20598546-smitesh-bakrania,5,"For an engineer, this is a fascinating history of precision machining. From Locks and Steam Engines to Jet Engines there is appreciate in the form of where industrial revolution began and how it was fueled by the need to economical production methods that scaled. The stories of Henry Maudslay, James Watt, and Joseph Whitworth are captivating along with the resilience of Frank Whittle. There are also great examples where impression led to disasters including the Qantas crash and the Hubble Space Telescope. The afterward is equally engaging with the story of units and how standards were created. Let us not forget the jo blocks. A great companion to engineering quality and reliability."
286,0062652575,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11830361-karrie,4,"A short history of precision and those that practice it, will seem dull to some and riveting to others. I fall in the later category, this being a subject close to his heart Winchester’s enthusiasm reads on the page.From steam to Hubble the evolution is told naturally with vivid details. I even liked the chapter headings."
287,0062652575,http://goodreads.com/user/show/23725851-lovely-loveday,5,"The Perfectionists: How Precision Engineers Created the Modern World by Simon Winchesteris an informative and insightful read that shares some of the reasons behind some of the most amazing inventions throughout history. Whether you are a science buff or not, you will be drawn into this fascinating world of science, technology and out of this world inventions. A book that will intrigue you making it hard to put down. *I received an ARC from Harper Collins in exchange for my honest and unbiased review.*"
288,0062652575,http://goodreads.com/user/show/109603-phaedra,5,"I love everything Simon Winchester. This has been my least favorite so far but I still give 5 stars. He's just that good. This book is very technical, with lots of zeros. As is his style, Winchester weaves in stories to add interest."
289,0062652575,http://goodreads.com/user/show/40495806-john-kidman,5,Fabulous in every way. I learnt so much from this book - even though I didn’t understand all that I read. The language used is truly wonderful. Simon sure knows how to write captivating sentences. 
290,0062652575,http://goodreads.com/user/show/18632777-ellen-deasy,4,If it hadn’t been for my book club I would NEVER have read this one. Quite a bit went over my head but putting words to the increasing impact of increased precision was pretty darned interesting. I liked it!
291,0062652575,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3126915-imi,0,"Not for me. Leaving unrated as I don't think I got far enough to judge fairly. There's plenty of interesting historical research here, but I'm finding it tedious and rambling, and it's definitely padded out by unnecessary personal stories and way too much detail."
292,0062652575,http://goodreads.com/user/show/17779819-tyrel-rupp,3,"Started great, but had no satisfying finish. Terrible at explaining technical things. "
293,0062652575,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5817790-steve,4,A fun book for tech-nerds like me!
294,0062652575,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9401123-chris,5,"This whole book is about the history of precision and accuracy, the difference between those definitions, and ways that we measure in the modern world. It's exactly my kind of book."
295,0062652575,http://goodreads.com/user/show/92418390-brian,5,Another great read by Simon. I'll think about this one a lot.
296,0062652575,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3708878-loni,5,Classic Winchester. Very enjoyable and educational. 
297,0062652575,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5291378-beth,4,"This was quite readable for a science/mechanics book. My favorite chapter was on lenses: cameras, telescopes, NASA equipment."
298,0062652575,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5785753-pam,3,"This book is not about different technologies and how they were improved, but instead about the people who made the improvements. Winchester does not necessarily explain the technological aspects of the improvements or does not necessarily explain those aspects well. At the beginning of each chapter he provides an estimate of how much improvement this person was responsible for but he never provides justification of that number. Not a bad book just not as good as I hoped. "
299,0062652575,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5774520-penelope,5,"Beautifully narrated by the author, this is a panoramic feast of information about how precision has enabled civilization to advance. Spell binding, wonderful. "
