A few years ago, when I was working at NASA, we made up a game called If Research Were Romance. Here, let me show you how to play.In real life, Thomas Kuhn wrote a book about paradigm changes in science. But if research were romance, he might have written a book about relationships instead. It might have been quite similar in many ways. Scientists care so much about their theories that you won't go far wrong if you think about the feelings they have for those theories as being similar to the feelings that normal people have for their significant others. If research were romance, Thomas Kuhn might have said that, when you're in a committed relationship, that relationship colors all your life. A lot of what you do and think only makes sense in terms of the relationship. And everyone over, say, 20, knows that relationships are not always easy. You're continually having problems, some of them little, some of them not so little. But if you're prepared to work on them, you can usually solve those problems, and when you've done so you usually feel that the relationship is stronger, not weaker. The fact that you've surmounted the problem gives you more faith in the relationship.If research were romance, Thomas Kuhn might have gone on to say that sometimes you get another feeling. The problems won't disappear, or they go away in one form and immediately return in another. You start to feel that the relationship is undergoing a real crisis. But you'll probably still continue to work on it, unless you meet another person who offers you a chance of something different. If you've been in your relationship a long time, it will feel difficult to consider seriously the idea of abandoning it and starting a new one. Sometimes, though, people do this. They won't really know why they're taking this drastic step, and they won't be able to justify it clearly in their minds. It will just seem like the right thing to do.If research were romance, Thomas Kuhn might have added that, after the old relationship has ended and the new one has started, it will be hard to see your old life in the same terms. Your view of it will now be colored by your new relationship. Now, you will probably only be able to see the old relationship as containing faults which you never noticed at the time. You will not really be able to remember what it was like.If research were romance, Thomas Kuhn might have said that some people believe that they have a true soulmate out there, and it's just a question of finding that special person they are fated to be with. But he wouldn't have believed that. He'd have said that people sometimes change their partner, and often they may do it for a good reason. But there is no absolute sense in which the new partner is better suited to them than the old one. They are better in some ways and worse in others. If research were romance, Thomas Kuhn would have been a rock star. Security staff would have been needed to stop groupies getting into his hotel room and he'd have been unsure about how many children he'd fathered. He'd have played it down in interviews, but everyone would have known what the deal was.If you also work in science, I encourage you to experiment with this game. You'll be amazed how much insight it gives you into what's really going on."

The philosophy of science before Kuhn began writing was most influenced by Karl Popper. He put forth the popular notion of falsifiability, whereby all scientific theories are tenable only if they are falsifiable, and theories can only be proven wrong with evidence that falsifies it. Kuhn says that that’s not how science works and it’s certainly not how scientists operate. Kuhn put everything in terms of paradigms—the phrase paradigm shift was made popular by this work. And the paradigm is what is supposed to be the method by which scientists make discoveries about the world. Before I delve into this, I have to say that I am conflicted about all the ideas that Kuhn propounds in this seminal work. I have commitments to other opinions I hold (especially having to do with the divide between religion and science). Out of a reaction to many religious apologetic positions, I have placed strong conviction in my views regarding scientific inquiry and formations of beliefs. In my discovery of the limitations of our ideas and ability to obtain knowledge, I feel a part of me tug away from it because of what it might imply regarding all the debates regarding God and apologetics. A common apologetic move is to capitalize upon our limitations on knowledge in order to motivate the view that a God exists. As what happened with the logical positivists, many have overreacted to preponderance of sloppy theism in society and overstepped their bounds and placed too much conviction in our ability to come to knowledge and the capacity for science to make meaningful discoveries. I’m not sure if this is what is pulling me away from Kuhn’s ideas, for Kuhn certainly places science in a much different light than we all have been taught. But, it is crucially important to keep in mind our biases, like the one that I have laid out for myself, while analyzing Kuhn’s ideas.Setting aside any implications about the theist, atheist debacle (which is unfortunately unavoidable while discussing anything about science and scientific discoveries), I will try to give an account of Kuhn’s ideas, as I understand them to be.The traditional view of science—see Karl Popper’s writings on the scientific method—is that scientists gather individual pieces of data from the natural world and when there is a sufficient amount of pieces of data, we can draw inferences about the relation between individual pieces of data. These inferences we draw about the world become hypotheses about the nature of the relation between these pieces of data—(a set of objects fall towards the ground, the scientist notices that all objects act in this way, then she posits the most likely explanation to account for this related set of phenomenon). Each hypothesis is accepted or rejected based on its ability to account for greater or lesser amounts of other pieces of data. Of course, we take falling objects to be under the influence of gravity, but Aristotle had a much different account of what was occurring when objects fell towards the ground. But after people discovered enough conflicting data that contradicted Aristotle’s theories, they were overturned and more robust theories took their place. This depicts science as a continual reformulation of theories to fit an ever-expanding knowledge base. It depicts science as slowly progressing towards the truth as it accumulates new pieces of data which are considered in light of the currently-held theories. In order for the theory to be tenable, it must be the best interpretation (the interpretation that makes the least amount of assumptions) which justifies the evidence. And all it takes is for a single piece of evidence to overthrow that theory and that theory will no longer be considered a tenable one.  However, Kuhn doesn't think this is how scientists really operate. While it's true that old theories do get over-turned by new evidence, it is a slow and gradual process, and it comes with great resistance from scientists working in their respective fields.When people used to believe in geocentricism, there were a great number of problems that came about as a result of this hypothesis. One of the many problems was the retrograde motion of the planets: http://www.scienceu.com/observatory/a.... When scientists began calculating the movement of the planets, they noticed that as a planet moved across the night sky, it moved backwards during a part of the year, then forward during another. But if the earth was in the middle of the solar system, why would planets move across the night sky, then seemingly move backwards in their orbits? In order to account for a geocentric universe and the retrograde motion of the planets, the astronomer Ptolemy posited what were called epicycles. Epicycles were the hypothetical orbit patterns of planets that accounted for the retrograde motion of the planets. The planets orbited around points which in turn followed the path of orbit around the earth. These were generally considered to be false, and the scientists who came later made fun of the Ptolemaics who believed in it. According to the classical view of science, Ptolemy was simply wrong with his epicycle hypothesis and as scientists amassed greater amounts of evidence, the hypothesis was rendered obsolete with the discovery of the fact that the earth is not the center of the universe. Kuhn uses an example like this to motivate his critique of the traditional view of scientific practice and inquiry, re Popper and falsification. Kuhn points to examples of how scientists have tried to cram new data into pre-existing theories. Scientists try to account for new data by forcing them to fit with background assumptions and they do not use these new pieces of data to overthrow those background assumptions which may be suspect. For Kuhn, scientists aren’t in the business of trying to falsify their own hypotheses. Instead, scientists work within what Kuhn calls a paradigm. A paradigm is essentially a backdrop set of assumptions and biases which inform everything about discoveries in science and the formation of hypotheses about the world. Instead of science being this thing which accumulates facts, Kuhn says that “normal” science—what we usually think of when talking about science—is merely “filling in the details” after a paradigm has been put in place.  Kuhn challenges our conception of progress in science: he calls a shift in paradigms, a revolution in science: when a set of theories and hypotheses come along that radically change the ways we view the world (the Copernican revolution, Einstein’s theory of relativity, quantum mechanics, etc.), it radically changes the way scientists conduct experiments, devise test implications and form hypotheses. The only type of “progress” for Kuhn, is drawing out the full implications of a certain paradigm once it’s been established. Given enough time, the full implication of the paradigm will be realized, and the limits of the paradigm will become known to scientists working in their respective fields. This is the process that Kuhn calls “normal science” and it is the science as we know it. This is the process of gathering facts to build hypotheses that explain phenomena in the world. But it is all done within a framework, within that background set of assumptions that constitute the paradigm. Most scientists will agree that one of the marks of a robust theory is if it fits with knowledge that we’ve already acquired. If, for instance, we are presented with a hypothesis that seems to contradict the theory of gravity, we have good reason to be suspicious of it, and to not believe it. So, instead of challenging the notion of gravity (which is often taken to be absolutely true), we find ways to either reassess the data or reformulate our experiment. This is one of the ways in which we work within the confines of the paradigm. However, if there comes to be enough conflicting evidence with a strongly-held theory, it might be cause to shift the paradigm. Once enough problems pile up for a certain paradigm, it will be rejected in favor of another paradigm. When enough evidence piles up against a certain set of assumptions it will be completely overturned.  Each paradigm has its limits as far as how much each paradigm can accurately account for phenomena in the natural world. Eventually after scientists have filled in the details of a given paradigm, they will discover all the problems and limitations of the paradigm and overthrow it in favor a new one. And each one is a merely a way of understanding the universe, not the way of understanding it. In this way, Kuhn does not believe that science can arrive at one absolute truth, one absolute fact of the matter when it comes to understanding the universe; nature, as he says, is far to complex and nuanced to ever be captured by the tools available to human thought and understanding. Kuhn is not necessarily out to disparage science, or make it seem illogical. He, in fact, thinks that it is remarkable that science has the ability to do this: fundamentally change the set of assumptions that inform the theories within it. It is this ability that gives science the edge on dogmatic beliefs, which remain inflexible and unchanging despite contrary evidence. And for Kuhn, the paradigm is an essential aspect to collecting information. Pre-paradigm science is merely “random fact collecting”. And this seems to make some sense. Without a set of tools for interpretation, it’s difficult to make sense of any specific thing. Even in our daily experience of the world, we are in a constant state of directly perceiving things and concurrently stringing that thing through with significance by virtue of a set of assumptions that inform our interpretation of it.In this sense, Kuhn is attacking the direct realist notion that we experience objects in the world directly and exactly as they are. Much of Kuhn’s ideas, while never made explicit in the text, stem out of this notion which goes back as far as Descartes, and his skepticism of knowledge based on the senses. Descartes laid the foundation for thinkers like Kant, who tried to describe the process involved with our understanding and its interaction with experience in the world. What’s most important about the whole discussion is the idea that we do not experience the world as it is, but rather, we process information about the outside world via a filter which informs the beliefs we construct out of sense experience.  Kuhn is working in this same vein by illustrating that the paradigm is part of this filter between us and world which informs all the biases and assumptions in the process of collecting data and making sense of it. Although Kant believed that this filter gave rise to a single “paradigm” or way of understanding the world and forming beliefs, Kuhn says that the features of the paradigm has changed throughout history as we’ve found new ways of conceiving of the universe. And through these different ways of viewing the world, we have formulated vastly different theories about the universe. What Kuhn is propounding here, is a type of belief holism, which depict ideas as coming in large chunks, or part of a net of interrelated connections, and all of which is informed by a set of assumptions that underly each idea. Belief atomism, by contrast, might depict our ideas in a direct realist sense, i.e. we have direct access to objects of the universe, in and of themselves, thus we can pull apart and dissect each idea on its own without any worry that it is part of some interconnected whole. A good way of grasping what Kuhn is after with “paradigms” and his brand of belief holism is to analyze examples from the history of scientific discoveries. A set of examples which illustrates this pretty clearly are two conceptions of projectile motion. This is the phenomena of throwing an object across a room, and when the object leaves your hand, it continues to move, despite the fact that the thing moving it (your hand) is no longer in contact with the object. This was quite the conundrum for many thinkers and scientists in the past. And to fully explain what projectile motion meant to someone like Aristotle, as opposed to Newton, will take a good amount of set-up, as both of their conceptions of what is going on, is deeply-seated in their ideas about the metaphysics of the universe. But after explaining how both came to understand this phenomenon, it might make sense of the belief holist position that Kuhn thinks underlies all scientific inquiry.So, for Aristotle, all things were composed of earth, air, water, fire and aether. And each one of these elements had its “place” in the universe. Space is subordinate to place, in that all of matter was subject to the place in which it belonged, and all things were working towards the end goal of getting to the place it belonged. This made Aristotle’s depiction of the universe teleological, goal oriented. He viewed the universe as a thing, biological which worked towards an end goal (like an acorn growing into a tree). All of matter functioned in this way, moving towards its final end goal. Aristotle figured that since most earth was beneath us, the “place” that earth belonged was towards the center of the universe.   Thus, when you pull something off the earth, its tendency is to fall back down to the ground. Without a concept like gravity and all the physics associated with it, this gave a fairly plausible explanation of that phenomenon. But this left a real puzzle: projectile motion. How could an object containing earth continue to move forward if its fundamental tendency was towards the ground? What is it that keeps it in the air? Aristotle posited a thing called “antiperistasis” which kept the earth particles in the air for an extended period of time before touching the ground. Notice how “antiperistasis” doesn’t make much sense without first having given a background sketch of Aristotle’s other beliefs about the world. Kuhn would have it that it’s impossible to talk about this concept in and of itself without understanding all the other peripheral ideas that inform the meaning of it.Newton, by contrast, introduced much of what our modern conception of the universe tells us: objects continue to move in straight-line motion until acted upon by outside forces. This is the principle of inertia. Newton postulated that if there were only one object in the universe that it would continue to be moving forward ad infinitum . In fact, there is no fundamental difference between moving and staying still in the Newtonian picture of inertia. This is because it only makes sense to say that something is moving relative to another object. If there are two objects in the universe, object A and object B, and oA moves past oB we can only definitively say that oA moves a certain direction relative to our reference frame of oB. The upshot of this is Newton’s first law of motion. This means that an object’s tendency is to always move in straight-line motion until it's effected by some other force in the universe. Take the ball flying out of my hand. The ball’s natural tendency is to move in a straight-line, but the ball falls back to the ground because of the force of gravity acting upon the inertial motion of the ball. Kuhn says that there’s no real answer to the question “who’s account of projectile motion is better, Aristotle or Newton’s?” because they both are coming from radically different paradigms which make such fundamentally different assumptions about the universe that there are, to use Kuhnian language, incommensurable, i.e. they just can not be compared. Kuhn believes that no paradigm will ever be able to capture the capital ‘t’ truth about the universe, that the universe is far too complex and multifaceted to ever be captured by any given paradigm. Some paradigms can better account for the available evidence, offer more cogent explanations of the universe and some can have far greater explanatory power than others, but no paradigm will ever get to the absolute truth; this is something that Kuhn whole-heartily rejects. We can never attain the absolute truth because there will always be a filter through which we analyze and understand the universe, the filter being the limited capacity of our senses and our capacity for understanding. I think that at least some of what Kuhn says has to be right, and it seems to make a lot of sense out of different world-views and starkly different viewpoints: many positions in science, politics, etc. really seem to be incommensurable with each other. A socialist feminist and a neo-con libertarian will most likely speak directly past one another as neither one will find any kind of common ground with which to communicate their ideas. It might be the same for the Aristotelian and the Newtonian. I’m still not sure however, if my own ability to write about their two positions counts as a counter-example against Kuhn or not. We still seem, despite our huge difference in opinions to communicate on some level, however much we may disagree with each other. "

Observation and experience can and must drastically restrict the range of admissible scientific belief, else there would be no science. But they cannot alone determine a particular body of such belief. An apparently arbitrary element, compounded of personal and historical accident, is always a formative ingredient of the beliefs espoused by a given scientific community at a given time.
This is one of those wonderfully rich classics, touching on many disparate fields and putting forward ideas that have become permanent fixtures of our mental furniture. Kuhn synthesizes insights from history, sociology, psychology, and philosophy into a novel conception of science—one which, despite seemingly nobody agreeing with it, has become remarkably influential. Indeed, this book made such an impact that the contemporary reader may have difficulty seeing why it was so controversial in the first place. Kuhn’s fundamental conception is of the paradigm. A paradigm is a research program that defines a discipline, perhaps briefly, perhaps for centuries. This is a not only a dominant theory, but a set of experimental methodologies, ontological commitments, and shared assumptions about standards of evidence and explanation. These paradigms usually trace their existence to a breakthrough work, such as Newton’s Principia or Lavoisier’s Elements; and they persist until the research program is thrown into crisis through stubborn anomalies (phenomena that cannot be accounted for within the theory). At this point a new paradigm may arise and replace the old one, such as the switch from Newton’s to Einstein’s system. Though Kuhn is often spoken of as responding to Popper, I believe his book is really aimed at undermining the old positivistic conception of science: where science consists of a body of verified statements, and discoveries and innovations cause this body of statements to gradually grow. What this view leaves out is the interconnection and interdependence between these beliefs, and the reciprocal relationship between theory and observation. Our background orients our vision, telling us where to look and what to look for; and we naturally do our best to integrate a new phenomenon into our preexisting web of beliefs. Thus we may extend, refine, and elaborate our vision of the world without undermining any of our fundamental theories. This is what Kuhn describes as “normal science.” During a period of “normal science” it may be true that scientific knowledge gradually accumulates. But when the dominant paradigm reaches a crisis, and the community finds itself unable to accommodate certain persistent observations, a new paradigm may take over. This cannot be described as a mere quantitative increase in knowledge, but is a qualitative shift in vision. New terms are introduced, older ones redefined; previous discoveries are reinterpreted and given a new meaning; and in general the web of connections between facts and theories is expanded and rearranged. This is Kuhn’s famous “paradigm shift.” And since the new paradigm so reorients our vision, it will be impossible to directly compare it with the older one; it will be as if practitioners from the two paradigms speak different languages or inhabit different worlds.  This scandalized some, and delighted others, and for the same reason: that Kuhn seemed to be arguing that scientific knowledge is socially solipsistic. That is to say that scientific “truth” was only true because it was given credence by the scientific community. Thus no paradigm can be said to be objectively “better” than another, and science cannot be said to really “advance.” Science was reduced to a series of fashionable ideas. Scientists were understandably peeved by the notion, and social scientists concomitantly delighted, since it meant their discipline was at the crux of scientific knowledge. But Kuhn repeatedly denied being a relativist, and I think the text bears him out. It must be said, however, that Kuhn does not guard against this relativistic interpretation of his work as much as, in retrospect, he should have. I believe this was because Kuhn’s primary aim was to undermine the positivistic, gradualist account of science—which was fairly universally held in the past—and not to replace it with a fully worked-out theory of scientific progress himself. (And this is ironic since Kuhn himself argues that an old paradigm is never abandoned until a new paradigm takes its place.) Though Kuhn does say a good deal about this, I think he could have emphasized more strongly the ways that paradigms contribute positively to reliable scientific knowledge. For we simply cannot look on the world as neutral observers; and even if we could, we would not be any the wiser for it. The very process of learning involves limiting possibilities. This is literally what happens to our brains as we grow up: the confused mass of neural connections is pruned, leaving only the ones which have proven useful in our environment. If our brains did not quickly and efficiently analyze environmental stimuli into familiar categories, we could hardly survive a day. The world would be a swirling, jumbled chaos. Reducing ambiguities is so important to our survival that I think one of the primary functions of human culture is to further eliminate possibilities. For humans, being born with considerable behavioral flexibility, must learn to become inflexible, so to speak, in order to live effectively in a group. All communication presupposes a large degree of agreement within members of a community; and since we are born lacking this, we must be taught fairly rigid sets of assumptions in order to create the necessary accord. In science this process is performed in a much more formalized way, but nevertheless its end is the same: to allow communication and cooperation via a shared language and a shared view of the world.  Yet this is no argument for epistemological relativism, any more than the existence of incompatible moral systems is an argument for moral relativism. While people commonly call themselves cultural relativists when it comes to morals, few people are really willing to argue that, say, unprovoked violence is morally praiseworthy in certain situations. What people mean by calling themselves relativists is that they are pluralists: they acknowledge that incompatible social arrangements can nevertheless be equally ethical. Whether a society has private property or holds everything in common, whether it is monogamous or polygamous, whether burping is considered polite or rude—these may vary, and yet create coherent, mutually incompatible, ethical systems. Furthermore, acknowledging the possibility of equally valid ethical systems also does not rule out the possibility of moral progress, as any given ethical system may contain flaws (such as refusing to respect certain categories of people) that can be corrected over time. I believe that Kuhn would argue that scientific cultures may be thought of in the same pluralistic way: paradigms can be improved, and incompatible paradigms can nevertheless both have some validity. Acknowledging this does not force one to abandon the concept of “knowledge,” any more than acknowledging cultural differences in etiquette forces one to abandon the concept of “politeness.”  Thus accepting Kuhn’s position does not force one to embrace epistemological relativism—or, at least not the strong variety, which reduces knowledge merely to widespread belief. I would go further, and argue that Kuhn’s account of science—or at least elements of his account—can be made to articulate even with the system of his reputed nemesis, Karl Popper. For both conceptions have the scientist beginning, not with observations and facts, but with certain arbitrary assumptions and expectations. This may sound unpromising; but these assumptions and expectations, by orienting our vision, allow us to realize when we are mistaken, and to revise our theories. The Baconian inductivist or the logical positivist, by beginning with an raw mass of data, has little idea how to make sense of it and thus no basis upon which to judge whether an observation is anomalous or not.  This is not where the resemblance ends. According to both Kuhn and Popper (though the former is describing while the second is prescribing), when we are revising our theories we should if possible modify or discard the least fundamental part, while leaving the underlying paradigm unchanged. This is Kuhn's ""normal science."" So when irregularities were observed in Uranus’ orbit, the scientists could have either discarded Newton’s theories (fundamental to the discipline) or the theory that Uranus was the furthest planet in the solar system (a superficial fact); obviously the latter was preferable, and this led to the discovery of Neptune. Science could not survive if scientists too willingly overturned the discoveries and theories of their discipline. A certain amount of stubbornness is a virtue in learning. Obviously, the two thinkers also disagree about much. One issue is whether two paradigms can be directly compared or definitively tested. Popper envisions conclusive experiments whose outcome can unambiguously decide whether one paradigm or another is to be preferred. There are some difficulties to this view, however, which Kuhn points out. One is that different paradigms may attach very different importance to certain phenomena. Thus for Galileo (to use Kuhn’s example) a pendulum is a prime exemplar of motion, while to an Aristotelian a pendulum is a highly complex secondary phenomenon, unfit to demonstrate the fundamental properties of motion. Another difficulty in comparing theories is that terms may be defined differently. Einstein said that massive objects bend space, but Newtonian space is not a thing at all and so cannot be bent. Granting the difficulties of comparing different paradigms, I nevertheless think that Kuhn is mistaken in his insistence that they are as separate as two languages. I believe his argument rests, in part, on his conceiving of a paradigm as beginning with definitions of fundamental terms (such as “space” or “time”) which are circular (such as “time is that measured by clocks,” etc.); so that comparing two paradigms would be like comparing Euclidian and non-Euclidian geometry to see which is more “true,” though both are equally true to their own axioms (while mutually incompatible). Yet such terms in science do not merely define, but denote phenomena in our experience. Thus (to continue the example) while Euclidian and non-Euclidian geometries may both be equally valid according to their premises, they may not be equally valid according to how they describe our experience. Kuhn’s response to this would be, I believe, that we cannot have neutral experiences, but all our observations are already theory-laden. While this is true, it is also true that theory does not totally determine our vision; and clever experimenters can often, I believe, devise tests that can differentiate between paradigms to most practitioners’ satisfaction. Nevertheless, as both Kuhn and Popper would admit, the decision to abandon one theory for another can never be a wholly rational affair, since there is no way of telling whether the old paradigm could, with sufficient ingenuity, be made to accommodate the anomalous data; and in any case a strange phenomena can always be tabled as a perplexing but unimportant deviation for future researchers to tackle. This is how an Aristotelian would view Galileo’s pendulum, I believe. Yet this fact—that there can be no objective, fool-proof criteria for switching paradigms—is no reason to despair. We are not prophets; every decision we take involves risk that it will not pan out; and in this respect science is no different. What makes science special is not that it is purely rational or wholly objective, but that our guesses are systematically checked against our experience and debated within a community of dedicated inquirers. All knowledge contains an imaginative and thus an arbitrary element; but this does not mean that anything goes. To use a comparison, a painter working on a portrait will have to make innumerable little decisions during her work; and yet—provided the painter is working within a tradition that values literal realism—her work will be judged, not for the taste displayed, but for the perceived accuracy. Just so, science is not different from other cultural realms in lacking arbitrary elements, but in the shared values that determine how the final result is judged. I think that Kuhn would assent to this; and I think it was only the widespread belief that science was as objective, asocial, and unimaginative as a camera taking a photograph that led him to emphasize the social and arbitrary aspects of science so strongly. This is why, contrary to his expectations, so many people read his work as advocating total relativism. It should be said, however, that Kuhn’s position does alter how we normally think of “truth.” In this I also find him strikingly close to his reputed nemesis, Popper. For here is the Austrian philosopher on the quest for truth:Science never pursues the illusory aim of making its answers final, or even probable. Its advance is, rather, towards the infinite yet attainable aim of ever discovering new, deeper, and more general problems, and of subjecting its ever tentative answers to ever renewed and ever more rigorous tests.And here is what his American counterpart has to say:Later scientific theories are better than earlier ones for solving puzzles in the often quite different environments to which they are applied. That is not a relativist’s position, and it displays the sense in which I am a convinced believer in scientific progress.Here is another juxtaposition. Popper says: Science is not a system of certain, or well-established, statements; nor is it a system which steadily advances towards a state of finality. Our science is not knowledge (episteme): it can never claim to have attained truth, or even a substitute for it, such as probability. … We do not know: we can only guess. And our guesses are guided by the unscientific, the metaphysical (though biologically explicable) faith in laws, in regularities which we can uncover—discover.And Kuhn:One often hears that successive theories grow ever closer to, or approximate more and more closely to, the truth… Perhaps there is some other way of salvaging the notion of ‘truth’ for application to whole theories, but this one will not do. There is, I think, no theory-independent way to reconstruct phrases like ‘really there’; the notion of a match between the ontology of a theory and its ‘real’ counterpart in nature now seems to me illusive in principle.Though there are important differences, to me it is striking how similar their accounts of scientific progress are: the ever-increasing expansion of problems, or puzzles, that the scientist may investigate. And both thinkers are careful to point out that this expansion cannot be understood as an approach towards an ultimate “true” explanation of everything, and I think their reasons for saying so are related. For since Popper begins with theories, and Kuhn with paradigms—both of which stem from the imagination of scientists—their accounts of knowledge can never be wholly “objective,” but must contain an aforementioned arbitrary element. This necessarily leaves open the possibility that an incompatible theory may yet do an equal or better job in making sense of an observation, or that a heretofore undiscovered phenomenon may violate the theory. And this being so, we can never say that we have reached an “ultimate” explanation, where our theory can be taken as a perfect mirror of reality.I do not think this notion jeopardizes the scientific enterprise. To the contrary, I think that science is distinguished from older, metaphysical sorts of enquiry in that it is always open-ended, and makes no claim to possessing absolute “truth.” It is this very corrigibility of science that is its strength. This review has already gone on for far too long, and much of it has been spent riding my own hobby-horse without evaluating the book. Yet I think it is a testament to Kuhn’s work that it is still so rich and suggestive, even after many of its insights have been absorbed into the culture. Though I have tried to defend Kuhn from accusations of relativism or undermining science, anyone must admit that this book has many flaws. One is Kuhn’s firm line between “normal” science and paradigm shifts. In his model, the first consists of mere puzzle-solving while the second involves a radical break with the past. But I think experience does not bear out this hard dichotomy; discoveries and innovations may be revolutionary to different degrees, which I think undermines Kuhn’s picture of science evolving as a punctuated equilibrium. Another weakness of Kuhn’s work is that it does not do justice to the way that empirical discoveries may cause unanticipated theoretical revolutions. In his model, major theoretical innovations are the products of brilliant practitioners who see the field in a new way. But this does not accurately describe what happened when, say, DNA was discovered. Watson and Crick worked within the known chemical paradigm, and operated like proper Popperians in brainstorming and eliminating possibilities based on the evidence. And yet the discovery of DNA’s double helix, while not overturning any major theoretical paradigms, nevertheless had such far-reaching implications that it caused a revolution in the field. Kuhn has little to say about events like this, which shows that his model is overly simplistic. I must end here, after thrashing about ineffectually in multiple disciples in which I am not even the rankest amateur. What I hoped to re-capture in this review was the intellectual excitement I felt while reading this little volume. In somewhat dry (though not technical) academic prose, Kuhn caused a revolution still forceful enough to make me dizzy."
4,0226458083,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2447803-jason,3,"Remember your 10th grade Geometry class? It was a 55 minute class just before lunch. Picture yourself, 15 years old, Friday, ensconced in Geometry on a beautiful late September day. If you’re a girl, you’re much more interested in whether the new boy is going to sit with Amber during lunch for a third day in a row, and what he’s going to say to her this time; he’s so confident and handsome. If you’re a guy, you’re much more interested in the 17 year old Varsity cheerleader at the front of your class, in uniform, school particolors pleated in the skirt, which is caught in a chair rivet and pulling the material agonizingly close to the lace edge of her panty, which you hope is vivid monochrome pink. Now imagine your eremitic teacher with Asperger’s syndrome intruding on those daydreams with a methodical, laborious, sterile mathematical proof. At the chalkboard, in mind-numbing detail, in plodding repetition, with no class participation, the teacher steps through the proof which begins by repeating the same several transitive properties by which all geometric proofs begin. Despite the fantastic universe of 3-dimensional rotation and neato equations to find volume, geometry is rendered lifeless on the chalkboard by these relentless proofs.This, then, is the tone of The Structure of Scientific Revolutions--from beginning to end--by Thomas Kuhn. This is great material, just like geometry, but the narrative is like reading a proof that takes up 3 pages in your spiral notebook or Trapper Keeper. Kuhn received a B.S., an M.S., and a PhD in physics from Harvard U. As a Harvard Fellow, he experienced an epiphany, and changed his life focus to the philosophy of Science. He subsequently taught philosophy at Berkley and MIT. Kuhn does not lack credibility. His ideas are provocative. However, his writing lacks verve, vim and vigor. Like a geometry proof, and so characteristic of a mathematician, Kuhn belabors his points with structured, routinized precision that keeps the subject firmly grounded, and, as a result, narratively flat.There’s great, thoughtful, and comprehensive support for his thesis, but like a proof, he is so exact that each subsequent sentence restates about half of the previous sentence, and each subsequent paragraph reconsiders half the previous paragraph. Each subsequent chapter starts somewhat like, “as stated in the previous chapter we now know X, Y and Z; we can summarized X, Y and Z as &c, &c, &c; we can therefore move to the idea that &c, &c, &c.” Just like a mathematical proof--in gory detail. This non-fiction creeps along at parking lot speeds of 5 mph.But this is an instructive book nevertheless. It’s an essential 4- to 5-star read for mathematicians, physicists, and engineers--really any practitioners of the ‘hard’ sciences. Written in 1961, the scientific revolutions that Kuhn outlines are no less relevant today than at publication. He leans heavily on major revolutions of the past, conceding that sometimes several generations need to pass before the proper perspective can be achieved in science, or what Kuhn declares as ‘mature science.’ So, he defines, characterizes, and compares revolutions in math (Aristarchus, Newton, Descartes) and physics (Copernicus, Kepler, Planck, Einstein) and astronomy (Ptolemy, Brahe, Galileo) and motion (Aristotle, Archimedes) and electromagnetism (Franklin, Leyden, Coulumb, Joule) and chemistry (Lavoisier, Boyle, Dalton, Kelvin). It’s important for theoretical problem-solvers and lay practitioners alike to read in methodical detail what might seem at first intuitive, but over the course of 210 pages, develops into a compelling analysis of attributes that all scientific revolutions display, and, going forward, what attributes that future scientific revolutions might project.I'm not a scientist. 3 stars."

Watch this and then we can talk paradigms:http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ahg6qc...Now, I don’t normally do that – nor do I like to talk about optical illusions. I generally think illusions mean quite other things to what most people like to say they mean. I find that people tend to say the most boringly predictable things about optical illusions. That is a large part of the source of my aversion to them, like Pavlov’s dogs, I have been taught to cringe at the first sight of the drawing that is a witch/young woman or a rabbit/duck. And let’s not mention poor old Escher – if he only knew the bollocks that is spoken with one of his drawings Power Pointed onto a screen behind a hundred thousand ‘motivational’ speakers… Can it really be all that hard to understand that there are paradoxes involved when you represent a three-dimensional object in two-dimensional space? This really isn’t something of the deep psychological significance some people seem to think it is and it certainly doesn’t prove that we ‘all see things differently’ – in fact, given these are standard optical illusions ought to be enough to prove we all see the world more or less the same.What is interesting in the ‘watch the white team’ exercise above is that getting us to focus our attention on the white team means we miss entirely anything going on with the black team – even when one of the black team become a moon walking bear. A friend of mine was so convinced she could not miss something so obvious as a moonwalking bear that she thought somehow the computer knew she had already seen it and therefore always showed the version with the bear in it, at least after that very first time she watched it, which clearly had had no such thing.A lot of this book is about how people can look at the same thing and yet not see the same things. Kuhn’s says that there are two kinds of science – normal science, which you can think of by way of the lovely metaphor of accretion (facts get added to science in much the same way that layers of barnacles get added to a boat). And then there is revolutionary science – when all of the world changes, when no further facts may have been added, but all is different anyway: as when Copernicus placed the sun in the middle of the solar system or Einstein curved space to explain gravity. Notice that both normal and revolutionary science imply progress. For Kuhn the difference between the two types of science isn’t ‘progress’ – all science is about that – but about the mental framework from within which we work when we are doing one or the other. Mostly, and most scientists, do ‘normal science’ most of the time.Sometimes people put out books with titles like ‘the 101 words or ideas you need to know to be considered scientifically aware’ – Kuhn’s idea of paradigm shifts would pretty well have make it onto one of those list like books: alongside the Turing test, Mr Schrodinger's cat and the uncertainty principle, I guess. A paradigm is a fundamental way of viewing the world. It is more than a theory, but literally a way of understanding. Better to think of it on the scale of a worldview – Dawkins and Creationists have separate paradigms. A lot of this comes from Kantian philosophy – and if I was to blame anyone for Kuhn, Kant would be the person I would turn to. Kant said that we can not know the world as it is in-itself. We can only understand the world as humans, with our limited human faculties. Is the ‘human’ way of understanding the world how the world should be understood? For Kant that question doesn’t really make sense (how would we ever know otherwise?) This is the subjectivism of Kantian philosophy – we might not know the world as it is in itself (how it is objectively) but we can come to understand the world partially and subjectively through our limited and even potentially distorting senses (was that a witch or a pretty young woman you drew for me?)Now, this is where people go off half-cocked and say that there is no meaning in the universe and that all that exists is our interpretation - the glorious appeal of solipsism to undergraduate philosophy students (with our thoughts we make the world) and other such nonsense. When I first read Kuhn I assumed that this was, fundamentally or finally, what he was saying. I still think subjectivism is large part of what he is saying (despite his spending pages and pages in the postscript trying to convince me otherwise), but I don't think he is saying either that the world outside our senses does not exist or that the universe is fundamentally meaningless.The best way to understand a paradigm shift is to work through an example of one. Perhaps an equally good way is to think about how your view of the world changed once you stopped counting passes made by the white team and noticed the dancing bear.Before Copernicus, people thought the earth was at the centre of the universe. Everything else revolved around us: the stars, the planets, the moon. After Copernicus the earth went from the centre of the universe to a place infinitely less significant, just another lump of rock forever falling towards a third-rate star and forever missing it around and around again. The change in perspective involved in this change of view can only be described as a revolution – not only in how we understood how the heavens work, but also how society worked when Copernicus was alive and how religion worked and so much else as well. The previous paradigm of science, one fitting epicycles into the orbits to account for odd observations like the backward progressions of planets, for example, suddenly seemed no longer necessary to people who accepted the new world view. But then, the problem was that not only were epicycles no long necessary, but perhaps neither were the strict Medieval social structures of kings and bishops and barons and peasants each in their separate and fixed spheres.Kuhn asks if two people (one holding the Ptolemaic view of the heavens and the other the Copernican) were to sit down beside an open fire with a glass of wine to chat about the skies, would they actually be talking about the same things? His answer is that what they would have to say to each other would be incommensurable. That is, what they would say might as well be said in two different and untranslatable languages.For example – to the Ptolemaic astronomer the sun is another, though special, planet – the word planet is from Greek and means wanderer. To the old astronomy the sun wanders across the sky and so is a planet. To the Copernican the sun is fixed and the planets and comets move around it. So, when they talk each to the other about the sun are they really talking about the same thing? Kahn says that in a sense they are - and this is how he tries to escape the charge of subjectivism – but that this is only true in that the light from the sun falls upon both observers equally. However, in looking at the sun from their separate paradigms it is hardly surprising they seem to be talking across each other, at cross purposes and worse, when they try to describe what they see.Our choice of paradigm is not simply a matter of us matching our theories to the world with increasing precision. Firstly, it took a very long time for the Copernican system to show itself superior to the Ptolemaic in predicting where planets and stars might be at any given time. You have to remember that placing the sun at the centre was only part of the solution – we also needed to understand that the orbits weren’t perfect circles and so much else struggled and teased from the heavens by Galileo, Kepler, Newton and others. Kuhn argues that the difference between how successfully the Copernican view made predictions over the Ptolemaic wasn’t really the thing that tipped things in its favour. But rather other criteria, like overall ‘simplicity’ of the theory and its ‘beauty’ where at least as important.Paradigm shifts are not important for the old questions they help to answer, but rather for the new questions they allow us to ask. They allow us to go back to normal science, but now in a way that directs our attention away from counting basketball passes and toward the moondancing bear.I think I was probably harder on Kuhn when I first read him than I am now. However, I still think incommensurable is far too strong a word. I think people can understand and still disagree – and that this isn’t really about misunderstanding. Sometimes we disagree because we understand too well.And I do think Kantian subjectivity is a large part of Kuhn’s theory and, in fact, that Kuhn goes even further than Kant did (at least Kant believed all humans had the same faculties, and therefore all saw the world in much the same way – Kuhn certainly does not agree with that).The other problem I have with this theory is that I constantly come back to the ‘so what’ test. I think it would be very hard to argue that we don’t see the world differently post-Einstein than we did under the classical world view of Newton. And that such a shift in perspective could not be anticipated prior to the shift and that those pre and post shift do see the world in quite different ways – but who could really argue otherwise? Newton’s absolute space and Einstein’s curved spacetime are like night and day in many ways. But even Newton knew there was a hole a mile wide in his theory of the universe. Not having any idea of what gravity was and only being able to describe how it worked annoyed him all of his life. Gravity could not be explained by Newtonian physics – so if there was ever to be an explanation then something had to change.Books like 13 Things That Don't Make Sense, I think, put this book into a new perspective. We are much more likely to hope for paradigm changes today, I think. For example, people both hope for evidence in support of and against string theory – one way or another, a new paradigm will be born. And what if we never find the Higgs Boson? The standard model will suddenly become somewhat non-standard. I think the current groping for new paradigms, particularly in physics, is interesting and quite different from what I take to be the meaning of Kuhn’s theory. To Kuhn, all science is normative – perhaps today that is less true of the outer limits of physics where quarks meet strings.The other ‘so what test’ is to ask if scientists on the ground use Kuhn’s theory as a why to help them either do normal science or map a path towards or through scientific revolutions? I would suspect this would be more likely to be the case in the social sciences – perhaps where notions like paradigm shifts really do mean something much more akin to worldviews. All the same, most of what I have read of science and scientists is that they are not terribly interested in philosophy (at least, those who are not outright contemptuous of it).Paradigm shifts, according to Kuhn, are for the young and often only succeed when the dead have died off. That is, paradigm shifts are for those not too deeply indoctrinated in the old paradigm. I think this is less true today – you don’t need to be a child any longer to win a Nobel Prize; in fact, the average age of winners increased throughout the whole of last century.The kinds of people who show optical illusions as part of their endlessly boring Power Point presentations are also the kinds of people who talk about paradigm shifts and quantum leaps. In science these phrases mean pretty well the exact opposite to what they generally mean in general chitchat. A quantum leap isn’t an earth shattering leap forward, but about the smallest change in state possible – a paradigm shift is closer in meaning to what is generally implied by quantum leap, a complete change in your view of the universe. Mostly, the kinds of people who talk of paradigm shifts, mean something as significant as a new wrapper on a chocolate bar. So, it is not only poor Mr Escher we need to consider being unintentionally abused by the ignorance of PowerPoint Presenters, but poor old Kuhn too."
6,0226458083,http://goodreads.com/user/show/68583290-jamie,4,"When this book came out fifty years ago it changed the terms of the debate about what scientific progress meant. Using multiple historical examples, and drawing on his own extensive research into the history of science, Thomas Kuhn developed an intellectual framework for how science develops, progresses, and changes in response to new paradigms. At the time of his writing the word paradigm was obscure and unknown to most readers, but it has since entered our common vocabulary, and this book is where the phrase “paradigm shift” comes from.Science starts with chaos, with multiple competing theories, each answering different but related questions, none of them providing a focal point for explaining a broad range of phenomena or predicting the outcome of future experiments. Then comes a breakthrough, such as Copernican cosmology, Newtonian mechanics, or John Dalton’s atomic theory of chemistry. Importantly, the new understanding does not answer all the questions within its purview (no theory ever encompasses one hundred percent of possible situations), but it is sufficiently complete and broadly explanatory enough to serve as a theoretical framework on which to build. Some scientists embrace it right away, some are gradually convinced of its appropriateness, and some never come around to the new way of thinking. The author quotes Max Plank who, “surveying his own career, sadly remarked that ‘a new scientific truth does not triumph by convincing its opponents and making them see the light, but rather because its opponents eventually die, and a new generation grows up that is familiar with it’”. (150)Then starts the era of normal science, where students are taught the new approach, experiments are conducted which further solidify its position, expand its use, and answer previously unanswerable questions. Kuhn points out two important aspects of this. First, the questions the new paradigm answers are generally applicable only within the new framework. The previous theories answered different questions, and their answers were not necessarily wrong, just inapplicable in the new system, so some things of value from the older understanding were lost. Second, teachers teach and students learn the new way of thinking, which sets boundaries on the kinds of questions they ask, the experiments they perform, and the way they interpret the results. They are not taught to question the paradigm or perform experiments which might invalidate it, so progress, while valuable, stays within the constraints of what is considered possible and appropriate.Eventually gaps are found in the prevailing paradigm and experiments to try to address them only confirm their existence and turn up new problems. The Ptolemaic system was adequate for predicting the positions of stars and planets, but it was never precise. Copernican astronomy was better but still not perfect; Einsteinian theories, accounting for relativity, are even better, but there are always gaps between the predicted and the observed locations.At some point the issues become a major problem for scientists, and as doubts accumulate chaos starts to return as multiple new theories are put forward. Eventually one of them answers most of the questions and becomes the new generally accepted paradigm, and the process starts over again.The other term that this book brought into the common discourse is incommensurability, the idea that the holders of the current paradigms look at the world differently from those of previous paradigms, and many of the questions asked by one theory are out of scope for the others. This is important because we tend to think of science as a steady progression from ignorance to ever greater knowledge, but it is actually more of a step function. Young scientists are taught the current paradigm but the previous ones are thought to be of no importance, superseded by the “right way to do things.” As a result, for all the progress made, we lose something when we become unable to see the world through those different, older lenses of thought. Answers to some questions which seem unsolvable today might be found by looking at the data and asking different questions about it.This book is not casual reading. Kuhn writes in dense academic prose. For example, chapter five beginsTo discover the relation between rules, paradigms, and normal science, consider first how the historian isolates the particular loci of commitment that have just been described as accepted rules. Close historical investigation of a given specialty at a given time discloses a set of recurrent and quasi-standard illustrations of various theories in their conceptual, observational, and instrumental applications. (43)Nevertheless, this book repays a close reading. Since it first came out it has enjoyed a reputation as an essential reference for scientists and historians of science. It provides a way of thinking about the current state of science, and intriguing ideas about how to enhance and extend the art of the possible, to see the world in ways which are both new and old at the same time, and to answer questions that previously could not even be formulated."
7,0226458083,http://goodreads.com/user/show/41289357-maica,5,"I can understand why the author thanked his family for their consideration of the author's efforts towards this book, as it must have demanded a lot of painstaking effort not to mention time. I would have given it 3 stars for its complicated way of delivering its points; the language is highly complex that it tends at many certain points throughout, that the arguments contradict each other. Five stars, however for its complexity and taken as a whole it is actually coherent. 
Like the choice between competing political institutions, that between competing paradigms proves to be a choice between incompatible modes of community life.
-Thomas KuhnAccording to Thomas Kuhn, in science or fields of science, there is a particular paradigm that practitioners adhere to. However, this paradigm at specific points in history, encounter change brought about by new discoveries, anomalies or crises that can disprove it or demand that it be rejected or replaced. In this process, as what this book points out, there are resistances by scientists whether they will discard this paradigm or replace it - and thus, the phenomenon of Paradigm Shift will occur or whether practitioners will stubbornly cling to the original paradigm.
No wonder, then, that in the early stages of the development of any science different men confronting the same range of phenomena, but not usually all the same range of phenomena, describe and interpret them in different ways. What is surprising, and perhaps also unique in its degree to the fields we call science, is that such initial divergences should ever largely disappear. For they do disappear to a very considerable extent and then apparently once and for all. Furthermore, their disappearance is usually caused by the triumph of one of the pre-paradigm schools, which, because of its own characteristic beliefs and preconceptions, emphasized only some special part of the two sizable and inchoate pool of information.
This historical process is nuanced and subtle because scientists even though they are eager to discover new phenomena on their field or contribute something original - are prone to protecting that particular paradigm that they follow. But crises and anomalies do certainly have to occur and be encountered, thus earlier theories have the potential to be discarded or new theories modified in such a way as to reduce contradictions with earlier theories. 
For reasons that are both obvious and highly functional, science textbooks (and too many of the older histories of science) refer only to that part of the work of past scientists that can easily be viewed as contributions to the statement and solution of the texts' paradigm problems. Partly by selection and partly by distortion, the scientists of early ages are implicitly represented as having worked upon the same set of fixed problems and in accordance with the same set of fixed canons that the most recent revolution in scientific theory and method has made seem scientific.
The gradual process of resistance and/or acceptance is highly nuanced and complex, hence the nature of this book. The presentation of analyses of the author can also be the reason why the book received critical comments particularly by philosophers of science, for instance, there was a comment whether 'he believes in reality?' Towards the end part, there is also the question of the evolution of human knowledge, whether it has a telos or whether, as compared to Dawinian concept, it evolves by itself towards a certain progression of which the goal is unknown.
No theory ever solves all the puzzles with which it is confronted at a given time; nor are the solutions already achieved often perfect. On the contrary, it is just the incompleteness and imperfection of the existing data-theory fit that, at any given time, define many of the puzzles that characterize normal science. If any and every failure to fit were ground for theory rejection, all theories ought to be rejected at all times. On the other hand, if only severe failure to fit justifies theory rejection, then the Popperians will require some criterion of ""improbability"" or of ""degree of falsification"". In developing one they will almost certainly encounter the same network of difficulties that has haunted the advocates of the various probabilistic verification theories [that the evaluative theory cannot itself be legitimated without appeal to another evaluative theory, leading to regress].
He also contrasted his analyses with Karl Popper's method of falsification and demarcation of knowledge, and stated that this method as espoused by Popper, needs a certain criteria as where to base the falsification of theories, and what qualifies that criteria? Or if that criteria were to be stated, an infinite regress is inevitable. ""Truth"" is not the criterion of scientific knowledge, because it will have a tendency that once that ""Truth"" was discovered, that will mean the end of scientific search for knowledge - this is where Kuhn and Popper meet. However, whereas Kuhn would propose the concept of ""Paradigm Shift"" (he actually used the perceptual psychology concept of ""Gestalt"" in this sense), Popper proposed the method of falsification of scientific theories. Kuhn's concept can be regarded in the sense, that it is what actually happens in the enterprise of science (it is the actual event), but Popper's falsification even if it is used by practitioners remains an ideal method and the question arises, as to what specific criteria will that 'falsification' be based upon? That will have to be addressed, and I hope will be clarified on my reading of Karl Popper's ""The Logic of Scientific Discovery"" or ""Logik der Forschung"". Although both concepts by Kuhn and Popper appear to be antagonistic as written by critics, I'm looking forward that in a way, what they actually proposed as regards their method of inquiry and analysis are reconcilable."
8,0226458083,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1096417-tyler,1,"Within this book, a 15-page essay somehow gets crammed into 174 tedious pages and crowned by a lengthy 35-page postscript. In its chapters Kuhn, father of the expression “paradigm shift,” shows us how science advances in spasmodic fractures that shatter previous models of nature. But at 210 pages, mission creep sinks in.The book does more than propose a new model of scientific progress. It also tells us why other models are mistaken. Kuhn refutes the correspondence theory of truth, logical positivism, and falsification as arbiters of scientific progress. What’s left is a relativistic notion of science as one endeavor among many, a craft whose rules are decided by its practitioners with no particular reference to the outside world. A new paradigm, Kuhn tells us, gets scientists no closer to any external reality than its predecessor. I found the discussion of paradigm shifts less convincing than I had expected. But what really turned me off about this essay was its style. The author continually stresses that a “paradigm” may not be treated as pop culture. Expounding this aversion to popular science, Kuhn notes that scientists engaging in science writing for public consumption are no doubt on the downslopes of their careers. He then tortures the text as if to avoid his own judgment.  The author uses a public venue, a book for general publication, to address the scientific community in a professional capacity. But this book isn’t science. It’s history and philosophy as they apply to this field. The author nevertheless unpacks the theme as if were a kind of hard science, or at least an abstruse academic paper. Ignoring the scope that history and philosophy allow writers, the author's writing instead becomes dense, annoying, elitist and even rude. Kuhn's thesis doesn’t warrant such an attitude. His ideas are interesting, but his ponderous execution confuses bad table manners with succinct scholarship.	 "
9,0226458083,http://goodreads.com/user/show/814660-greg,4,"I first read Kuhn's book during my first year as a Ph.D. student, and found it rather interesting. It challenges notions of scientific progress as liner by suggesting instead a process of ""paradigm shift."" Essentially, Kuhn argues that researchers in a branch of science accept as normal a set of ""received beliefs"" that guide and bound their investigations into new phenomena. Because of this set of accepted beliefs and assumptions, new ways of looking at the world are often suppressed or ignored. Thus, even when presented with anomalous results, researchers often knowingly or unknowingly attempt to force-fit them to the preconceived structure they have embraced. This continues until a paradigm-busting shift occurs -- a scientific revolution -- that (generally abruptly) takes the field in a new direction. Understandably, not all scientific revolutions are successful in bringing about a paradigm shift. The ideas expressed in this book are provactive, even compelling, and have come back to me often in the 25 years since I read it in the form of questions and thoughts about potential paradigm shifts that may be overdue. It5 one that is worth reading for most people, and the scientific branches affected by it are not limited to the ""hard sciences."" Politics, psychology, sociology, cultural change, religious thought, and many other scientific domains can be profitably viewed through the lens of Kuhn's work. "
10,0226458083,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1884982-adam,5,"a response to some of the reviews here:From those giving the book a negative rating, we inevitably get the standard accusation of relativism, which is bullshit and Kuhn and his followers have responded appropriately. A positive three-star review says Kuhn's major thesis is that scientific progress is largely illusory, when Kuhn says nothing of the sort and has also defended himself against such objections in the past by explaining, very simply, what a careful reader would have already gleaned from reading this book [his actual point is related to the correspondence theory of truth; he argues that while we frequently hear that ""successive theories grow ever closer to, or approximate more and more closely to, the truth,"" that is often not the case; he says ""I do not doubt, for example, that Newton's mechanics improves on Aristotle's and that Einstein's improves on Newton's as instruments for puzzle-solving. But I can see in their succession no coherent direction of ontological development."" Kuhn has repeatedly both explicitly and implicitly identified himself as a firm believer in scientific progress]. Others here bemoan the length of the book, even though it is short. As a historian of science, Kuhn has the responsibility to be thorough and clear. Considering the subject matter, Kuhn is actually concise. Perhaps some of these readers are better off reading continental philosophy on science, wherein philosophers feel free to assert their theses without rigorous, well-constructed arguments. Kuhn's education was in Physics, but he is most assuredly a sophisticated philosopher, whose style is rooted in the analytic tradition. Kuhn's arguments are well-constructed, and he takes great care to address a substantial number of possible flaws in his own thinking, to back up his ideas with scientific history, to detail the nature of his thesis. Unfortunately, those who feel this was a 15 page essay with a lot of padding probably so badly mischaracterize Kuhn's position because of their presumptions. Kuhn does not waste a single sentence here, and there is nothing of insignificance. Perhaps more attentive readers would not strawman him and misrepresent his position. All this is not to say that Kuhn does not have his sophisticated critics, but it's frustrating to see so many comments here that are quite clearly nonsense. I don't say this because I'm a pompous jackass (although I am), I say this because of the sheer amount of misrepresentation and misinformation here.It's refreshing, however, to see that a number of fellow goodreads members, and not just I, think the applicability of this book's arguments is wide. "
11,0226458083,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4940476-leonard,5,"Thomas Kuhn, through the concept of paradigm shift, has demythologized science as an accumulation of knowledge through smooth progress. That, for Kuhn, is just normal science, the incremental progress within the limits, biases and assumptions of a paradigm. For him, a paradigm is a set of accepted practices within the scientific community, the scientific traditions the scientists have grown up with. For him, “The success of a paradigm… is at the start largely a promise of success discoverable in selected and still incomplete examples. And “Normal science consists in the actualization of that promise.” ...... Johannes Kepler and Isaac NewtonThough Thomas Kuhn focused on the Copernican Revolution, for me the Quantum Revolution is a more poignant example of paradigm shift. And the latter, like the former, starts with unexplainable phenomena. When the traditional electromagnetic theory of Maxwell’s Equations couldn’t explain black body radiation, Boltzmann and then Plank developed a set of equations with quantized energy levels to explain the phenomena. Later, Niels Bohr formulated the quantized levels of atoms to explain their discrete emissions.   Max Planck .... Niels Bohr .... Albert EinsteinAs Kuhn says, “When, in the development of a natural science, an individual or group first produces a synthesis able to attract most of the next generation’s practitioners, the older schools gradually disappear.” In this case, Bohr persuaded his colleagues about the new view and pushed quantum mechanics into the forefront, securing it as the dominant theory in modern physics. But there were oppositions. Even Einstein, who proposed the quantization of light, could not accept the probabilistic nature of matter-energy as described by the Uncertainty Principle. For him, “God does not play dice.”  .......  .. Erwin Shcrodinger Werner Heisenberg Richard FeynmanThe shift from Newtonian mechanics to quantum mechanics is a shift from a deterministic view of the universe to a probabilistic one, a change of beliefs and values. For Einstein and others, accepting quantum mechanics seemed like returning to the pre-scientific age, where a person, even a scientist, couldn’t quantify and analyze and predict natural events. When the way of doing science changes, so do the tools. Whereas calculus was the mathematical tool of Newtonian mechanics, statistics and transforms, Fourier or others, and the related group theories are those of quantum mechanics. And we know, even outside of science, that using different tools creates different results. Thomas KuhnFor Kuhn, “Paradigms may be prior to, more binding, and more complete than any set of rules for research that could be unequivocally abstracted from them.” So the preferences toward a deterministic worldview and the corresponding tools predisposed scientists to solve those problems with a well-defined solution. Motion under gravitational and electromagnetic forces in the macroscopic world. On the other hand, the preference toward a probabilistic worldview and the corresponding tools predispose scientists to focus on the uncertain boundaries between matter and energy, space and time, position and momentum, and energy and time. And so, “one of the things a scientific community acquires with a paradigm is a criterion for choosing problems that, while the paradigm is taken for granted, can be assumed to have solutions.” Following the Quantum Revolution, scientists developed quantum electrodynamics (QED) and quantum chromodynamics (QCD) through normal science. But when string and other theories begin to emerge, scientists must again reevaluate their models and even more importantly their practices and worldviews.Through The Structure of Scientific Revolutions, we begin to see scientific progress’s jagged path and appreciate the subjective parts of doing science. And instead of worshiping science, we take on the scientific mindset of observing phenomena and analyzing data and revealing biases and modifying models. "

Sixth ever perfect nonfiction rating: 'Structure' is not overrated at all.This is the scientific counterpart to the invaluable work of Alisdair MacIntyre in philosophy. Those works ('After Virtue', 'Whose Justice?', 'Three Rival Versions') are some of the most important for understanding the practice of philosophy and the seemingly-insurmountable aporiae in philosophy and ethics.Kuhn's work does the same for science, is extensible to many other disciplines, and is the only work I'm aware of that gives a partial, though plausible, set of criteria for distinguishing between science (which progresses *in regards to its ability to solve puzzles about nature* after consolidation in to one framework of practice per subspecialty, with other agreed-upon frameworks overarching) and everything else (e.g. philosophy, which doesn't seem to progress in a linear fashion, *because it has not found a paradigm* - those aforementioned aporiae - and is besotted with paradigmatically scientific definitions of progress). On the whole, Kuhn's sketched definition of science does more to solve the demarcation problem than any positivist or ((Popperian)) falsificationist accountMacIntyre throws light on Kuhn, Kuhn throws light on MacIntyre. A work by an atheist that may pave the way for my turn to a modified creationism (one which can account for the reality of human biodiversity and group differences unlike typical Hammian young-earth 'creation science': Cavalli-Sforza [in 'The History and Geography of the Human Genome'] estimates that major adaptations can occur in 2,000 years and full speciation in 40,000) from the teleological evolutionism I now believe, and which in any case makes that teleological evolutionism more secure than the adirectional - ironically, for Kuhn argues for a picture of scientific development that is as adirectional as the most consistent materialist picture of evolution as opposed to the received picture of an essentially teleological development."
13,0226458083,http://goodreads.com/user/show/16212136-peter-pete-mcloughlin,4, Kuhn hit on an interesting idea. Sometimes new discoveries lead to a foundational crisis. The foundation in an area of science come into question and that is when the view of the world changes. I don't think it is so much that science goes through periods of suppressing anomalies while it solves puzzles merely that some puzzles hit the bedrock of unexamined assumptions and revising assumptions can be a messy business. the Twentieth Century examples of Relativity and QM are foremost in the mind and maybe the foundational crisis of mathematics. It is not that the old stuff is thrown out I mean Newtonian Mechanics will still get you to the moon. It does affect are foundational worldviews but that is always a bit of an abstraction from day to day affairs. And revolutions in worldview are not always so messy as say the discovery of dark energy in the 1990s not much of suppression of anomalies in Type I supernova data and the acceptance of dark energy was a very easy switch.
14,0226458083,http://goodreads.com/user/show/974210-erik-graff,5,"Kuhn, a physicist and philosopher and historian of science, wrote The Structure of Scientific Revolutions in 1962, producing other editions until his death in 1996. The book was very influential (see description), serving as a starting point for reappraisals within several disciplines. One, psychology, was specifically covered by John Bannon's Philosophy of Psychology class held during the second semester of 1982/83 at Loyola University Chicago.I found the book profoundly stimulating, challenging as it did my rather naive understanding of the physical sciences, and went on to read another book which overtly applied Kuhn's analytic template to psychology."
15,0226458083,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1127767-coral,1,"Bit of a preface: I hated this book. It contains some really good ideas, which are totally worth discussing, but the whole thing is so much wordier and denser than it needs to be (this, coming from me!); seriously, the ideas put forth in this 200-page monstrosity would have been better shared in a 5-10 page article. Still, we were assigned to read it for LIS 2000, Understanding Information, and asked to write a 400-word review, describing ""how the content of this book relates to the information professions. Why do you think this is assigned reading?"" followed by a 250-word addendum, restating our opinion and describing how it had changed in reading the other students' essays, so I tried my best to get through it. Although I'm a little embarrassed to post this--and nervous that people who already took the class will say ""No! You are so wrong! You'll see!""--I still think it might be useful to do so. I can't change my answer now (or, well, not after 11pm--but I promise not to, now that I've made this public), so I'm curious what people who've been through this hazing ritualbook have to say.When we were assigned Thomas Kuhn's The Structure of Scientific Revolutions and asked to define its relevance to the information professions, I falsely assumed my professors were implying that our field is undergoing a ""paradigm shift."" Certainly, that argument can be made: With the Internet making information simultaneously more plentiful and harder to find, the effectiveness of distributed tagging and its effects on discussion of cataloguing, and the popularity of digital libraries and plans for automation thereof, nobody would seriously assert that our field is in any way stagnant or unchanging. On the other hand, paradigms point to fundamental thought patterns, and to suggest that our ""paradigm"" is in flux seems questionable: We still believe that information should be freely available to all, and we still strive to provide it in the best way available to us; that, I claim, is our true paradigm. That we have one at all shows the applicability of The Structure of Scientific Revolutions; certainly, we make assumptions about the world and about information, and we consider questions relevant or irrelevant based on those assumptions. Just as scientists are not the impartial observers that we are told they should be, we are not the impartial information providers that we would like to be.Although Kuhn has many interesting and widely applicable ideas, I do not agree that his is the best way to think about science and progress. Certainly, the book has its fans (London 2008), but I was pleased to see that I was not its only doubter: Weinberg (1998), for instance, disagrees with nearly all of Kuhn's central assertions. I do not go quite so far. As a scientist*, I believe that science, taken as a whole, does progress with time--to argue that our understanding of the universe today is not fuller than it was 200 years ago seems ludicrous--but we should be cautious in treating any one scientific finding or theory as ""progress,"" in and of itself: First, a scientist's paradigm and her puzzle-solving nature restrict what questions she considers asking (p. 37), and second, the explanations provided by a new theory or paradigm may not be any closer to truth than those of its predecessor (see discussion of opium, p. 104). I think the latter point also applies to the information professions: We may find that any one of the ""advancements"" we make is really a step back, hampering access to information.------With the help of my colleagues' reviews and Dr. Tomer's lecture, my views about Kuhn have changed over the last week. While I stand by my assertion that the information professions, like every field, have sets of accepted viewpoints (""paradigms"") at their foundation, I no longer contend that that is Kuhn's sole applicability. Information Science is, after all, not really a science. Rather, I believe that Kuhn's description of incremental advances--and of new paradigms overwriting, if you will, previous work--is relevant to us in our capacity as guardians and gatekeepers of knowledge. A Kuhnian view of progress requires us to remain both vigilant and flexible in our maintenance of the scientific knowledge base; we must catalog the day-to-day work of ""normal"" knowledge accumulation in every field, particularly science, but we must also be aware that the rules and accepted facts are subject to change. As such, we must struggle to provide the information that daily practitioners of the field will deem relevant, perhaps in addition to previous ""advances,"" or perhaps instead of them. I would add that I do not think we can expect to determine, entirely on our own, precisely which scientific information is worth keeping; as Kuhn says, people outside of a sub-field stand little chance of understanding the literature, and even people inside a field cannot predict with certainty which research direction will lead to a paradigm change. Rather, we should maintain a dialog with the experts and seek to improve our collections in collaboration with them. Kuhn, T.S. (1996). The Structure of Scientific Revolutions.

As scientific instruments and measurements improve, discrepancies appear between what is observed and what the current theory, or paradigm, predicts. As a result, the theory or paradigm must change, but some people resist it. The change from the geocentric model of Ptolemy to the helio-centric model of Copernicus is an example, as it the change from Aristotle to Newton to Einstein. As if we didn't already know that. This book is unbelievably wordy, self contradictory, pompous, and obscure. I absolutely hated it.

Kuhn puts forth a very interesting theory, and I think at least a few sections are very helpful when approaching the history of science. But it's certainly not a fun read, and much of the argument's density could have been fairly easily avoided. If you're a scientist, or have an interest in the philosophy or history of science, I'd recommend giving it a go. Otherwise, probably not.****I haven't re-read this book, but I do want to change my review - in large part because this is one of the books that I keep coming back to and thinking about over the years. I still think that there are some problems with it - and yikes, it is not a terribly pleasant read - but it's a really fascinating and thought-provoking work. It's really shaped the way I think about things, so I think it's worth a go even if you don't entirely agree with Kuhn's thesis."

19,0226458083,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3948872-laura,3,"I’ve seen citations to this book for decades, and it’s been on my shelf, unread-by-me, nearly as long. Finally read it. Kuhn contends that the then-accepted description of scientific process as a largely smooth increase in human knowledge isn’t accurate. Instead, it’s Hegelian-esque: an accepted model less and less satisfactory as more and more things are observed that do not fit; new models emerge and are resisted for reasons rational and not; and one fine day, the paradigm shifts. For reasons rational and not, a new model becomes accepted. Repeat, with variations. Reading it now, it’s a little unsatisfying. Yes, paradigms shift. Seen it happen. Some critical number of those in the relevant field of inquiry accept a paradigm, and there’s a new paradigm. Science, law, economics, whatever. I found myself in the odd position of explaining the gold standard, and what it means to have abandoned it, to a chum last Saturday. A paradigm shifted. In that, by a matter of decree, but still, only after some critical number of those in the relevant field accepted that a currency could be backed by the full faith and credit of the United States, and not just gold. Kuhn suggests that paradigms don’t just shift because the new one is better; society doesn’t operate that way. Social enthusiasm for an idea matters a lot. Apparently that pissed a lot of people off at the time, which again from 2012 seems a little silly. We’re not just rational actors. I know I’m not. I loved Kuhn’s illustration of that with Lord Kelvin denouncing X-rays as a hoax. He had a commitment to a certain understanding of how tests worked, and the fact that there could be X-rays messing up the procedures was unsettling. I’m sure he came around. I suspect I found the book somewhat unsatisfying because it’s central thesis – that we aren’t just rational; that progress is not slow and steady, and that the paradigm matters – is so well accepted that it’s hard to get excited about. Which is pleasingly meta, now that I come to think about it. "
20,0226458083,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3387843-celine,3,"Isn't it ironic that a book about paradigm shifts caused a paradigm shift in itself? And isn't it even more ironic that I'm studying this book from a humanities perspective, a science Kuhn himself might not even call a science?The Structure of Scientific Revolutions is a fascinating book because it works out, detail after tiny detail, how a scientific revolution takes place. One of the most interesting ideas Kuhn posits is that we can't compare two paradigms with each other (say, Newtonian physics and the theory of relativity), because they both encompass a different paradigm, and with that paradigm a different language and way of seeing the world. Kuhn's writing is terribly dry, and his book could have definitely been shorter. His examples can be repetitive; he often makes the same point two, three, four times throughout the course of the book. Structure isn't exactly light reading, but it contains some very interesting ideas about the nature of science and the nature of the progress of science. "
21,0226458083,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2658311-notgettingenough,3,I have made an update to my review in response to comments.http://alittleteaalittlechat.wordpres...
22,0226458083,http://goodreads.com/user/show/762235-marcus,5,"The premise of the book is that science doesn't progress by the cumulative addition of knowledge, but instead advances by major shifts in paradigms that replace, rather than increment, large parts of previous paradigms. To begin with, scientific research in a specific subject is carried out within the bounds of a generally accepted framework that defines what scientists already know about the field, as well as the questions that remain unanswered. This is what Kuhn calls a paradigm. A paradigm is useful because it defines puzzles that need to be solved and gives a set rules for them to be solved in. Over time, the paradigm is more fully explored and is broken down into smaller and more specific problems. To solve them, scientists develop specialized equipment and detailed experiments are carried out. Scientists experiment not to generate an unknown result, but with a hypothesis that has an expected result. The paradigm they're working under has helped them predict results and expect an answer.Eventually however, problems are discovered that can't be effectively solved within the rules of the paradigm. At first, these types of problems can be worked around by making adjustments in rules of the paradigm. Ultimately, as it is explored more deeply and the rules become more complex, a problem or problems arise that simply cannot be answered elegantly with the paradigm. As these difficult problems gain notice, they become recognized as the problems in most urgent need of a solution. When there is a big problem like this it can either be ignored until better equipment is available, made to fit by adjusting the current paradigm or, most interestingly, it can lead to the development of a new theory, or group of theories that attempt to solve the problem. As alternate competing theories are proposed to address the crises, eventually one gains enough traction among scientists to become the new paradigm. One of the examples used in the book is how Einstein's relativity became the paradigm that replaced Newtonian physics. What happened was not that Newtonian physics was found to be outdated and immediately replaced with the theory of relativity, in fact that theory is still useful within a large number of applications today. Instead, it was recognized that there is a very limited set of parameters in which Newtonian physics is accurate--specifically for calculating interactions between objects moving at relatively low velocities, but that outside those parameters, Newtonian physics will lead to incorrect assumptions. The theory of relativity solves the same problems that Newtonian physics does, but it also works with objects moving at high velocities. Rather than just building upon Newtonian physics incrementally, relativity supplanted large parts of it, even as scientists recognized that parts of Newtonian physics remain useful in certain contexts.To me, a non-scientist, rather than being controversial, this is a really useful way to think about science, and beyond science to how change and progress occur in almost any field. To a scientist, I can see how Kuhn's ideas are controversial. They mean that what scientists see and look for in observational and experimental data is not analyzed and recorded completely objectively but that scientists are heavily biased by what they believe and expect they're going to find. It 'accuses' scientists of viewing data and the experiments they choose to perform relatively, rather than objectively or positively (there is a long and hairy philosophical argument on relative knowledge that I will avoid getting into). Kuhn, rather than criticizing scientists for their subjective view on data, believes that viewing science this way is unavoidable, and in fact beneficial because it trains scientists to recognize patterns in data and to become adept with the data that they deal with. When a scientist is proficient at viewing data within the bounds of a paradigm, they are, in turn, well-prepared to view anomalies in the way their paradigm interprets data. This leads to the tough problems that are escalated to criseses in the paradigm and eventually, to the development of new paradigms."

25,0226458083,http://goodreads.com/user/show/60488672-william-liggett,5,"Who hasn't heard the term ""paradigm shift?"" Guess who introduced it into the popular lexicon? Thomas Kuhn was a philopher of science who retraced the history of many scientific discoveries, especially in physics. He demonstrated how the subjective worldview of the scientists led to their paradigms, or mental models, and ultimately supported a paradigm shift in a whole field like physics. Often major scientific discoveries are made by young outsiders who are not yet steeped in the worldview of an established scientific community with its textbooks and training. A good modern example are the students who derived ""chaos theory"" which departed from accepted physics in the late 20th century. Kuhn's theory sparked debate among those who saw science as purely objective vs. the notion that scientists' perceptions are often subjective—influenced by the paradigms they hold. It is informative to read Kuhn's original descriptions of paradigms to better understand why the concept has been adopted by so many fields ranging from the social sciences to business and education. "
26,0226458083,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2238273-oliver-bateman,5,"Yet another ""important"" book, one that advances a theory of ""paradigm shift"" to explain the transition between scientific worldviews (or transitions from pre-paradigm to paradigm worldviews, in the case of a coalescing field). Although written in an easy-to-understand way, Kuhn's presentation of this material--as evidenced by the somewhat defensive tone he adopts when responding to criticisms about his slipshod use of the term ""paradigm"" and his tendency to pass between descriptive and normative explanations of how science works (to which he replies, ""'is' and 'ought' are by no means always so separate as they have seemed"")--raises as many questions as it answers. His discussion of perception, in which he challenges the understanding that has prevailed since Descartes, is particularly confusing (in the postscript he refers to a ""computer program"" he is using to categorize ""intuitions"" of ""scientists,"" although he offers the reader no idea of how such a program would work); and his treatment of incommensurability isn't much better, although he at least admits for the possibility of ""translation"" (but it seems to me that ""translation"" isn't the issue during ""paradigm conflicts"" that occur in a given generation; rather, the problem lies elsewhere). Kuhn also advances the conventional wisdom about ""paradigms"" being shattered most frequently by ""young men"" (he states that this is almost self-evident, that ""extraordinary science"" is a young man's game), yet offers only a handful of examples as support for this claim. However, there are various excellent aspects of this work that bear mentioning: Section I (""A Role for History"") sketches a useful way of applying history in order to understand the development of knowledge; Section XI (""The Invisibility of Revolutions"") does a nice job of describing the problems with teaching history through science textbooks (and explains why the field is so singularly unaware of its past); and Section XIII (""Progress Through Revolutions"") offers a fine critique of others who believe that science is somehow ""different"" than other fields because it is ""getting better"" or ""working toward the truth."" That being written, I would recommend both Feyerabend's Against Method or the introductory essay in Foucault's The Order of Things in lieu of this work (although by all means read this book too, if you've got the time). Foucault's idea of the episteme--which looks at developments in various fields as a result of the ""epistemological unconscious"" of an era and does not rely for its foundation on a privileged definition of science (which Kuhn, coming from a background in physics, seeks to maintain: ""puzzle-solving"" is how he refers to ""normal science"")--is a much more cogent model of explanation. Foucault has also demonstrated the existence of connections among fields of knowledge (medicine, law, criminology, psychiatry, etc.) that Kuhn only hints at in Section XIII, and might, if pressed to mention them at all, even deem to be unrelated.

28,0226458083,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2531665-charlene,4,"Sometimes dry but an absolutely essential read for understanding how certain scientific paradigms remain stuck in place, despite new evidence that suggest a new paradigm should be adopted. Throughout history society and scientific communities themselves refused to allow the advancement of various new ideas that were supported by myriad evidence. Even Einstein, one of the biggest progressives in scientific history, could not accept the implications of his own theory. Other scientists were too invested in their fame (ie., Isaac Newton) to allow others to join the discussion and further our scientific knowledge. Today we have Richard Dawkins who actively tried to destroy the credibility of those working in fields like epigenetics, thus slowing the dissemination of knowledge throughout society.There are many reasons why scientists and nonscientist alike engage in denial of evidence. Kuhn looks at it in exquisite detail. When you are finished reading Kuhn, I suggest moving onto Michael ""Free Radicals,"" which looks at the same phenomenon Kuhn first brought to our attention."

30,0226458083,http://goodreads.com/user/show/60074558-xander,1,"What a terrible book! This is not my usual way to begin a review with, and certainly each author deserves a nuanced review of his or her works. But I simply can't believe that the author of The Copernican Revolutions (one of the best science books ever written!) is the same author that wrote The Structure of Scientific Revolutions. Maybe the comparison is unfair, since the Copernican Revolution is a book - in which Kuhn gives an exposition of astronomical developments, from ancient Greek astronomy to Newton's Principia - and The Structure of Scientific Revolutions is an essay. But then again, an essay of 170 pages with an additional postscript of 30 pages, is long enough to be criticized harshly, albeit fairly.Kuhn's main thoughts are easy to summarize: science begins - in broad outlines, exceptions are possible - with a pre-paradigm stage. During this stage, loose facts are gathered (like the Baconian conception of science) and no central structure of theory is present to interpret the facts. In short, it's data-gathering. Then, some bright mind enters the stage and thinks up a coherent and consistent piece of theory that places a clearly circumscribed set of facts in a certain perspective, a paradigm. This paradigm is some sort of selection criterion, which helps the scientist focus on interesting and relevant problems and leave the irrelevant ones alone. This paradigm, then, gradually develops into mainstream scientific consensus, until a new fact or body of facts - unexplainable within the current paradigm - is stumbled on. Then, scientists will try to adjust the main paradigm with all sorts of ad hoc explanations and the paradigm will crumble into dozens of unique versions. This is the moment of scientific revolution: a scientist (usually a young one) will offer a whole new paradigm that explains the old body of facts as well as the anomaly (which was the cause of the failure of the old paradigm).This new paradigm will not be adopted by the main body of scientists, who like to cling to their own pet theories, and the old paradigm (or the endless variations of the main paradigm) will die off with their respective promulgators. Young scientists will be schooled in the new paradigm, so the new paradigm gradually proceeds to become the new scientific consensus. Then, over time, new problems or anomalies pop up for the then-current paradigm and the process begins anew.This, in a nutshell is scientific development, according to Kuhn. Science proceeds from paradigm to paradigm. Though Kuhn's thesis sounds plausible at first, it seems to me that this is a problematic explanation of science. And for two reasons.1. Since science proceeds from paradigm to paradigm, and each paradigm is valid in its own respective way (i.e. related to its own circumscribes facts and problems), it follows that there is no such thing as scientific progress. This is a problem that Kuhn doesn't solve satisfactorily (or at all, but see point 2 beneath). In this sense, Newtonian mechanics is as true as the Einsteinian version. But this is not so. While Newton's mechanics is still being used for everyday problem-solving (such as sending rockets into space or calculating the trajectories of bullets), utility or usefulness isn't a criterion of truth, and in a very deep sense Newton's mechanics is incompatible with its Einsteinian competitor. Netwon's conception of mass (later extended with the law of conservation of mass) is that it is an absolute quantity: it's there and it cannot be annihilated. In other words: the total amount of mass in the universe alwys remains the same, even though it continuously changes its form. But Einstein showed us that mass is equivalent to energy (his famous e=mc2 formula); so mass can be annihilated - namely converted into pure energy - and vice versa. This is just one example that seems, to me at least, to counter Kuhn's claim that science doesn't progress but just hops from paradigm to paradigm. Newton's mechanics is derivable from Einstein's relativity theory, but it is, conceptually speaking, not Newtonian mechanics, since it is only part of a whole new framework. In that sense, there IS progress in science and there are reasons to believe that we are approaching the limits of our knowledge. The standard model/the hot big bang theory are almost universally accepted and physicists are currently trying to find a theory that comprises both quantum mechanics and general relativity (i.e. a 'theory of everything') that would apply to the very start of our universe. This would mean that science (at least from a cosmological point of view) is finished and we can begin with (what Kuhn so nicely calls) the mopping up: filling in all the blanks. But even from a more basic point of view we see scientific progress. Current scientific knowledge lets us control nature up to a point that is unheard of. So, at least from a utilitarian point of view, science has not only developped but also (and more importantly) progressed. 2. So how does Kuhn answer the above objection? Well, in the last chapter he claims that scientific development can be compared to evolution by natural selection. Paradigms are pitted against each other and the most fit survive. Since nature seems to proceed to ever increasing complexity and design (seems, this is not true, though), science proceeds accordingly. Kuhn seems to stumble into Paley's trap. Paley likened organisms to watches, and since watches have designers and organisms are just as designed as watches (i.e. adaptive complexity), they are designed as well. Therefore, God -as creator - exists. But this is teleology, the thought that there is some purpose to nature, some end-goal to obtain, some guiding principle according to which nature develops. This, of course, is bullshit - there is no evidence (at all) for a higher purpose, let alone a progress in natural history. Christopher Hitchens would label this thought as solipsism, and I can only agree with this wise man on that.I think the same objections apply to Kuhn's vision of science as evolution. The most fit paradigm will survive? Well, in Soviet Russia communist genetics survived - at the cost of scientific genetics (and millions of starved people) - so it isn't clear to me that 'fitness' in that sense has anything to do with truth.I would argue that science shows us that having illusions has (in some cases) benificent effects on human health and well being. It doesn't make these illuions true, though. The only rationale in science is the discovery of truth, and this has to be progressive, since we learn from our mistakes and move on to better theories. the method of trial-and-error lets us get ever closer to the truth - so in that sense there is progress (not just development). (This, by the way, is exactly what call Karl Popper sees as the growth of knowledge).So science can (and only then!) be regarded as evolutionary as long as truth is the criterion of fitness. But Kuhn clearly states, earlier in his essay, that paradigms follow each other - it's the natural process of science - and that each paradigm is true in its own particular sense. These two views are incommensurable (as Kuhn himself calls two conflicting paradigms). I think the history of science shows an ever increasing knowledge of and mastery over nature. This is a sign of progress: truth works. A last point - not really that strong an objection to Kuhn, but important nonetheless - is the fact that Kuhn's sociological view of science pretty soon leads to a view of radical relativism. If science is nothing but hopping from paradigm to paradigm, and if all paradigms are true within their own scope and limits, it follows that all paradigms - although incommensurable - are equally true. Therefore, absolute knowledge is impossible. It is not strange that many religious and/or postmodern people have used Kuhn as an argument against (mainstream) science).So to end this review: I cannot really recommend the book. Its content is flawed, and it is written in very dry and abstract language. Though it is 'only' 170 or so pages, it takes very long to proceed, mainly due to Kuhn's writing. And this is sad, since in The Copernican Revolution, his masterpiece, he shows he's a gifted and clear writer. Also, Kuhn uses a lot of historical examples to illustrate his main points, but one has to be familiar with these examples in order to get the gist. (Readers who are unfamiliar with concepts as 'phlogiston theory', 'lumineforous ether', etc. will have a hard time following Kuhn). "

Kuhn's writing is clear and well-reasoned, though I think that some of his points come in an odd order. Mostly, what made this book difficult to understand, at times, was the old examples from chemistry. Despite my years of chemistry education, I had never heard of phlogiston theory. Lots of googling of old physical and chemical beliefs was required. That said, once I understood his examples in terms of content they were remarkably clear in his particular application. No other book I have read within the scientific community looks as critically at the scientific process and mindset as this one did. "

The argument Kuhn develops of revolution in thought due to paradigmatic change seems to me to be something that has proliferated, because even in lay situations, I've run across a portion of these ideas before--I just didn't know from where they originated. Nor were they ever as developed as they are here. The takeaway from the book, for me, stretches far beyond the scientific community that Kuhn examines and seems personally applicable in my own experience. Tremendously thought provoking in all it's implications. "

35,0226458083,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1241339-clif,3,"Warning - this book is not light reading.I give the book only 3 stars because, not being a member of the scientific community, I have no way of judging the accuracy of the author's assertions.However, as a layman and an avid follower of science, what he has to say rings true.Kuhn claims that science is not cumulative, that is it isn't a simple tower of knowledge with each level built upon and adding to the earlier levels. Rather, science is practiced and has meaning within the framework of a paradigm.A paradigm, as I understand him to say, is a view of the nature and subject matter covered by an area of science. This view is held by the scientific community; the relatively small number of scientists who consider themselves, and are acknowledged by others, to be authorities in their field. The paradigm suggests what are the legitimate questions to be asked, the areas of research to follow and the answers to be confirmed by ""normal science"" (see below).Scientific revolutions arrive when oddities collect that the paradigm cannot satisfactorily or simply address. One or two such oddities may be put on the back burner, but if they continue to collect a shadow of doubt grows and unease arises. Those long involved will tend to defend the paradigm (strongly implanted in students of the field by textbooks), but at some point someone, usually one of the young scientists, not indoctrinated, with no need to defend long practice, and willing to take a risk will offer a novel view that accounts for the oddities.Rather than a capitulation by the elders who are convinced by the upstart ideas, the revolution proceeds by the younger set practicing under a new view that becomes successful not only in accounting for the oddities but in handling old questions as well or better than did the old paradigm. Kuhn writes of several interesting subtopics...""normal science"" is how Kuhn refers to the day-to-day work that scientists do. Characteristic of normal science is that answers to questions being researched are known and the challenge to practicing scientist is to design procedures and experiments that will confirm these answers. Normal science is by no means a blind hunt for truth.Truth? Kuhn denies that one can say current science is more truthful that that of times long gone. All that can be said is we know more answers, more specifically, with greater complexity, to our questions than our forebears did with respect to theirs. To be meaningful, nothing can be stated without regard to the paradigm within which it exists (or existed). But to be valid and quite practical within the paradigm cannot be a claim to ultimate truth. The questions asked in the 16th century can seem like nonsense and irrelevant now because we see the world in an entirely different way.What's the difference between the natural sciences and the social sciences? Must I reveal all? Put on your thinking cap and go get a copy of this book."
36,0226458083,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9566554-martin,5,"This book is a classic. It still causes debate as to the extent of how historicity and the social study of science has a genuine role.His main contribution for me is: Science is what human scientists do, there’s a method to it (to ensure its not a madness).The paradigms that it offers as explanatory sets are not something to “believe in” in any other respect than they are (tentatively and for the time being since they are in principle falsifiable, an inheritance from Popper) the best fit to empiricism whilst being analytically sound. Other contending paradigms may be offered up, and there's a variety of means of valuing them (e.g., Occam’s razor), but these valuing systems are human “investments”, and a paradigm shift may well occur when these investments change as well as the empirical data set is updated. Arguments ensue in the community of scientists when values are held/clinged onto at the expense of confirmation bias with the data set.Hence science is a subject for philosophy to engage in with respect to looking at these value investments.Something that is topical these days with some scientists still not getting it as to what they are doing, and on what value system, that they may not be reflecting over, that underpins them."
37,0226458083,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2708448-thomas-herzog,4,"I expected not to like this book, having been exposed to very critical accounts of Kuhn's theory in the past. Many current popular science writers (David Deutsch comes to mind) proudly label themselves Popperians, in implied or explicit contrast to Kuhn. I expected a sociological account of scientific practice, showing science as a decidedly human enterprise, and maybe some postmodern sneering at ""objective truth"" thrown in for good measure.All those elements can be found in the book, and yet, I am very glad to have read it. The central structure painted by Kuhn of normal science as puzzle solving guided by a shared paradigm, followed by anomaly and crisis which ultimately leads to revolution and a change of paradigm, is very illuminating and insightful. Yet, as pointed out by Ian Hacking in the introductory essay to the 50th anniversary edition, it is a bit too neat to be a general template of how science works.Still, I highly recommend reading this book at least once. Even if, in the end, it does not convince on all counts, it still contains enough insight and food for thought to be worth the effort."
38,0226458083,http://goodreads.com/user/show/14941179-anna,4,"While I found ‘The Structure of Scientific Revolutions’ thoughtful and interesting, it wasn't as transformative as I expected. My mum recommended it to me as a mind-changing book, yet I felt similarly to the author in his 1969 postscript: ‘To the extent that the book portrays scientific development as a succession of tradition-bound periods punctuated by non-cumulative breaks, its theses are undoubtedly of wide applicability. But they should be, for they are borrowed from other fields. Historians of literature, of music, of the arts, of political development, and of many other human activities have long described their subjects in the same way’. Thus I found Kuhn’s analysis of science’s non-linear progression to be a cogent application of familiar concepts to a new disciplinary context. The writing is very careful and precise, making it rather ponderous to read while also aiding understanding. For the non-scientist, I felt the most important point was that textbooks and popular science books elide and simplify the nature of scientific discovery. While this is by no means malicious, it gives a somewhat misleading impression of cumulative linear progress. Kuhn explores a number of ways and draws on many examples (including the question of when oxygen was discovered) to argue that this is not actually how things work. To wit, ‘The scientists of earlier ages are implicitly represented as having worked upon the same set of fixed problems and in accordance with the same set of fixed canons that the most recent revolution in scientific theory and method has made seem scientific’.What particularly impressed me about the book was Kuhn’s use of the word ‘paradigm’ in a genuinely meaningful manner. Rarely has there been a more misused word, in the social science and policy worlds at least. I keep a tally of how many times it is used in meetings and documents, with more than three instances a definite indicator of that bullshit's afoot. Here, however, the term is discussed and defined clearly:Our most recent examples show that paradigms provide scientists not only with a map but also with some of the directions essential for map-making. In learning a paradigm the scientist acquires theory, methods, and standards together, usually in an inextricable mixture. Therefore, when paradigms change, there are usually significant shifts in the criteria determining the legitimacy both of problems and proposed solutions.I found Kuhn’s thesis a convincing and helpful structure for understanding how science has happened over centuries. It brings up many thought-provoking questions, such as how language mediates observations:No current attempt to achieve that end has yet come close to a generally applicable language of pure precepts. And those attempts that come closest share one characteristic that strongly reinforces several of this essay’s main theses. From the start they presuppose a paradigm, taken either from a current scientific theory or from some fraction of everyday discourse, and they then try to eliminate from it all non-logical and non-perceptual terms. […] But their result is a language that – like those employed in the sciences – embodies a host of expectations about nature and fails to function the moment these expectations are violated. […] No language thus restricted to reporting a world fully known in advance can produce mere neutral and objective reports on ‘the given’.Another fascinating question is how the revolutionary shift from one paradigm to another occurs:Max Planck, surveying his own career in his Scientific Autobiography, sadly remarked that ‘a new scientific truth does not triumph by convincing its opponents and making them see the light, but rather because its opponents eventually die, and a new generation grows up that is familiar with it’. These facts and others like them are too commonly known to need further emphasis. But they do need re-evaluation. […] The transfer of allegiance from paradigm to paradigm is a conversion experience that cannot be forced. Lifelong resistance, particularly from those whose productive careers have committed them to an older tradition of normal science, is not a violation of scientific standards but an index to the nature of scientific research itself.A third and very fundamental question that Kuhn raises without dwelling on is whether science needs a final goal. This he links neatly with one of the most controversial aspects of Darwin’s theory of evolution: that it has no end in mind, no higher plan. As the book puts it, ‘The Origin of the Species recognised no goal set by God or nature.’ Progress, argues Kuhn, does not require such a goal to be articulated. The question is nonetheless a fascinating one, as it raises the issue of more specific goals in specific scientific fields and whether they add up to a consistent pattern. Writing in the 1960s, it’s a little surprising that Kuhn never mentions the prosaic military goals of science during the Cold War. Today, research across the disciplines has been infected with the need for outputs to be monetised somehow, or to have semi-plausible commercial potential. Although these goals may be imposed upon scientific institutions from outside, over the decades they must have been internalised to some extent. From a more idealistic perspective, some might state the goal of science as ‘to make the world a better place by increasing our understanding of it’. That is tantamount to inviting a bunch of social scientists (like me) into your lab to argue for hours about what is meant by better, for whom, when, how, etc, etc, etc. The interdisciplinary nature of ‘The Structure of Scientific Revolutions’ has ensured that it remains relevant and thought-provoking fifty years after first publication. It certainly isn’t a fast read and I had to go over quite a few sentences twice to be clear about what Kuhn was saying. Nonetheless, there is a lot to consider packed into a small space."
39,0226458083,http://goodreads.com/user/show/426277-james,4,"I read this in college for both History of Science and History of Economic Thought classes. Subsequently I acquired a newer edition and reread the book. While Kuhn's theories are extremely popular and they appear to be very good at explaining the changes in scientific ""paradigms"", they are not as rigorous as they seem to be on first reading. It is even more curious that the methods presented here are being used in areas beyond those originally considered. Rereading this after several decades impresses on me both that it is now a ""classic"" of the history of science and still contains the flaws I noted upon my first readings in college. However, this still is a seminal work in the history of science and worth considering as one approach to the changes in scientific views over time. "
40,0226458083,http://goodreads.com/user/show/23221969-lawrence,4,"During the half-year or so it took me to read this book, I found myself in the strange position of having my underlying assumptions about its subject matter radically changed, for reasons that most likely had nothing to do with the book. Blame the coronavirus (along with the needlessly horrific response to it here in the United States), if you will, for causing me to value a solid measure of objectivity in science. That position, though, turns out to not be nearly so far removed from Kuhn's as I once imagined.Although the beginning of The Structure of Scientific Revolutions manages to be able to read simply as a sociological study of what scientists generally do (""normal science"", as Kuhn puts it), I was still, apparently, suspicious enough of being drawn in to something harmful (probably due to my several-years-ago curious perusal of RationalWiki) that I looked Kuhn up on the Internet this past February (2020), after reading only a couple of chapters. I landed on the articles of author and Scientific American ""Cross-Check"" blogger John Horgan, whose posts on Kuhn include ""What Thomas Kuhn Really Thought About Scientific 'Truth'"", ""Did Thomas Kuhn Help Elect Donald Trump?"", and ""Was Thomas Kuhn Evil?"". Horgan's answer to the Trump question is ""no"", to cut to the chase, but, disappointingly enough for me as an anti-Trump Kuhn reader, seemingly only because Kuhn (like, apparently, philosophers these days in general) hasn't had nearly as much influence on culture at large as a ""yes"" answer would imply.Horgan does seem to generally think of Kuhn, though, as a postmodernist who disclaims ideas of scientific truth — a contention that actually accords very well with the very critical-theory-oriented undergraduate environment in which his book was first recommended to me — and I have to say, at least from simply reading it, that I didn't get that sense. In ""What Thomas Kuhn Really Thought About Scientific 'Truth'"", Horgan says about meeting Kuhn, ""[H]is speech was as profoundly tangled, as suffused with subjunctives and qualifiers, as his prose"", and indeed, I did find Kuhn's writing style in The Structure of Scientific Revolutions tangled and difficult to get through, even dry (despite the claim by Ian Hacking, in his introduction to the 2012 50th-anniversary edition of Structure that I read, that the book is actually a ""page-turner""). I think the flaws (as I see them) in Kuhn's writing style here are the main reason I'm docking a star from a full rating, as a matter of fact. When Horgan writes, in the same article, ""One of the sources of Structure's power and persistence is its profound ambiguity, which explains why it appeals to relativists and science worshippers alike"", I see what he means.It was important, in that regard, then, for me to read Kuhn's postscript, which was originally appended to the 1969 edition of Structure and reproduced here. Although the postscript was actually more difficult to get through linguistically than the body of the book, I think it accomplished its job of clarifying the ambiguity in the body, and in the process, revealed Kuhn to be substantially more pro-science than was clear before. Although I don't think the body is anti-science as a whole, Kuhn does take some swipes at the institution in it, for example: ""The depreciation of historical fact is deeply, and probably functionally, ingrained in the ideology of the scientific profession, the same profession that places the highest of all values upon factual details of other sorts."" Yet, even this statement of Kuhn's contains a belief that the ""function"" of science is benefited by its erasing its own history. He is consistent throughout Structure about giving science credit, even in the same sentences he uses to criticize it.I suppose it's, at best, a roundabout way of thinking about the culture wars that are pretty front-and-center here in the United States of August 2020 to write here about The Structure of Scientific Revolutions, but I think reading it was something it's been good to go through during these past six months. Structure really did strike me as acute about science and scientists: Kuhn's contention, for example, that ""[g]iven a set of necessary and sufficient conditions for identifying a theoretical entity, the entity can be eliminated from the ontology of a theory by substitution. In the absence of such rules, however, these entities are not eliminable; the theory then demands their existence"" does, I believe, actually say something profound about ontology. Horgan's ""possible interpretation"" that Kuhn ""focused on what science is rather than on what it should be"" and had a ""realistic, hard-nosed, psychologically accurate view of science"" also seems to be on point. And one more thing: I'm not done with critically investigating the nature of science, either, and Bruno Latour is on deck. Books like The Structure of Scientific Revolutions activate a dialogue in my head about deep (to me) questions about whether and how to trust authority — here, scientific authority can stand in for other forms as well — and even how to conduct conversations based on facts, and I think that's a good thing."

46,0226458083,http://goodreads.com/user/show/13424240-pavan-dharanipragada,5,"I would call this a Really Important Book, and urge that you all read it.The view we have of science currently doesn't explain a lot of things about the way science is actually done day-to-day. Once you get into research it becomes obvious that it works in a way that's not very ""scientific"" the way you were taught it would be. Research is a lot of the times about intuition, dogma, peer pressure, and appeals to values that are very clearly not about ""logic"". A lot of concepts that are used in Physics (which it's not controversial to say is the most mature science) are also really vague and unremarked upon, while research on them proceeds nevertheless. At times of crisis, these undetermined items are thrown into the center of a conflict, that usually emerges with a new shared set of values, perspectives, and bunch of other things that enable research to proceed, which is called a ""paradigm"" by Kuhn in the book. This change is a revolution in that particular field. What surprised me about this essay, is that one of its theses is that, this dogmatic, faith-based nature of scientific research is what is responsible for the success of science and scientific progress. The fact that no scientist is required to make explicit the fundamental beliefs underlying his field in every research paper, and she can thus take for granted the acceptance of her work's relevance and importance frees them up to pursue really esoteric problems, leading to a depth of progress not possible in fields like economics or sociology.The essay draws a lot of parallels between science and theology, and normally that would piss me off, but they are all well-argued and explain a lot. Superficially similar kind of argument made in Sapiens: A Brief History of Humankind I fucking hated because they were poorly argued and couldn't explain shit. But despite all the relativism this seems to characterise in science, Kuhn takes pain to make clear the relevance of the special way we perceive science, compared to arts. We need not abandon the notion of scientific progress altogether. We just need to slightly modify it. As in, science doesn't get more and more closer to some real world that exists independently, it just gets better and better at explaining the world."

The Copernicus Revolution for instance is a great example. This breakthrough and establishment of a new order, I mean paradigm, Kuhn calls Scientific Revolutions.The technical language, which is understandable, since Kuhn is not a writer of pop-science, did lessen my enjoyment a bit though."

52,0226458083,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8277957-conrad,4,"The general outline of The Structure of Scientific Revolutions is widely known: Scientists work within 'paradigms'; during the intra-paradigm period of 'normal science' there is the accumulation of solved problems; a period of crisis follows arising from 'anomalies'--problems which the current paradigm seems incapable of solving; then the rise of competing paradigms; and the final return to normal science as one paradigm wins out.I think a reasonable demand from authors of philosophical works is that they should strive for clarity. While Kuhn's writing is readable, it shares a major flaw with many other philosophical works, ambiguity.Although others have already pointed out that it is possible to read Kuhn in two ways (see for example Sokal and Bricmont's Fashionable Nonsense chapter 4), this criticism deserves to be repeated. It is possible to read this book in a way that is correct but certainly not profound, and it is possible to read this book in a way that is radical but inaccurate. Where Kuhn deserves his due credit is that by analyzing the historical shifts between periods of normal science he was the first to make explicit the non-rational reasons for why scientists come to accept new theories. Although individual scientists may have non-rational reasons for pursuing the questions and ideas that they do, this tells us nothing of the truth of a particular science. This is the correct reading of Kuhn. The radical interpretation is that scientific truths are no more deserving of the term truth than are the truths of any of the multitude of theologies, say.One doesn't have to look far for a refutation of the radical interpretation: ""Why speak in a realist mode about historical categories, such as paradigms, if it is an illusion to speak in a realist mode about scientific concepts?"" (Sokal and Bricmont, chapter 4)Although Kuhn tells us in his 1969 postscript that his intent was not to have his work interpreted in such a radically relativistic way, it seems he is purposefully flirtatious with such an interpretation throughout The Structure of Scientific Revolutions. The use of the less-than-modest word 'revolution,' and the claim that the scientists of pre-revolution and post-revolution paradigms would have difficulty seeing from the point of view of the other, are both exemplars of the radical Kuhn. It might make you wonder if Kuhn had given any thought to the currently coexisting and incommensurate paradigms of quantum mechanics and general relativity. Is it really possible that the those who research quantum mechanics cannot fully understand general relativity as the relativists do? Despite Kuhn's intent, he fails to answer what to me seems to be a central question: How is it that the effectiveness of science at explaining the material world progresses despite the apparent non-rational behaviors of the individuals involved in the scientific enterprise?You would expect that the last chapter--progress through revolutions--would attempt to answer this question. But here Kuhn dodges the question, and prefers instead to use the word 'progress' as a synonym for accumulation. The accumulation of concepts and explanations within a paradigm counts as progress, and the characteristic of a science is that all, or at least most, of its practitioners work within a single paradigm. This is in contrast to other endeavors: ""We have, for example, just noted that while artists aimed at representation as their goal, both critics and historians chronicled the progress of the apparently united group. Other creative fields display progress of the same sort...If we do doubt, as many do, that non-scientific fields make progress, that cannot be because individuals schools make none. Rather, it must be because there are always competing schools, each of which constantly questions the very foundations of the others."" (pp. 162-163, 2nd ed.) And so progress is not progress at effectively solving a larger set scientific problems with a more parsimonious set of assumptions, progress is not the possibility of accurately predicting with greater and greater precision the effects of a physical or biological cause, but is rather mere accumulation of solved problems within a given paradigm."
53,0226458083,http://goodreads.com/user/show/79435586-benjamin-lerner,5,"I've been taking notes on this book using Siri dictation. I'm going to transcribe my notes here from the last few chapters, without creating a thesis or justifying my star rating, and then never clean it up----------- A scientific revolution is not like interpreting existing experimental data in a new way. Imagine you have a scatterplot in front of you. Different ""interpretations"" of the data are like drawing different regression lines through the points on the scatterplot. Kuhn says that a scientific revolution is much more fundamental: it's like changing the dimensions themselves on which you're regressing. It's questioning why you're performing a regression in the first place. What if instead of trying to draw a line through the points, you're drawing a shape *around* the points, to box them in? That's a totally different way of looking at the data. Whereas before you were trying to see which line would pass *through* the data, now you're thinking about which shape will *surround* the data.- The very experiments you choose to conduct and the type of data that you collect are dependent on the paradigm in which you are trying to conduct experiments. Scientists view the world through the data they collect, so their view of the world will be limited if they aren't looking at the right kind of data. For example, with relativity: who would have thought to measure the *length* of an object as it travels, as if its motion would change its length? No one would have even considered that length was dependent on relative velocity before the 20th century. - Two people who are defending different paradigms might end up talking through each other because it is difficult for either of them to understand the others' point of view- The paradigm that ends up winning out is the one seems most capable of explaining existing data. That includes the anomalous data that prompted its creation as well as historical data that was collected under old paradigms. If a new paradigm makes old phenomenon difficult to explain, then scientists need to *trust that the new paradigm will allow them to re-explain old phenomena they used to understand*- In arts and philosophy, one often deals directly with primary sources and engages with the historical record. There isn't an idea of art ""progressing"" towards higher forms of art in the way one might imagine science ""progressing"" away from primitive, inaccurate worldview. When studying science, you generally deal with secondary texts, textbooks. It's already hard enough to build up to an understanding of the current state of the world for the physical sciences (i.e. with high energy physics), it would be impossible for a student of physical sciences to ALSO deal with all the previous, inaccurate physical science paradigms. Think about how much more common ""art history"" is as a field of study than ""history of science."" In the arts, there is a sense that earlier art periods have genuine value, whereas looking back on the history of science is mostly an account of ""errors made."" So it is difficult for a student of science to understand that textbooks only present the tip of the iceberg, they only mention experiments that were conducted under the current paradigm or that support the current paradigm.- Every scientific revolution is followed by a rewriting of the textbooks, which changes new students' view of the field- Whereas with arts, students can very quickly appreciate the current ""state of the world"" by examining recently created art pieces, in science it takes a long time for students to build up enough knowledge and context to understand brand-new papers in their field. Whereas an art student can quickly begin practicing her craft, a science student must wait a long time before she can start practicing science.- Think of science as less like ""reaching closer and closer towards a full objective account of nature's behavior"" and more like ""getting further and further from inaccurate descriptions of nature's behavior."" In other words, science is a tool that guides us towards being ""less wrong"" (https://amzn.to/2wZ05yp), and that's the most we can ask of it."
54,0226458083,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1633145-james,5,"This is a book/author that was referenced many times in my college classes, both in psychology and philosophy, though the book itself is specifically centered around the nature of science and the history of science. I'm really glad that I got around to reading it.Kuhn's ideas about science are both fascinating and revolutionary, and they have implications for any sort of hard or soft science or philosophy. Basically, Kuhn presents the idea that science may not be as impartial, linear, and straightforward as most people seem to believe.Most people, either scientists or non-scientists, think of science as a way to get at the truth of what is ""out there"". There is an absolute truth and if we can only use the right methods, then we could see that truth.Kuhn suggests the idea of scientific paradigms, meaning that in various stages of history, science moved between different paradigms/worldviews that actually limited and directed what science could and couldn't do. A common example would be moving from the paradigm of Newton's physics to Einstein's.A new paradigm begins to be established when scientists (usually the younger ones who are not as entrenched in past methods/philosophy) start to notice anomalies in their findings--things that don't fit into the paradigm/understanding that they currently have. These scientists will then CREATE a new paradigm to encapsulate their findings. When enough people support the new worldview, a scientific revolution happens.But the interesting thing about moving into a new paradigm is that it is not a cumulative storage of every past scientific experiment. Instead, a new paradigm actually limits what the experimenters can do--in effect, scientists come up with a theory of how the universe works, determine what should be possible in that universe, and then use methods/tools designed to prove exactly that.A metaphorical example of my own making:We are all inside one room. All of our experiments that we conduct prove the existence of the room, thus verifying what we have already established. The room is all that exists. However, one day someone does an experiment where they look outside the window. The results are baffling. What is this? This doesn't fit with our paradigm. Subsequent scientists then try to show how the results of looking out the window are actually just a variant of our ""one room theory"". ""It's not a new room,"" says one scientist, ""it's actually light reflecting off our coffee table creating the effects...""However, if enough people refuse to accept these rationalizations, then we may move far enough to create a revolution. I propose that there is another room and design methods for testing this theory. My method is to open the door and treat the room and hallway as the only reality that exists. Eventually, enough people accept my theory and use my new method and open the door and enter a new paradigm in which the room and the hallway are ""the true reality"". All of our subsequent experiments prove the existence of the ""room-hallway"" worldview. We do not test the fact that there may be more outside the hallway because all our methods and tools are aimed at proving the ""room-hallway"" now. In addition, we do not take all our theories and data from the ""room"" era and add them cumulatively to our ""hallway"" paradigm. Instead, we go back and rewrite all our textbooks so that only the evidence showing the progression of past scientists from the ""room"" towards the ""hallway"" viewpoint are shown. We actually deceive ourselves into thinking that all science is connected and linear, where in reality it is fluid and actually fundamentally based on what we choose to see and recognize.Fascinating and a must read for any scientist, philosopher, or anyone interested in the way we do scientific research"
55,0226458083,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5226097-bojan-tunguz,5,"As a practicing scientist and someone who has always been interested in history and the development of scientific ideas ""The Structure of Scientific Revolutions"" has for long time been the book that loomed large on my intellectual horizon. Thomas Khun's book has for a long time had a reputation as the definitive and seminal work on understanding how new scientific ideas come about and how and why they gain support. Part of my reluctance to start reading this book stemmed from my belief that it would be an overly philosophical work, with a lot of opaque technical jargon, and with very little relevance to actual scientific practice. However, to my great surprise and delight, nothing could be farther from the truth. This book is written in a very matter-of-fact style, and it is easy to understand what Khun is getting at. His own background in science and history of science probably made him very sensitive to the working and thinking of practicing scientists. The insights that Khun has arrived at are still relevant almost half a century after this book has been published. The idea of ""paradigm shifts"" has even entered the mainstream consciousness, to the point that it can be caricatured in various cartoons and silly t-shirts. However, after reading this book it is not quite clear to me whether Khun wanted this to be a description of the way that science works, or more of a normative prescription for how to arrive at truly fundamental changes in some scientific discipline. This is particularly relevant for disciplines or directions of research that seem to have gotten stuck in some dead end, as has been the case with particle physics for several decades. Whether you are a practicing scientist, someone interested in science, or someone who would like to know more about how scientific breakthroughs happen you'll greatly benefit from reading this book. You may not agree with Khun's every conclusion, but the longevity of the ideas presented here makes them relevant for every serious discussion about scientific endeavor."
56,0226458083,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7208369-miles,3,"I found this book pretty frustrating overall. I didn't feel like the writing was very clear and I found some of the insights boring and others problematic. I'm sure it was more groundbreaking when it was first published, but now it feels dated and fairly relativistic. Kuhn seems to have defended himself against claims of relativism, but I'm not sure if he escapes them entirely. I really don't know enough about the subject matter to be sure. Some of the ideas are interesting, and the concept of ""paradigm"" has certainly become important in modern culture. I don't think I agree with the notion that increasingly better paradigms don't get us closer to an empirically verifiable reality (truth). Too much of that argument seemed semantic in nature; I'm not sure if he really addressed the simple fact that, regardless of differences in perception, we are all sharing a common world with identifiable, consistent characteristics that scientific theories are designed to test and describe. And I do think our knowledge of how these theories do or do not accurately describe the world gets better as we go. I agree with Kuhn that it happens more in spurts and leaps followed by long periods of ""normal science"" that flesh out a new paradigm, but I think those leaps tend to actually bring us closer to the nature of nature. So supplanting one paradigm with another is more than just changing a worldview; it's choosing a more advantageous worldview that better describes our experience of anomalous observations. "
57,0226458083,http://goodreads.com/user/show/38319939-lee-richardson,5,"# ReviewRemarkable book written by a historian of science about how scientific progress is made. Kuhn argues that science doesn't progress 'brick by brick' in a cumulative fashion, but rather through large and small revolutions, or 'paradigm shifts'. When a scientific community isn't in a crisis, Kuhn calls this 'normal science', where practitioners use the prevailing paradigm for 'puzzle solving'. When anomalies or new theories emerge, science 'evolves' by replacing the older paradigm with a new one.The role of normal science, or puzzle solving, is to push the existing paradigm as far as it goes, and by doing this we understand where it breaks down. However, Kuhn is clear that puzzle solving is not aimed at 'breaking' the existing paradigm through falsification. Rather, puzzle solving knows what the outcome will be, and delights in applying the paradigm to get to more and more complex solutions.At the end of the book, Kuhn sort-of reveals that he is applying Darwin's theory of evolution to scientific communities and the growth of knowledge. Science gets better, our knowledge is growing, and we can do more now than has ever been possible. So, it it not a 'relativistic' book in any sense. Kuhn simply argues that the story we tell ourselves about scientific research doesn't add up when we look at the historical record, and the concept of 'paradigms' is a better explanation.# Notes- Pg 35. ""Perhaps the most striking feature of the normal research problems we have just encountered is how little they aim to product major novelties"" - Pg 37. ""We have already seen, however, that one of the things a scientific community acquires with a paradigm is a criterion for choosing problems that, while the paradigm is taken for granted, can be assumed to have solutions"" - Pg 42. ""Finally, at a still higher level, there is another set of commitments without which no man is a scientist. The scientist must, for example be concerned to understand the world and to extend the precision and scope with which it has been ordered. That commitment must, in turn, lead him to scrutinize, either for himself or through colleagues, some aspect of nature in great empirical detail"" - Pg 47. ""One is at liberty to suppose that somewhere along the way the scientist has intuitively learned abstracted the rules of the game for himself, but there is little reason to believe it. Though many scientists talk easily and well about the particular individual hypothesis that underlie a concrete piece of current research, they are little better than the laymen at characterizing the established bases of their field, its legitimate problems and methods"" - Pg 62/63. Great story regarding how we catch anomalies in a game of cards. - Pg 77. ""... once it has achieved the status of paradigm, a scientific theory is declared invalid only if an alternative candidate is available to take its place."" - Pg 126. ""As for a pure observation language, perhaps one will yet be devised. But three centuries after Descartes our hope for such an eventuality still depends exclusively upon a theory of perception and of the mind"" - Pg 138. Great discussion regarding how textbooks represent the state of knowledge as ""linear"", but in reality this is not what happens... - Pg 140. Another gripe with textbook accounts: ""One by one, in a process often compared to the addition of bricks to a building, scientists have added another fact, concept, law, or theory to the body of information supplied in the contemporary science text"" - Quotes on acceptance of new theories by Max Plank and Darwin: "" Although I am fully convinced of the truth of the views given in this volume..., I by no means expect to convince experienced naturalists whose minds are stocked with a multitude of facts all viewed, during a long course of years, from a point of view directly opposite to mine."" - Darwin ""a new scientific truth does not triumph by convincing its opponents and making them see the light, but rather because its opponents eventually die, and a new generation grows up that is familiar with it"" - Pg 165. Interesting point, not sure what to make of it. This happens in statistics as well, we don't read Fisher, Neyman, etc. Is this a good thing? ""Until the very last stages in the education of a scientist, textbooks are systematically substituted for creative scientific literature that made them possible. Given the confidence in their paradigms, which makes this educational technique possible, few scientists would wish to change it. Why, after all, should the student of physics, for example, read the works of Newton, Faraday, Einstein, or Schrodinger, when everything he needs to know about these works is recapitulated in far briefer, more precise, and more systematic form in a number of up-to-date textbooks?""- Pg 168. ""But only civilizations that descend for Hellenic Greece have possessed more than the most rudimentary science. The bulk of scientific knowledge is a product of Europe in the last four centuries. No other place and time has supported the very special communities from which scientific productivity comes.""- Pg 169, ""Because the unit of scientific achievement is a solved problem..."", kind of, but not really true on modern day. Now, units are changing to ""published papers"", no one cares as much about problems.- Pg 170/171. ""It is now time to notice that until the last very few pages the term 'truth' had entered the essay only in a quotation from Francis Bacon.... But nothing that has been said or will be said makes it a process of evolution toward anything... But need there be any such goal? Can we not account for both science's existence and its success in terms of evolution from the communities state of knowledge at any given time? Does it really help to imagine that there is some one full, objective, true account of nature and that the proper measure of scientific achievement is the extent to which it brings us closer to that ultimate goal?""- Pg 189. ""After he has completed a certain number, which may vary widely from one individual to the next, he views the situations that confront him as a scientist in the same gestalt as other members of his specialists' group. For him they are no longer the same situations he had encountered when his training began. He has meanwhile assimilated a time-tested and group licensed way of seeing""- Pg 203. Good discussion on how representatives from different groups / ways of seeing can communicate without 'talking past each-other'."
58,0226458083,http://goodreads.com/user/show/29573450-brandon-henke,4,"A strong criticism of the modern era's teleological conception of science. Kuhn's historical approach leads to a theory of paradigms which supersedes the logical empiricist view of science as cumulative progression toward truth. Goal-oriented research is not the primary catalyst for incredible scientific breakthrough. Dubbed ""normal science"" by Kuhn, this form of highly-specialized research is really just glorified puzzle-solving for the purpose of refining established theory. It is through undirected tinkering and mere chance that scientists typically come to the realization that the fundamental tenets have shifted and that the tools that once defined their research are now mere encumbrances. Thus, we have a complex evolutionary process in which predominant systems of belief are successively destroyed and replaced by new assumptions and associated procedures. Often, this occurs in revolutionary fashion with a bona fide ideological battle on multiple fronts. The supplanting paradigm subsequently distributes its instructive demagoguery in the form of textbooks and the process continues. That many questions remain unanswered by this new regime is permissible, so long as the avenues it opens to scientific endeavor are embraced by the practicing community."
59,0226458083,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6243880-gary-beauregard-bottomley,3,"This kind of book is why I love audible so much. I never would have read it let alone understand it if it weren't for being on audible. The book is written at such a level that anyone can follow what he's trying to say. I never would have realized that if I were reading the book on my own. (God bless Audible and it's great library of books!).By listening to the reader (Dennis Holland) it becomes obvious the writer (Kuhn) was writing the essay as to be accessible to all levels of readers (listeners). The reader gave it the simple presentation the author was striving to give.The two previous books I had been listening to, '13 Things That Don't Make Sense"" and ""Too Big to Know"", both referenced this book extensively so I thought I'd give it a try. Usually, primary sources are hard for me to follow, but this book was not. At its core the book is still a philosophy book and doesn't flow as well as most of the popular science books that I read do. "
