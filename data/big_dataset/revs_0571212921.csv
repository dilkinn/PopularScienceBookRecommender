2,0571212921,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1718283-terran,4,"I read very few biographies, so I have trouble evaluating this within its field. That said, I found it fascinating, but a bit drier than I typically like my (recreational) nonfiction.But it is a fascinating and disturbing story. Nash lived (still is living, I guess) a really complicated life, even aside from his illness. Like many geniuses, he was a ""difficult"" personality. (He apparently used to stand on the table in the middle of Princeton's math department grad student meetings and put down anybody who might challenge his intellect.) This naturally caused him certain social frictions, but he was apparently forgiven a lot because of his genius. And then, when his schizophrenia struck, he was protected further by colleagues who respected him.And there was a lot of protecting going on. For example, when he pushed his pregnant wife down the stairs. (Bits that they leave out of shallow, fantasized Hollywood treatments.) Or that he cheated on her. Or the fact that he treated his son like a pariah. Some of this is entangled with his illness, of course, but not all. And a lot of the looking the other way happened before his illness was public knowledge. It makes me reflect on the structure of society in general, and academia specifically, and what we regard as sufficient excuse for bad behavior. (I had a long rant on scientific academia here, but I'm too tired to make it coherently now, and this really isn't the best venue.)As a math geek, I wish there had been a bit more about his math itself. It's difficult, I guess, because most of what he worked on was extremely abstruse stuff -- even to someone who has studied a reasonable amount of (mostly applied) math. I understand Nash equilibria, but, interestingly enough, even though he won the Nobel for this idea, he and the mathematical community generally felt that this was far from his most interesting and important contribution. And that's probably the most accessible thing he worked on. (Which is probably why it was able to become important in economics circles.) His other works are so involved that I have trouble parsing the statement of the theorems, let alone the proofs.But really, this is the story of his life. Like all of us, he lived a complicated, difficult life. More complicated and difficult than many, but still a very human life."
3,0571212921,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2723599-chad-sayban,4,"More reviews at The Story Within The StoryAt first glance, a biography of a mathematician would seem to make for a read dryer than the Sahara. However, John Nash is no ordinary mathematician and Sylvia Nasar is no ordinary biographer. In her capable hands, the life of John Nash comes to life…in all of its brilliant, dark, pessimistic, extraordinary, callous wonder. John Forbes Nash, Jr. is a mathematical genius whose extraordinary mind developed the structure for what became known as Game Theory – revolutionizing both mathematics and economics in the second half of the twentieth century. The power of his theories culminated with him being awarded the Nobel Prize for Economics nearly fifty years after his groundbreaking work began. But it came at a heavy price. By the age of thirty, Nash was suffering from his first bouts of paranoid schizophrenia, a disease he would suffer with for three decades. He was institutionalized by his family on several occasions and left for dead by most of the mathematics community. Left to wander the campus of Princeton University as a “ghost” and a “crazy man,” Nash did the unthinkable – he began recovering from a disease that there was thought to be no recovery from. He even begin to work on mathematics research again. It was a recovery that physiatrists thought was impossible.
“I've made the most important discovery of my life. It's only in the mysterious equation of love that any logic or reasons can be found.”
A Beautiful Mind is really not about mathematics, but about what it means to be labeled “gifted,” “different” or “sick.” It is about how society treats people who are unusual and how few answers there are for what goes on between someone’s ears. It is also about John’s wife Alicia, who set aside her own desires to try to guide John through a world that had become hostile to him.Ultimately, Sylvia Nasar succeeds with A Beautiful Mind because she leaves out most of the heavy-handed mathematics and focuses on who John Nash is and what his life represents. Make no mistake, John Nash not a lovable person. He is rude, thoughtless, self-centered and egotistical – all the things we don’t like in a person. His genius is both a gift and a curse. Yet, we cheer for him the whole way because there is an innocence about him; a childlike quality of someone who doesn’t quite understand other people but has to function within society none-the-less. And it is a society of the 1950s and 1960s with little understanding or tolerance for mental illness. His story also gives us hope that no matter how hopeless a person’s situation may seem, here is an example of someone who was able to climb out of that hole and rejoin life and be happy again. That is what makes John Nash’s story so important – A Beautiful Mind demonstrates that anyone’s life can be turned around. It demonstrates hope. It demonstrates redemption. It is a story well worth your time."
4,0571212921,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2010687-steven-dzwonczyk,1,"I would have never gotten through this book if it wasn't an audiobook. Author Sylvia Nasar presented a comprehensive narrative of John Forbes Nash's life. Unfortunately, she was absent from school the days they taught about engaging your audience, limiting your topic, and just about every other skill related to literature. She is no doubt a wonderful researcher, but includes details so small as to call into question her own sanity, let alone the sanity of her subject.This book was a lot like watching someone else's home movies. To them, they are interesting; to everyone else they are a drudgery. For about the first 49 chapters you could literally skip all the odd chapters and not really miss anything.There were a few moments of interesting detail, mostly surrounding the Nobel Prize and applications of Nash's work. Also, I found the details of Princeton in the 50's and 60's interesting since I live near there. Otherwise, it was dull.Though I usually like Blackstone Audio's production of books, the narration of this one by Anna Fields, was below their standards. The narrator's voice was so expressionless that she seemingly started new chapters mid-sentence.This is one of those rare cases where the movie was much better than the book. In fact, if the titles weren't the same I'd be hard-pressed to tell you that they were based on the same story.A true disappointment. I should have listened to the wisdom of my older sister and skipped this one. That is 17 hours of my life that I'll never get back."
5,0571212921,http://goodreads.com/user/show/934107-april,1,"The book conveys a convincing portrayal of mental illness; but, it is unpleasant to read. I found that I didn't enjoy spending so much time with a person who, in addition to being a genius, and mentally ill, was basically a creep. The movie was better - mainly because the screenplay converted Nash into a more likeable guy (helped to be played by Russell Crow). If you haven't read the book or seen the movie - I recommend the latter. But keep in mind it's not a terribly truthful portrayal."
6,0571212921,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1711431-eric-w,5,"""'How could you,' Mackey asked, 'how could you, a mathematician, a man devoted to reason and logical proof. . . how could you believe that extra terrestrials are sending you messages? How could you believe that you are being recruited by aliens from outer space to save the world? How could you . . .?' ""Nash looked up at last and fixed Mackey with an unblinking stare as cool and dispassionate as that of any bird or snake. 'Because,' Nash said slowly in his soft, reasonable southern drawl, as if talking to himself, 'the ideas I had about supernatural beings came to me the same way that my mathematical ideas did. So I took them seriously.'""A Beautiful Mind by Sylvia Nasar is the biography of John Forbes Nash. Nash was brilliant. (The movie was terrific, but often bore little resemblance to reality.) At twenty-one he had invented a theory of modern human behavior and his contributions to game theory would ultimately win him a Nobel Prize. As a young professor he solved some mathematical problems deemed ""impossible"" by other mathematicians. He also became insane. This most fascinating book is the story of his descent into schizophrenia and his sudden remission at age sixty-two.Nash had that spark of genius reserved for the extraordinary few. He could visualize answers to problems that baffled others, often working out proofs later. He worked and learned not by absorbing what others had already accomplished but by rediscovering the concepts on his own. He was ""compulsively rational,"" and envied the emotionless, considering thinking machines superior to humans. He remained aloof from the mundane and was described by his contemporaries as ""queer,"" ""spooky,"" and ""isolated."" Ironically, he was to revolutionize the theories of social cooperation and conflict. Unlike Von Neumann who had focused on the group, Nash, in his twenty-seven-page dissertation thesis proposed a theory for game ""in which there was a possibility of mutual gain. His insight was that the game [economics:] would be solved when every player independently chose his best responses to the other player's best strategies. . . a decentralized decision-making process could, in fact, be coherent.""Princeton probably deserves the Nobel medal as much as anyone for sticking with the genius and putting up with his bizarre behavior as does his family who often sacrificed a great deal in their efforts to help him. Whether an ""ordinary"" person would have received such special care is perhaps another issue.What is truly ironic is that Nash's son suffers from the same condition as his father, but despite advances in pharmaceutical treatment for schizophrenia, his son has not displayed the signs of remission that brought his father back."

A Beautiful Mind

 is one of those books that I loved so much, and learned so much from reading that I've yet to actually review it. However, in light of the news that the man behind the eponymous mind, 
John Forbes Nash Jr.,
 is no longer with us I thought I'd at least take the time to recommend the book, if not to explain why.

8,0571212921,http://goodreads.com/user/show/23622394-melania-x1f352,3,"3,4/5 (Some Mild Spoilers Ahead) What I struggled most with,reading this book,was young Nash’s personality . Half of the book, I could only think about what a humongous piece of .... work Nash is. I know he was sick ,but we don’t know for sure how/ if that influenced his personality as a youngster. The way he treated his friends or anyone around, for that matter , even the mother of his child ,was unforgiving from where I stand . Not helping in any way raising his own son, pushing his future wife on the ground and putting his foot on her neck so his friends can see that she belonged to him, I mean.... I can’t get over this kind of actions for anything in the world. If I’ll ever remember Nash for one thing, this is it. And then, for the rest of the book, I could not help but to pity what he became. Alone, (and for good reasons) his most precious possession ,his mind, was turning against him. His abusive, childish character disappeared, just like it never existed. And at this point I started to feel bad for him. So you know, in the end ,it was a somehow happy medium. But, I have to admit ,an emotional connection was already there . I’ve studied his equilibrium theory in faculty with one of the best professors that I’ve ever had, so that, too ,was a reason for not disliking this book more. I was thinking about my professor, my colleagues from those years a lot while listening to this.About the movie: I don’t believe it is better. I believe that Hollywood did with this story exactly was Hollywood does all the time: it erased big chunks of Nash’s personality in order to fit Hollywood’ standards.Crow’s character is merely a shadow of real Nash.With all this in mind, I don’t regret reading A Beautiful Mind,but I don’t believe I’ll ever come back , to the film or this book."
9,0571212921,http://goodreads.com/user/show/821868-kirsten,5,"This biography was the basis for the popular film ""A Beautiful Mind"" a few years ago. It's the fascinating story of an arrogant young mathematician who began his career with genius-level work in mathetmatics, succumbed to paranoid schizophrenia in his thirties, and ultimately experienced a remission in the late 80s and was awarded the Nobel Prize for his early work in game theory.Reading about Nash's early life and the beginning of his career, I couldn't help but notice that he was always rather an odd duck, even before he became delusional and was diagnosed as schizophrenic. I'm inclined to think that if he were a child now, it's fairly likely he would be diagnosed as having Asperger's or something similar, but that's just my uneducated opinion. His way of relating to the world was always sufficiently different that it took a long time for many of his colleagues to realize that his eccentricities had morphed into delusions. He was a genius, he was expected to behave oddly, and in some ways this both served as a measure of protection for him, and also may have prevented him from getting help earlier.I have to admit that I actually really disliked John Nash for a lot of the book. Even when he was sane, he was arrogant, self-absorbed, and unkind. He must have had some good qualities, though, other than his genius, because what really saved him in the end was the willingness of his friends and family to stand by him and try to help him. Again and again during his illness, his colleagues arranged work for him, smoothed over scandals caused by his odd behavior, and assisted his wife and mother in providing him with care. At times, his friends were almost too caring -- not having the same intimate contact with Nash that his wife Alice did, many of them believed he was not as ill as he actually was, and were very upset when he was involuntarily committed. The many points of view Nasar provides really bring home what it's like when someone succumbs to mental illness, and the way it affects just about everyone the person comes into contact with, like ripples in a pond.Nash's return to normality after years of delusional behavior is still something of a mystery to neuroscientists. This is not something that often happens in schizophrenic patients, which led some to posit that Nash may not have been schizophrenic, after all. Yet his behavior and experiences are much more consistent with schizophrenia than with any of the other illnesses, like biopolar disorder, that have been suggested. This leads to the conclusion that Nash is one of the lucky few who experience a near-complete remission after years of illness. I'd definitely recommend this biography to anyone with an interest in mathematics, mental illness, or who just likes a well-written biography."
10,0571212921,http://goodreads.com/user/show/44824883-paul-e-morph,4,"It seems to be a commonly held belief that genius often goes hand-in-hand with mental illness. I've often wondered if this is actually the case or whether it's just that most people have never heard of most genius level intellects that aren't afflicted in this way. How many of us could honestly say we'd ever have heard of John Nash if it weren't for his prolonged battle with schizophrenia (if 'battle' is even the right word)?I admit that I'd not heard of him until my wife recommended the movie to me after watching it with friends. I quickly bought it and loved it (I know which side my bread is buttered, folks) and this lead me to read the book the movie is based on.Having now finished the book, I have to say that it's made me reappraise the film. While I'm sure I'd still enjoy the movie, I now see that it is an extremely idealised version of Nash's life. It has left out large chunks of the less sympathetic aspects of the man's personality. It's almost impossible to say how much of Nash's (how to put this?) dickish behaviour was due to his as-yet-undiagnosed schizophrenia but it is clear (to this reader, anyway) that the man was a rather unlikeable individual long before he became ill.I don't, however, only want to read about people I'd like to have a drink with and, despite the rather unsavoury aspects of Nash's character, this is undeniably a fascinating book and I'm very glad I read it. It manages to be a 'warts-and-all' autobiography without ever stooping to sensationalism and remains respectful of its subject even while recounting some of his worst facets. I recommend it to anybody who has seen the movie version that would like to know the truth behind the Hollywood fairytale.It's also made me want to read more about game theory..."
11,0571212921,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5864678-jan-rice,5,"I was thinking of this book again because of the deaths of John and Alicia Nash. At this remove, I cannot remember any details. We had this book on audio during a car trip. In 2002 the medium may have been tape. We either had the book as well, or, if not, I was picking my husband's brain on the story's mathematical aspects. The story was well told, very moving; the aspects relating to his schizophrenia passed muster with me. Later we saw the film, and I was appalled; thought the schizophrenia had been reworked to fit public expectations (to conform to some meme). In the news article I read, all references were to the film; it was as though there had never been a book. Again, it was very good; although the details have faded, it possibly was in a class with Simon Winchester's The Professor and the Madman: A Tale of Murder, Insanity and the Making of the Oxford English Dictionary"
12,0571212921,http://goodreads.com/user/show/13144387-kali-srikanth,4,"Update: 24/05/15Noble Laureate, Genius Mathematician John Nash is no longer with us. He is killed in a car accident along with his wife.http://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/j...****This is the story of John Forbes Nash, Jr. It is a story about the mystery of the human mind, in three acts:1. GENIUS: Perhaps John Nash was the greatest mathematical genius ever born in his times. He grew up as a child who lacked social skills (which his parents feared the most), days he locked himself up in dark room with books alone, has no close friends etc., all he got was his mother, his sister and his mathematical books. Soon after he grew up into a young man who took up Secret-code breaking jobs at RAND, who gave mind blowing seminars at Princeton & MIT and who invented theories (at Carnegie) which no one could possibly think of. But what author irritates you with in this genius tale is jumping into long and unnecessary back stories of people who inspired John or made friends with or simply he met and long mathematical equations/jargon which I never understood (which proved life achievement otherwise to John of course). As a person John was never liked by anyone but everyone approved that he is a genius.  2. MADNESS: Perhaps this is the worst phase that any human being could get into leave alone John. He often flew off from country alone (only wife was allowed to see him), approached NATO countless times as a refugee. He met horrible treatment days at hospitals (to cope with his delusions). What made his life worse were conflicts between his mistress (who is bearing his son now) and his wife, Alicia Nash who is stubborn enough not to give up on John and stay with him despite of his dangerous conduct towards others and to himself (To me she was more inspiring through-out than her husband). In eye’s blink John lost 25 years which he always regretted. Finally, his wife gave up on him too. Now John is all alone and he has his madness in its peaks.3. REAWAKENING: I count this book as inspiring not because it’s about a mathematician who solved problems in a snap which took lifetime to his colleagues just to understand them, but because of his determination to deal with his delusions, his will to cope with his illness, his awareness to revitalize his relations with people (who considered him as mad by the time) around him and his remarriage with Alicia Nash again and his reawakening state as a whole (Perhaps this is the best part of the whole book). No wonder people fought for John to nominate him at the Noble in spite of his illness and awkward behavior (his nomination alone can jeopardize the status of the Noble prize and its history you see, this triggered few people at Noble committee to oppose his nomination) This is the story of John Forbes Nash, Jr. It is a story about the mystery of the human mind. Inspiring, but not perfect in writing (more academic, unnecessarily long and too explanatory at times). 4/5 to this Pulitzer prize nominated, Oscar winning film turned inspiring biography."

15,0571212921,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1385106-jamie,4,"When it comes to geniuses, a few archetypes generally come to mind. They're often characterized as under appreciated geeks with hearts of gold (think the entire cast of Revenge of the Nerds) or as slightly spaced out but cuddly old men (think Einstein). Or they're quixotic coyotes forever trying to nab that pesky road runner. In any case, the word ""noble"" probably applies, at some level, to most conceptions of the intellectually gifted.This is not true of John Nash, the subject of the biography A Beautiful Mind. He's a total a-hole.In fact, judged by the contents of the quite detailed book, Nash is a grade A jerk, the kind of guy you'd rather punch in the teeth than appreciate or get to know. Here's a guy who constantly belittled those around him, refused to support his illegitimate son in any way, demeaned his wife, harbored jealous grudges against those few who bettered him, periodically erupted in violence when thwarted, and was generally contemptuous of you or anyone like you. Really, his ego, misogyny, racism, arrogance and general prickishness knew no bounds.Thing is, the same could be said for his intellect and his ambition. He was apparently one of the most brilliant mathematicians of the last century, and his character is made more interesting by the fact that he often went about solving mathematical problems in unique and revolutionary ways that broke new grounds in various fields. I can't imagine what it would be like to be that smart, but it's fun to try. The author of his biography, Sylvia Nasar, does a great job of making his life's story interesting, even before we get to the part where the brilliant mathematician tragically plunges into the dim depths of schizophrenia, only to slowly awaken years later just in time to receive a long-overdue Nobel prize. Though age and mental illness have mellowed him greatly, Nash was an interesting character all through his life (and he is, in fact, still alive). Nasar makes this all accessible by stitching together many fascinating episodes into one whole narrative, repeatedly using themes of ""genius, madness, and awakening.""Parenthetically, this book is much more complete than the 2001 movie of the same name. In fact, there's really very little overlap between the two. The movie contrives scenes for the sake of drama and totally glosses over critical aspects of Nash's life, such as his bisexuality, the ignoble way he treated his first family (including an illegitmate son) in Boston, or even that whole ""math"" thing he was so good at. Also, Nash's general ""jerk-ishness"" is really toned down in the movie, despite being on center stage in the book. And that whole ""imaginary best friend/roomate"" thing from the book? Apparently never really happened in the book or real life, dramatic as the reveal was in the movie. So even if you've seen the movie, I recommend the book; there's lots more to learn. The only downside of the book relative to the movie is the conspicuous absence of Jennifer Connelly."

One cannot avoid the temptation of reading the book, after watching the movie; twice. The movie is excellent in the way it describes schizophrenia (a form of); better than many textbooks. One can actually see the mind at work of a math genius called Nash and even empathize with his afflictions; his inner struggle.From nearly the onset of the pathology, to its development, treatment and some recovery (by Nash's free will...and his wife's love), the movie tells a story through time: Nash while a student in college through his several jobs (even those imaginary!) till his final recognition as a Nobel-prize winner for his work in the mathematics and economics fields. Especially poignant are college and family scenes, for the awkwardness inherent to the pathology at stake: schizophrenia, its painful delusions and paranoia. Ron Howard did a great job/movie; Russell Crowe, a terrific acting part.The music of the film, by James Horner, has been a fantastic feat; how numbers and equations and solutions... and equilibrium ....became delicate, touching musical notes, one wonders.Well, if you're a mathematician, maybe you'll get curious about psychotherapy; if you're already a psychotherapist, math will tempt you in its beauty, as well.I owe the second view of the movie to my friend* at GR who had made a review of the book.Now, I can't let it go, listening to the movie soundtrack. The sum of a manin: https://www.theguardian.com/books/200... “Mathematicians are comparatively sane as a group. It is the people who study logic that are not so sane.” J. Nash""Nash was totally spooky. He wouldn’t look at you. He’d take a lot of time answering a question. If he thought the question was foolish he wouldn’t answer at all. He had no affect. It was mixture of pride and something else. He was so isolated but there really was underneath it all a warmth andappreciation of people”A fellow student at Princeton

I was surprised to find this one among them. Why, I wondered, had I picked a book about a mathematician I'd personally never heard of? By the time my youngest was in freshman year at high school I could no longer follow what she was doing in math. Actually, that was probably true in 8th grade. Ok, 7th grade. You get the picture? I'm not a mathematician.Well, I love surprises. I was spellbound by the story of John Nash, who as a young man emerged as one of the most talented mathematicians of his generation. The discussion of how mathematics, especially game theory, was used during the Cold War to plan strategies was beyond fascinating even though I didn't understand it 100%. And then as Nash drew closer to middle age, at the time when he should have been riding the top of the wave, his eccentricity degenerated into outright schizophrenia and cost him his job, his marriage and his rational mind.And THEN--I feel like one of those commercials, ""Wait! There's more!""--after years spent in asylums he somehow managed to emerge from insanity and THEN, something like 40 years after he'd done the work, he was awarded a Nobel Prize for his contribution to game theory. (view spoiler)[By the end of the book he is living in a fragile balance with his ex-wife, still seeing his mathematical friends and caring for a son with schizophrenia. And, most striking of all, he is a much nicer person after his harrowing experience with insanity than he was as an arrogant wunderkind. (hide spoiler)] Nasar provides a very complete, warts-and-all picture of a human thinking machine.This was the abridged version, which was a pity. One day I'll seek out the full version and read it, or listen to it, again. The narrator, by the way, one Edward Hermann, was one of the best I've heard recently; an unremarkable voice in a way but a reading that was as smooth as silk with absolutely NO annoying mannerisms of speech."
22,0571212921,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4247818-syahira,5,"I never would have thought a book on a real life person to be more interesting than the fictitious movie the book had inspired. It was amazing and so painfully cited that although it was an unofficial rendition of the life John Forbes Nash, Jr, it was in fact, more real than ever. Made you really wonder that it wasn't even for someone with a brilliant mind, it was a difficult life and a difficult time.It wasn't always that the truth can be as more puzzling as the reality. ""A Beautiful Mind"" is just like that. It detailed some of the events in Nash's life although seemingly at a distance, almost surgical, but the amount of the content the author had obtained made the movie somehow romanticize the man into a mythical math hero and made his life a film noir.It is a math book. Most of the time it does filled itself with literal theories without equations and numbers, but it was enough to provide concise explanation around Nash's academical life and his significance in the world of economics. For me, that was the most interesting part of the book while the second act, where he became to regress in his personal life was the one that made his story epic and surreal. Although some parts of the book was deeply personal and it felt invasive knowing about his marriage life and his life with his family, it didn't let go of the basic human story this book carry.What the book reveal to its audience was that this man who suffered manic depression, despite his gifts in logical and problem solving and impressive academic career, is still as human as us. With limitations and constraint, with problems and fault, strange and alien as he was with the rest of us, he wasn't flawless but his mind was much more than that and even in his suffering, everything made the man more than the rest of us.Oh, I caught a Doctor Who reference in the book. Find them."
23,0571212921,http://goodreads.com/user/show/171430-rivka,4,"This is one of those books where writing a review was so daunting that I didn't get to it right away . . . and so never got to it at all.But even though it has now been almost 3 years since I read it, I will try to come up with something. Because I see several friends who had it as ""to-read"" 3 years ago still have not read it, and they should!I enjoyed the movie that is loosely based on this book. But it takes a lot of liberties with the facts -- skipping Nash's early life altogether, ignoring/omitting his other son and other relationships, ignoring the fact that he and his wife were in fact divorced for many years. It also gets game theory really, really wrong. And the schizophrenic spy stuff came from the minds of the filmmakers. The movie took the real life of John Nash, trimmed off many of the unsightly bits, polished it up and added some color. Makes for a very good movie, but not an accurate biography.Sylvia Nassar gives us the real John Nash, in all his too-human glory, warts and all. She also gives a nice look at game theory which is very readable to the layperson. Her research and interviews were clearly exhaustive, and her presentation of Nash's life is well-written and multi-layered.If there is ever some reason for my biography to be written, I want Sylvia Nassar to do it."
24,0571212921,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5973308-david-boyce,0,"Well Well, if you want to see a nice film about a nice man conquering a nice mental illness then watch the film. If you want to find out about an awful guy getting an awful disease and ruining the lives of everybody that got close to him, then read the book. Sylvia Nasar paints a painful picture of loss. She describes the mystery world of schizophrenia as seen through the eyes of those people most hurt by it, the family and friends of John Nash. As a reader I couldn’t help but sympathise with Alicia and Eleanor and his children. He won the Nobel prize, but other than that John Nash was a complete failure as a human being. His remarkable recovery from schizophrenia and his ability to solve mathematical problems never quite make up for the awful neglect and selfishness of this man. Sylvia Nasar doesn’t hero worship though, she paints it as she sees it.The book is written fairly monotonously and is not that easy to read, though I did finish it in two sittings. Sometimes it seems that Sylvia struggles to make sense of her own notes and throws in disjointed quotes and snippets from other sources in a less than homogeneous way. In places this ruins the flow of the story. Ultimately the book is worth reading simply because of its honesty. "
25,0571212921,http://goodreads.com/user/show/21707944-travelin,4,"Update of 7/2017: I recently learned that John Nash had a letter of recommendation written by Herbert Simon, he of the Nobel Prize deconstructing Rational Model Theory. Who knows, maybe Nash and Simon were working on the same problems in some way. But it appears that Nash was already of two minds in early university days: his own and Simon's. Then again, have you ever noticed how many bank clerks, librarians, grammar school teachers, and accountants become paranoid, tinpot dictators somehow?Original review:John Nash won his Nobel for economic models based on game theory. This was the popular attempt to reduce human enterprises to closed-world, zero-sum rational (logical?) models. Subsequent economists have won Nobels for saying that this is simply impossible.I'm not any sort of expert, but it's just possible that paranoia builds up in a person who tries to build castles of sand on a sand bar. Counter-intuitively, the book suggests he calmed himself by working with computers."
26,0571212921,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4548913-danamarie1993,5," In A beautiful mind it tells a story about Mr. Nash. He is like all of the other kids when he was younger. The book is a time line of his life. As the story proceeds, you will get pulled into his world. There are some of problems in his life that he will have to face or go through. He also, triumphs his old fears of his school and his friends. Towards the middle of the story; Like everyone in the story, Mr.Nash goes through some changes. He also,meets some new people that shares his interest in his studying; which is mathamatices. Mr.Nash works in a ivyleaugue school as a teacher. Through his teaching years, he becomes accutsomed to working all the time. Which leads to this ""gift"" he recevies later in the story. I believe this book is inspiring, because this man as went though colleges, a hospital, and a new family with a mental disorder. He did all of that and in return he gets something worth wild. This book touches my heart in a way no other book has done before. If you like to read about a man with a passion to learn, who learns how to face this fears and who gets thought a mental disorder then, you should read this story. "
27,0571212921,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4091267-rebecca-huston,5,"One of the best books on a Nobel laureate that I have ever read. John Nash is one of those men that managed to transcend a very difficult life and reach the apex of succeeding in the scientific world -- winning a Nobel prize. His Game Theory changed the twentieth century, both good and bad, and his struggle with schizophrenia is one that anyone who is coping with mental illness themselves, or in someone that they care for, is one that inspires and educates. I heartily recommend this one. Five stars overall.For the longer review, please go here:http://www.epinions.com/review/A_Beau..."

Nassar's book provides a wealth of detail about the maverick Nobel Laureate and a glimpse into his amazing life.
29,0571212921,http://goodreads.com/user/show/50052704-omama,5,"This is a standout biography of Noble Prize winner John Nash; a brilliant mathematician, which manages to combine some fairly detailed discussions of mathematics as a field, the scientific milieu of the 20th century, and mental illness and treatment in the 20th century, with a meticulous exploration of John Nash's life. I had to watch the movie based on this book for my Clinical Psychology class, to get a glimpse of his life-long struggles with Schizophrenia; and boy, was I hooked. On impulse, I had to go and read the book, also. The book is based on different parts of Nash's life; the first part covers Nash’s early life and mathematical blossoming; the second part elucidates his burgeoning relationships and the importance of connections to the outside world, as well as his growing star and significant mathematical contributions. The third section delves into some of the roots of his coming mental illness, both in terms of mathematical failures and turmoil within his personal life, as well as the first acute symptoms and subsequent hospitalization. The fourth part dives deeply into his downfall and plunge into mental illness, with the psychological reasoning and process behind it. Finally, the fifth portion explores Nash’s redemption and acceptance back into the mathematical and economics community, while also exploring his attempts to reconnect with his family members.Overall, Nassar paints a vivid, empathetic, and complex picture of schizophrenia through Nash and the devastation that it can wreak on a person’s life, if not properly treated. She flawlessly combines anecdotes, psychological theory and history of the treatment to give the reader an in-depth understanding of the Schizophrenic disorder."
30,0571212921,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1400289-chana,4,"Once I started reading this book I realized that the movie, which I had enjoyed, was entertainment, concerning itself more with the strange delusions of John Nash's mental illness than with the life of the real man. More than half of this book is about John Nash before he became ill at age 30. He was this totally arrogant young math genius, eccentric and homosexually inclined. He was pretty hard to like because he was obnoxious and unkind and very self-centered. (I was reminded of how my mother always used to say that we should be glad that we weren't geniuses because they had a very hard time making friends because they were so different from other people. I can't say her statement carried much weight because I had trouble making friends and didn't have the consolation of being a genius. But that was back in the mid-60's and I wondered as I read if John Nash's tragedy had not entered the national consciousness rendering ""genius"" a less than desirable condition). I was particularly appalled by his disregard for his first child and the child's mother. His level of maturity was shocking to me, like maybe that of an 8 to 10 year old boy when he was in his 20's. He was unable to be much of a father to 2nd son either as the child was born at the time that he was becoming ill. So John Nash, still involved in homosexual relationships, fathers a child out of wedlock, deserts mother and child, marries a different woman and fathers another child, and has his ego trampled severly underfoot when he is not acknowledged for his brilliant work by not winning prestigious awards. He then undertakes to solve the Riemann Hypothesis (don't ask me to explain what that is) and his mind just starts making all these weird and faulty connections with numerology, politics and religion. His math becomes gibberish and his actions inexplicable. The next 30 years are essentially lost to him as he and his family suffer through hospitalizations, treatments and all the sorrows this brings.Strangely, John Nash starts to recover on his own and becomes more and more rational. He wins a Nobel in Economics, gives lectures, and remarries Alicia who had divorced him many years earlier but continued to be his main support and friend all the intervening years. It really is miraculous. Not only that but he seemed to mature quite a bit and become a much nicer person than he had been. The sad thing is that his younger son is also schizophrenic and has been in and out of hospitals for years. Alicia and John care for him at home and my heart goes out to them in this. Small point, but I really didn't like the cover of the book, which shows the actor who plays John Nash rather than John Nash himself."

 ""People have a mental picture that this is a difficult problem. Maybe that's the stumbling block. Maybe, if people didn't realize that the problem was 'hard,' they could solve it.""
I am very impressed with how they adapted this into a movie. This book is more factual than the emotionally driven theme of the movie and I liked that. I liked how they differed on that aspect. I loved both of them in their own formats of publications.The maths and physics theories went over my head, but for once I didn't mind reading about them because I was invested in getting to know John Nash better. One of the things that really interested me was the mention of the Italian mathematician ""Ennio De Giorgi"", who before his death was attempting to prove the existence of God by using Math; I want to read that paper to see what he came up with even if its incomplete. At first, I wasn't sure if I found Nash not paying for child support and other unlikeable things that he did, a personality flaw making him a douche or did his schizophrenia justify that behavior? I found it surprising how sympathetic I was towards the Russell Crowe version of Nash as my feelings towards him were a bit negative at this point, but later in the book I found my sympathy kicking back in and felt awed by Alica and Nash's relationship and struggles. It was infact as sad as the movie, even if the writing style of the book was more serious which made me feel like I was reading a research paper at times and that isn't my preferred reading genre but all's well, it pulled through and kept me engaged regardless. I am glad the book ended in a hopeful tone, with Nash getting better and helping around with Johnny and reconciling with Alicia and his first born John David.This will be one of my most memorable reads. I am glad my sister bought this book, 'cause otherwise I wouldn't have picked this one up and would have missed out on a great read."

Well, make it an exception.It is not because the book is not well-written, though powerful and mesmerising it is, nor is It not exceptionally detailed and real. The fact is it's exactly because it was so real that I became evasive of this genius and form an indelible impression on his darksides.When a genius conceived a great achievement for mankind, people Marvel at his grandure and are prone to be deliberately neglectful and blindful of his defects,however fatal and unscrupulous they are. They justified his evils in the name of paying attributes to a great mind. Well, if they think this way, IMHO,screw these people and those geniuses!Nash was a true genius and he was Fortunate enough to have Alicia with him.I always guard against those self-proclaimed masters or experts, vigillant of their hypocrisy.For geniune talents, I admire their contributions but still treat them as people not saints. When I perceived their darkness, I wouln't be surprised.Dedicate this short review to Alicia!"

35,0571212921,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7861828-matt,3,"This book took me through the full range of emotions. I felt awe, disgust, pity, wonder, joy, confusion, resolution, etc... Most of all it made me introspective as to how I treat others, and how the entire field of Psychiatry treats patients.First of all, I learned that the movie took MANY liberties with the facts. It is about 20% truth, and the rest is style and effects. For many years I have enjoyed the movie and recommended it to friends. So I felt disillusioned when I found out how false it was. But then I thought about the truth, John Nash’s life, and the goals of the film.John Nash did not have visual hallucinations. He didn’t see people who weren’t there, and he never imagined a roommate, or a little girl. But how else do you portray in a movie the reality of his delusions? How do you show a movie audience the absolute belief he had, and how much it had to hurt to find out that much of your life…is imaginary. He often thought he was working for the FBI, or for the world government. He thought he was Royalty, an Arab refugee, Job, Castro, a mouse. He thought he was traveling to Cairo, Kabul, Thebes, Mongolia, or even purgatory, inferno, or some sort of polluted heaven. He lived in constant fear of annihilation, Armageddon, the Apocalypse, the Final day of Judgment, and of certain ominous dates such as May 29th.So I give the film license for showing Schizophrenia in a false light because it portrays the feeling, and the pain and despair that go along with it very well.Here are other interesting things I never knew from the film.John Nash was a draft dodger. It didn’t just scare him…it mortified him. He worked diligently for years to avoid the draft, wrote letters, used University faculty and presidents, and employed every means imaginable to avoid the draft.Alicia (Nash’s wife) was not his first girlfriend, nor the mother of his first child. Eleanor was. They had a son named John David. His last name was not Nash however, because Eleanor and Nash were never married. Though they remained together for some time, and he sometimes spoke of marriage, it never happened.Alicia at first perturbed me. She thought Nash was cute, and pursued him with great vigor (even getting a job at his favorite hang-out, just to see him more often.) Eventually they started sleeping together, until Eleanor arrived at his place one night, and found her there. After much screaming and crying by Eleanor, Nash said “My perfect little world is ruined.”Alicia had quite a different reaction. Eleanor called Alicia to complain, and met with her to discuss the fact that She and Nash were getting married and already had a son. Alicia was pleased. She took the meeting as a sign that “She was beginning to matter.” She continued their courtship until eventually Alicia and Nash were married and had their own son, John Charles.My initial thought was –“Alicia is so ruthless and cold that she deserves what’s coming.” I later regretted that thought. She stuck with Nash through the worst of times. She followed him all over Europe trying to find a place where he was content and sane, but it never happened. He bankrupted her, and left her many, many times.Nash had homosexual flings. While working for a think tank called RAND, he was arrested in a restroom police sting for “indecent exposure.” This was one of many recorded occurrences when he had intimate relationships with men.Eventually Alicia divorced him, and she believed it was for his good. He no longer had the stress of a family or obligations…he could go where he wanted when he wanted with no thought for a family.Years later he finally settled down at Princeton again, and became known as “The Phantom.” He walked the hallways and wrote cryptic messages or math problems on the chalk boards.He became a legend at Princeton among the students. Anybody who was too much of a grind or who lacked social graces was warned that he or she was “going to end up like the phantom”. Yet if a new student complained that having him around made him feel uncomfortable, he was immediately warned: “He was a better mathematician then you’ll ever be.”John Nash was a brilliant mathematician. He solved problems in ways no one else had ever imagined. He proved that “every Riemannian manifold can be isometrically embedded into some Euclidean space.”(FYI – this book has a ton of Math that I did not understand but accepted that it was really hard and really complex)During this period at Princeton, after many hospitalizations, insulin coma therapy, and many attempts to renounce his U.S. citizenship and become a “Citizen of the World”; Alicia eventually let him move back in with her, and get to know his second son. And years later, after he won the Nobel Prize, they did remarry. Even when they were divorced, she felt responsible for him. She suffered huge amounts, and it didn’t end with him. Their son, John Charles, also has Paranoid Schizophrenia. I may not have liked how she entered his life, but she certainly proved her worth, and was indespensible.I’ll end this book report with an Interesting Fact I learned from the book.The Nobel prize in Economics (which Nash won in 1994) is not technically a Nobel Prize. The prize was not one of the awards set out in the will of Alfred Nobel. He listed only physics, chemistry, physiology or medicine, and literature, which have been awarded since 1901. In 1968 an award was added for economics by the Central Bank of Sweden. And they provide the funding separately for the “Sveriges Riksbank Prize in Economic Sciences in Memory of Alfred Nobel”P.S. This book changed the way I see Schizophrenia, and how I interact with Schizophrenic patients and their families. It has been a very worthwhile book for me. I hope others choose to enjoy it as well."

This is my favorite photo of this book. This shows a very young and and absent-minded-looking John Nash. I read this book because I watched the mmovie and I wanted to know more details about his privileged mind that was able to find a way to deal with his mental illness without the medication that made him be someone different from who he wanted to be. This idea of having to sacrifice oneself's essence in order to avoid the horrible sympthoms of mental illness is a conundrum that many mental patients face. A lot of them decide one way or the other, and this is one notorious case about one who decided to deal with his demons himself, and had to pay a high price for that.This is the cover and editorial page of the book I read:

I really liked this book, and think that the movie is a really good first approach to read about this punctual experience of mental illness and a gifted mind.***I also have a blog! Link here: http://lunairereadings.blogspot.com"
37,0571212921,http://goodreads.com/user/show/49938-anastacia,5,"Though it was a bit slow in places (which is probably to be expected given John Nash’s career in mathematics), I really enjoyed reading A Beautiful Mind. I’m interested in history and mental illness and, lately, I have become absolutely fascinated by some of the history of mathematical geniuses, as they tend to be quite a rather unique bunch. I saw the movie version of the book when it was released several years ago, and while I don’t remember much about it other than I liked it, I’m pretty sure the movie was extremely sugarcoated. This was a raw, real account that is somehow simultaneously joyous and tragic. One of the things I am coming to appreciate most in a biography is when the author resists painting a one-dimensional, rosy picture of the subject. Even the best people are imperfect and I resent when all the subject’s flaws are just glossed over as though they never existed. The author did a fabulous job here in painting the entire picture of the great man; a man that is not perfect and, in many ways, an extremely difficult person to deal with. Nash was an incredibly complex man and his genius was both a gift and a curse. He didn’t get along well with people, he was arrogant at times, lacking in social skills and struggled with his sexuality. Rather than coming off as unlikable, though, I was rooting for him and I finished the book with a deep appreciation for the man and his legacy, which, I should add, I don’t completely understand as I am not a part of the mathematics world. And that was another aspect of the book I appreciated – I don’t think it is necessary to be a part of the mathematics world – or even have a deep appreciation for it – to enjoy the book. I’m more interested in the way the brain works and in psychological illnesses than I am math, but on the other hand, I am close to several deeply mathematical-minded people and that may make reading about it more interesting to me. The book was, as I mentioned, very slow in some places and I would have appreciated reading more about his illness than all the great detail about his mathematical achievements, but I suppose that I can’t complain about it because I knew what I was getting into. I just feel that it could have been more interesting if more attention were paid to other details. I ended up skimming some of the last chapters on the history and procedures of the Nobel. I just didn’t find any of that very interesting, and, again, the time and detail could have been better spent on other aspects, in my opinion.I’m on the fence about giving the book 3 or 4 stars. 3 seems unnecessarily harsh, but because it was slow in the beginning and a bit slow in a few chapters toward the end, I can’t really give it a 4. This is another instance where I wish GoodReads would implement half-stars in the rating system. I’d recommend this book to those interested in history, mathematics, biographies of geniuses, and those deeply interested in not only mental illness but also how the brain works in many different ways. I do know that some may find it boring. Even something with the slightest hint of math can be a turn-off for some folks. So, while I would recommend, I’d also add the caveat that one understands that it is not merely about his schizophrenia but his life as a mathematical genius in general."
38,0571212921,http://goodreads.com/user/show/33019-leonora,4,"Having read the book, I don't think I can see the movie. From what I've heard the film is quite good and tells the story of a genius gone mad. I gather that's where the similarity ends.John Nash is (for most of the book) an egotist who enjoys playing dangerous pranks on others, brags that he is one of three smartest men at Princeton, treats his lovers (male and female) as though they are only there for his amusement/pleasure. He is smart, cruel, and completely socially inept. Until his illness, it almost seems like he has Asperger Syndrome (a mild form of autism).However, as Nasar beautifully describes, this is all in line with his personality, which would eventually become schizoid. And, despite his faults I did root for him as he attempts to solve problems no one, even other top mathematicians, have the guts (or audacity) to attempt.Nasar, for the most part, is my favorite kind of biographer. She knows her subject well and doesn't treat him with kid gloves. She accurately interprets his personality in terms of his past and makes him human, understandable, despite his shortcomings. In this way, she reminded me of Jack El-Hai who wrote the brilliant biography, ""The Lobotomist"".Sidenote: his gay relationships were known at Princeton & MIT. I had no idea the math community in the 50s wasn't horribly homophobic! This was one of the most interesting things in the book."
39,0571212921,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2154122-a,1,"Well, I will not read this book again. Nor do I recommend it to anyone.I admit it was interesting to learn more about John Nash, particularly just how good he was, and what his colleagues had to say about his brilliant, beautiful mind. It was eye opening to read about the time of his life when he actively began struggling with his illness, and his subsequent recovery. It was gratifying to read about his Nobel Prize experience.All that said, it was not at all ""good"" enough to entice me to spend my time reading again. First of all, it's a book about a mathematician. A brilliant mathematician whose works I don't really understand even when they are put in ""plain"" English, as she occasionally did. And since he had essentially no life outside of his mathematics, until you get to the part where he is ill, and can no longer do math, it talks a lot about things I don't understand.Also, while there was not a language problem per se, the instances where there was a foul word used it was one of the foulest, and quite off-putting.And last but probably most of all I will not read it again because some of the anecdotes she chose to include about his life just plain made me uncomfortable. I felt a little bit like I had invaded his private life, because even though she never really gave details or was graphic, it just felt too inimately personal."
40,0571212921,http://goodreads.com/user/show/263190-jill,4,"Though I am severely dull when it comes to mathematics (I can’t do any math that moves), I found this biography fascinating and very moving. I enjoyed it all the way through and thought very interesting the story behind Nash’s Nobel Prize. I thought the book was really well written and not off-putting to people like me, who have a hard time wrapping their head around anything mathematically complicated. It’s rather a sad story, but much, much better than the film. I also learned a ton about game theory, what it’s about, and its usage in business, government, and personal strategy. I also learned that mathematics is considered a young man’s field. It seems perfectly reasonable to me, that because of the intense mental rigor, you’d wear out as you age. I love that Nash went back to work after he recovered. I was also very impressed by the strength of his wife, Alicia. His son’s mental illness is really tragic, but I love that Nash takes care of him. A really great, worthwhile, and enjoyable read."

48,0571212921,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3816725-larry-bassett,3,"It is hard to know how to say that John Nash is a fairly unique individual. You have to start with the fact that he was a brilliant mathematician. To be a mathematician with a brain that works in fairly amazing ways is hard enough to explain in words I suspect. When I was in graduate school I lived in a house with two other women, one of whom was a graduate student in mathematics. I wish I could find Janet Woodruff today to talk with her about John Nash.John Nash was also someone who suffered from schizophrenia and apparently came back from that after 25 years of suffering and treatment and hospitalization. The book says that mathematics is a specialty of young people and that people in that field rise to the heights of their profession at a young age. The book follows the life of John Nash through a long period of severe disability that also displayed how mathematical Rockstars experience life in academia. It talks about how people who are extremely bright also often have peculiar social disabilities. We follow the life of John Nash through many ups and downs. He is a unique individual from many different points of view. Once again the fact that I experience this as an audible book was an asset for me in getting through a story that I might not have managed to overcome if I had to turn paper pages."
49,0571212921,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1769011-arminzerella,3,"John Nash was a prominent mathematician in the prime of his career – best known for his work on game theory (and its applications in economics) – when he was diagnosed with schizophrenia. Already somewhat eccentric and socially awkward, his illness pushed him over into paranoid and delusional. He was unable to function in the real world and had to be institutionalized. He received treatments, some of which were more successful than others, and like other schizophrenics he relapsed many times. It seemed for many years that John Nash would never recover the thing he valued most – his mind. And then, seemingly out of nowhere, he got better. He became accustomed to the extra noise in his head and found that he was able to distinguish between the thoughts/ideas that were “normal” and the ones that were “crazy.” He began working again as a mathematician and making contributions to his field. Sylvia Nasar’s book is much more detailed than the movie that was based on it, but the way that Nash’s illness is revealed in the movie is much more dramatic (because you’re seeing things from inside of Nash’s head and he doesn’t realize he’s delusional). Although he is described as tall and attractive, there was much about John Nash that was off-putting to many. He could be arrogant and cruel and during his young life he often found himself on the outside – the social outcast of the social outcasts. His brilliance, however, was unquestionable. Nasar spares us most of the mathematical details (which the layperson wouldn’t grasp – even Nash’s colleagues were often gobsmacked at his unique approaches to problems), but brings the man to life. I don’t really follow the mathematics (computations! proofs! reasoning!) or understand the importance of the work that he’s done/doing, but I found his breakthrough out of schizophrenia fascinating. Nash has a son who is also afflicted with this illness."
50,0571212921,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2393446-anne-hawn-smith,5,"The story of the brilliant John Nash is an incredibly complicated one. Did his madness contribute to his difficult, arrogant personality or was he just one of those people who has a severe social disability? I came up with more questions than answers after reading this book. Did he have Asbergers syndrome? Was this why he was so inept at social relations, or was he so contemptuous of everyone around him because he recognized early that he was intellectually so far superior to everyone he knew? Did his brilliance allow him to triumph over schizophrenia of was it just one of those miracles that happen for no reason? I think what I learned from this book was the fragility of the human mind and the weakness of our human vessels. How could someone this brilliant be beset by so many problems? Why is it that genius of any type, intellectual, artistic or diplomatic seems to be so closely related to deficits in other areas of development? Do all great gifts come with a cost? Is the idiot/savant just an extreme version of this paradox? Why couldn't a mind so brilliant find some way to protect himself from madness? "
51,0571212921,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10918354-nurul-badriah,5,"I rarely read autobiography book because it's quite boring for me. But this book is such an amazing and touching book. This is my all time favorite book that I will read over and over again and will recommend to all the people around the world to read it. In my opinion all the smart people have some mental illness problems, not all of them but plenty of them do have psychological problems. This book shows us about how people undergoes psychological problems like schizophrenia in this story and to overcome them by the help of family, friends and society. This book talk about John Nash and about his theory and illness, the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences. This book just took me by storm by the uniqueness, ironically enough because it was based on a real life situation. This book touched me on many levels. The psychology was intriguing, the mathematical philosophies was actually amazing and the humanistic side of love. A Beautiful Mind was by far the most original,realistic, intelligent and heart touching book that I have ever read. John Nash was truly worthy of the Noble Prize."
52,0571212921,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1354567-melissa,4,"This was a tough read. Halfway through I disliked John Nash so intensely that I wasn't sure I could finish the book. He was arrogant, rude, selfish, sexist, and even frightening. The book also highlighted how culturally we are willing to accept not only difficult but harmful behavior from people who are highly gifted, which I hate. However, it's also nearly impossible to disentangle Nash from his illness, and I couldn't help wondering how his mental condition figured into his behavior even before he became obviously ill. By the end of the book, I had much more sympathy for what he endured as a product of his time (the 50s and 60s) as well as what he endured from his illness (insulin shock therapy sounds horrific). The moment toward the end when he asks if it's okay for him to enter a cafeteria at Princeton because he wasn't faculty actually drew tears because it was such a contrast from his earlier arrogance. Nash was a fascinating, complicated, messy, unlikeable person who, in the words of one of his colleagues, was still ""worth saving."" This book is an unflinching look at all of the different facets of that reality."
53,0571212921,http://goodreads.com/user/show/46089881-elsa-k,4,"I had recently re watched ""A Beautiful Mind"" and I was inspired to read the book. John Nash was a fascinating figure. But I will say the movie definitely Hollywoodized him. In the book he is very disturbing, especially in his younger years. He did and said some terrible things. He had a son by his mistress and pretty much abandoned him. He was arrested for exposing himself, tried to come on to other men etc. Sometimes the book was hard to get through as I didn't want to spend so much time with such a creeper! But I still found it interesting, especially how he managed to control his mental health issues over the years. His love story was strange to me- what did Alyssa see in him? I didn't understand all the math background, so I would skim some of that. It was sad to hear how he struggled and was treated in his mental illness. Also sad to hear his second son struggles with schizophrenia too. I would still recommend it as in interesting book, especially to someone with a math background."
54,0571212921,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5153361-annie,4,"I loved the movie so much I was a bit tentative to read the book(in case the story was idealized and distorted exceedingly). However, the book was far more indepth, interesting, and potent that I could have imagined. The story was much more real, wrought with tragedy, beauty, and poignancy. I think if the movie would have adhered more to the truth it would have been far more interesting but it was still well done. Not only did the book provide indepth information in the personal life and accomplishments of Nash, but it also branched into the history of mathematics(related to Nash), Princeton, the Cold War mathematicians, sanitariums and pyschiatric methods during the time, and the nomination and debate related to Nobel prize nominees. At times however I found the mathematical information a bit confusing but I'm only in 11th grade so my incomprehension can not be completely blamed on the book itself. All together it was a fascinating, detailed work."
55,0571212921,http://goodreads.com/user/show/14808426-dhwani-swadia,5,"Read the full review here: https://thereandtheir.com/2017/01/25/...The book takes you on a journey of the life of the extraordinary man, John Nash. Since the story begins right at the birth, we come to understand the kind of person that he is. I appreciate the fact that the book paints the good, the bad and the ugly all with the same brush. This helps us to come to know exactly what kind of a person John Nash was.A beautiful mind is more on the fact that if a person really puts his mind to it, he can come out of a disease that was presumably incurable than the mathematical as well as the economic contributions. The book deals more with the life events than the mathematical equations. I was hoping to read something about how he came upon the Game Theory as well as other discoveries that he made in the field, but I suppose the reason it was omitted was that the field in which Nash worked was so abstract that it would have put off many readers."
56,0571212921,http://goodreads.com/user/show/445677-scott,5,"A very well-written and engaging biography of John Nash. While many readers may have already seen the movie version, I had not. Nash certainly presents a difficult character; at times it is hard to muster sympathy for him, but ultimately I was heartbroken by his schizophrenia and ""lost years."" The fact that he has enjoyed a remission of this disease, and a return to a somewhat normal life, is a testament to the will and love of those around him who rallied support and resources to care for him during his long periods of bizarre behavior. Author Nasar describes the mathematics without getting mired in the details, so the reader has a sense of the import of Nash's achievements without a learned appreciation of them. I enjoyed this book, but will want to read something more light-hearted next!"

I enjoyed the movie more.To be fair, it is easier to paint a tale with more likable characters, intrigue and fairy-tale turnaround, when not restrained by real life. I had no idea how much real-life was altered for the movie. What bothered me most about the book was that at several points, I felt I was reading less of a biography about Nash, and more a story about the lives of people around him and the academic world that he wandered through... with occasional notes about Nash behaving brashly."
60,0571212921,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1400289-chana,4,"Once I started reading this book I realized that the movie, which I had enjoyed, was entertainment, concerning itself more with the strange delusions of John Nash's mental illness than with the life of the real man. More than half of this book is about John Nash before he became ill at age 30. He was this totally arrogant young math genius, eccentric and homosexually inclined. He was pretty hard to like because he was obnoxious and unkind and very self-centered. (I was reminded of how my mother always used to say that we should be glad that we weren't geniuses because they had a very hard time making friends because they were so different from other people. I can't say her statement carried much weight because I had trouble making friends and didn't have the consolation of being a genius. But that was back in the mid-60's and I wondered as I read if John Nash's tragedy had not entered the national consciousness rendering ""genius"" a less than desirable condition). I was particularly appalled by his disregard for his first child and the child's mother. His level of maturity was shocking to me, like maybe that of an 8 to 10 year old boy when he was in his 20's. He was unable to be much of a father to 2nd son either as the child was born at the time that he was becoming ill. So John Nash, still involved in homosexual relationships, fathers a child out of wedlock, deserts mother and child, marries a different woman and fathers another child, and has his ego trampled severly underfoot when he is not acknowledged for his brilliant work by not winning prestigious awards. He then undertakes to solve the Riemann Hypothesis (don't ask me to explain what that is) and his mind just starts making all these weird and faulty connections with numerology, politics and religion. His math becomes gibberish and his actions inexplicable. The next 30 years are essentially lost to him as he and his family suffer through hospitalizations, treatments and all the sorrows this brings.Strangely, John Nash starts to recover on his own and becomes more and more rational. He wins a Nobel in Economics, gives lectures, and remarries Alicia who had divorced him many years earlier but continued to be his main support and friend all the intervening years. It really is miraculous. Not only that but he seemed to mature quite a bit and become a much nicer person than he had been. The sad thing is that his younger son is also schizophrenic and has been in and out of hospitals for years. Alicia and John care for him at home and my heart goes out to them in this. Small point, but I really didn't like the cover of the book, which shows the actor who plays John Nash rather than John Nash himself."

 ""People have a mental picture that this is a difficult problem. Maybe that's the stumbling block. Maybe, if people didn't realize that the problem was 'hard,' they could solve it.""
I am very impressed with how they adapted this into a movie. This book is more factual than the emotionally driven theme of the movie and I liked that. I liked how they differed on that aspect. I loved both of them in their own formats of publications.The maths and physics theories went over my head, but for once I didn't mind reading about them because I was invested in getting to know John Nash better. One of the things that really interested me was the mention of the Italian mathematician ""Ennio De Giorgi"", who before his death was attempting to prove the existence of God by using Math; I want to read that paper to see what he came up with even if its incomplete. At first, I wasn't sure if I found Nash not paying for child support and other unlikeable things that he did, a personality flaw making him a douche or did his schizophrenia justify that behavior? I found it surprising how sympathetic I was towards the Russell Crowe version of Nash as my feelings towards him were a bit negative at this point, but later in the book I found my sympathy kicking back in and felt awed by Alica and Nash's relationship and struggles. It was infact as sad as the movie, even if the writing style of the book was more serious which made me feel like I was reading a research paper at times and that isn't my preferred reading genre but all's well, it pulled through and kept me engaged regardless. I am glad the book ended in a hopeful tone, with Nash getting better and helping around with Johnny and reconciling with Alicia and his first born John David.This will be one of my most memorable reads. I am glad my sister bought this book, 'cause otherwise I wouldn't have picked this one up and would have missed out on a great read."

Well, make it an exception.It is not because the book is not well-written, though powerful and mesmerising it is, nor is It not exceptionally detailed and real. The fact is it's exactly because it was so real that I became evasive of this genius and form an indelible impression on his darksides.When a genius conceived a great achievement for mankind, people Marvel at his grandure and are prone to be deliberately neglectful and blindful of his defects,however fatal and unscrupulous they are. They justified his evils in the name of paying attributes to a great mind. Well, if they think this way, IMHO,screw these people and those geniuses!Nash was a true genius and he was Fortunate enough to have Alicia with him.I always guard against those self-proclaimed masters or experts, vigillant of their hypocrisy.For geniune talents, I admire their contributions but still treat them as people not saints.

65,0571212921,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7861828-matt,3,"This book took me through the full range of emotions. I felt awe, disgust, pity, wonder, joy, confusion, resolution, etc... Most of all it made me introspective as to how I treat others, and how the entire field of Psychiatry treats patients.First of all, I learned that the movie took MANY liberties with the facts. It is about 20% truth, and the rest is style and effects. For many years I have enjoyed the movie and recommended it to friends. So I felt disillusioned when I found out how false it was. But then I thought about the truth, John Nash’s life, and the goals of the film.John Nash did not have visual hallucinations. He didn’t see people who weren’t there, and he never imagined a roommate, or a little girl. But how else do you portray in a movie the reality of his delusions? How do you show a movie audience the absolute belief he had, and how much it had to hurt to find out that much of your life…is imaginary. He often thought he was working for the FBI, or for the world government. He thought he was Royalty, an Arab refugee, Job, Castro, a mouse. He thought he was traveling to Cairo, Kabul, Thebes, Mongolia, or even purgatory, inferno, or some sort of polluted heaven. He lived in constant fear of annihilation, Armageddon, the Apocalypse, the Final day of Judgment, and of certain ominous dates such as May 29th.So I give the film license for showing Schizophrenia in a false light because it portrays the feeling, and the pain and despair that go along with it very well.Here are other interesting things I never knew from the film.John Nash was a draft dodger. It didn’t just scare him…it mortified him. He worked diligently for years to avoid the draft, wrote letters, used University faculty and presidents, and employed every means imaginable to avoid the draft.Alicia (Nash’s wife) was not his first girlfriend, nor the mother of his first child. Eleanor was. They had a son named John David. His last name was not Nash however, because Eleanor and Nash were never married. Though they remained together for some time, and he sometimes spoke of marriage, it never happened.Alicia at first perturbed me. She thought Nash was cute, and pursued him with great vigor (even getting a job at his favorite hang-out, just to see him more often.) Eventually they started sleeping together, until Eleanor arrived at his place one night, and found her there. After much screaming and crying by Eleanor, Nash said “My perfect little world is ruined.”Alicia had quite a different reaction. Eleanor called Alicia to complain, and met with her to discuss the fact that She and Nash were getting married and already had a son. Alicia was pleased. She took the meeting as a sign that “She was beginning to matter.” She continued their courtship until eventually Alicia and Nash were married and had their own son, John Charles.My initial thought was –“Alicia is so ruthless and cold that she deserves what’s coming.” I later regretted that thought. She stuck with Nash through the worst of times. She followed him all over Europe trying to find a place where he was content and sane, but it never happened. He bankrupted her, and left her many, many times.Nash had homosexual flings. While working for a think tank called RAND, he was arrested in a restroom police sting for “indecent exposure.” This was one of many recorded occurrences when he had intimate relationships with men.Eventually Alicia divorced him, and she believed it was for his good. He no longer had the stress of a family or obligations…he could go where he wanted when he wanted with no thought for a family.Years later he finally settled down at Princeton again, and became known as “The Phantom.” He walked the hallways and wrote cryptic messages or math problems on the chalk boards.He became a legend at Princeton among the students. Anybody who was too much of a grind or who lacked social graces was warned that he or she was “going to end up like the phantom”. Yet if a new student complained that having him around made him feel uncomfortable, he was immediately warned: “He was a better mathematician then you’ll ever be.”John Nash was a brilliant mathematician. He solved problems in ways no one else had ever imagined. He proved that “every Riemannian manifold can be isometrically embedded into some Euclidean space.”(FYI – this book has a ton of Math that I did not understand but accepted that it was really hard and really complex)During this period at Princeton, after many hospitalizations, insulin coma therapy, and many attempts to renounce his U.S. citizenship and become a “Citizen of the World”; Alicia eventually let him move back in with her, and get to know his second son. And years later, after he won the Nobel Prize, they did remarry. Even when they were divorced, she felt responsible for him. She suffered huge amounts, and it didn’t end with him. Their son, John Charles, also has Paranoid Schizophrenia. I may not have liked how she entered his life, but she certainly proved her worth, and was indespensible.I’ll end this book report with an Interesting Fact I learned from the book.The Nobel prize in Economics (which Nash won in 1994) is not technically a Nobel Prize. The prize was not one of the awards set out in the will of Alfred Nobel. He listed only physics, chemistry, physiology or medicine, and literature, which have been awarded since 1901. In 1968 an award was added for economics by the Central Bank of Sweden. And they provide the funding separately for the “Sveriges Riksbank Prize in Economic Sciences in Memory of Alfred Nobel”P.S. This book changed the way I see Schizophrenia, and how I interact with Schizophrenic patients and their families. It has been a very worthwhile book for me. I hope others choose to enjoy it as well."

This is my favorite photo of this book. This shows a very young and and absent-minded-looking John Nash. I read this book because I watched the mmovie and I wanted to know more details about his privileged mind that was able to find a way to deal with his mental illness without the medication that made him be someone different from who he wanted to be. This idea of having to sacrifice oneself's essence in order to avoid the horrible sympthoms of mental illness is a conundrum that many mental patients face. A lot of them decide one way or the other, and this is one notorious case about one who decided to deal with his demons himself, and had to pay a high price for that.This is the cover and editorial page of the book I read:

I really liked this book, and think that the movie is a really good first approach to read about this punctual experience of mental illness and a gifted mind.***I also have a blog! Link here: http://lunairereadings.blogspot.com"
67,0571212921,http://goodreads.com/user/show/49938-anastacia,5,"Though it was a bit slow in places (which is probably to be expected given John Nash’s career in mathematics), I really enjoyed reading A Beautiful Mind. I’m interested in history and mental illness and, lately, I have become absolutely fascinated by some of the history of mathematical geniuses, as they tend to be quite a rather unique bunch. I saw the movie version of the book when it was released several years ago, and while I don’t remember much about it other than I liked it, I’m pretty sure the movie was extremely sugarcoated. This was a raw, real account that is somehow simultaneously joyous and tragic. One of the things I am coming to appreciate most in a biography is when the author resists painting a one-dimensional, rosy picture of the subject. Even the best people are imperfect and I resent when all the subject’s flaws are just glossed over as though they never existed. The author did a fabulous job here in painting the entire picture of the great man; a man that is not perfect and, in many ways, an extremely difficult person to deal with. Nash was an incredibly complex man and his genius was both a gift and a curse. He didn’t get along well with people, he was arrogant at times, lacking in social skills and struggled with his sexuality. Rather than coming off as unlikable, though, I was rooting for him and I finished the book with a deep appreciation for the man and his legacy, which, I should add, I don’t completely understand as I am not a part of the mathematics world. And that was another aspect of the book I appreciated – I don’t think it is necessary to be a part of the mathematics world – or even have a deep appreciation for it – to enjoy the book. I’m more interested in the way the brain works and in psychological illnesses than I am math, but on the other hand, I am close to several deeply mathematical-minded people and that may make reading about it more interesting to me. The book was, as I mentioned, very slow in some places and I would have appreciated reading more about his illness than all the great detail about his mathematical achievements, but I suppose that I can’t complain about it because I knew what I was getting into. I just feel that it could have been more interesting if more attention were paid to other details. I ended up skimming some of the last chapters on the history and procedures of the Nobel. I just didn’t find any of that very interesting, and, again, the time and detail could have been better spent on other aspects, in my opinion.I’m on the fence about giving the book 3 or 4 stars. 3 seems unnecessarily harsh, but because it was slow in the beginning and a bit slow in a few chapters toward the end, I can’t really give it a 4. This is another instance where I wish GoodReads would implement half-stars in the rating system. I’d recommend this book to those interested in history, mathematics, biographies of geniuses, and those deeply interested in not only mental illness but also how the brain works in many different ways. I do know that some may find it boring. Even something with the slightest hint of math can be a turn-off for some folks. So, while I would recommend, I’d also add the caveat that one understands that it is not merely about his schizophrenia but his life as a mathematical genius in general."
68,0571212921,http://goodreads.com/user/show/33019-leonora,4,"Having read the book, I don't think I can see the movie. From what I've heard the film is quite good and tells the story of a genius gone mad. I gather that's where the similarity ends.John Nash is (for most of the book) an egotist who enjoys playing dangerous pranks on others, brags that he is one of three smartest men at Princeton, treats his lovers (male and female) as though they are only there for his amusement/pleasure. He is smart, cruel, and completely socially inept. Until his illness, it almost seems like he has Asperger Syndrome (a mild form of autism).However, as Nasar beautifully describes, this is all in line with his personality, which would eventually become schizoid. And, despite his faults I did root for him as he attempts to solve problems no one, even other top mathematicians, have the guts (or audacity) to attempt.Nasar, for the most part, is my favorite kind of biographer. She knows her subject well and doesn't treat him with kid gloves. She accurately interprets his personality in terms of his past and makes him human, understandable, despite his shortcomings. In this way, she reminded me of Jack El-Hai who wrote the brilliant biography, ""The Lobotomist"".Sidenote: his gay relationships were known at Princeton & MIT. I had no idea the math community in the 50s wasn't horribly homophobic! This was one of the most interesting things in the book."
69,0571212921,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2154122-a,1,"Well, I will not read this book again. Nor do I recommend it to anyone.I admit it was interesting to learn more about John Nash, particularly just how good he was, and what his colleagues had to say about his brilliant, beautiful mind. It was eye opening to read about the time of his life when he actively began struggling with his illness, and his subsequent recovery. It was gratifying to read about his Nobel Prize experience.All that said, it was not at all ""good"" enough to entice me to spend my time reading again. First of all, it's a book about a mathematician. A brilliant mathematician whose works I don't really understand even when they are put in ""plain"" English, as she occasionally did. And since he had essentially no life outside of his mathematics, until you get to the part where he is ill, and can no longer do math, it talks a lot about things I don't understand.Also, while there was not a language problem per se, the instances where there was a foul word used it was one of the foulest, and quite off-putting.And last but probably most of all I will not read it again because some of the anecdotes she chose to include about his life just plain made me uncomfortable. I felt a little bit like I had invaded his private life, because even though she never really gave details or was graphic, it just felt too inimately personal."

I enjoyed it all the way through and thought very interesting the story behind Nash’s Nobel Prize. I thought the book was really well written and not off-putting to people like me, who have a hard time wrapping their head around anything mathematically complicated. It’s rather a sad story, but much, much better than the film. I also learned a ton about game theory, what it’s about, and its usage in business, government, and personal strategy. I also learned that mathematics is considered a young man’s field. It seems perfectly reasonable to me, that because of the intense mental rigor, you’d wear out as you age. I love that Nash went back to work after he recovered. I was also very impressed by the strength of his wife, Alicia. His son’s mental illness is really tragic, but I love that Nash takes care of him. A really great, worthwhile, and enjoyable read."

Though I know nothing about ""partial diferential equations"" etc, I could follow 99% of the book and was fascinated by learning about this genius who suffered from schizophrenia for years and recovered, e.g. that even while suffering from schizophrenia he learned to speak French."

78,0571212921,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3816725-larry-bassett,3,"It is hard to know how to say that John Nash is a fairly unique individual. You have to start with the fact that he was a brilliant mathematician. To be a mathematician with a brain that works in fairly amazing ways is hard enough to explain in words I suspect. When I was in graduate school I lived in a house with two other women, one of whom was a graduate student in mathematics. I wish I could find Janet Woodruff today to talk with her about John Nash.John Nash was also someone who suffered from schizophrenia and apparently came back from that after 25 years of suffering and treatment and hospitalization. The book says that mathematics is a specialty of young people and that people in that field rise to the heights of their profession at a young age. The book follows the life of John Nash through a long period of severe disability that also displayed how mathematical Rockstars experience life in academia. It talks about how people who are extremely bright also often have peculiar social disabilities. We follow the life of John Nash through many ups and downs. He is a unique individual from many different points of view. Once again the fact that I experience this as an audible book was an asset for me in getting through a story that I might not have managed to overcome if I had to turn paper pages."
79,0571212921,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1769011-arminzerella,3,"John Nash was a prominent mathematician in the prime of his career – best known for his work on game theory (and its applications in economics) – when he was diagnosed with schizophrenia. Already somewhat eccentric and socially awkward, his illness pushed him over into paranoid and delusional. He was unable to function in the real world and had to be institutionalized. He received treatments, some of which were more successful than others, and like other schizophrenics he relapsed many times. It seemed for many years that John Nash would never recover the thing he valued most – his mind. And then, seemingly out of nowhere, he got better. He became accustomed to the extra noise in his head and found that he was able to distinguish between the thoughts/ideas that were “normal” and the ones that were “crazy.” He began working again as a mathematician and making contributions to his field. Sylvia Nasar’s book is much more detailed than the movie that was based on it, but the way that Nash’s illness is revealed in the movie is much more dramatic (because you’re seeing things from inside of Nash’s head and he doesn’t realize he’s delusional). Although he is described as tall and attractive, there was much about John Nash that was off-putting to many. He could be arrogant and cruel and during his young life he often found himself on the outside – the social outcast of the social outcasts. His brilliance, however, was unquestionable. Nasar spares us most of the mathematical details (which the layperson wouldn’t grasp – even Nash’s colleagues were often gobsmacked at his unique approaches to problems), but brings the man to life. I don’t really follow the mathematics (computations! proofs! reasoning!) or understand the importance of the work that he’s done/doing, but I found his breakthrough out of schizophrenia fascinating. Nash has a son who is also afflicted with this illness."
80,0571212921,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2393446-anne-hawn-smith,5,"The story of the brilliant John Nash is an incredibly complicated one. Did his madness contribute to his difficult, arrogant personality or was he just one of those people who has a severe social disability? I came up with more questions than answers after reading this book. Did he have Asbergers syndrome? Was this why he was so inept at social relations, or was he so contemptuous of everyone around him because he recognized early that he was intellectually so far superior to everyone he knew? Did his brilliance allow him to triumph over schizophrenia of was it just one of those miracles that happen for no reason? I think what I learned from this book was the fragility of the human mind and the weakness of our human vessels. How could someone this brilliant be beset by so many problems? Why is it that genius of any type, intellectual, artistic or diplomatic seems to be so closely related to deficits in other areas of development? Do all great gifts come with a cost? Is the idiot/savant just an extreme version of this paradox? Why couldn't a mind so brilliant find some way to protect himself from madness? "
81,0571212921,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10918354-nurul-badriah,5,"I rarely read autobiography book because it's quite boring for me. But this book is such an amazing and touching book. This is my all time favorite book that I will read over and over again and will recommend to all the people around the world to read it. In my opinion all the smart people have some mental illness problems, not all of them but plenty of them do have psychological problems. This book shows us about how people undergoes psychological problems like schizophrenia in this story and to overcome them by the help of family, friends and society. This book talk about John Nash and about his theory and illness, the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences. This book just took me by storm by the uniqueness, ironically enough because it was based on a real life situation. This book touched me on many levels. The psychology was intriguing, the mathematical philosophies was actually amazing and the humanistic side of love. A Beautiful Mind was by far the most original,realistic, intelligent and heart touching book that I have ever read. John Nash was truly worthy of the Noble Prize."
82,0571212921,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1354567-melissa,4,"This was a tough read. Halfway through I disliked John Nash so intensely that I wasn't sure I could finish the book. He was arrogant, rude, selfish, sexist, and even frightening. The book also highlighted how culturally we are willing to accept not only difficult but harmful behavior from people who are highly gifted, which I hate. However, it's also nearly impossible to disentangle Nash from his illness, and I couldn't help wondering how his mental condition figured into his behavior even before he became obviously ill. By the end of the book, I had much more sympathy for what he endured as a product of his time (the 50s and 60s) as well as what he endured from his illness (insulin shock therapy sounds horrific). The moment toward the end when he asks if it's okay for him to enter a cafeteria at Princeton because he wasn't faculty actually drew tears because it was such a contrast from his earlier arrogance. Nash was a fascinating, complicated, messy, unlikeable person who, in the words of one of his colleagues, was still ""worth saving."" This book is an unflinching look at all of the different facets of that reality."
83,0571212921,http://goodreads.com/user/show/46089881-elsa-k,4,"I had recently re watched ""A Beautiful Mind"" and I was inspired to read the book. John Nash was a fascinating figure. But I will say the movie definitely Hollywoodized him. In the book he is very disturbing, especially in his younger years. He did and said some terrible things. He had a son by his mistress and pretty much abandoned him. He was arrested for exposing himself, tried to come on to other men etc. Sometimes the book was hard to get through as I didn't want to spend so much time with such a creeper! But I still found it interesting, especially how he managed to control his mental health issues over the years. His love story was strange to me- what did Alyssa see in him? I didn't understand all the math background, so I would skim some of that. It was sad to hear how he struggled and was treated in his mental illness. Also sad to hear his second son struggles with schizophrenia too. I would still recommend it as in interesting book, especially to someone with a math background."
84,0571212921,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5153361-annie,4,"I loved the movie so much I was a bit tentative to read the book(in case the story was idealized and distorted exceedingly). However, the book was far more indepth, interesting, and potent that I could have imagined. The story was much more real, wrought with tragedy, beauty, and poignancy. I think if the movie would have adhered more to the truth it would have been far more interesting but it was still well done. Not only did the book provide indepth information in the personal life and accomplishments of Nash, but it also branched into the history of mathematics(related to Nash), Princeton, the Cold War mathematicians, sanitariums and pyschiatric methods during the time, and the nomination and debate related to Nobel prize nominees. At times however I found the mathematical information a bit confusing but I'm only in 11th grade so my incomprehension can not be completely blamed on the book itself. All together it was a fascinating, detailed work."

Since the story begins right at the birth, we come to understand the kind of person that he is. I appreciate the fact that the book paints the good, the bad and the ugly all with the same brush. This helps us to come to know exactly what kind of a person John Nash was.A beautiful mind is more on the fact that if a person really puts his mind to it, he can come out of a disease that was presumably incurable than the mathematical as well as the economic contributions. The book deals more with the life events than the mathematical equations. I was hoping to read something about how he came upon the Game Theory as well as other discoveries that he made in the field, but I suppose the reason it was omitted was that the field in which Nash worked was so abstract that it would have put off many readers."
86,0571212921,http://goodreads.com/user/show/445677-scott,5,"A very well-written and engaging biography of John Nash. While many readers may have already seen the movie version, I had not. Nash certainly presents a difficult character; at times it is hard to muster sympathy for him, but ultimately I was heartbroken by his schizophrenia and ""lost years."" The fact that he has enjoyed a remission of this disease, and a return to a somewhat normal life, is a testament to the will and love of those around him who rallied support and resources to care for him during his long periods of bizarre behavior. Author Nasar describes the mathematics without getting mired in the details, so the reader has a sense of the import of Nash's achievements without a learned appreciation of them. I enjoyed this book, but will want to read something more light-hearted next!"

I enjoyed the movie more.To be fair, it is easier to paint a tale with more likable characters, intrigue and fairy-tale turnaround, when not restrained by real life. I had no idea how much real-life was altered for the movie. What bothered me most about the book was that at several points, I felt I was reading less of a biography about Nash, and more a story about the lives of people around him and the academic world that he wandered through... with occasional notes about Nash behaving brashly."
90,0571212921,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1400289-chana,4,"Once I started reading this book I realized that the movie, which I had enjoyed, was entertainment, concerning itself more with the strange delusions of John Nash's mental illness than with the life of the real man. More than half of this book is about John Nash before he became ill at age 30. He was this totally arrogant young math genius, eccentric and homosexually inclined. He was pretty hard to like because he was obnoxious and unkind and very self-centered. (I was reminded of how my mother always used to say that we should be glad that we weren't geniuses because they had a very hard time making friends because they were so different from other people. I can't say her statement carried much weight because I had trouble making friends and didn't have the consolation of being a genius. But that was back in the mid-60's and I wondered as I read if John Nash's tragedy had not entered the national consciousness rendering ""genius"" a less than desirable condition). I was particularly appalled by his disregard for his first child and the child's mother. His level of maturity was shocking to me, like maybe that of an 8 to 10 year old boy when he was in his 20's. He was unable to be much of a father to 2nd son either as the child was born at the time that he was becoming ill. So John Nash, still involved in homosexual relationships, fathers a child out of wedlock, deserts mother and child, marries a different woman and fathers another child, and has his ego trampled severly underfoot when he is not acknowledged for his brilliant work by not winning prestigious awards. He then undertakes to solve the Riemann Hypothesis (don't ask me to explain what that is) and his mind just starts making all these weird and faulty connections with numerology, politics and religion. His math becomes gibberish and his actions inexplicable. The next 30 years are essentially lost to him as he and his family suffer through hospitalizations, treatments and all the sorrows this brings.Strangely, John Nash starts to recover on his own and becomes more and more rational. He wins a Nobel in Economics, gives lectures, and remarries Alicia who had divorced him many years earlier but continued to be his main support and friend all the intervening years. It really is miraculous. Not only that but he seemed to mature quite a bit and become a much nicer person than he had been. The sad thing is that his younger son is also schizophrenic and has been in and out of hospitals for years. Alicia and John care for him at home and my heart goes out to them in this. Small point, but I really didn't like the cover of the book, which shows the actor who plays John Nash rather than John Nash himself."

 ""People have a mental picture that this is a difficult problem. Maybe that's the stumbling block. Maybe, if people didn't realize that the problem was 'hard,' they could solve it.""
I am very impressed with how they adapted this into a movie. This book is more factual than the emotionally driven theme of the movie and I liked that. I liked how they differed on that aspect. I loved both of them in their own formats of publications.The maths and physics theories went over my head, but for once I didn't mind reading about them because I was invested in getting to know John Nash better. One of the things that really interested me was the mention of the Italian mathematician ""Ennio De Giorgi"", who before his death was attempting to prove the existence of God by using Math; I want to read that paper to see what he came up with even if its incomplete. At first, I wasn't sure if I found Nash not paying for child support and other unlikeable things that he did, a personality flaw making him a douche or did his schizophrenia justify that behavior? I found it surprising how sympathetic I was towards the Russell Crowe version of Nash as my feelings towards him were a bit negative at this point, but later in the book I found my sympathy kicking back in and felt awed by Alica and Nash's relationship and struggles. It was infact as sad as the movie, even if the writing style of the book was more serious which made me feel like I was reading a research paper at times and that isn't my preferred reading genre but all's well, it pulled through and kept me engaged regardless. I am glad the book ended in a hopeful tone, with Nash getting better and helping around with Johnny and reconciling with Alicia and his first born John David.This will be one of my most memorable reads. I am glad my sister bought this book, 'cause otherwise I wouldn't have picked this one up and would have missed out on a great read."

Well, make it an exception.It is not because the book is not well-written, though powerful and mesmerising it is, nor is It not exceptionally detailed and real. The fact is it's exactly because it was so real that I became evasive of this genius and form an indelible impression on his darksides.When a genius conceived a great achievement for mankind, people Marvel at his grandure and are prone to be deliberately neglectful and blindful of his defects,however fatal and unscrupulous they are. They justified his evils in the name of paying attributes to a great mind. Well, if they think this way, IMHO,screw these people and those geniuses!Nash was a true genius and he was Fortunate enough to have Alicia with him.I always guard against those self-proclaimed masters or experts, vigillant of their hypocrisy.For geniune talents, I admire their contributions but still treat them as people not saints.

95,0571212921,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7861828-matt,3,"This book took me through the full range of emotions. I felt awe, disgust, pity, wonder, joy, confusion, resolution, etc... Most of all it made me introspective as to how I treat others, and how the entire field of Psychiatry treats patients.First of all, I learned that the movie took MANY liberties with the facts. It is about 20% truth, and the rest is style and effects. For many years I have enjoyed the movie and recommended it to friends. So I felt disillusioned when I found out how false it was. But then I thought about the truth, John Nash’s life, and the goals of the film.John Nash did not have visual hallucinations. He didn’t see people who weren’t there, and he never imagined a roommate, or a little girl. But how else do you portray in a movie the reality of his delusions? How do you show a movie audience the absolute belief he had, and how much it had to hurt to find out that much of your life…is imaginary. He often thought he was working for the FBI, or for the world government. He thought he was Royalty, an Arab refugee, Job, Castro, a mouse. He thought he was traveling to Cairo, Kabul, Thebes, Mongolia, or even purgatory, inferno, or some sort of polluted heaven. He lived in constant fear of annihilation, Armageddon, the Apocalypse, the Final day of Judgment, and of certain ominous dates such as May 29th.So I give the film license for showing Schizophrenia in a false light because it portrays the feeling, and the pain and despair that go along with it very well.Here are other interesting things I never knew from the film.John Nash was a draft dodger. It didn’t just scare him…it mortified him. He worked diligently for years to avoid the draft, wrote letters, used University faculty and presidents, and employed every means imaginable to avoid the draft.Alicia (Nash’s wife) was not his first girlfriend, nor the mother of his first child. Eleanor was. They had a son named John David. His last name was not Nash however, because Eleanor and Nash were never married. Though they remained together for some time, and he sometimes spoke of marriage, it never happened.Alicia at first perturbed me. She thought Nash was cute, and pursued him with great vigor (even getting a job at his favorite hang-out, just to see him more often.) Eventually they started sleeping together, until Eleanor arrived at his place one night, and found her there. After much screaming and crying by Eleanor, Nash said “My perfect little world is ruined.”Alicia had quite a different reaction. Eleanor called Alicia to complain, and met with her to discuss the fact that She and Nash were getting married and already had a son. Alicia was pleased. She took the meeting as a sign that “She was beginning to matter.” She continued their courtship until eventually Alicia and Nash were married and had their own son, John Charles.My initial thought was –“Alicia is so ruthless and cold that she deserves what’s coming.” I later regretted that thought. She stuck with Nash through the worst of times. She followed him all over Europe trying to find a place where he was content and sane, but it never happened. He bankrupted her, and left her many, many times.Nash had homosexual flings. While working for a think tank called RAND, he was arrested in a restroom police sting for “indecent exposure.” This was one of many recorded occurrences when he had intimate relationships with men.Eventually Alicia divorced him, and she believed it was for his good. He no longer had the stress of a family or obligations…he could go where he wanted when he wanted with no thought for a family.Years later he finally settled down at Princeton again, and became known as “The Phantom.” He walked the hallways and wrote cryptic messages or math problems on the chalk boards.He became a legend at Princeton among the students. Anybody who was too much of a grind or who lacked social graces was warned that he or she was “going to end up like the phantom”. Yet if a new student complained that having him around made him feel uncomfortable, he was immediately warned: “He was a better mathematician then you’ll ever be.”John Nash was a brilliant mathematician. He solved problems in ways no one else had ever imagined. He proved that “every Riemannian manifold can be isometrically embedded into some Euclidean space.”(FYI – this book has a ton of Math that I did not understand but accepted that it was really hard and really complex)During this period at Princeton, after many hospitalizations, insulin coma therapy, and many attempts to renounce his U.S. citizenship and become a “Citizen of the World”; Alicia eventually let him move back in with her, and get to know his second son. And years later, after he won the Nobel Prize, they did remarry. Even when they were divorced, she felt responsible for him. She suffered huge amounts, and it didn’t end with him. Their son, John Charles, also has Paranoid Schizophrenia. I may not have liked how she entered his life, but she certainly proved her worth, and was indespensible.I’ll end this book report with an Interesting Fact I learned from the book.The Nobel prize in Economics (which Nash won in 1994) is not technically a Nobel Prize. The prize was not one of the awards set out in the will of Alfred Nobel. He listed only physics, chemistry, physiology or medicine, and literature, which have been awarded since 1901. In 1968 an award was added for economics by the Central Bank of Sweden. And they provide the funding separately for the “Sveriges Riksbank Prize in Economic Sciences in Memory of Alfred Nobel”P.S. This book changed the way I see Schizophrenia, and how I interact with Schizophrenic patients and their families. It has been a very worthwhile book for me. I hope others choose to enjoy it as well."

This is my favorite photo of this book. This shows a very young and and absent-minded-looking John Nash. I read this book because I watched the mmovie and I wanted to know more details about his privileged mind that was able to find a way to deal with his mental illness without the medication that made him be someone different from who he wanted to be. This idea of having to sacrifice oneself's essence in order to avoid the horrible sympthoms of mental illness is a conundrum that many mental patients face. A lot of them decide one way or the other, and this is one notorious case about one who decided to deal with his demons himself, and had to pay a high price for that.This is the cover and editorial page of the book I read:

I really liked this book, and think that the movie is a really good first approach to read about this punctual experience of mental illness and a gifted mind.***I also have a blog! Link here: http://lunairereadings.blogspot.com"
97,0571212921,http://goodreads.com/user/show/49938-anastacia,5,"Though it was a bit slow in places (which is probably to be expected given John Nash’s career in mathematics), I really enjoyed reading A Beautiful Mind. I’m interested in history and mental illness and, lately, I have become absolutely fascinated by some of the history of mathematical geniuses, as they tend to be quite a rather unique bunch. I saw the movie version of the book when it was released several years ago, and while I don’t remember much about it other than I liked it, I’m pretty sure the movie was extremely sugarcoated. This was a raw, real account that is somehow simultaneously joyous and tragic. One of the things I am coming to appreciate most in a biography is when the author resists painting a one-dimensional, rosy picture of the subject. Even the best people are imperfect and I resent when all the subject’s flaws are just glossed over as though they never existed. The author did a fabulous job here in painting the entire picture of the great man; a man that is not perfect and, in many ways, an extremely difficult person to deal with. Nash was an incredibly complex man and his genius was both a gift and a curse. He didn’t get along well with people, he was arrogant at times, lacking in social skills and struggled with his sexuality. Rather than coming off as unlikable, though, I was rooting for him and I finished the book with a deep appreciation for the man and his legacy, which, I should add, I don’t completely understand as I am not a part of the mathematics world. And that was another aspect of the book I appreciated – I don’t think it is necessary to be a part of the mathematics world – or even have a deep appreciation for it – to enjoy the book. I’m more interested in the way the brain works and in psychological illnesses than I am math, but on the other hand, I am close to several deeply mathematical-minded people and that may make reading about it more interesting to me. The book was, as I mentioned, very slow in some places and I would have appreciated reading more about his illness than all the great detail about his mathematical achievements, but I suppose that I can’t complain about it because I knew what I was getting into. I just feel that it could have been more interesting if more attention were paid to other details. I ended up skimming some of the last chapters on the history and procedures of the Nobel. I just didn’t find any of that very interesting, and, again, the time and detail could have been better spent on other aspects, in my opinion.I’m on the fence about giving the book 3 or 4 stars. 3 seems unnecessarily harsh, but because it was slow in the beginning and a bit slow in a few chapters toward the end, I can’t really give it a 4. This is another instance where I wish GoodReads would implement half-stars in the rating system. I’d recommend this book to those interested in history, mathematics, biographies of geniuses, and those deeply interested in not only mental illness but also how the brain works in many different ways. I do know that some may find it boring. Even something with the slightest hint of math can be a turn-off for some folks. So, while I would recommend, I’d also add the caveat that one understands that it is not merely about his schizophrenia but his life as a mathematical genius in general."
98,0571212921,http://goodreads.com/user/show/33019-leonora,4,"Having read the book, I don't think I can see the movie. From what I've heard the film is quite good and tells the story of a genius gone mad. I gather that's where the similarity ends.John Nash is (for most of the book) an egotist who enjoys playing dangerous pranks on others, brags that he is one of three smartest men at Princeton, treats his lovers (male and female) as though they are only there for his amusement/pleasure. He is smart, cruel, and completely socially inept. Until his illness, it almost seems like he has Asperger Syndrome (a mild form of autism).However, as Nasar beautifully describes, this is all in line with his personality, which would eventually become schizoid. And, despite his faults I did root for him as he attempts to solve problems no one, even other top mathematicians, have the guts (or audacity) to attempt.Nasar, for the most part, is my favorite kind of biographer. She knows her subject well and doesn't treat him with kid gloves. She accurately interprets his personality in terms of his past and makes him human, understandable, despite his shortcomings. In this way, she reminded me of Jack El-Hai who wrote the brilliant biography, ""The Lobotomist"".Sidenote: his gay relationships were known at Princeton & MIT. I had no idea the math community in the 50s wasn't horribly homophobic! This was one of the most interesting things in the book."
99,0571212921,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2154122-a,1,"Well, I will not read this book again. Nor do I recommend it to anyone.I admit it was interesting to learn more about John Nash, particularly just how good he was, and what his colleagues had to say about his brilliant, beautiful mind. It was eye opening to read about the time of his life when he actively began struggling with his illness, and his subsequent recovery. It was gratifying to read about his Nobel Prize experience.All that said, it was not at all ""good"" enough to entice me to spend my time reading again. First of all, it's a book about a mathematician. A brilliant mathematician whose works I don't really understand even when they are put in ""plain"" English, as she occasionally did. And since he had essentially no life outside of his mathematics, until you get to the part where he is ill, and can no longer do math, it talks a lot about things I don't understand.Also, while there was not a language problem per se, the instances where there was a foul word used it was one of the foulest, and quite off-putting.And last but probably most of all I will not read it again because some of the anecdotes she chose to include about his life just plain made me uncomfortable. I felt a little bit like I had invaded his private life, because even though she never really gave details or was graphic, it just felt too inimately personal."
100,0571212921,http://goodreads.com/user/show/263190-jill,4,"Though I am severely dull when it comes to mathematics (I can’t do any math that moves), I found this biography fascinating and very moving. I enjoyed it all the way through and thought very interesting the story behind Nash’s Nobel Prize. I thought the book was really well written and not off-putting to people like me, who have a hard time wrapping their head around anything mathematically complicated. It’s rather a sad story, but much, much better than the film. I also learned a ton about game theory, what it’s about, and its usage in business, government, and personal strategy. I also learned that mathematics is considered a young man’s field. It seems perfectly reasonable to me, that because of the intense mental rigor, you’d wear out as you age. I love that Nash went back to work after he recovered. I was also very impressed by the strength of his wife, Alicia. His son’s mental illness is really tragic, but I love that Nash takes care of him. A really great, worthwhile, and enjoyable read."

108,0571212921,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3816725-larry-bassett,3,"It is hard to know how to say that John Nash is a fairly unique individual. You have to start with the fact that he was a brilliant mathematician. To be a mathematician with a brain that works in fairly amazing ways is hard enough to explain in words I suspect. When I was in graduate school I lived in a house with two other women, one of whom was a graduate student in mathematics. I wish I could find Janet Woodruff today to talk with her about John Nash.John Nash was also someone who suffered from schizophrenia and apparently came back from that after 25 years of suffering and treatment and hospitalization. The book says that mathematics is a specialty of young people and that people in that field rise to the heights of their profession at a young age. The book follows the life of John Nash through a long period of severe disability that also displayed how mathematical Rockstars experience life in academia. It talks about how people who are extremely bright also often have peculiar social disabilities. We follow the life of John Nash through many ups and downs. He is a unique individual from many different points of view. Once again the fact that I experience this as an audible book was an asset for me in getting through a story that I might not have managed to overcome if I had to turn paper pages."
109,0571212921,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1769011-arminzerella,3,"John Nash was a prominent mathematician in the prime of his career – best known for his work on game theory (and its applications in economics) – when he was diagnosed with schizophrenia. Already somewhat eccentric and socially awkward, his illness pushed him over into paranoid and delusional. He was unable to function in the real world and had to be institutionalized. He received treatments, some of which were more successful than others, and like other schizophrenics he relapsed many times. It seemed for many years that John Nash would never recover the thing he valued most – his mind. And then, seemingly out of nowhere, he got better. He became accustomed to the extra noise in his head and found that he was able to distinguish between the thoughts/ideas that were “normal” and the ones that were “crazy.” He began working again as a mathematician and making contributions to his field. Sylvia Nasar’s book is much more detailed than the movie that was based on it, but the way that Nash’s illness is revealed in the movie is much more dramatic (because you’re seeing things from inside of Nash’s head and he doesn’t realize he’s delusional). Although he is described as tall and attractive, there was much about John Nash that was off-putting to many. He could be arrogant and cruel and during his young life he often found himself on the outside – the social outcast of the social outcasts. His brilliance, however, was unquestionable. Nasar spares us most of the mathematical details (which the layperson wouldn’t grasp – even Nash’s colleagues were often gobsmacked at his unique approaches to problems), but brings the man to life. I don’t really follow the mathematics (computations! proofs! reasoning!) or understand the importance of the work that he’s done/doing, but I found his breakthrough out of schizophrenia fascinating. Nash has a son who is also afflicted with this illness."
110,0571212921,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2393446-anne-hawn-smith,5,"The story of the brilliant John Nash is an incredibly complicated one. Did his madness contribute to his difficult, arrogant personality or was he just one of those people who has a severe social disability? I came up with more questions than answers after reading this book. Did he have Asbergers syndrome? Was this why he was so inept at social relations, or was he so contemptuous of everyone around him because he recognized early that he was intellectually so far superior to everyone he knew? Did his brilliance allow him to triumph over schizophrenia of was it just one of those miracles that happen for no reason? I think what I learned from this book was the fragility of the human mind and the weakness of our human vessels. How could someone this brilliant be beset by so many problems? Why is it that genius of any type, intellectual, artistic or diplomatic seems to be so closely related to deficits in other areas of development? Do all great gifts come with a cost? Is the idiot/savant just an extreme version of this paradox? Why couldn't a mind so brilliant find some way to protect himself from madness? "
111,0571212921,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10918354-nurul-badriah,5,"I rarely read autobiography book because it's quite boring for me. But this book is such an amazing and touching book. This is my all time favorite book that I will read over and over again and will recommend to all the people around the world to read it. In my opinion all the smart people have some mental illness problems, not all of them but plenty of them do have psychological problems. This book shows us about how people undergoes psychological problems like schizophrenia in this story and to overcome them by the help of family, friends and society. This book talk about John Nash and about his theory and illness, the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences. This book just took me by storm by the uniqueness, ironically enough because it was based on a real life situation. This book touched me on many levels. The psychology was intriguing, the mathematical philosophies was actually amazing and the humanistic side of love. A Beautiful Mind was by far the most original,realistic, intelligent and heart touching book that I have ever read. John Nash was truly worthy of the Noble Prize."
112,0571212921,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1354567-melissa,4,"This was a tough read. Halfway through I disliked John Nash so intensely that I wasn't sure I could finish the book. He was arrogant, rude, selfish, sexist, and even frightening. The book also highlighted how culturally we are willing to accept not only difficult but harmful behavior from people who are highly gifted, which I hate. However, it's also nearly impossible to disentangle Nash from his illness, and I couldn't help wondering how his mental condition figured into his behavior even before he became obviously ill. By the end of the book, I had much more sympathy for what he endured as a product of his time (the 50s and 60s) as well as what he endured from his illness (insulin shock therapy sounds horrific). The moment toward the end when he asks if it's okay for him to enter a cafeteria at Princeton because he wasn't faculty actually drew tears because it was such a contrast from his earlier arrogance. Nash was a fascinating, complicated, messy, unlikeable person who, in the words of one of his colleagues, was still ""worth saving."" This book is an unflinching look at all of the different facets of that reality."
113,0571212921,http://goodreads.com/user/show/46089881-elsa-k,4,"I had recently re watched ""A Beautiful Mind"" and I was inspired to read the book. John Nash was a fascinating figure. But I will say the movie definitely Hollywoodized him. In the book he is very disturbing, especially in his younger years. He did and said some terrible things. He had a son by his mistress and pretty much abandoned him. He was arrested for exposing himself, tried to come on to other men etc. Sometimes the book was hard to get through as I didn't want to spend so much time with such a creeper! But I still found it interesting, especially how he managed to control his mental health issues over the years. His love story was strange to me- what did Alyssa see in him? I didn't understand all the math background, so I would skim some of that. It was sad to hear how he struggled and was treated in his mental illness. Also sad to hear his second son struggles with schizophrenia too. I would still recommend it as in interesting book, especially to someone with a math background."
114,0571212921,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5153361-annie,4,"I loved the movie so much I was a bit tentative to read the book(in case the story was idealized and distorted exceedingly). However, the book was far more indepth, interesting, and potent that I could have imagined. The story was much more real, wrought with tragedy, beauty, and poignancy. I think if the movie would have adhered more to the truth it would have been far more interesting but it was still well done. Not only did the book provide indepth information in the personal life and accomplishments of Nash, but it also branched into the history of mathematics(related to Nash), Princeton, the Cold War mathematicians, sanitariums and pyschiatric methods during the time, and the nomination and debate related to Nobel prize nominees. At times however I found the mathematical information a bit confusing but I'm only in 11th grade so my incomprehension can not be completely blamed on the book itself. All together it was a fascinating, detailed work."

Since the story begins right at the birth, we come to understand the kind of person that he is. I appreciate the fact that the book paints the good, the bad and the ugly all with the same brush. This helps us to come to know exactly what kind of a person John Nash was.A beautiful mind is more on the fact that if a person really puts his mind to it, he can come out of a disease that was presumably incurable than the mathematical as well as the economic contributions. The book deals more with the life events than the mathematical equations. I was hoping to read something about how he came upon the Game Theory as well as other discoveries that he made in the field, but I suppose the reason it was omitted was that the field in which Nash worked was so abstract that it would have put off many readers."

Nash certainly presents a difficult character; at times it is hard to muster sympathy for him, but ultimately I was heartbroken by his schizophrenia and ""lost years."" The fact that he has enjoyed a remission of this disease, and a return to a somewhat normal life, is a testament to the will and love of those around him who rallied support and resources to care for him during his long periods of bizarre behavior. Author Nasar describes the mathematics without getting mired in the details, so the reader has a sense of the import of Nash's achievements without a learned appreciation of them. I enjoyed this book, but will want to read something more light-hearted next!"

I enjoyed the movie more.To be fair, it is easier to paint a tale with more likable characters, intrigue and fairy-tale turnaround, when not restrained by real life. I had no idea how much real-life was altered for the movie. What bothered me most about the book was that at several points, I felt I was reading less of a biography about Nash, and more a story about the lives of people around him and the academic world that he wandered through... with occasional notes about Nash behaving brashly."
120,0571212921,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1400289-chana,4,"Once I started reading this book I realized that the movie, which I had enjoyed, was entertainment, concerning itself more with the strange delusions of John Nash's mental illness than with the life of the real man. More than half of this book is about John Nash before he became ill at age 30. He was this totally arrogant young math genius, eccentric and homosexually inclined. He was pretty hard to like because he was obnoxious and unkind and very self-centered. (I was reminded of how my mother always used to say that we should be glad that we weren't geniuses because they had a very hard time making friends because they were so different from other people. I can't say her statement carried much weight because I had trouble making friends and didn't have the consolation of being a genius. But that was back in the mid-60's and I wondered as I read if John Nash's tragedy had not entered the national consciousness rendering ""genius"" a less than desirable condition). I was particularly appalled by his disregard for his first child and the child's mother. His level of maturity was shocking to me, like maybe that of an 8 to 10 year old boy when he was in his 20's. He was unable to be much of a father to 2nd son either as the child was born at the time that he was becoming ill. So John Nash, still involved in homosexual relationships, fathers a child out of wedlock, deserts mother and child, marries a different woman and fathers another child, and has his ego trampled severly underfoot when he is not acknowledged for his brilliant work by not winning prestigious awards. He then undertakes to solve the Riemann Hypothesis (don't ask me to explain what that is) and his mind just starts making all these weird and faulty connections with numerology, politics and religion. His math becomes gibberish and his actions inexplicable. The next 30 years are essentially lost to him as he and his family suffer through hospitalizations, treatments and all the sorrows this brings.Strangely, John Nash starts to recover on his own and becomes more and more rational. He wins a Nobel in Economics, gives lectures, and remarries Alicia who had divorced him many years earlier but continued to be his main support and friend all the intervening years. It really is miraculous. Not only that but he seemed to mature quite a bit and become a much nicer person than he had been. The sad thing is that his younger son is also schizophrenic and has been in and out of hospitals for years. Alicia and John care for him at home and my heart goes out to them in this. Small point, but I really didn't like the cover of the book, which shows the actor who plays John Nash rather than John Nash himself."

 ""People have a mental picture that this is a difficult problem. Maybe that's the stumbling block. Maybe, if people didn't realize that the problem was 'hard,' they could solve it.""
I am very impressed with how they adapted this into a movie. This book is more factual than the emotionally driven theme of the movie and I liked that. I liked how they differed on that aspect. I loved both of them in their own formats of publications.The maths and physics theories went over my head, but for once I didn't mind reading about them because I was invested in getting to know John Nash better. One of the things that really interested me was the mention of the Italian mathematician ""Ennio De Giorgi"", who before his death was attempting to prove the existence of God by using Math; I want to read that paper to see what he came up with even if its incomplete. At first, I wasn't sure if I found Nash not paying for child support and other unlikeable things that he did, a personality flaw making him a douche or did his schizophrenia justify that behavior? I found it surprising how sympathetic I was towards the Russell Crowe version of Nash as my feelings towards him were a bit negative at this point, but later in the book I found my sympathy kicking back in and felt awed by Alica and Nash's relationship and struggles. It was infact as sad as the movie, even if the writing style of the book was more serious which made me feel like I was reading a research paper at times and that isn't my preferred reading genre but all's well, it pulled through and kept me engaged regardless. I am glad the book ended in a hopeful tone, with Nash getting better and helping around with Johnny and reconciling with Alicia and his first born John David.This will be one of my most memorable reads. I am glad my sister bought this book, 'cause otherwise I wouldn't have picked this one up and would have missed out on a great read."

Well, make it an exception.It is not because the book is not well-written, though powerful and mesmerising it is, nor is It not exceptionally detailed and real. The fact is it's exactly because it was so real that I became evasive of this genius and form an indelible impression on his darksides.When a genius conceived a great achievement for mankind, people Marvel at his grandure and are prone to be deliberately neglectful and blindful of his defects,however fatal and unscrupulous they are. They justified his evils in the name of paying attributes to a great mind. Well, if they think this way, IMHO,screw these people and those geniuses!Nash was a true genius and he was Fortunate enough to have Alicia with him.I always guard against those self-proclaimed masters or experts, vigillant of their hypocrisy.For geniune talents, I admire their contributions but still treat them as people not saints.

125,0571212921,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7861828-matt,3,"This book took me through the full range of emotions. I felt awe, disgust, pity, wonder, joy, confusion, resolution, etc... Most of all it made me introspective as to how I treat others, and how the entire field of Psychiatry treats patients.First of all, I learned that the movie took MANY liberties with the facts. It is about 20% truth, and the rest is style and effects. For many years I have enjoyed the movie and recommended it to friends. So I felt disillusioned when I found out how false it was. But then I thought about the truth, John Nash’s life, and the goals of the film.John Nash did not have visual hallucinations. He didn’t see people who weren’t there, and he never imagined a roommate, or a little girl. But how else do you portray in a movie the reality of his delusions? How do you show a movie audience the absolute belief he had, and how much it had to hurt to find out that much of your life…is imaginary. He often thought he was working for the FBI, or for the world government. He thought he was Royalty, an Arab refugee, Job, Castro, a mouse. He thought he was traveling to Cairo, Kabul, Thebes, Mongolia, or even purgatory, inferno, or some sort of polluted heaven. He lived in constant fear of annihilation, Armageddon, the Apocalypse, the Final day of Judgment, and of certain ominous dates such as May 29th.So I give the film license for showing Schizophrenia in a false light because it portrays the feeling, and the pain and despair that go along with it very well.Here are other interesting things I never knew from the film.John Nash was a draft dodger. It didn’t just scare him…it mortified him. He worked diligently for years to avoid the draft, wrote letters, used University faculty and presidents, and employed every means imaginable to avoid the draft.Alicia (Nash’s wife) was not his first girlfriend, nor the mother of his first child. Eleanor was. They had a son named John David. His last name was not Nash however, because Eleanor and Nash were never married. Though they remained together for some time, and he sometimes spoke of marriage, it never happened.Alicia at first perturbed me. She thought Nash was cute, and pursued him with great vigor (even getting a job at his favorite hang-out, just to see him more often.) Eventually they started sleeping together, until Eleanor arrived at his place one night, and found her there. After much screaming and crying by Eleanor, Nash said “My perfect little world is ruined.”Alicia had quite a different reaction. Eleanor called Alicia to complain, and met with her to discuss the fact that She and Nash were getting married and already had a son. Alicia was pleased. She took the meeting as a sign that “She was beginning to matter.” She continued their courtship until eventually Alicia and Nash were married and had their own son, John Charles.My initial thought was –“Alicia is so ruthless and cold that she deserves what’s coming.” I later regretted that thought. She stuck with Nash through the worst of times. She followed him all over Europe trying to find a place where he was content and sane, but it never happened. He bankrupted her, and left her many, many times.Nash had homosexual flings. While working for a think tank called RAND, he was arrested in a restroom police sting for “indecent exposure.” This was one of many recorded occurrences when he had intimate relationships with men.Eventually Alicia divorced him, and she believed it was for his good. He no longer had the stress of a family or obligations…he could go where he wanted when he wanted with no thought for a family.Years later he finally settled down at Princeton again, and became known as “The Phantom.” He walked the hallways and wrote cryptic messages or math problems on the chalk boards.He became a legend at Princeton among the students. Anybody who was too much of a grind or who lacked social graces was warned that he or she was “going to end up like the phantom”. Yet if a new student complained that having him around made him feel uncomfortable, he was immediately warned: “He was a better mathematician then you’ll ever be.”John Nash was a brilliant mathematician. He solved problems in ways no one else had ever imagined. He proved that “every Riemannian manifold can be isometrically embedded into some Euclidean space.”(FYI – this book has a ton of Math that I did not understand but accepted that it was really hard and really complex)During this period at Princeton, after many hospitalizations, insulin coma therapy, and many attempts to renounce his U.S. citizenship and become a “Citizen of the World”; Alicia eventually let him move back in with her, and get to know his second son. And years later, after he won the Nobel Prize, they did remarry. Even when they were divorced, she felt responsible for him. She suffered huge amounts, and it didn’t end with him. Their son, John Charles, also has Paranoid Schizophrenia. I may not have liked how she entered his life, but she certainly proved her worth, and was indespensible.I’ll end this book report with an Interesting Fact I learned from the book.The Nobel prize in Economics (which Nash won in 1994) is not technically a Nobel Prize. The prize was not one of the awards set out in the will of Alfred Nobel. He listed only physics, chemistry, physiology or medicine, and literature, which have been awarded since 1901. In 1968 an award was added for economics by the Central Bank of Sweden. And they provide the funding separately for the “Sveriges Riksbank Prize in Economic Sciences in Memory of Alfred Nobel”P.S. This book changed the way I see Schizophrenia, and how I interact with Schizophrenic patients and their families. It has been a very worthwhile book for me. I hope others choose to enjoy it as well."

This is my favorite photo of this book. This shows a very young and and absent-minded-looking John Nash. I read this book because I watched the mmovie and I wanted to know more details about his privileged mind that was able to find a way to deal with his mental illness without the medication that made him be someone different from who he wanted to be. This idea of having to sacrifice oneself's essence in order to avoid the horrible sympthoms of mental illness is a conundrum that many mental patients face. A lot of them decide one way or the other, and this is one notorious case about one who decided to deal with his demons himself, and had to pay a high price for that.This is the cover and editorial page of the book I read:

I really liked this book, and think that the movie is a really good first approach to read about this punctual experience of mental illness and a gifted mind.***I also have a blog! Link here: http://lunairereadings.blogspot.com"
127,0571212921,http://goodreads.com/user/show/49938-anastacia,5,"Though it was a bit slow in places (which is probably to be expected given John Nash’s career in mathematics), I really enjoyed reading A Beautiful Mind. I’m interested in history and mental illness and, lately, I have become absolutely fascinated by some of the history of mathematical geniuses, as they tend to be quite a rather unique bunch. I saw the movie version of the book when it was released several years ago, and while I don’t remember much about it other than I liked it, I’m pretty sure the movie was extremely sugarcoated. This was a raw, real account that is somehow simultaneously joyous and tragic. One of the things I am coming to appreciate most in a biography is when the author resists painting a one-dimensional, rosy picture of the subject. Even the best people are imperfect and I resent when all the subject’s flaws are just glossed over as though they never existed. The author did a fabulous job here in painting the entire picture of the great man; a man that is not perfect and, in many ways, an extremely difficult person to deal with. Nash was an incredibly complex man and his genius was both a gift and a curse. He didn’t get along well with people, he was arrogant at times, lacking in social skills and struggled with his sexuality. Rather than coming off as unlikable, though, I was rooting for him and I finished the book with a deep appreciation for the man and his legacy, which, I should add, I don’t completely understand as I am not a part of the mathematics world. And that was another aspect of the book I appreciated – I don’t think it is necessary to be a part of the mathematics world – or even have a deep appreciation for it – to enjoy the book. I’m more interested in the way the brain works and in psychological illnesses than I am math, but on the other hand, I am close to several deeply mathematical-minded people and that may make reading about it more interesting to me. The book was, as I mentioned, very slow in some places and I would have appreciated reading more about his illness than all the great detail about his mathematical achievements, but I suppose that I can’t complain about it because I knew what I was getting into. I just feel that it could have been more interesting if more attention were paid to other details. I ended up skimming some of the last chapters on the history and procedures of the Nobel. I just didn’t find any of that very interesting, and, again, the time and detail could have been better spent on other aspects, in my opinion.I’m on the fence about giving the book 3 or 4 stars. 3 seems unnecessarily harsh, but because it was slow in the beginning and a bit slow in a few chapters toward the end, I can’t really give it a 4. This is another instance where I wish GoodReads would implement half-stars in the rating system. I’d recommend this book to those interested in history, mathematics, biographies of geniuses, and those deeply interested in not only mental illness but also how the brain works in many different ways. I do know that some may find it boring. Even something with the slightest hint of math can be a turn-off for some folks. So, while I would recommend, I’d also add the caveat that one understands that it is not merely about his schizophrenia but his life as a mathematical genius in general."
128,0571212921,http://goodreads.com/user/show/33019-leonora,4,"Having read the book, I don't think I can see the movie. From what I've heard the film is quite good and tells the story of a genius gone mad. I gather that's where the similarity ends.John Nash is (for most of the book) an egotist who enjoys playing dangerous pranks on others, brags that he is one of three smartest men at Princeton, treats his lovers (male and female) as though they are only there for his amusement/pleasure. He is smart, cruel, and completely socially inept. Until his illness, it almost seems like he has Asperger Syndrome (a mild form of autism).However, as Nasar beautifully describes, this is all in line with his personality, which would eventually become schizoid. And, despite his faults I did root for him as he attempts to solve problems no one, even other top mathematicians, have the guts (or audacity) to attempt.Nasar, for the most part, is my favorite kind of biographer. She knows her subject well and doesn't treat him with kid gloves. She accurately interprets his personality in terms of his past and makes him human, understandable, despite his shortcomings. In this way, she reminded me of Jack El-Hai who wrote the brilliant biography, ""The Lobotomist"".Sidenote: his gay relationships were known at Princeton & MIT. I had no idea the math community in the 50s wasn't horribly homophobic! This was one of the most interesting things in the book."
129,0571212921,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2154122-a,1,"Well, I will not read this book again. Nor do I recommend it to anyone.I admit it was interesting to learn more about John Nash, particularly just how good he was, and what his colleagues had to say about his brilliant, beautiful mind. It was eye opening to read about the time of his life when he actively began struggling with his illness, and his subsequent recovery. It was gratifying to read about his Nobel Prize experience.All that said, it was not at all ""good"" enough to entice me to spend my time reading again. First of all, it's a book about a mathematician. A brilliant mathematician whose works I don't really understand even when they are put in ""plain"" English, as she occasionally did. And since he had essentially no life outside of his mathematics, until you get to the part where he is ill, and can no longer do math, it talks a lot about things I don't understand.Also, while there was not a language problem per se, the instances where there was a foul word used it was one of the foulest, and quite off-putting.And last but probably most of all I will not read it again because some of the anecdotes she chose to include about his life just plain made me uncomfortable. I felt a little bit like I had invaded his private life, because even though she never really gave details or was graphic, it just felt too inimately personal."
130,0571212921,http://goodreads.com/user/show/263190-jill,4,"Though I am severely dull when it comes to mathematics (I can’t do any math that moves), I found this biography fascinating and very moving. I enjoyed it all the way through and thought very interesting the story behind Nash’s Nobel Prize. I thought the book was really well written and not off-putting to people like me, who have a hard time wrapping their head around anything mathematically complicated. It’s rather a sad story, but much, much better than the film. I also learned a ton about game theory, what it’s about, and its usage in business, government, and personal strategy. I also learned that mathematics is considered a young man’s field. It seems perfectly reasonable to me, that because of the intense mental rigor, you’d wear out as you age. I love that Nash went back to work after he recovered. I was also very impressed by the strength of his wife, Alicia. His son’s mental illness is really tragic, but I love that Nash takes care of him. A really great, worthwhile, and enjoyable read."
131,0571212921,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5975123-george-p,4,"An excellent bio of the mathematican who co-won a Nobel in economics for his pioneer work in ""game theory"", though he is also well-known among mathematicians for other remarkable work. Though I know nothing about ""partial diferential equations"" etc, I could follow 99% of the book and was fascinated by learning about this genius who suffered from schizophrenia for years and recovered, e.g. that even while suffering from schizophrenia he learned to speak French."
132,0571212921,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1072582-kaethe-douglas,5,A good book that deals well with a delicate subject. Nasar wrote a compassiaonate book. Recommended for anyone who doesn't know enough about the lived experience of having a mental illness. Highly readable.Library copy

137,0571212921,http://goodreads.com/user/show/198798-linda,5,"Great book, the math part was hard for me, but the human part was very interesting!"
138,0571212921,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3816725-larry-bassett,3,"It is hard to know how to say that John Nash is a fairly unique individual. You have to start with the fact that he was a brilliant mathematician. To be a mathematician with a brain that works in fairly amazing ways is hard enough to explain in words I suspect. When I was in graduate school I lived in a house with two other women, one of whom was a graduate student in mathematics. I wish I could find Janet Woodruff today to talk with her about John Nash.John Nash was also someone who suffered from schizophrenia and apparently came back from that after 25 years of suffering and treatment and hospitalization. The book says that mathematics is a specialty of young people and that people in that field rise to the heights of their profession at a young age. The book follows the life of John Nash through a long period of severe disability that also displayed how mathematical Rockstars experience life in academia. It talks about how people who are extremely bright also often have peculiar social disabilities. We follow the life of John Nash through many ups and downs. He is a unique individual from many different points of view. Once again the fact that I experience this as an audible book was an asset for me in getting through a story that I might not have managed to overcome if I had to turn paper pages."
139,0571212921,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1769011-arminzerella,3,"John Nash was a prominent mathematician in the prime of his career – best known for his work on game theory (and its applications in economics) – when he was diagnosed with schizophrenia. Already somewhat eccentric and socially awkward, his illness pushed him over into paranoid and delusional. He was unable to function in the real world and had to be institutionalized. He received treatments, some of which were more successful than others, and like other schizophrenics he relapsed many times. It seemed for many years that John Nash would never recover the thing he valued most – his mind. And then, seemingly out of nowhere, he got better. He became accustomed to the extra noise in his head and found that he was able to distinguish between the thoughts/ideas that were “normal” and the ones that were “crazy.” He began working again as a mathematician and making contributions to his field. Sylvia Nasar’s book is much more detailed than the movie that was based on it, but the way that Nash’s illness is revealed in the movie is much more dramatic (because you’re seeing things from inside of Nash’s head and he doesn’t realize he’s delusional). Although he is described as tall and attractive, there was much about John Nash that was off-putting to many. He could be arrogant and cruel and during his young life he often found himself on the outside – the social outcast of the social outcasts. His brilliance, however, was unquestionable. Nasar spares us most of the mathematical details (which the layperson wouldn’t grasp – even Nash’s colleagues were often gobsmacked at his unique approaches to problems), but brings the man to life. I don’t really follow the mathematics (computations! proofs! reasoning!) or understand the importance of the work that he’s done/doing, but I found his breakthrough out of schizophrenia fascinating. Nash has a son who is also afflicted with this illness."
140,0571212921,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2393446-anne-hawn-smith,5,"The story of the brilliant John Nash is an incredibly complicated one. Did his madness contribute to his difficult, arrogant personality or was he just one of those people who has a severe social disability? I came up with more questions than answers after reading this book. Did he have Asbergers syndrome? Was this why he was so inept at social relations, or was he so contemptuous of everyone around him because he recognized early that he was intellectually so far superior to everyone he knew? Did his brilliance allow him to triumph over schizophrenia of was it just one of those miracles that happen for no reason? I think what I learned from this book was the fragility of the human mind and the weakness of our human vessels. How could someone this brilliant be beset by so many problems? Why is it that genius of any type, intellectual, artistic or diplomatic seems to be so closely related to deficits in other areas of development? Do all great gifts come with a cost? Is the idiot/savant just an extreme version of this paradox? Why couldn't a mind so brilliant find some way to protect himself from madness? "
141,0571212921,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10918354-nurul-badriah,5,"I rarely read autobiography book because it's quite boring for me. But this book is such an amazing and touching book. This is my all time favorite book that I will read over and over again and will recommend to all the people around the world to read it. In my opinion all the smart people have some mental illness problems, not all of them but plenty of them do have psychological problems. This book shows us about how people undergoes psychological problems like schizophrenia in this story and to overcome them by the help of family, friends and society. This book talk about John Nash and about his theory and illness, the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences. This book just took me by storm by the uniqueness, ironically enough because it was based on a real life situation. This book touched me on many levels. The psychology was intriguing, the mathematical philosophies was actually amazing and the humanistic side of love. A Beautiful Mind was by far the most original,realistic, intelligent and heart touching book that I have ever read. John Nash was truly worthy of the Noble Prize."
142,0571212921,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1354567-melissa,4,"This was a tough read. Halfway through I disliked John Nash so intensely that I wasn't sure I could finish the book. He was arrogant, rude, selfish, sexist, and even frightening. The book also highlighted how culturally we are willing to accept not only difficult but harmful behavior from people who are highly gifted, which I hate. However, it's also nearly impossible to disentangle Nash from his illness, and I couldn't help wondering how his mental condition figured into his behavior even before he became obviously ill. By the end of the book, I had much more sympathy for what he endured as a product of his time (the 50s and 60s) as well as what he endured from his illness (insulin shock therapy sounds horrific). The moment toward the end when he asks if it's okay for him to enter a cafeteria at Princeton because he wasn't faculty actually drew tears because it was such a contrast from his earlier arrogance. Nash was a fascinating, complicated, messy, unlikeable person who, in the words of one of his colleagues, was still ""worth saving."" This book is an unflinching look at all of the different facets of that reality."
143,0571212921,http://goodreads.com/user/show/46089881-elsa-k,4,"I had recently re watched ""A Beautiful Mind"" and I was inspired to read the book. John Nash was a fascinating figure. But I will say the movie definitely Hollywoodized him. In the book he is very disturbing, especially in his younger years. He did and said some terrible things. He had a son by his mistress and pretty much abandoned him. He was arrested for exposing himself, tried to come on to other men etc. Sometimes the book was hard to get through as I didn't want to spend so much time with such a creeper! But I still found it interesting, especially how he managed to control his mental health issues over the years. His love story was strange to me- what did Alyssa see in him? I didn't understand all the math background, so I would skim some of that. It was sad to hear how he struggled and was treated in his mental illness. Also sad to hear his second son struggles with schizophrenia too. I would still recommend it as in interesting book, especially to someone with a math background."
144,0571212921,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5153361-annie,4,"I loved the movie so much I was a bit tentative to read the book(in case the story was idealized and distorted exceedingly). However, the book was far more indepth, interesting, and potent that I could have imagined. The story was much more real, wrought with tragedy, beauty, and poignancy. I think if the movie would have adhered more to the truth it would have been far more interesting but it was still well done. Not only did the book provide indepth information in the personal life and accomplishments of Nash, but it also branched into the history of mathematics(related to Nash), Princeton, the Cold War mathematicians, sanitariums and pyschiatric methods during the time, and the nomination and debate related to Nobel prize nominees. At times however I found the mathematical information a bit confusing but I'm only in 11th grade so my incomprehension can not be completely blamed on the book itself. All together it was a fascinating, detailed work."
145,0571212921,http://goodreads.com/user/show/14808426-dhwani-swadia,5,"Read the full review here: https://thereandtheir.com/2017/01/25/...The book takes you on a journey of the life of the extraordinary man, John Nash. Since the story begins right at the birth, we come to understand the kind of person that he is. I appreciate the fact that the book paints the good, the bad and the ugly all with the same brush. This helps us to come to know exactly what kind of a person John Nash was.A beautiful mind is more on the fact that if a person really puts his mind to it, he can come out of a disease that was presumably incurable than the mathematical as well as the economic contributions. The book deals more with the life events than the mathematical equations. I was hoping to read something about how he came upon the Game Theory as well as other discoveries that he made in the field, but I suppose the reason it was omitted was that the field in which Nash worked was so abstract that it would have put off many readers."
146,0571212921,http://goodreads.com/user/show/445677-scott,5,"A very well-written and engaging biography of John Nash. While many readers may have already seen the movie version, I had not. Nash certainly presents a difficult character; at times it is hard to muster sympathy for him, but ultimately I was heartbroken by his schizophrenia and ""lost years."" The fact that he has enjoyed a remission of this disease, and a return to a somewhat normal life, is a testament to the will and love of those around him who rallied support and resources to care for him during his long periods of bizarre behavior. Author Nasar describes the mathematics without getting mired in the details, so the reader has a sense of the import of Nash's achievements without a learned appreciation of them. I enjoyed this book, but will want to read something more light-hearted next!"

He developed a game and later focuses on game theory. He got a position in MIT.

Many years later, he is getting better. And his earlier work is becoming central for economists. He was then awarded the Nobel Prize in economics and returned to Princeton.[Need to scan: the part on Nobel Prize committee sounds interesting]"

I enjoyed the movie more.To be fair, it is easier to paint a tale with more likable characters, intrigue and fairy-tale turnaround, when not restrained by real life. I had no idea how much real-life was altered for the movie. What bothered me most about the book was that at several points, I felt I was reading less of a biography about Nash, and more a story about the lives of people around him and the academic world that he wandered through... with occasional notes about Nash behaving brashly."
150,0571212921,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1400289-chana,4,"Once I started reading this book I realized that the movie, which I had enjoyed, was entertainment, concerning itself more with the strange delusions of John Nash's mental illness than with the life of the real man. More than half of this book is about John Nash before he became ill at age 30. He was this totally arrogant young math genius, eccentric and homosexually inclined. He was pretty hard to like because he was obnoxious and unkind and very self-centered. (I was reminded of how my mother always used to say that we should be glad that we weren't geniuses because they had a very hard time making friends because they were so different from other people. I can't say her statement carried much weight because I had trouble making friends and didn't have the consolation of being a genius. But that was back in the mid-60's and I wondered as I read if John Nash's tragedy had not entered the national consciousness rendering ""genius"" a less than desirable condition). I was particularly appalled by his disregard for his first child and the child's mother. His level of maturity was shocking to me, like maybe that of an 8 to 10 year old boy when he was in his 20's. He was unable to be much of a father to 2nd son either as the child was born at the time that he was becoming ill. So John Nash, still involved in homosexual relationships, fathers a child out of wedlock, deserts mother and child, marries a different woman and fathers another child, and has his ego trampled severly underfoot when he is not acknowledged for his brilliant work by not winning prestigious awards. He then undertakes to solve the Riemann Hypothesis (don't ask me to explain what that is) and his mind just starts making all these weird and faulty connections with numerology, politics and religion. His math becomes gibberish and his actions inexplicable. The next 30 years are essentially lost to him as he and his family suffer through hospitalizations, treatments and all the sorrows this brings.Strangely, John Nash starts to recover on his own and becomes more and more rational. He wins a Nobel in Economics, gives lectures, and remarries Alicia who had divorced him many years earlier but continued to be his main support and friend all the intervening years. It really is miraculous. Not only that but he seemed to mature quite a bit and become a much nicer person than he had been. The sad thing is that his younger son is also schizophrenic and has been in and out of hospitals for years. Alicia and John care for him at home and my heart goes out to them in this. Small point, but I really didn't like the cover of the book, which shows the actor who plays John Nash rather than John Nash himself."

 ""People have a mental picture that this is a difficult problem. Maybe that's the stumbling block. Maybe, if people didn't realize that the problem was 'hard,' they could solve it.""
I am very impressed with how they adapted this into a movie. This book is more factual than the emotionally driven theme of the movie and I liked that. I liked how they differed on that aspect. I loved both of them in their own formats of publications.The maths and physics theories went over my head, but for once I didn't mind reading about them because I was invested in getting to know John Nash better. One of the things that really interested me was the mention of the Italian mathematician ""Ennio De Giorgi"", who before his death was attempting to prove the existence of God by using Math; I want to read that paper to see what he came up with even if its incomplete. At first, I wasn't sure if I found Nash not paying for child support and other unlikeable things that he did, a personality flaw making him a douche or did his schizophrenia justify that behavior? I found it surprising how sympathetic I was towards the Russell Crowe version of Nash as my feelings towards him were a bit negative at this point, but later in the book I found my sympathy kicking back in and felt awed by Alica and Nash's relationship and struggles. It was infact as sad as the movie, even if the writing style of the book was more serious which made me feel like I was reading a research paper at times and that isn't my preferred reading genre but all's well, it pulled through and kept me engaged regardless. I am glad the book ended in a hopeful tone, with Nash getting better and helping around with Johnny and reconciling with Alicia and his first born John David.This will be one of my most memorable reads. I am glad my sister bought this book, 'cause otherwise I wouldn't have picked this one up and would have missed out on a great read."

Well, make it an exception.It is not because the book is not well-written, though powerful and mesmerising it is, nor is It not exceptionally detailed and real. The fact is it's exactly because it was so real that I became evasive of this genius and form an indelible impression on his darksides.When a genius conceived a great achievement for mankind, people Marvel at his grandure and are prone to be deliberately neglectful and blindful of his defects,however fatal and unscrupulous they are. They justified his evils in the name of paying attributes to a great mind. Well, if they think this way, IMHO,screw these people and those geniuses!Nash was a true genius and he was Fortunate enough to have Alicia with him.I always guard against those self-proclaimed masters or experts, vigillant of their hypocrisy.For geniune talents, I admire their contributions but still treat them as people not saints.

155,0571212921,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7861828-matt,3,"This book took me through the full range of emotions. I felt awe, disgust, pity, wonder, joy, confusion, resolution, etc... Most of all it made me introspective as to how I treat others, and how the entire field of Psychiatry treats patients.First of all, I learned that the movie took MANY liberties with the facts. It is about 20% truth, and the rest is style and effects. For many years I have enjoyed the movie and recommended it to friends. So I felt disillusioned when I found out how false it was. But then I thought about the truth, John Nash’s life, and the goals of the film.John Nash did not have visual hallucinations. He didn’t see people who weren’t there, and he never imagined a roommate, or a little girl. But how else do you portray in a movie the reality of his delusions? How do you show a movie audience the absolute belief he had, and how much it had to hurt to find out that much of your life…is imaginary. He often thought he was working for the FBI, or for the world government. He thought he was Royalty, an Arab refugee, Job, Castro, a mouse. He thought he was traveling to Cairo, Kabul, Thebes, Mongolia, or even purgatory, inferno, or some sort of polluted heaven. He lived in constant fear of annihilation, Armageddon, the Apocalypse, the Final day of Judgment, and of certain ominous dates such as May 29th.So I give the film license for showing Schizophrenia in a false light because it portrays the feeling, and the pain and despair that go along with it very well.Here are other interesting things I never knew from the film.John Nash was a draft dodger. It didn’t just scare him…it mortified him. He worked diligently for years to avoid the draft, wrote letters, used University faculty and presidents, and employed every means imaginable to avoid the draft.Alicia (Nash’s wife) was not his first girlfriend, nor the mother of his first child. Eleanor was. They had a son named John David. His last name was not Nash however, because Eleanor and Nash were never married. Though they remained together for some time, and he sometimes spoke of marriage, it never happened.Alicia at first perturbed me. She thought Nash was cute, and pursued him with great vigor (even getting a job at his favorite hang-out, just to see him more often.) Eventually they started sleeping together, until Eleanor arrived at his place one night, and found her there. After much screaming and crying by Eleanor, Nash said “My perfect little world is ruined.”Alicia had quite a different reaction. Eleanor called Alicia to complain, and met with her to discuss the fact that She and Nash were getting married and already had a son. Alicia was pleased. She took the meeting as a sign that “She was beginning to matter.” She continued their courtship until eventually Alicia and Nash were married and had their own son, John Charles.My initial thought was –“Alicia is so ruthless and cold that she deserves what’s coming.” I later regretted that thought. She stuck with Nash through the worst of times. She followed him all over Europe trying to find a place where he was content and sane, but it never happened. He bankrupted her, and left her many, many times.Nash had homosexual flings. While working for a think tank called RAND, he was arrested in a restroom police sting for “indecent exposure.” This was one of many recorded occurrences when he had intimate relationships with men.Eventually Alicia divorced him, and she believed it was for his good. He no longer had the stress of a family or obligations…he could go where he wanted when he wanted with no thought for a family.Years later he finally settled down at Princeton again, and became known as “The Phantom.” He walked the hallways and wrote cryptic messages or math problems on the chalk boards.He became a legend at Princeton among the students. Anybody who was too much of a grind or who lacked social graces was warned that he or she was “going to end up like the phantom”. Yet if a new student complained that having him around made him feel uncomfortable, he was immediately warned: “He was a better mathematician then you’ll ever be.”John Nash was a brilliant mathematician. He solved problems in ways no one else had ever imagined. He proved that “every Riemannian manifold can be isometrically embedded into some Euclidean space.”(FYI – this book has a ton of Math that I did not understand but accepted that it was really hard and really complex)During this period at Princeton, after many hospitalizations, insulin coma therapy, and many attempts to renounce his U.S. citizenship and become a “Citizen of the World”; Alicia eventually let him move back in with her, and get to know his second son. And years later, after he won the Nobel Prize, they did remarry. Even when they were divorced, she felt responsible for him. She suffered huge amounts, and it didn’t end with him. Their son, John Charles, also has Paranoid Schizophrenia. I may not have liked how she entered his life, but she certainly proved her worth, and was indespensible.I’ll end this book report with an Interesting Fact I learned from the book.The Nobel prize in Economics (which Nash won in 1994) is not technically a Nobel Prize. The prize was not one of the awards set out in the will of Alfred Nobel. He listed only physics, chemistry, physiology or medicine, and literature, which have been awarded since 1901. In 1968 an award was added for economics by the Central Bank of Sweden. And they provide the funding separately for the “Sveriges Riksbank Prize in Economic Sciences in Memory of Alfred Nobel”P.S. This book changed the way I see Schizophrenia, and how I interact with Schizophrenic patients and their families. It has been a very worthwhile book for me. I hope others choose to enjoy it as well."

This is my favorite photo of this book. This shows a very young and and absent-minded-looking John Nash. I read this book because I watched the mmovie and I wanted to know more details about his privileged mind that was able to find a way to deal with his mental illness without the medication that made him be someone different from who he wanted to be. This idea of having to sacrifice oneself's essence in order to avoid the horrible sympthoms of mental illness is a conundrum that many mental patients face. A lot of them decide one way or the other, and this is one notorious case about one who decided to deal with his demons himself, and had to pay a high price for that.This is the cover and editorial page of the book I read:

I really liked this book, and think that the movie is a really good first approach to read about this punctual experience of mental illness and a gifted mind.***I also have a blog! Link here: http://lunairereadings.blogspot.com"
157,0571212921,http://goodreads.com/user/show/49938-anastacia,5,"Though it was a bit slow in places (which is probably to be expected given John Nash’s career in mathematics), I really enjoyed reading A Beautiful Mind. I’m interested in history and mental illness and, lately, I have become absolutely fascinated by some of the history of mathematical geniuses, as they tend to be quite a rather unique bunch. I saw the movie version of the book when it was released several years ago, and while I don’t remember much about it other than I liked it, I’m pretty sure the movie was extremely sugarcoated. This was a raw, real account that is somehow simultaneously joyous and tragic. One of the things I am coming to appreciate most in a biography is when the author resists painting a one-dimensional, rosy picture of the subject. Even the best people are imperfect and I resent when all the subject’s flaws are just glossed over as though they never existed. The author did a fabulous job here in painting the entire picture of the great man; a man that is not perfect and, in many ways, an extremely difficult person to deal with. Nash was an incredibly complex man and his genius was both a gift and a curse. He didn’t get along well with people, he was arrogant at times, lacking in social skills and struggled with his sexuality. Rather than coming off as unlikable, though, I was rooting for him and I finished the book with a deep appreciation for the man and his legacy, which, I should add, I don’t completely understand as I am not a part of the mathematics world. And that was another aspect of the book I appreciated – I don’t think it is necessary to be a part of the mathematics world – or even have a deep appreciation for it – to enjoy the book. I’m more interested in the way the brain works and in psychological illnesses than I am math, but on the other hand, I am close to several deeply mathematical-minded people and that may make reading about it more interesting to me. The book was, as I mentioned, very slow in some places and I would have appreciated reading more about his illness than all the great detail about his mathematical achievements, but I suppose that I can’t complain about it because I knew what I was getting into. I just feel that it could have been more interesting if more attention were paid to other details. I ended up skimming some of the last chapters on the history and procedures of the Nobel. I just didn’t find any of that very interesting, and, again, the time and detail could have been better spent on other aspects, in my opinion.I’m on the fence about giving the book 3 or 4 stars. 3 seems unnecessarily harsh, but because it was slow in the beginning and a bit slow in a few chapters toward the end, I can’t really give it a 4. This is another instance where I wish GoodReads would implement half-stars in the rating system. I’d recommend this book to those interested in history, mathematics, biographies of geniuses, and those deeply interested in not only mental illness but also how the brain works in many different ways. I do know that some may find it boring. Even something with the slightest hint of math can be a turn-off for some folks. So, while I would recommend, I’d also add the caveat that one understands that it is not merely about his schizophrenia but his life as a mathematical genius in general."
158,0571212921,http://goodreads.com/user/show/33019-leonora,4,"Having read the book, I don't think I can see the movie. From what I've heard the film is quite good and tells the story of a genius gone mad. I gather that's where the similarity ends.John Nash is (for most of the book) an egotist who enjoys playing dangerous pranks on others, brags that he is one of three smartest men at Princeton, treats his lovers (male and female) as though they are only there for his amusement/pleasure. He is smart, cruel, and completely socially inept. Until his illness, it almost seems like he has Asperger Syndrome (a mild form of autism).However, as Nasar beautifully describes, this is all in line with his personality, which would eventually become schizoid. And, despite his faults I did root for him as he attempts to solve problems no one, even other top mathematicians, have the guts (or audacity) to attempt.Nasar, for the most part, is my favorite kind of biographer. She knows her subject well and doesn't treat him with kid gloves. She accurately interprets his personality in terms of his past and makes him human, understandable, despite his shortcomings. In this way, she reminded me of Jack El-Hai who wrote the brilliant biography, ""The Lobotomist"".Sidenote: his gay relationships were known at Princeton & MIT. I had no idea the math community in the 50s wasn't horribly homophobic! This was one of the most interesting things in the book."
159,0571212921,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2154122-a,1,"Well, I will not read this book again. Nor do I recommend it to anyone.I admit it was interesting to learn more about John Nash, particularly just how good he was, and what his colleagues had to say about his brilliant, beautiful mind. It was eye opening to read about the time of his life when he actively began struggling with his illness, and his subsequent recovery. It was gratifying to read about his Nobel Prize experience.All that said, it was not at all ""good"" enough to entice me to spend my time reading again. First of all, it's a book about a mathematician. A brilliant mathematician whose works I don't really understand even when they are put in ""plain"" English, as she occasionally did. And since he had essentially no life outside of his mathematics, until you get to the part where he is ill, and can no longer do math, it talks a lot about things I don't understand.Also, while there was not a language problem per se, the instances where there was a foul word used it was one of the foulest, and quite off-putting.And last but probably most of all I will not read it again because some of the anecdotes she chose to include about his life just plain made me uncomfortable. I felt a little bit like I had invaded his private life, because even though she never really gave details or was graphic, it just felt too inimately personal."
160,0571212921,http://goodreads.com/user/show/263190-jill,4,"Though I am severely dull when it comes to mathematics (I can’t do any math that moves), I found this biography fascinating and very moving. I enjoyed it all the way through and thought very interesting the story behind Nash’s Nobel Prize. I thought the book was really well written and not off-putting to people like me, who have a hard time wrapping their head around anything mathematically complicated. It’s rather a sad story, but much, much better than the film. I also learned a ton about game theory, what it’s about, and its usage in business, government, and personal strategy. I also learned that mathematics is considered a young man’s field. It seems perfectly reasonable to me, that because of the intense mental rigor, you’d wear out as you age. I love that Nash went back to work after he recovered. I was also very impressed by the strength of his wife, Alicia. His son’s mental illness is really tragic, but I love that Nash takes care of him. A really great, worthwhile, and enjoyable read."
161,0571212921,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5975123-george-p,4,"An excellent bio of the mathematican who co-won a Nobel in economics for his pioneer work in ""game theory"", though he is also well-known among mathematicians for other remarkable work. Though I know nothing about ""partial diferential equations"" etc, I could follow 99% of the book and was fascinated by learning about this genius who suffered from schizophrenia for years and recovered, e.g. that even while suffering from schizophrenia he learned to speak French."
162,0571212921,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1072582-kaethe-douglas,5,A good book that deals well with a delicate subject. Nasar wrote a compassiaonate book. Recommended for anyone who doesn't know enough about the lived experience of having a mental illness. Highly readable.Library copy

167,0571212921,http://goodreads.com/user/show/198798-linda,5,"Great book, the math part was hard for me, but the human part was very interesting!"
168,0571212921,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3816725-larry-bassett,3,"It is hard to know how to say that John Nash is a fairly unique individual. You have to start with the fact that he was a brilliant mathematician. To be a mathematician with a brain that works in fairly amazing ways is hard enough to explain in words I suspect. When I was in graduate school I lived in a house with two other women, one of whom was a graduate student in mathematics. I wish I could find Janet Woodruff today to talk with her about John Nash.John Nash was also someone who suffered from schizophrenia and apparently came back from that after 25 years of suffering and treatment and hospitalization. The book says that mathematics is a specialty of young people and that people in that field rise to the heights of their profession at a young age. The book follows the life of John Nash through a long period of severe disability that also displayed how mathematical Rockstars experience life in academia. It talks about how people who are extremely bright also often have peculiar social disabilities. We follow the life of John Nash through many ups and downs. He is a unique individual from many different points of view. Once again the fact that I experience this as an audible book was an asset for me in getting through a story that I might not have managed to overcome if I had to turn paper pages."
169,0571212921,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1769011-arminzerella,3,"John Nash was a prominent mathematician in the prime of his career – best known for his work on game theory (and its applications in economics) – when he was diagnosed with schizophrenia. Already somewhat eccentric and socially awkward, his illness pushed him over into paranoid and delusional. He was unable to function in the real world and had to be institutionalized. He received treatments, some of which were more successful than others, and like other schizophrenics he relapsed many times. It seemed for many years that John Nash would never recover the thing he valued most – his mind. And then, seemingly out of nowhere, he got better. He became accustomed to the extra noise in his head and found that he was able to distinguish between the thoughts/ideas that were “normal” and the ones that were “crazy.” He began working again as a mathematician and making contributions to his field. Sylvia Nasar’s book is much more detailed than the movie that was based on it, but the way that Nash’s illness is revealed in the movie is much more dramatic (because you’re seeing things from inside of Nash’s head and he doesn’t realize he’s delusional). Although he is described as tall and attractive, there was much about John Nash that was off-putting to many. He could be arrogant and cruel and during his young life he often found himself on the outside – the social outcast of the social outcasts. His brilliance, however, was unquestionable. Nasar spares us most of the mathematical details (which the layperson wouldn’t grasp – even Nash’s colleagues were often gobsmacked at his unique approaches to problems), but brings the man to life. I don’t really follow the mathematics (computations! proofs! reasoning!) or understand the importance of the work that he’s done/doing, but I found his breakthrough out of schizophrenia fascinating. Nash has a son who is also afflicted with this illness."
170,0571212921,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2393446-anne-hawn-smith,5,"The story of the brilliant John Nash is an incredibly complicated one. Did his madness contribute to his difficult, arrogant personality or was he just one of those people who has a severe social disability? I came up with more questions than answers after reading this book. Did he have Asbergers syndrome? Was this why he was so inept at social relations, or was he so contemptuous of everyone around him because he recognized early that he was intellectually so far superior to everyone he knew? Did his brilliance allow him to triumph over schizophrenia of was it just one of those miracles that happen for no reason? I think what I learned from this book was the fragility of the human mind and the weakness of our human vessels. How could someone this brilliant be beset by so many problems? Why is it that genius of any type, intellectual, artistic or diplomatic seems to be so closely related to deficits in other areas of development? Do all great gifts come with a cost? Is the idiot/savant just an extreme version of this paradox? Why couldn't a mind so brilliant find some way to protect himself from madness? "
171,0571212921,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10918354-nurul-badriah,5,"I rarely read autobiography book because it's quite boring for me. But this book is such an amazing and touching book. This is my all time favorite book that I will read over and over again and will recommend to all the people around the world to read it. In my opinion all the smart people have some mental illness problems, not all of them but plenty of them do have psychological problems. This book shows us about how people undergoes psychological problems like schizophrenia in this story and to overcome them by the help of family, friends and society. This book talk about John Nash and about his theory and illness, the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences. This book just took me by storm by the uniqueness, ironically enough because it was based on a real life situation. This book touched me on many levels. The psychology was intriguing, the mathematical philosophies was actually amazing and the humanistic side of love. A Beautiful Mind was by far the most original,realistic, intelligent and heart touching book that I have ever read. John Nash was truly worthy of the Noble Prize."
172,0571212921,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1354567-melissa,4,"This was a tough read. Halfway through I disliked John Nash so intensely that I wasn't sure I could finish the book. He was arrogant, rude, selfish, sexist, and even frightening. The book also highlighted how culturally we are willing to accept not only difficult but harmful behavior from people who are highly gifted, which I hate. However, it's also nearly impossible to disentangle Nash from his illness, and I couldn't help wondering how his mental condition figured into his behavior even before he became obviously ill. By the end of the book, I had much more sympathy for what he endured as a product of his time (the 50s and 60s) as well as what he endured from his illness (insulin shock therapy sounds horrific). The moment toward the end when he asks if it's okay for him to enter a cafeteria at Princeton because he wasn't faculty actually drew tears because it was such a contrast from his earlier arrogance. Nash was a fascinating, complicated, messy, unlikeable person who, in the words of one of his colleagues, was still ""worth saving."" This book is an unflinching look at all of the different facets of that reality."
173,0571212921,http://goodreads.com/user/show/46089881-elsa-k,4,"I had recently re watched ""A Beautiful Mind"" and I was inspired to read the book. John Nash was a fascinating figure. But I will say the movie definitely Hollywoodized him. In the book he is very disturbing, especially in his younger years. He did and said some terrible things. He had a son by his mistress and pretty much abandoned him. He was arrested for exposing himself, tried to come on to other men etc. Sometimes the book was hard to get through as I didn't want to spend so much time with such a creeper! But I still found it interesting, especially how he managed to control his mental health issues over the years. His love story was strange to me- what did Alyssa see in him? I didn't understand all the math background, so I would skim some of that. It was sad to hear how he struggled and was treated in his mental illness. Also sad to hear his second son struggles with schizophrenia too. I would still recommend it as in interesting book, especially to someone with a math background."
174,0571212921,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5153361-annie,4,"I loved the movie so much I was a bit tentative to read the book(in case the story was idealized and distorted exceedingly). However, the book was far more indepth, interesting, and potent that I could have imagined. The story was much more real, wrought with tragedy, beauty, and poignancy. I think if the movie would have adhered more to the truth it would have been far more interesting but it was still well done. Not only did the book provide indepth information in the personal life and accomplishments of Nash, but it also branched into the history of mathematics(related to Nash), Princeton, the Cold War mathematicians, sanitariums and pyschiatric methods during the time, and the nomination and debate related to Nobel prize nominees. At times however I found the mathematical information a bit confusing but I'm only in 11th grade so my incomprehension can not be completely blamed on the book itself. All together it was a fascinating, detailed work."
175,0571212921,http://goodreads.com/user/show/14808426-dhwani-swadia,5,"Read the full review here: https://thereandtheir.com/2017/01/25/...The book takes you on a journey of the life of the extraordinary man, John Nash. Since the story begins right at the birth, we come to understand the kind of person that he is. I appreciate the fact that the book paints the good, the bad and the ugly all with the same brush. This helps us to come to know exactly what kind of a person John Nash was.A beautiful mind is more on the fact that if a person really puts his mind to it, he can come out of a disease that was presumably incurable than the mathematical as well as the economic contributions. The book deals more with the life events than the mathematical equations. I was hoping to read something about how he came upon the Game Theory as well as other discoveries that he made in the field, but I suppose the reason it was omitted was that the field in which Nash worked was so abstract that it would have put off many readers."
176,0571212921,http://goodreads.com/user/show/445677-scott,5,"A very well-written and engaging biography of John Nash. While many readers may have already seen the movie version, I had not. Nash certainly presents a difficult character; at times it is hard to muster sympathy for him, but ultimately I was heartbroken by his schizophrenia and ""lost years."" The fact that he has enjoyed a remission of this disease, and a return to a somewhat normal life, is a testament to the will and love of those around him who rallied support and resources to care for him during his long periods of bizarre behavior. Author Nasar describes the mathematics without getting mired in the details, so the reader has a sense of the import of Nash's achievements without a learned appreciation of them. I enjoyed this book, but will want to read something more light-hearted next!"

I enjoyed the movie more.To be fair, it is easier to paint a tale with more likable characters, intrigue and fairy-tale turnaround, when not restrained by real life. I had no idea how much real-life was altered for the movie. What bothered me most about the book was that at several points, I felt I was reading less of a biography about Nash, and more a story about the lives of people around him and the academic world that he wandered through... with occasional notes about Nash behaving brashly."
180,0571212921,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1400289-chana,4,"Once I started reading this book I realized that the movie, which I had enjoyed, was entertainment, concerning itself more with the strange delusions of John Nash's mental illness than with the life of the real man. More than half of this book is about John Nash before he became ill at age 30. He was this totally arrogant young math genius, eccentric and homosexually inclined. He was pretty hard to like because he was obnoxious and unkind and very self-centered. (I was reminded of how my mother always used to say that we should be glad that we weren't geniuses because they had a very hard time making friends because they were so different from other people. I can't say her statement carried much weight because I had trouble making friends and didn't have the consolation of being a genius. But that was back in the mid-60's and I wondered as I read if John Nash's tragedy had not entered the national consciousness rendering ""genius"" a less than desirable condition). I was particularly appalled by his disregard for his first child and the child's mother. His level of maturity was shocking to me, like maybe that of an 8 to 10 year old boy when he was in his 20's. He was unable to be much of a father to 2nd son either as the child was born at the time that he was becoming ill. So John Nash, still involved in homosexual relationships, fathers a child out of wedlock, deserts mother and child, marries a different woman and fathers another child, and has his ego trampled severly underfoot when he is not acknowledged for his brilliant work by not winning prestigious awards. He then undertakes to solve the Riemann Hypothesis (don't ask me to explain what that is) and his mind just starts making all these weird and faulty connections with numerology, politics and religion. His math becomes gibberish and his actions inexplicable. The next 30 years are essentially lost to him as he and his family suffer through hospitalizations, treatments and all the sorrows this brings.Strangely, John Nash starts to recover on his own and becomes more and more rational. He wins a Nobel in Economics, gives lectures, and remarries Alicia who had divorced him many years earlier but continued to be his main support and friend all the intervening years. It really is miraculous. Not only that but he seemed to mature quite a bit and become a much nicer person than he had been. The sad thing is that his younger son is also schizophrenic and has been in and out of hospitals for years. Alicia and John care for him at home and my heart goes out to them in this. Small point, but I really didn't like the cover of the book, which shows the actor who plays John Nash rather than John Nash himself."

 ""People have a mental picture that this is a difficult problem. Maybe that's the stumbling block. Maybe, if people didn't realize that the problem was 'hard,' they could solve it.""
I am very impressed with how they adapted this into a movie. This book is more factual than the emotionally driven theme of the movie and I liked that. I liked how they differed on that aspect. I loved both of them in their own formats of publications.The maths and physics theories went over my head, but for once I didn't mind reading about them because I was invested in getting to know John Nash better. One of the things that really interested me was the mention of the Italian mathematician ""Ennio De Giorgi"", who before his death was attempting to prove the existence of God by using Math; I want to read that paper to see what he came up with even if its incomplete. At first, I wasn't sure if I found Nash not paying for child support and other unlikeable things that he did, a personality flaw making him a douche or did his schizophrenia justify that behavior? I found it surprising how sympathetic I was towards the Russell Crowe version of Nash as my feelings towards him were a bit negative at this point, but later in the book I found my sympathy kicking back in and felt awed by Alica and Nash's relationship and struggles. It was infact as sad as the movie, even if the writing style of the book was more serious which made me feel like I was reading a research paper at times and that isn't my preferred reading genre but all's well, it pulled through and kept me engaged regardless. I am glad the book ended in a hopeful tone, with Nash getting better and helping around with Johnny and reconciling with Alicia and his first born John David.This will be one of my most memorable reads. I am glad my sister bought this book, 'cause otherwise I wouldn't have picked this one up and would have missed out on a great read."

Well, make it an exception.It is not because the book is not well-written, though powerful and mesmerising it is, nor is It not exceptionally detailed and real. The fact is it's exactly because it was so real that I became evasive of this genius and form an indelible impression on his darksides.When a genius conceived a great achievement for mankind, people Marvel at his grandure and are prone to be deliberately neglectful and blindful of his defects,however fatal and unscrupulous they are. They justified his evils in the name of paying attributes to a great mind. Well, if they think this way, IMHO,screw these people and those geniuses!Nash was a true genius and he was Fortunate enough to have Alicia with him.I always guard against those self-proclaimed masters or experts, vigillant of their hypocrisy.For geniune talents, I admire their contributions but still treat them as people not saints.

185,0571212921,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7861828-matt,3,"This book took me through the full range of emotions. I felt awe, disgust, pity, wonder, joy, confusion, resolution, etc... Most of all it made me introspective as to how I treat others, and how the entire field of Psychiatry treats patients.First of all, I learned that the movie took MANY liberties with the facts. It is about 20% truth, and the rest is style and effects. For many years I have enjoyed the movie and recommended it to friends. So I felt disillusioned when I found out how false it was. But then I thought about the truth, John Nash’s life, and the goals of the film.John Nash did not have visual hallucinations. He didn’t see people who weren’t there, and he never imagined a roommate, or a little girl. But how else do you portray in a movie the reality of his delusions? How do you show a movie audience the absolute belief he had, and how much it had to hurt to find out that much of your life…is imaginary. He often thought he was working for the FBI, or for the world government. He thought he was Royalty, an Arab refugee, Job, Castro, a mouse. He thought he was traveling to Cairo, Kabul, Thebes, Mongolia, or even purgatory, inferno, or some sort of polluted heaven. He lived in constant fear of annihilation, Armageddon, the Apocalypse, the Final day of Judgment, and of certain ominous dates such as May 29th.So I give the film license for showing Schizophrenia in a false light because it portrays the feeling, and the pain and despair that go along with it very well.Here are other interesting things I never knew from the film.John Nash was a draft dodger. It didn’t just scare him…it mortified him. He worked diligently for years to avoid the draft, wrote letters, used University faculty and presidents, and employed every means imaginable to avoid the draft.Alicia (Nash’s wife) was not his first girlfriend, nor the mother of his first child. Eleanor was. They had a son named John David. His last name was not Nash however, because Eleanor and Nash were never married. Though they remained together for some time, and he sometimes spoke of marriage, it never happened.Alicia at first perturbed me. She thought Nash was cute, and pursued him with great vigor (even getting a job at his favorite hang-out, just to see him more often.) Eventually they started sleeping together, until Eleanor arrived at his place one night, and found her there. After much screaming and crying by Eleanor, Nash said “My perfect little world is ruined.”Alicia had quite a different reaction. Eleanor called Alicia to complain, and met with her to discuss the fact that She and Nash were getting married and already had a son. Alicia was pleased. She took the meeting as a sign that “She was beginning to matter.” She continued their courtship until eventually Alicia and Nash were married and had their own son, John Charles.My initial thought was –“Alicia is so ruthless and cold that she deserves what’s coming.” I later regretted that thought. She stuck with Nash through the worst of times. She followed him all over Europe trying to find a place where he was content and sane, but it never happened. He bankrupted her, and left her many, many times.Nash had homosexual flings. While working for a think tank called RAND, he was arrested in a restroom police sting for “indecent exposure.” This was one of many recorded occurrences when he had intimate relationships with men.Eventually Alicia divorced him, and she believed it was for his good. He no longer had the stress of a family or obligations…he could go where he wanted when he wanted with no thought for a family.Years later he finally settled down at Princeton again, and became known as “The Phantom.” He walked the hallways and wrote cryptic messages or math problems on the chalk boards.He became a legend at Princeton among the students. Anybody who was too much of a grind or who lacked social graces was warned that he or she was “going to end up like the phantom”. Yet if a new student complained that having him around made him feel uncomfortable, he was immediately warned: “He was a better mathematician then you’ll ever be.”John Nash was a brilliant mathematician. He solved problems in ways no one else had ever imagined. He proved that “every Riemannian manifold can be isometrically embedded into some Euclidean space.”(FYI – this book has a ton of Math that I did not understand but accepted that it was really hard and really complex)During this period at Princeton, after many hospitalizations, insulin coma therapy, and many attempts to renounce his U.S. citizenship and become a “Citizen of the World”; Alicia eventually let him move back in with her, and get to know his second son. And years later, after he won the Nobel Prize, they did remarry. Even when they were divorced, she felt responsible for him. She suffered huge amounts, and it didn’t end with him. Their son, John Charles, also has Paranoid Schizophrenia. I may not have liked how she entered his life, but she certainly proved her worth, and was indespensible.I’ll end this book report with an Interesting Fact I learned from the book.The Nobel prize in Economics (which Nash won in 1994) is not technically a Nobel Prize. The prize was not one of the awards set out in the will of Alfred Nobel. He listed only physics, chemistry, physiology or medicine, and literature, which have been awarded since 1901. In 1968 an award was added for economics by the Central Bank of Sweden. And they provide the funding separately for the “Sveriges Riksbank Prize in Economic Sciences in Memory of Alfred Nobel”P.S. This book changed the way I see Schizophrenia, and how I interact with Schizophrenic patients and their families. It has been a very worthwhile book for me. I hope others choose to enjoy it as well."

This is my favorite photo of this book. This shows a very young and and absent-minded-looking John Nash. I read this book because I watched the mmovie and I wanted to know more details about his privileged mind that was able to find a way to deal with his mental illness without the medication that made him be someone different from who he wanted to be. This idea of having to sacrifice oneself's essence in order to avoid the horrible sympthoms of mental illness is a conundrum that many mental patients face. A lot of them decide one way or the other, and this is one notorious case about one who decided to deal with his demons himself, and had to pay a high price for that.This is the cover and editorial page of the book I read:

I really liked this book, and think that the movie is a really good first approach to read about this punctual experience of mental illness and a gifted mind.***I also have a blog! Link here: http://lunairereadings.blogspot.com"
187,0571212921,http://goodreads.com/user/show/49938-anastacia,5,"Though it was a bit slow in places (which is probably to be expected given John Nash’s career in mathematics), I really enjoyed reading A Beautiful Mind. I’m interested in history and mental illness and, lately, I have become absolutely fascinated by some of the history of mathematical geniuses, as they tend to be quite a rather unique bunch. I saw the movie version of the book when it was released several years ago, and while I don’t remember much about it other than I liked it, I’m pretty sure the movie was extremely sugarcoated. This was a raw, real account that is somehow simultaneously joyous and tragic. One of the things I am coming to appreciate most in a biography is when the author resists painting a one-dimensional, rosy picture of the subject. Even the best people are imperfect and I resent when all the subject’s flaws are just glossed over as though they never existed. The author did a fabulous job here in painting the entire picture of the great man; a man that is not perfect and, in many ways, an extremely difficult person to deal with. Nash was an incredibly complex man and his genius was both a gift and a curse. He didn’t get along well with people, he was arrogant at times, lacking in social skills and struggled with his sexuality. Rather than coming off as unlikable, though, I was rooting for him and I finished the book with a deep appreciation for the man and his legacy, which, I should add, I don’t completely understand as I am not a part of the mathematics world. And that was another aspect of the book I appreciated – I don’t think it is necessary to be a part of the mathematics world – or even have a deep appreciation for it – to enjoy the book. I’m more interested in the way the brain works and in psychological illnesses than I am math, but on the other hand, I am close to several deeply mathematical-minded people and that may make reading about it more interesting to me. The book was, as I mentioned, very slow in some places and I would have appreciated reading more about his illness than all the great detail about his mathematical achievements, but I suppose that I can’t complain about it because I knew what I was getting into. I just feel that it could have been more interesting if more attention were paid to other details. I ended up skimming some of the last chapters on the history and procedures of the Nobel. I just didn’t find any of that very interesting, and, again, the time and detail could have been better spent on other aspects, in my opinion.I’m on the fence about giving the book 3 or 4 stars. 3 seems unnecessarily harsh, but because it was slow in the beginning and a bit slow in a few chapters toward the end, I can’t really give it a 4. This is another instance where I wish GoodReads would implement half-stars in the rating system. I’d recommend this book to those interested in history, mathematics, biographies of geniuses, and those deeply interested in not only mental illness but also how the brain works in many different ways. I do know that some may find it boring. Even something with the slightest hint of math can be a turn-off for some folks. So, while I would recommend, I’d also add the caveat that one understands that it is not merely about his schizophrenia but his life as a mathematical genius in general."
188,0571212921,http://goodreads.com/user/show/33019-leonora,4,"Having read the book, I don't think I can see the movie. From what I've heard the film is quite good and tells the story of a genius gone mad. I gather that's where the similarity ends.John Nash is (for most of the book) an egotist who enjoys playing dangerous pranks on others, brags that he is one of three smartest men at Princeton, treats his lovers (male and female) as though they are only there for his amusement/pleasure. He is smart, cruel, and completely socially inept. Until his illness, it almost seems like he has Asperger Syndrome (a mild form of autism).However, as Nasar beautifully describes, this is all in line with his personality, which would eventually become schizoid. And, despite his faults I did root for him as he attempts to solve problems no one, even other top mathematicians, have the guts (or audacity) to attempt.Nasar, for the most part, is my favorite kind of biographer. She knows her subject well and doesn't treat him with kid gloves. She accurately interprets his personality in terms of his past and makes him human, understandable, despite his shortcomings. In this way, she reminded me of Jack El-Hai who wrote the brilliant biography, ""The Lobotomist"".Sidenote: his gay relationships were known at Princeton & MIT. I had no idea the math community in the 50s wasn't horribly homophobic! This was one of the most interesting things in the book."
189,0571212921,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2154122-a,1,"Well, I will not read this book again. Nor do I recommend it to anyone.I admit it was interesting to learn more about John Nash, particularly just how good he was, and what his colleagues had to say about his brilliant, beautiful mind. It was eye opening to read about the time of his life when he actively began struggling with his illness, and his subsequent recovery. It was gratifying to read about his Nobel Prize experience.All that said, it was not at all ""good"" enough to entice me to spend my time reading again. First of all, it's a book about a mathematician. A brilliant mathematician whose works I don't really understand even when they are put in ""plain"" English, as she occasionally did. And since he had essentially no life outside of his mathematics, until you get to the part where he is ill, and can no longer do math, it talks a lot about things I don't understand.Also, while there was not a language problem per se, the instances where there was a foul word used it was one of the foulest, and quite off-putting.And last but probably most of all I will not read it again because some of the anecdotes she chose to include about his life just plain made me uncomfortable. I felt a little bit like I had invaded his private life, because even though she never really gave details or was graphic, it just felt too inimately personal."
190,0571212921,http://goodreads.com/user/show/263190-jill,4,"Though I am severely dull when it comes to mathematics (I can’t do any math that moves), I found this biography fascinating and very moving. I enjoyed it all the way through and thought very interesting the story behind Nash’s Nobel Prize. I thought the book was really well written and not off-putting to people like me, who have a hard time wrapping their head around anything mathematically complicated. It’s rather a sad story, but much, much better than the film. I also learned a ton about game theory, what it’s about, and its usage in business, government, and personal strategy. I also learned that mathematics is considered a young man’s field. It seems perfectly reasonable to me, that because of the intense mental rigor, you’d wear out as you age. I love that Nash went back to work after he recovered. I was also very impressed by the strength of his wife, Alicia. His son’s mental illness is really tragic, but I love that Nash takes care of him. A really great, worthwhile, and enjoyable read."

198,0571212921,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3816725-larry-bassett,3,"It is hard to know how to say that John Nash is a fairly unique individual. You have to start with the fact that he was a brilliant mathematician. To be a mathematician with a brain that works in fairly amazing ways is hard enough to explain in words I suspect. When I was in graduate school I lived in a house with two other women, one of whom was a graduate student in mathematics. I wish I could find Janet Woodruff today to talk with her about John Nash.John Nash was also someone who suffered from schizophrenia and apparently came back from that after 25 years of suffering and treatment and hospitalization. The book says that mathematics is a specialty of young people and that people in that field rise to the heights of their profession at a young age. The book follows the life of John Nash through a long period of severe disability that also displayed how mathematical Rockstars experience life in academia. It talks about how people who are extremely bright also often have peculiar social disabilities. We follow the life of John Nash through many ups and downs. He is a unique individual from many different points of view. Once again the fact that I experience this as an audible book was an asset for me in getting through a story that I might not have managed to overcome if I had to turn paper pages."
199,0571212921,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1769011-arminzerella,3,"John Nash was a prominent mathematician in the prime of his career – best known for his work on game theory (and its applications in economics) – when he was diagnosed with schizophrenia. Already somewhat eccentric and socially awkward, his illness pushed him over into paranoid and delusional. He was unable to function in the real world and had to be institutionalized. He received treatments, some of which were more successful than others, and like other schizophrenics he relapsed many times. It seemed for many years that John Nash would never recover the thing he valued most – his mind. And then, seemingly out of nowhere, he got better. He became accustomed to the extra noise in his head and found that he was able to distinguish between the thoughts/ideas that were “normal” and the ones that were “crazy.” He began working again as a mathematician and making contributions to his field. Sylvia Nasar’s book is much more detailed than the movie that was based on it, but the way that Nash’s illness is revealed in the movie is much more dramatic (because you’re seeing things from inside of Nash’s head and he doesn’t realize he’s delusional). Although he is described as tall and attractive, there was much about John Nash that was off-putting to many. He could be arrogant and cruel and during his young life he often found himself on the outside – the social outcast of the social outcasts. His brilliance, however, was unquestionable. Nasar spares us most of the mathematical details (which the layperson wouldn’t grasp – even Nash’s colleagues were often gobsmacked at his unique approaches to problems), but brings the man to life. I don’t really follow the mathematics (computations! proofs! reasoning!) or understand the importance of the work that he’s done/doing, but I found his breakthrough out of schizophrenia fascinating. Nash has a son who is also afflicted with this illness."
200,0571212921,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2393446-anne-hawn-smith,5,"The story of the brilliant John Nash is an incredibly complicated one. Did his madness contribute to his difficult, arrogant personality or was he just one of those people who has a severe social disability? I came up with more questions than answers after reading this book. Did he have Asbergers syndrome? Was this why he was so inept at social relations, or was he so contemptuous of everyone around him because he recognized early that he was intellectually so far superior to everyone he knew? Did his brilliance allow him to triumph over schizophrenia of was it just one of those miracles that happen for no reason? I think what I learned from this book was the fragility of the human mind and the weakness of our human vessels. How could someone this brilliant be beset by so many problems? Why is it that genius of any type, intellectual, artistic or diplomatic seems to be so closely related to deficits in other areas of development? Do all great gifts come with a cost? Is the idiot/savant just an extreme version of this paradox? Why couldn't a mind so brilliant find some way to protect himself from madness? "
201,0571212921,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10918354-nurul-badriah,5,"I rarely read autobiography book because it's quite boring for me. But this book is such an amazing and touching book. This is my all time favorite book that I will read over and over again and will recommend to all the people around the world to read it. In my opinion all the smart people have some mental illness problems, not all of them but plenty of them do have psychological problems. This book shows us about how people undergoes psychological problems like schizophrenia in this story and to overcome them by the help of family, friends and society. This book talk about John Nash and about his theory and illness, the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences. This book just took me by storm by the uniqueness, ironically enough because it was based on a real life situation. This book touched me on many levels. The psychology was intriguing, the mathematical philosophies was actually amazing and the humanistic side of love. A Beautiful Mind was by far the most original,realistic, intelligent and heart touching book that I have ever read. John Nash was truly worthy of the Noble Prize."
202,0571212921,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1354567-melissa,4,"This was a tough read. Halfway through I disliked John Nash so intensely that I wasn't sure I could finish the book. He was arrogant, rude, selfish, sexist, and even frightening. The book also highlighted how culturally we are willing to accept not only difficult but harmful behavior from people who are highly gifted, which I hate. However, it's also nearly impossible to disentangle Nash from his illness, and I couldn't help wondering how his mental condition figured into his behavior even before he became obviously ill. By the end of the book, I had much more sympathy for what he endured as a product of his time (the 50s and 60s) as well as what he endured from his illness (insulin shock therapy sounds horrific). The moment toward the end when he asks if it's okay for him to enter a cafeteria at Princeton because he wasn't faculty actually drew tears because it was such a contrast from his earlier arrogance. Nash was a fascinating, complicated, messy, unlikeable person who, in the words of one of his colleagues, was still ""worth saving."" This book is an unflinching look at all of the different facets of that reality."
203,0571212921,http://goodreads.com/user/show/46089881-elsa-k,4,"I had recently re watched ""A Beautiful Mind"" and I was inspired to read the book. John Nash was a fascinating figure. But I will say the movie definitely Hollywoodized him. In the book he is very disturbing, especially in his younger years. He did and said some terrible things. He had a son by his mistress and pretty much abandoned him. He was arrested for exposing himself, tried to come on to other men etc. Sometimes the book was hard to get through as I didn't want to spend so much time with such a creeper! But I still found it interesting, especially how he managed to control his mental health issues over the years. His love story was strange to me- what did Alyssa see in him? I didn't understand all the math background, so I would skim some of that. It was sad to hear how he struggled and was treated in his mental illness. Also sad to hear his second son struggles with schizophrenia too. I would still recommend it as in interesting book, especially to someone with a math background."
204,0571212921,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5153361-annie,4,"I loved the movie so much I was a bit tentative to read the book(in case the story was idealized and distorted exceedingly). However, the book was far more indepth, interesting, and potent that I could have imagined. The story was much more real, wrought with tragedy, beauty, and poignancy. I think if the movie would have adhered more to the truth it would have been far more interesting but it was still well done. Not only did the book provide indepth information in the personal life and accomplishments of Nash, but it also branched into the history of mathematics(related to Nash), Princeton, the Cold War mathematicians, sanitariums and pyschiatric methods during the time, and the nomination and debate related to Nobel prize nominees. At times however I found the mathematical information a bit confusing but I'm only in 11th grade so my incomprehension can not be completely blamed on the book itself. All together it was a fascinating, detailed work."
205,0571212921,http://goodreads.com/user/show/14808426-dhwani-swadia,5,"Read the full review here: https://thereandtheir.com/2017/01/25/...The book takes you on a journey of the life of the extraordinary man, John Nash. Since the story begins right at the birth, we come to understand the kind of person that he is. I appreciate the fact that the book paints the good, the bad and the ugly all with the same brush. This helps us to come to know exactly what kind of a person John Nash was.A beautiful mind is more on the fact that if a person really puts his mind to it, he can come out of a disease that was presumably incurable than the mathematical as well as the economic contributions. The book deals more with the life events than the mathematical equations. I was hoping to read something about how he came upon the Game Theory as well as other discoveries that he made in the field, but I suppose the reason it was omitted was that the field in which Nash worked was so abstract that it would have put off many readers."

Nash certainly presents a difficult character; at times it is hard to muster sympathy for him, but ultimately I was heartbroken by his schizophrenia and ""lost years."" The fact that he has enjoyed a remission of this disease, and a return to a somewhat normal life, is a testament to the will and love of those around him who rallied support and resources to care for him during his long periods of bizarre behavior. Author Nasar describes the mathematics without getting mired in the details, so the reader has a sense of the import of Nash's achievements without a learned appreciation of them. I enjoyed this book, but will want to read something more light-hearted next!"

He developed a game and later focuses on game theory. He got a position in MIT. Here it’s mostly personal stories: he impregnated a woman he dated but refused to marry her; he eventually married a student from an upper class family; he started to show signs of schizophrenia, including turning down a professorship at Chicago because he is becoming emperor of Antarctica. Many years later, he is getting better. And his earlier work is becoming central for economists.

I enjoyed the movie more.To be fair, it is easier to paint a tale with more likable characters, intrigue and fairy-tale turnaround, when not restrained by real life. I had no idea how much real-life was altered for the movie. What bothered me most about the book was that at several points, I felt I was reading less of a biography about Nash, and more a story about the lives of people around him and the academic world that he wandered through... with occasional notes about Nash behaving brashly."
210,0571212921,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1400289-chana,4,"Once I started reading this book I realized that the movie, which I had enjoyed, was entertainment, concerning itself more with the strange delusions of John Nash's mental illness than with the life of the real man. More than half of this book is about John Nash before he became ill at age 30. He was this totally arrogant young math genius, eccentric and homosexually inclined. He was pretty hard to like because he was obnoxious and unkind and very self-centered. (I was reminded of how my mother always used to say that we should be glad that we weren't geniuses because they had a very hard time making friends because they were so different from other people. I can't say her statement carried much weight because I had trouble making friends and didn't have the consolation of being a genius. But that was back in the mid-60's and I wondered as I read if John Nash's tragedy had not entered the national consciousness rendering ""genius"" a less than desirable condition). I was particularly appalled by his disregard for his first child and the child's mother. His level of maturity was shocking to me, like maybe that of an 8 to 10 year old boy when he was in his 20's. He was unable to be much of a father to 2nd son either as the child was born at the time that he was becoming ill. So John Nash, still involved in homosexual relationships, fathers a child out of wedlock, deserts mother and child, marries a different woman and fathers another child, and has his ego trampled severly underfoot when he is not acknowledged for his brilliant work by not winning prestigious awards. He then undertakes to solve the Riemann Hypothesis (don't ask me to explain what that is) and his mind just starts making all these weird and faulty connections with numerology, politics and religion. His math becomes gibberish and his actions inexplicable. The next 30 years are essentially lost to him as he and his family suffer through hospitalizations, treatments and all the sorrows this brings.Strangely, John Nash starts to recover on his own and becomes more and more rational. He wins a Nobel in Economics, gives lectures, and remarries Alicia who had divorced him many years earlier but continued to be his main support and friend all the intervening years. It really is miraculous. Not only that but he seemed to mature quite a bit and become a much nicer person than he had been. The sad thing is that his younger son is also schizophrenic and has been in and out of hospitals for years. Alicia and John care for him at home and my heart goes out to them in this. Small point, but I really didn't like the cover of the book, which shows the actor who plays John Nash rather than John Nash himself."

 ""People have a mental picture that this is a difficult problem. Maybe that's the stumbling block. Maybe, if people didn't realize that the problem was 'hard,' they could solve it.""
I am very impressed with how they adapted this into a movie. This book is more factual than the emotionally driven theme of the movie and I liked that. I liked how they differed on that aspect. I loved both of them in their own formats of publications.The maths and physics theories went over my head, but for once I didn't mind reading about them because I was invested in getting to know John Nash better. One of the things that really interested me was the mention of the Italian mathematician ""Ennio De Giorgi"", who before his death was attempting to prove the existence of God by using Math; I want to read that paper to see what he came up with even if its incomplete. At first, I wasn't sure if I found Nash not paying for child support and other unlikeable things that he did, a personality flaw making him a douche or did his schizophrenia justify that behavior? I found it surprising how sympathetic I was towards the Russell Crowe version of Nash as my feelings towards him were a bit negative at this point, but later in the book I found my sympathy kicking back in and felt awed by Alica and Nash's relationship and struggles. It was infact as sad as the movie, even if the writing style of the book was more serious which made me feel like I was reading a research paper at times and that isn't my preferred reading genre but all's well, it pulled through and kept me engaged regardless. I am glad the book ended in a hopeful tone, with Nash getting better and helping around with Johnny and reconciling with Alicia and his first born John David.This will be one of my most memorable reads. I am glad my sister bought this book, 'cause otherwise I wouldn't have picked this one up and would have missed out on a great read."

Well, make it an exception.It is not because the book is not well-written, though powerful and mesmerising it is, nor is It not exceptionally detailed and real. The fact is it's exactly because it was so real that I became evasive of this genius and form an indelible impression on his darksides.When a genius conceived a great achievement for mankind, people Marvel at his grandure and are prone to be deliberately neglectful and blindful of his defects,however fatal and unscrupulous they are. They justified his evils in the name of paying attributes to a great mind. Well, if they think this way, IMHO,screw these people and those geniuses!Nash was a true genius and he was Fortunate enough to have Alicia with him.I always guard against those self-proclaimed masters or experts, vigillant of their hypocrisy.For geniune talents, I admire their contributions but still treat them as people not saints. When I perceived their darkness, I wouln't be surprised.Dedicate this short review to Alicia!"

215,0571212921,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7861828-matt,3,"This book took me through the full range of emotions. I felt awe, disgust, pity, wonder, joy, confusion, resolution, etc... Most of all it made me introspective as to how I treat others, and how the entire field of Psychiatry treats patients.First of all, I learned that the movie took MANY liberties with the facts. It is about 20% truth, and the rest is style and effects. For many years I have enjoyed the movie and recommended it to friends. So I felt disillusioned when I found out how false it was. But then I thought about the truth, John Nash’s life, and the goals of the film.John Nash did not have visual hallucinations. He didn’t see people who weren’t there, and he never imagined a roommate, or a little girl. But how else do you portray in a movie the reality of his delusions? How do you show a movie audience the absolute belief he had, and how much it had to hurt to find out that much of your life…is imaginary. He often thought he was working for the FBI, or for the world government. He thought he was Royalty, an Arab refugee, Job, Castro, a mouse. He thought he was traveling to Cairo, Kabul, Thebes, Mongolia, or even purgatory, inferno, or some sort of polluted heaven. He lived in constant fear of annihilation, Armageddon, the Apocalypse, the Final day of Judgment, and of certain ominous dates such as May 29th.So I give the film license for showing Schizophrenia in a false light because it portrays the feeling, and the pain and despair that go along with it very well.Here are other interesting things I never knew from the film.John Nash was a draft dodger. It didn’t just scare him…it mortified him. He worked diligently for years to avoid the draft, wrote letters, used University faculty and presidents, and employed every means imaginable to avoid the draft.Alicia (Nash’s wife) was not his first girlfriend, nor the mother of his first child. Eleanor was. They had a son named John David. His last name was not Nash however, because Eleanor and Nash were never married. Though they remained together for some time, and he sometimes spoke of marriage, it never happened.Alicia at first perturbed me. She thought Nash was cute, and pursued him with great vigor (even getting a job at his favorite hang-out, just to see him more often.) Eventually they started sleeping together, until Eleanor arrived at his place one night, and found her there. After much screaming and crying by Eleanor, Nash said “My perfect little world is ruined.”Alicia had quite a different reaction. Eleanor called Alicia to complain, and met with her to discuss the fact that She and Nash were getting married and already had a son. Alicia was pleased. She took the meeting as a sign that “She was beginning to matter.” She continued their courtship until eventually Alicia and Nash were married and had their own son, John Charles.My initial thought was –“Alicia is so ruthless and cold that she deserves what’s coming.” I later regretted that thought. She stuck with Nash through the worst of times. She followed him all over Europe trying to find a place where he was content and sane, but it never happened. He bankrupted her, and left her many, many times.Nash had homosexual flings. While working for a think tank called RAND, he was arrested in a restroom police sting for “indecent exposure.” This was one of many recorded occurrences when he had intimate relationships with men.Eventually Alicia divorced him, and she believed it was for his good. He no longer had the stress of a family or obligations…he could go where he wanted when he wanted with no thought for a family.Years later he finally settled down at Princeton again, and became known as “The Phantom.” He walked the hallways and wrote cryptic messages or math problems on the chalk boards.He became a legend at Princeton among the students. Anybody who was too much of a grind or who lacked social graces was warned that he or she was “going to end up like the phantom”. Yet if a new student complained that having him around made him feel uncomfortable, he was immediately warned: “He was a better mathematician then you’ll ever be.”John Nash was a brilliant mathematician. He solved problems in ways no one else had ever imagined. He proved that “every Riemannian manifold can be isometrically embedded into some Euclidean space.”(FYI – this book has a ton of Math that I did not understand but accepted that it was really hard and really complex)During this period at Princeton, after many hospitalizations, insulin coma therapy, and many attempts to renounce his U.S. citizenship and become a “Citizen of the World”; Alicia eventually let him move back in with her, and get to know his second son. And years later, after he won the Nobel Prize, they did remarry. Even when they were divorced, she felt responsible for him. She suffered huge amounts, and it didn’t end with him. Their son, John Charles, also has Paranoid Schizophrenia. I may not have liked how she entered his life, but she certainly proved her worth, and was indespensible.I’ll end this book report with an Interesting Fact I learned from the book.The Nobel prize in Economics (which Nash won in 1994) is not technically a Nobel Prize. The prize was not one of the awards set out in the will of Alfred Nobel. He listed only physics, chemistry, physiology or medicine, and literature, which have been awarded since 1901. In 1968 an award was added for economics by the Central Bank of Sweden. And they provide the funding separately for the “Sveriges Riksbank Prize in Economic Sciences in Memory of Alfred Nobel”P.S. This book changed the way I see Schizophrenia, and how I interact with Schizophrenic patients and their families. It has been a very worthwhile book for me. I hope others choose to enjoy it as well."

This is my favorite photo of this book. This shows a very young and and absent-minded-looking John Nash. I read this book because I watched the mmovie and I wanted to know more details about his privileged mind that was able to find a way to deal with his mental illness without the medication that made him be someone different from who he wanted to be. This idea of having to sacrifice oneself's essence in order to avoid the horrible sympthoms of mental illness is a conundrum that many mental patients face. A lot of them decide one way or the other, and this is one notorious case about one who decided to deal with his demons himself, and had to pay a high price for that.This is the cover and editorial page of the book I read:

I really liked this book, and think that the movie is a really good first approach to read about this punctual experience of mental illness and a gifted mind.***I also have a blog! Link here: http://lunairereadings.blogspot.com"
217,0571212921,http://goodreads.com/user/show/49938-anastacia,5,"Though it was a bit slow in places (which is probably to be expected given John Nash’s career in mathematics), I really enjoyed reading A Beautiful Mind. I’m interested in history and mental illness and, lately, I have become absolutely fascinated by some of the history of mathematical geniuses, as they tend to be quite a rather unique bunch. I saw the movie version of the book when it was released several years ago, and while I don’t remember much about it other than I liked it, I’m pretty sure the movie was extremely sugarcoated. This was a raw, real account that is somehow simultaneously joyous and tragic. One of the things I am coming to appreciate most in a biography is when the author resists painting a one-dimensional, rosy picture of the subject. Even the best people are imperfect and I resent when all the subject’s flaws are just glossed over as though they never existed. The author did a fabulous job here in painting the entire picture of the great man; a man that is not perfect and, in many ways, an extremely difficult person to deal with. Nash was an incredibly complex man and his genius was both a gift and a curse. He didn’t get along well with people, he was arrogant at times, lacking in social skills and struggled with his sexuality. Rather than coming off as unlikable, though, I was rooting for him and I finished the book with a deep appreciation for the man and his legacy, which, I should add, I don’t completely understand as I am not a part of the mathematics world. And that was another aspect of the book I appreciated – I don’t think it is necessary to be a part of the mathematics world – or even have a deep appreciation for it – to enjoy the book. I’m more interested in the way the brain works and in psychological illnesses than I am math, but on the other hand, I am close to several deeply mathematical-minded people and that may make reading about it more interesting to me. The book was, as I mentioned, very slow in some places and I would have appreciated reading more about his illness than all the great detail about his mathematical achievements, but I suppose that I can’t complain about it because I knew what I was getting into. I just feel that it could have been more interesting if more attention were paid to other details. I ended up skimming some of the last chapters on the history and procedures of the Nobel. I just didn’t find any of that very interesting, and, again, the time and detail could have been better spent on other aspects, in my opinion.I’m on the fence about giving the book 3 or 4 stars. 3 seems unnecessarily harsh, but because it was slow in the beginning and a bit slow in a few chapters toward the end, I can’t really give it a 4. This is another instance where I wish GoodReads would implement half-stars in the rating system. I’d recommend this book to those interested in history, mathematics, biographies of geniuses, and those deeply interested in not only mental illness but also how the brain works in many different ways. I do know that some may find it boring. Even something with the slightest hint of math can be a turn-off for some folks. So, while I would recommend, I’d also add the caveat that one understands that it is not merely about his schizophrenia but his life as a mathematical genius in general."
218,0571212921,http://goodreads.com/user/show/33019-leonora,4,"Having read the book, I don't think I can see the movie. From what I've heard the film is quite good and tells the story of a genius gone mad. I gather that's where the similarity ends.John Nash is (for most of the book) an egotist who enjoys playing dangerous pranks on others, brags that he is one of three smartest men at Princeton, treats his lovers (male and female) as though they are only there for his amusement/pleasure. He is smart, cruel, and completely socially inept. Until his illness, it almost seems like he has Asperger Syndrome (a mild form of autism).However, as Nasar beautifully describes, this is all in line with his personality, which would eventually become schizoid. And, despite his faults I did root for him as he attempts to solve problems no one, even other top mathematicians, have the guts (or audacity) to attempt.Nasar, for the most part, is my favorite kind of biographer. She knows her subject well and doesn't treat him with kid gloves. She accurately interprets his personality in terms of his past and makes him human, understandable, despite his shortcomings. In this way, she reminded me of Jack El-Hai who wrote the brilliant biography, ""The Lobotomist"".Sidenote: his gay relationships were known at Princeton & MIT. I had no idea the math community in the 50s wasn't horribly homophobic! This was one of the most interesting things in the book."
219,0571212921,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2154122-a,1,"Well, I will not read this book again. Nor do I recommend it to anyone.I admit it was interesting to learn more about John Nash, particularly just how good he was, and what his colleagues had to say about his brilliant, beautiful mind. It was eye opening to read about the time of his life when he actively began struggling with his illness, and his subsequent recovery. It was gratifying to read about his Nobel Prize experience.All that said, it was not at all ""good"" enough to entice me to spend my time reading again. First of all, it's a book about a mathematician. A brilliant mathematician whose works I don't really understand even when they are put in ""plain"" English, as she occasionally did. And since he had essentially no life outside of his mathematics, until you get to the part where he is ill, and can no longer do math, it talks a lot about things I don't understand.Also, while there was not a language problem per se, the instances where there was a foul word used it was one of the foulest, and quite off-putting.And last but probably most of all I will not read it again because some of the anecdotes she chose to include about his life just plain made me uncomfortable. I felt a little bit like I had invaded his private life, because even though she never really gave details or was graphic, it just felt too inimately personal."
220,0571212921,http://goodreads.com/user/show/263190-jill,4,"Though I am severely dull when it comes to mathematics (I can’t do any math that moves), I found this biography fascinating and very moving. I enjoyed it all the way through and thought very interesting the story behind Nash’s Nobel Prize. I thought the book was really well written and not off-putting to people like me, who have a hard time wrapping their head around anything mathematically complicated. It’s rather a sad story, but much, much better than the film. I also learned a ton about game theory, what it’s about, and its usage in business, government, and personal strategy. I also learned that mathematics is considered a young man’s field. It seems perfectly reasonable to me, that because of the intense mental rigor, you’d wear out as you age. I love that Nash went back to work after he recovered. I was also very impressed by the strength of his wife, Alicia. His son’s mental illness is really tragic, but I love that Nash takes care of him. A really great, worthwhile, and enjoyable read."

228,0571212921,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3816725-larry-bassett,3,"It is hard to know how to say that John Nash is a fairly unique individual. You have to start with the fact that he was a brilliant mathematician. To be a mathematician with a brain that works in fairly amazing ways is hard enough to explain in words I suspect. When I was in graduate school I lived in a house with two other women, one of whom was a graduate student in mathematics. I wish I could find Janet Woodruff today to talk with her about John Nash.John Nash was also someone who suffered from schizophrenia and apparently came back from that after 25 years of suffering and treatment and hospitalization. The book says that mathematics is a specialty of young people and that people in that field rise to the heights of their profession at a young age. The book follows the life of John Nash through a long period of severe disability that also displayed how mathematical Rockstars experience life in academia. It talks about how people who are extremely bright also often have peculiar social disabilities. We follow the life of John Nash through many ups and downs. He is a unique individual from many different points of view. Once again the fact that I experience this as an audible book was an asset for me in getting through a story that I might not have managed to overcome if I had to turn paper pages."
229,0571212921,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1769011-arminzerella,3,"John Nash was a prominent mathematician in the prime of his career – best known for his work on game theory (and its applications in economics) – when he was diagnosed with schizophrenia. Already somewhat eccentric and socially awkward, his illness pushed him over into paranoid and delusional. He was unable to function in the real world and had to be institutionalized. He received treatments, some of which were more successful than others, and like other schizophrenics he relapsed many times. It seemed for many years that John Nash would never recover the thing he valued most – his mind. And then, seemingly out of nowhere, he got better. He became accustomed to the extra noise in his head and found that he was able to distinguish between the thoughts/ideas that were “normal” and the ones that were “crazy.” He began working again as a mathematician and making contributions to his field. Sylvia Nasar’s book is much more detailed than the movie that was based on it, but the way that Nash’s illness is revealed in the movie is much more dramatic (because you’re seeing things from inside of Nash’s head and he doesn’t realize he’s delusional). Although he is described as tall and attractive, there was much about John Nash that was off-putting to many. He could be arrogant and cruel and during his young life he often found himself on the outside – the social outcast of the social outcasts. His brilliance, however, was unquestionable. Nasar spares us most of the mathematical details (which the layperson wouldn’t grasp – even Nash’s colleagues were often gobsmacked at his unique approaches to problems), but brings the man to life. I don’t really follow the mathematics (computations! proofs! reasoning!) or understand the importance of the work that he’s done/doing, but I found his breakthrough out of schizophrenia fascinating. Nash has a son who is also afflicted with this illness."
230,0571212921,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2393446-anne-hawn-smith,5,"The story of the brilliant John Nash is an incredibly complicated one. Did his madness contribute to his difficult, arrogant personality or was he just one of those people who has a severe social disability? I came up with more questions than answers after reading this book. Did he have Asbergers syndrome? Was this why he was so inept at social relations, or was he so contemptuous of everyone around him because he recognized early that he was intellectually so far superior to everyone he knew? Did his brilliance allow him to triumph over schizophrenia of was it just one of those miracles that happen for no reason? I think what I learned from this book was the fragility of the human mind and the weakness of our human vessels. How could someone this brilliant be beset by so many problems? Why is it that genius of any type, intellectual, artistic or diplomatic seems to be so closely related to deficits in other areas of development? Do all great gifts come with a cost? Is the idiot/savant just an extreme version of this paradox? Why couldn't a mind so brilliant find some way to protect himself from madness? "
231,0571212921,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10918354-nurul-badriah,5,"I rarely read autobiography book because it's quite boring for me. But this book is such an amazing and touching book. This is my all time favorite book that I will read over and over again and will recommend to all the people around the world to read it. In my opinion all the smart people have some mental illness problems, not all of them but plenty of them do have psychological problems. This book shows us about how people undergoes psychological problems like schizophrenia in this story and to overcome them by the help of family, friends and society. This book talk about John Nash and about his theory and illness, the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences. This book just took me by storm by the uniqueness, ironically enough because it was based on a real life situation. This book touched me on many levels. The psychology was intriguing, the mathematical philosophies was actually amazing and the humanistic side of love. A Beautiful Mind was by far the most original,realistic, intelligent and heart touching book that I have ever read. John Nash was truly worthy of the Noble Prize."
232,0571212921,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1354567-melissa,4,"This was a tough read. Halfway through I disliked John Nash so intensely that I wasn't sure I could finish the book. He was arrogant, rude, selfish, sexist, and even frightening. The book also highlighted how culturally we are willing to accept not only difficult but harmful behavior from people who are highly gifted, which I hate. However, it's also nearly impossible to disentangle Nash from his illness, and I couldn't help wondering how his mental condition figured into his behavior even before he became obviously ill. By the end of the book, I had much more sympathy for what he endured as a product of his time (the 50s and 60s) as well as what he endured from his illness (insulin shock therapy sounds horrific). The moment toward the end when he asks if it's okay for him to enter a cafeteria at Princeton because he wasn't faculty actually drew tears because it was such a contrast from his earlier arrogance. Nash was a fascinating, complicated, messy, unlikeable person who, in the words of one of his colleagues, was still ""worth saving."" This book is an unflinching look at all of the different facets of that reality."
233,0571212921,http://goodreads.com/user/show/46089881-elsa-k,4,"I had recently re watched ""A Beautiful Mind"" and I was inspired to read the book. John Nash was a fascinating figure. But I will say the movie definitely Hollywoodized him. In the book he is very disturbing, especially in his younger years. He did and said some terrible things. He had a son by his mistress and pretty much abandoned him. He was arrested for exposing himself, tried to come on to other men etc. Sometimes the book was hard to get through as I didn't want to spend so much time with such a creeper! But I still found it interesting, especially how he managed to control his mental health issues over the years. His love story was strange to me- what did Alyssa see in him? I didn't understand all the math background, so I would skim some of that. It was sad to hear how he struggled and was treated in his mental illness. Also sad to hear his second son struggles with schizophrenia too. I would still recommend it as in interesting book, especially to someone with a math background."
234,0571212921,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5153361-annie,4,"I loved the movie so much I was a bit tentative to read the book(in case the story was idealized and distorted exceedingly). However, the book was far more indepth, interesting, and potent that I could have imagined. The story was much more real, wrought with tragedy, beauty, and poignancy. I think if the movie would have adhered more to the truth it would have been far more interesting but it was still well done. Not only did the book provide indepth information in the personal life and accomplishments of Nash, but it also branched into the history of mathematics(related to Nash), Princeton, the Cold War mathematicians, sanitariums and pyschiatric methods during the time, and the nomination and debate related to Nobel prize nominees. At times however I found the mathematical information a bit confusing but I'm only in 11th grade so my incomprehension can not be completely blamed on the book itself. All together it was a fascinating, detailed work."

Since the story begins right at the birth, we come to understand the kind of person that he is. I appreciate the fact that the book paints the good, the bad and the ugly all with the same brush. This helps us to come to know exactly what kind of a person John Nash was.A beautiful mind is more on the fact that if a person really puts his mind to it, he can come out of a disease that was presumably incurable than the mathematical as well as the economic contributions. The book deals more with the life events than the mathematical equations. I was hoping to read something about how he came upon the Game Theory as well as other discoveries that he made in the field, but I suppose the reason it was omitted was that the field in which Nash worked was so abstract that it would have put off many readers."

Nash certainly presents a difficult character; at times it is hard to muster sympathy for him, but ultimately I was heartbroken by his schizophrenia and ""lost years."" The fact that he has enjoyed a remission of this disease, and a return to a somewhat normal life, is a testament to the will and love of those around him who rallied support and resources to care for him during his long periods of bizarre behavior. Author Nasar describes the mathematics without getting mired in the details, so the reader has a sense of the import of Nash's achievements without a learned appreciation of them. I enjoyed this book, but will want to read something more light-hearted next!"

240,0571212921,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1400289-chana,4,"Once I started reading this book I realized that the movie, which I had enjoyed, was entertainment, concerning itself more with the strange delusions of John Nash's mental illness than with the life of the real man. More than half of this book is about John Nash before he became ill at age 30. He was this totally arrogant young math genius, eccentric and homosexually inclined. He was pretty hard to like because he was obnoxious and unkind and very self-centered. (I was reminded of how my mother always used to say that we should be glad that we weren't geniuses because they had a very hard time making friends because they were so different from other people. I can't say her statement carried much weight because I had trouble making friends and didn't have the consolation of being a genius. But that was back in the mid-60's and I wondered as I read if John Nash's tragedy had not entered the national consciousness rendering ""genius"" a less than desirable condition). I was particularly appalled by his disregard for his first child and the child's mother. His level of maturity was shocking to me, like maybe that of an 8 to 10 year old boy when he was in his 20's. He was unable to be much of a father to 2nd son either as the child was born at the time that he was becoming ill. So John Nash, still involved in homosexual relationships, fathers a child out of wedlock, deserts mother and child, marries a different woman and fathers another child, and has his ego trampled severly underfoot when he is not acknowledged for his brilliant work by not winning prestigious awards. He then undertakes to solve the Riemann Hypothesis (don't ask me to explain what that is) and his mind just starts making all these weird and faulty connections with numerology, politics and religion. His math becomes gibberish and his actions inexplicable. The next 30 years are essentially lost to him as he and his family suffer through hospitalizations, treatments and all the sorrows this brings.Strangely, John Nash starts to recover on his own and becomes more and more rational. He wins a Nobel in Economics, gives lectures, and remarries Alicia who had divorced him many years earlier but continued to be his main support and friend all the intervening years. It really is miraculous. Not only that but he seemed to mature quite a bit and become a much nicer person than he had been. The sad thing is that his younger son is also schizophrenic and has been in and out of hospitals for years. Alicia and John care for him at home and my heart goes out to them in this. Small point, but I really didn't like the cover of the book, which shows the actor who plays John Nash rather than John Nash himself."

 ""People have a mental picture that this is a difficult problem. Maybe that's the stumbling block. Maybe, if people didn't realize that the problem was 'hard,' they could solve it.""
I am very impressed with how they adapted this into a movie. This book is more factual than the emotionally driven theme of the movie and I liked that. I liked how they differed on that aspect. I loved both of them in their own formats of publications.The maths and physics theories went over my head, but for once I didn't mind reading about them because I was invested in getting to know John Nash better. One of the things that really interested me was the mention of the Italian mathematician ""Ennio De Giorgi"", who before his death was attempting to prove the existence of God by using Math; I want to read that paper to see what he came up with even if its incomplete. At first, I wasn't sure if I found Nash not paying for child support and other unlikeable things that he did, a personality flaw making him a douche or did his schizophrenia justify that behavior? I found it surprising how sympathetic I was towards the Russell Crowe version of Nash as my feelings towards him were a bit negative at this point, but later in the book I found my sympathy kicking back in and felt awed by Alica and Nash's relationship and struggles. It was infact as sad as the movie, even if the writing style of the book was more serious which made me feel like I was reading a research paper at times and that isn't my preferred reading genre but all's well, it pulled through and kept me engaged regardless. I am glad the book ended in a hopeful tone, with Nash getting better and helping around with Johnny and reconciling with Alicia and his first born John David.This will be one of my most memorable reads. I am glad my sister bought this book, 'cause otherwise I wouldn't have picked this one up and would have missed out on a great read."

Well, make it an exception.It is not because the book is not well-written, though powerful and mesmerising it is, nor is It not exceptionally detailed and real. The fact is it's exactly because it was so real that I became evasive of this genius and form an indelible impression on his darksides.When a genius conceived a great achievement for mankind, people Marvel at his grandure and are prone to be deliberately neglectful and blindful of his defects,however fatal and unscrupulous they are. They justified his evils in the name of paying attributes to a great mind. Well, if they think this way, IMHO,screw these people and those geniuses!Nash was a true genius and he was Fortunate enough to have Alicia with him.I always guard against those self-proclaimed masters or experts, vigillant of their hypocrisy.For geniune talents, I admire their contributions but still treat them as people not saints. When I perceived their darkness, I wouln't be surprised.Dedicate this short review to Alicia!"

245,0571212921,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7861828-matt,3,"This book took me through the full range of emotions. I felt awe, disgust, pity, wonder, joy, confusion, resolution, etc... Most of all it made me introspective as to how I treat others, and how the entire field of Psychiatry treats patients.First of all, I learned that the movie took MANY liberties with the facts. It is about 20% truth, and the rest is style and effects. For many years I have enjoyed the movie and recommended it to friends. So I felt disillusioned when I found out how false it was. But then I thought about the truth, John Nash’s life, and the goals of the film.John Nash did not have visual hallucinations. He didn’t see people who weren’t there, and he never imagined a roommate, or a little girl. But how else do you portray in a movie the reality of his delusions? How do you show a movie audience the absolute belief he had, and how much it had to hurt to find out that much of your life…is imaginary. He often thought he was working for the FBI, or for the world government. He thought he was Royalty, an Arab refugee, Job, Castro, a mouse. He thought he was traveling to Cairo, Kabul, Thebes, Mongolia, or even purgatory, inferno, or some sort of polluted heaven. He lived in constant fear of annihilation, Armageddon, the Apocalypse, the Final day of Judgment, and of certain ominous dates such as May 29th.So I give the film license for showing Schizophrenia in a false light because it portrays the feeling, and the pain and despair that go along with it very well.Here are other interesting things I never knew from the film.John Nash was a draft dodger. It didn’t just scare him…it mortified him. He worked diligently for years to avoid the draft, wrote letters, used University faculty and presidents, and employed every means imaginable to avoid the draft.Alicia (Nash’s wife) was not his first girlfriend, nor the mother of his first child. Eleanor was. They had a son named John David. His last name was not Nash however, because Eleanor and Nash were never married. Though they remained together for some time, and he sometimes spoke of marriage, it never happened.Alicia at first perturbed me. She thought Nash was cute, and pursued him with great vigor (even getting a job at his favorite hang-out, just to see him more often.) Eventually they started sleeping together, until Eleanor arrived at his place one night, and found her there. After much screaming and crying by Eleanor, Nash said “My perfect little world is ruined.”Alicia had quite a different reaction. Eleanor called Alicia to complain, and met with her to discuss the fact that She and Nash were getting married and already had a son. Alicia was pleased. She took the meeting as a sign that “She was beginning to matter.” She continued their courtship until eventually Alicia and Nash were married and had their own son, John Charles.My initial thought was –“Alicia is so ruthless and cold that she deserves what’s coming.” I later regretted that thought. She stuck with Nash through the worst of times. She followed him all over Europe trying to find a place where he was content and sane, but it never happened. He bankrupted her, and left her many, many times.Nash had homosexual flings. While working for a think tank called RAND, he was arrested in a restroom police sting for “indecent exposure.” This was one of many recorded occurrences when he had intimate relationships with men.Eventually Alicia divorced him, and she believed it was for his good. He no longer had the stress of a family or obligations…he could go where he wanted when he wanted with no thought for a family.Years later he finally settled down at Princeton again, and became known as “The Phantom.” He walked the hallways and wrote cryptic messages or math problems on the chalk boards.He became a legend at Princeton among the students. Anybody who was too much of a grind or who lacked social graces was warned that he or she was “going to end up like the phantom”. Yet if a new student complained that having him around made him feel uncomfortable, he was immediately warned: “He was a better mathematician then you’ll ever be.”John Nash was a brilliant mathematician. He solved problems in ways no one else had ever imagined. He proved that “every Riemannian manifold can be isometrically embedded into some Euclidean space.”(FYI – this book has a ton of Math that I did not understand but accepted that it was really hard and really complex)During this period at Princeton, after many hospitalizations, insulin coma therapy, and many attempts to renounce his U.S. citizenship and become a “Citizen of the World”; Alicia eventually let him move back in with her, and get to know his second son. And years later, after he won the Nobel Prize, they did remarry. Even when they were divorced, she felt responsible for him. She suffered huge amounts, and it didn’t end with him. Their son, John Charles, also has Paranoid Schizophrenia. I may not have liked how she entered his life, but she certainly proved her worth, and was indespensible.I’ll end this book report with an Interesting Fact I learned from the book.The Nobel prize in Economics (which Nash won in 1994) is not technically a Nobel Prize. The prize was not one of the awards set out in the will of Alfred Nobel. He listed only physics, chemistry, physiology or medicine, and literature, which have been awarded since 1901. In 1968 an award was added for economics by the Central Bank of Sweden. And they provide the funding separately for the “Sveriges Riksbank Prize in Economic Sciences in Memory of Alfred Nobel”P.S. This book changed the way I see Schizophrenia, and how I interact with Schizophrenic patients and their families. It has been a very worthwhile book for me. I hope others choose to enjoy it as well."

This is my favorite photo of this book. This shows a very young and and absent-minded-looking John Nash. I read this book because I watched the mmovie and I wanted to know more details about his privileged mind that was able to find a way to deal with his mental illness without the medication that made him be someone different from who he wanted to be. This idea of having to sacrifice oneself's essence in order to avoid the horrible sympthoms of mental illness is a conundrum that many mental patients face. A lot of them decide one way or the other, and this is one notorious case about one who decided to deal with his demons himself, and had to pay a high price for that.This is the cover and editorial page of the book I read:

I really liked this book, and think that the movie is a really good first approach to read about this punctual experience of mental illness and a gifted mind.***I also have a blog! Link here: http://lunairereadings.blogspot.com"
247,0571212921,http://goodreads.com/user/show/49938-anastacia,5,"Though it was a bit slow in places (which is probably to be expected given John Nash’s career in mathematics), I really enjoyed reading A Beautiful Mind. I’m interested in history and mental illness and, lately, I have become absolutely fascinated by some of the history of mathematical geniuses, as they tend to be quite a rather unique bunch. I saw the movie version of the book when it was released several years ago, and while I don’t remember much about it other than I liked it, I’m pretty sure the movie was extremely sugarcoated. This was a raw, real account that is somehow simultaneously joyous and tragic. One of the things I am coming to appreciate most in a biography is when the author resists painting a one-dimensional, rosy picture of the subject. Even the best people are imperfect and I resent when all the subject’s flaws are just glossed over as though they never existed. The author did a fabulous job here in painting the entire picture of the great man; a man that is not perfect and, in many ways, an extremely difficult person to deal with. Nash was an incredibly complex man and his genius was both a gift and a curse. He didn’t get along well with people, he was arrogant at times, lacking in social skills and struggled with his sexuality. Rather than coming off as unlikable, though, I was rooting for him and I finished the book with a deep appreciation for the man and his legacy, which, I should add, I don’t completely understand as I am not a part of the mathematics world. And that was another aspect of the book I appreciated – I don’t think it is necessary to be a part of the mathematics world – or even have a deep appreciation for it – to enjoy the book. I’m more interested in the way the brain works and in psychological illnesses than I am math, but on the other hand, I am close to several deeply mathematical-minded people and that may make reading about it more interesting to me. The book was, as I mentioned, very slow in some places and I would have appreciated reading more about his illness than all the great detail about his mathematical achievements, but I suppose that I can’t complain about it because I knew what I was getting into. I just feel that it could have been more interesting if more attention were paid to other details. I ended up skimming some of the last chapters on the history and procedures of the Nobel. I just didn’t find any of that very interesting, and, again, the time and detail could have been better spent on other aspects, in my opinion.I’m on the fence about giving the book 3 or 4 stars. 3 seems unnecessarily harsh, but because it was slow in the beginning and a bit slow in a few chapters toward the end, I can’t really give it a 4. This is another instance where I wish GoodReads would implement half-stars in the rating system. I’d recommend this book to those interested in history, mathematics, biographies of geniuses, and those deeply interested in not only mental illness but also how the brain works in many different ways. I do know that some may find it boring. Even something with the slightest hint of math can be a turn-off for some folks. So, while I would recommend, I’d also add the caveat that one understands that it is not merely about his schizophrenia but his life as a mathematical genius in general."
248,0571212921,http://goodreads.com/user/show/33019-leonora,4,"Having read the book, I don't think I can see the movie. From what I've heard the film is quite good and tells the story of a genius gone mad. I gather that's where the similarity ends.John Nash is (for most of the book) an egotist who enjoys playing dangerous pranks on others, brags that he is one of three smartest men at Princeton, treats his lovers (male and female) as though they are only there for his amusement/pleasure. He is smart, cruel, and completely socially inept. Until his illness, it almost seems like he has Asperger Syndrome (a mild form of autism).However, as Nasar beautifully describes, this is all in line with his personality, which would eventually become schizoid. And, despite his faults I did root for him as he attempts to solve problems no one, even other top mathematicians, have the guts (or audacity) to attempt.Nasar, for the most part, is my favorite kind of biographer. She knows her subject well and doesn't treat him with kid gloves. She accurately interprets his personality in terms of his past and makes him human, understandable, despite his shortcomings. In this way, she reminded me of Jack El-Hai who wrote the brilliant biography, ""The Lobotomist"".Sidenote: his gay relationships were known at Princeton & MIT. I had no idea the math community in the 50s wasn't horribly homophobic! This was one of the most interesting things in the book."
249,0571212921,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2154122-a,1,"Well, I will not read this book again. Nor do I recommend it to anyone.I admit it was interesting to learn more about John Nash, particularly just how good he was, and what his colleagues had to say about his brilliant, beautiful mind. It was eye opening to read about the time of his life when he actively began struggling with his illness, and his subsequent recovery. It was gratifying to read about his Nobel Prize experience.All that said, it was not at all ""good"" enough to entice me to spend my time reading again. First of all, it's a book about a mathematician. A brilliant mathematician whose works I don't really understand even when they are put in ""plain"" English, as she occasionally did. And since he had essentially no life outside of his mathematics, until you get to the part where he is ill, and can no longer do math, it talks a lot about things I don't understand.Also, while there was not a language problem per se, the instances where there was a foul word used it was one of the foulest, and quite off-putting.And last but probably most of all I will not read it again because some of the anecdotes she chose to include about his life just plain made me uncomfortable. I felt a little bit like I had invaded his private life, because even though she never really gave details or was graphic, it just felt too inimately personal."
250,0571212921,http://goodreads.com/user/show/263190-jill,4,"Though I am severely dull when it comes to mathematics (I can’t do any math that moves), I found this biography fascinating and very moving. I enjoyed it all the way through and thought very interesting the story behind Nash’s Nobel Prize. I thought the book was really well written and not off-putting to people like me, who have a hard time wrapping their head around anything mathematically complicated. It’s rather a sad story, but much, much better than the film. I also learned a ton about game theory, what it’s about, and its usage in business, government, and personal strategy. I also learned that mathematics is considered a young man’s field. It seems perfectly reasonable to me, that because of the intense mental rigor, you’d wear out as you age. I love that Nash went back to work after he recovered. I was also very impressed by the strength of his wife, Alicia. His son’s mental illness is really tragic, but I love that Nash takes care of him. A really great, worthwhile, and enjoyable read."
251,0571212921,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5975123-george-p,4,"An excellent bio of the mathematican who co-won a Nobel in economics for his pioneer work in ""game theory"", though he is also well-known among mathematicians for other remarkable work. Though I know nothing about ""partial diferential equations"" etc, I could follow 99% of the book and was fascinated by learning about this genius who suffered from schizophrenia for years and recovered, e.g. that even while suffering from schizophrenia he learned to speak French."

258,0571212921,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3816725-larry-bassett,3,"It is hard to know how to say that John Nash is a fairly unique individual. You have to start with the fact that he was a brilliant mathematician. To be a mathematician with a brain that works in fairly amazing ways is hard enough to explain in words I suspect. When I was in graduate school I lived in a house with two other women, one of whom was a graduate student in mathematics. I wish I could find Janet Woodruff today to talk with her about John Nash.John Nash was also someone who suffered from schizophrenia and apparently came back from that after 25 years of suffering and treatment and hospitalization. The book says that mathematics is a specialty of young people and that people in that field rise to the heights of their profession at a young age. The book follows the life of John Nash through a long period of severe disability that also displayed how mathematical Rockstars experience life in academia. It talks about how people who are extremely bright also often have peculiar social disabilities. We follow the life of John Nash through many ups and downs. He is a unique individual from many different points of view. Once again the fact that I experience this as an audible book was an asset for me in getting through a story that I might not have managed to overcome if I had to turn paper pages."
259,0571212921,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1769011-arminzerella,3,"John Nash was a prominent mathematician in the prime of his career – best known for his work on game theory (and its applications in economics) – when he was diagnosed with schizophrenia. Already somewhat eccentric and socially awkward, his illness pushed him over into paranoid and delusional. He was unable to function in the real world and had to be institutionalized. He received treatments, some of which were more successful than others, and like other schizophrenics he relapsed many times. It seemed for many years that John Nash would never recover the thing he valued most – his mind. And then, seemingly out of nowhere, he got better. He became accustomed to the extra noise in his head and found that he was able to distinguish between the thoughts/ideas that were “normal” and the ones that were “crazy.” He began working again as a mathematician and making contributions to his field. Sylvia Nasar’s book is much more detailed than the movie that was based on it, but the way that Nash’s illness is revealed in the movie is much more dramatic (because you’re seeing things from inside of Nash’s head and he doesn’t realize he’s delusional). Although he is described as tall and attractive, there was much about John Nash that was off-putting to many. He could be arrogant and cruel and during his young life he often found himself on the outside – the social outcast of the social outcasts. His brilliance, however, was unquestionable. Nasar spares us most of the mathematical details (which the layperson wouldn’t grasp – even Nash’s colleagues were often gobsmacked at his unique approaches to problems), but brings the man to life. I don’t really follow the mathematics (computations! proofs! reasoning!) or understand the importance of the work that he’s done/doing, but I found his breakthrough out of schizophrenia fascinating. Nash has a son who is also afflicted with this illness."
260,0571212921,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2393446-anne-hawn-smith,5,"The story of the brilliant John Nash is an incredibly complicated one. Did his madness contribute to his difficult, arrogant personality or was he just one of those people who has a severe social disability? I came up with more questions than answers after reading this book. Did he have Asbergers syndrome? Was this why he was so inept at social relations, or was he so contemptuous of everyone around him because he recognized early that he was intellectually so far superior to everyone he knew? Did his brilliance allow him to triumph over schizophrenia of was it just one of those miracles that happen for no reason? I think what I learned from this book was the fragility of the human mind and the weakness of our human vessels. How could someone this brilliant be beset by so many problems? Why is it that genius of any type, intellectual, artistic or diplomatic seems to be so closely related to deficits in other areas of development? Do all great gifts come with a cost? Is the idiot/savant just an extreme version of this paradox? Why couldn't a mind so brilliant find some way to protect himself from madness? "
261,0571212921,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10918354-nurul-badriah,5,"I rarely read autobiography book because it's quite boring for me. But this book is such an amazing and touching book. This is my all time favorite book that I will read over and over again and will recommend to all the people around the world to read it. In my opinion all the smart people have some mental illness problems, not all of them but plenty of them do have psychological problems. This book shows us about how people undergoes psychological problems like schizophrenia in this story and to overcome them by the help of family, friends and society. This book talk about John Nash and about his theory and illness, the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences. This book just took me by storm by the uniqueness, ironically enough because it was based on a real life situation. This book touched me on many levels. The psychology was intriguing, the mathematical philosophies was actually amazing and the humanistic side of love. A Beautiful Mind was by far the most original,realistic, intelligent and heart touching book that I have ever read. John Nash was truly worthy of the Noble Prize."
262,0571212921,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1354567-melissa,4,"This was a tough read. Halfway through I disliked John Nash so intensely that I wasn't sure I could finish the book. He was arrogant, rude, selfish, sexist, and even frightening. The book also highlighted how culturally we are willing to accept not only difficult but harmful behavior from people who are highly gifted, which I hate. However, it's also nearly impossible to disentangle Nash from his illness, and I couldn't help wondering how his mental condition figured into his behavior even before he became obviously ill. By the end of the book, I had much more sympathy for what he endured as a product of his time (the 50s and 60s) as well as what he endured from his illness (insulin shock therapy sounds horrific). The moment toward the end when he asks if it's okay for him to enter a cafeteria at Princeton because he wasn't faculty actually drew tears because it was such a contrast from his earlier arrogance. Nash was a fascinating, complicated, messy, unlikeable person who, in the words of one of his colleagues, was still ""worth saving."" This book is an unflinching look at all of the different facets of that reality."
263,0571212921,http://goodreads.com/user/show/46089881-elsa-k,4,"I had recently re watched ""A Beautiful Mind"" and I was inspired to read the book. John Nash was a fascinating figure. But I will say the movie definitely Hollywoodized him. In the book he is very disturbing, especially in his younger years. He did and said some terrible things. He had a son by his mistress and pretty much abandoned him. He was arrested for exposing himself, tried to come on to other men etc. Sometimes the book was hard to get through as I didn't want to spend so much time with such a creeper! But I still found it interesting, especially how he managed to control his mental health issues over the years. His love story was strange to me- what did Alyssa see in him? I didn't understand all the math background, so I would skim some of that. It was sad to hear how he struggled and was treated in his mental illness. Also sad to hear his second son struggles with schizophrenia too. I would still recommend it as in interesting book, especially to someone with a math background."
264,0571212921,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5153361-annie,4,"I loved the movie so much I was a bit tentative to read the book(in case the story was idealized and distorted exceedingly). However, the book was far more indepth, interesting, and potent that I could have imagined. The story was much more real, wrought with tragedy, beauty, and poignancy. I think if the movie would have adhered more to the truth it would have been far more interesting but it was still well done. Not only did the book provide indepth information in the personal life and accomplishments of Nash, but it also branched into the history of mathematics(related to Nash), Princeton, the Cold War mathematicians, sanitariums and pyschiatric methods during the time, and the nomination and debate related to Nobel prize nominees. At times however I found the mathematical information a bit confusing but I'm only in 11th grade so my incomprehension can not be completely blamed on the book itself. All together it was a fascinating, detailed work."
265,0571212921,http://goodreads.com/user/show/14808426-dhwani-swadia,5,"Read the full review here: https://thereandtheir.com/2017/01/25/...The book takes you on a journey of the life of the extraordinary man, John Nash. Since the story begins right at the birth, we come to understand the kind of person that he is. I appreciate the fact that the book paints the good, the bad and the ugly all with the same brush. This helps us to come to know exactly what kind of a person John Nash was.A beautiful mind is more on the fact that if a person really puts his mind to it, he can come out of a disease that was presumably incurable than the mathematical as well as the economic contributions. The book deals more with the life events than the mathematical equations. I was hoping to read something about how he came upon the Game Theory as well as other discoveries that he made in the field, but I suppose the reason it was omitted was that the field in which Nash worked was so abstract that it would have put off many readers."

Nash certainly presents a difficult character; at times it is hard to muster sympathy for him, but ultimately I was heartbroken by his schizophrenia and ""lost years."" The fact that he has enjoyed a remission of this disease, and a return to a somewhat normal life, is a testament to the will and love of those around him who rallied support and resources to care for him during his long periods of bizarre behavior. Author Nasar describes the mathematics without getting mired in the details, so the reader has a sense of the import of Nash's achievements without a learned appreciation of them. I enjoyed this book, but will want to read something more light-hearted next!"

He developed a game and later focuses on game theory. He got a position in MIT. Here it’s mostly personal stories: he impregnated a woman he dated but refused to marry her; he eventually married a student from an upper class family; he started to show signs of schizophrenia, including turning down a professorship at Chicago because he is becoming emperor of Antarctica. Many years later, he is getting better. And his earlier work is becoming central for economists.

I enjoyed the movie more.To be fair, it is easier to paint a tale with more likable characters, intrigue and fairy-tale turnaround, when not restrained by real life. I had no idea how much real-life was altered for the movie. What bothered me most about the book was that at several points, I felt I was reading less of a biography about Nash, and more a story about the lives of people around him and the academic world that he wandered through... with occasional notes about Nash behaving brashly."
270,0571212921,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1400289-chana,4,"Once I started reading this book I realized that the movie, which I had enjoyed, was entertainment, concerning itself more with the strange delusions of John Nash's mental illness than with the life of the real man. More than half of this book is about John Nash before he became ill at age 30. He was this totally arrogant young math genius, eccentric and homosexually inclined. He was pretty hard to like because he was obnoxious and unkind and very self-centered. (I was reminded of how my mother always used to say that we should be glad that we weren't geniuses because they had a very hard time making friends because they were so different from other people. I can't say her statement carried much weight because I had trouble making friends and didn't have the consolation of being a genius. But that was back in the mid-60's and I wondered as I read if John Nash's tragedy had not entered the national consciousness rendering ""genius"" a less than desirable condition). I was particularly appalled by his disregard for his first child and the child's mother. His level of maturity was shocking to me, like maybe that of an 8 to 10 year old boy when he was in his 20's. He was unable to be much of a father to 2nd son either as the child was born at the time that he was becoming ill. So John Nash, still involved in homosexual relationships, fathers a child out of wedlock, deserts mother and child, marries a different woman and fathers another child, and has his ego trampled severly underfoot when he is not acknowledged for his brilliant work by not winning prestigious awards. He then undertakes to solve the Riemann Hypothesis (don't ask me to explain what that is) and his mind just starts making all these weird and faulty connections with numerology, politics and religion. His math becomes gibberish and his actions inexplicable. The next 30 years are essentially lost to him as he and his family suffer through hospitalizations, treatments and all the sorrows this brings.Strangely, John Nash starts to recover on his own and becomes more and more rational. He wins a Nobel in Economics, gives lectures, and remarries Alicia who had divorced him many years earlier but continued to be his main support and friend all the intervening years. It really is miraculous. Not only that but he seemed to mature quite a bit and become a much nicer person than he had been. The sad thing is that his younger son is also schizophrenic and has been in and out of hospitals for years. Alicia and John care for him at home and my heart goes out to them in this. Small point, but I really didn't like the cover of the book, which shows the actor who plays John Nash rather than John Nash himself."

 ""People have a mental picture that this is a difficult problem. Maybe that's the stumbling block. Maybe, if people didn't realize that the problem was 'hard,' they could solve it.""
I am very impressed with how they adapted this into a movie. This book is more factual than the emotionally driven theme of the movie and I liked that. I liked how they differed on that aspect. I loved both of them in their own formats of publications.The maths and physics theories went over my head, but for once I didn't mind reading about them because I was invested in getting to know John Nash better. One of the things that really interested me was the mention of the Italian mathematician ""Ennio De Giorgi"", who before his death was attempting to prove the existence of God by using Math; I want to read that paper to see what he came up with even if its incomplete. At first, I wasn't sure if I found Nash not paying for child support and other unlikeable things that he did, a personality flaw making him a douche or did his schizophrenia justify that behavior? I found it surprising how sympathetic I was towards the Russell Crowe version of Nash as my feelings towards him were a bit negative at this point, but later in the book I found my sympathy kicking back in and felt awed by Alica and Nash's relationship and struggles. It was infact as sad as the movie, even if the writing style of the book was more serious which made me feel like I was reading a research paper at times and that isn't my preferred reading genre but all's well, it pulled through and kept me engaged regardless. I am glad the book ended in a hopeful tone, with Nash getting better and helping around with Johnny and reconciling with Alicia and his first born John David.This will be one of my most memorable reads. I am glad my sister bought this book, 'cause otherwise I wouldn't have picked this one up and would have missed out on a great read."

Well, make it an exception.It is not because the book is not well-written, though powerful and mesmerising it is, nor is It not exceptionally detailed and real. The fact is it's exactly because it was so real that I became evasive of this genius and form an indelible impression on his darksides.When a genius conceived a great achievement for mankind, people Marvel at his grandure and are prone to be deliberately neglectful and blindful of his defects,however fatal and unscrupulous they are. They justified his evils in the name of paying attributes to a great mind. Well, if they think this way, IMHO,screw these people and those geniuses!Nash was a true genius and he was Fortunate enough to have Alicia with him.I always guard against those self-proclaimed masters or experts, vigillant of their hypocrisy.For geniune talents, I admire their contributions but still treat them as people not saints.

275,0571212921,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7861828-matt,3,"This book took me through the full range of emotions. I felt awe, disgust, pity, wonder, joy, confusion, resolution, etc... Most of all it made me introspective as to how I treat others, and how the entire field of Psychiatry treats patients.First of all, I learned that the movie took MANY liberties with the facts. It is about 20% truth, and the rest is style and effects. For many years I have enjoyed the movie and recommended it to friends. So I felt disillusioned when I found out how false it was. But then I thought about the truth, John Nash’s life, and the goals of the film.John Nash did not have visual hallucinations. He didn’t see people who weren’t there, and he never imagined a roommate, or a little girl. But how else do you portray in a movie the reality of his delusions? How do you show a movie audience the absolute belief he had, and how much it had to hurt to find out that much of your life…is imaginary. He often thought he was working for the FBI, or for the world government. He thought he was Royalty, an Arab refugee, Job, Castro, a mouse. He thought he was traveling to Cairo, Kabul, Thebes, Mongolia, or even purgatory, inferno, or some sort of polluted heaven. He lived in constant fear of annihilation, Armageddon, the Apocalypse, the Final day of Judgment, and of certain ominous dates such as May 29th.So I give the film license for showing Schizophrenia in a false light because it portrays the feeling, and the pain and despair that go along with it very well.Here are other interesting things I never knew from the film.John Nash was a draft dodger. It didn’t just scare him…it mortified him. He worked diligently for years to avoid the draft, wrote letters, used University faculty and presidents, and employed every means imaginable to avoid the draft.Alicia (Nash’s wife) was not his first girlfriend, nor the mother of his first child. Eleanor was. They had a son named John David. His last name was not Nash however, because Eleanor and Nash were never married. Though they remained together for some time, and he sometimes spoke of marriage, it never happened.Alicia at first perturbed me. She thought Nash was cute, and pursued him with great vigor (even getting a job at his favorite hang-out, just to see him more often.) Eventually they started sleeping together, until Eleanor arrived at his place one night, and found her there. After much screaming and crying by Eleanor, Nash said “My perfect little world is ruined.”Alicia had quite a different reaction. Eleanor called Alicia to complain, and met with her to discuss the fact that She and Nash were getting married and already had a son. Alicia was pleased. She took the meeting as a sign that “She was beginning to matter.” She continued their courtship until eventually Alicia and Nash were married and had their own son, John Charles.My initial thought was –“Alicia is so ruthless and cold that she deserves what’s coming.” I later regretted that thought. She stuck with Nash through the worst of times. She followed him all over Europe trying to find a place where he was content and sane, but it never happened. He bankrupted her, and left her many, many times.Nash had homosexual flings. While working for a think tank called RAND, he was arrested in a restroom police sting for “indecent exposure.” This was one of many recorded occurrences when he had intimate relationships with men.Eventually Alicia divorced him, and she believed it was for his good. He no longer had the stress of a family or obligations…he could go where he wanted when he wanted with no thought for a family.Years later he finally settled down at Princeton again, and became known as “The Phantom.” He walked the hallways and wrote cryptic messages or math problems on the chalk boards.He became a legend at Princeton among the students. Anybody who was too much of a grind or who lacked social graces was warned that he or she was “going to end up like the phantom”. Yet if a new student complained that having him around made him feel uncomfortable, he was immediately warned: “He was a better mathematician then you’ll ever be.”John Nash was a brilliant mathematician. He solved problems in ways no one else had ever imagined. He proved that “every Riemannian manifold can be isometrically embedded into some Euclidean space.”(FYI – this book has a ton of Math that I did not understand but accepted that it was really hard and really complex)During this period at Princeton, after many hospitalizations, insulin coma therapy, and many attempts to renounce his U.S. citizenship and become a “Citizen of the World”; Alicia eventually let him move back in with her, and get to know his second son. And years later, after he won the Nobel Prize, they did remarry. Even when they were divorced, she felt responsible for him. She suffered huge amounts, and it didn’t end with him. Their son, John Charles, also has Paranoid Schizophrenia. I may not have liked how she entered his life, but she certainly proved her worth, and was indespensible.I’ll end this book report with an Interesting Fact I learned from the book.The Nobel prize in Economics (which Nash won in 1994) is not technically a Nobel Prize. The prize was not one of the awards set out in the will of Alfred Nobel. He listed only physics, chemistry, physiology or medicine, and literature, which have been awarded since 1901. In 1968 an award was added for economics by the Central Bank of Sweden. And they provide the funding separately for the “Sveriges Riksbank Prize in Economic Sciences in Memory of Alfred Nobel”P.S. This book changed the way I see Schizophrenia, and how I interact with Schizophrenic patients and their families. It has been a very worthwhile book for me. I hope others choose to enjoy it as well."

This is my favorite photo of this book. This shows a very young and and absent-minded-looking John Nash. I read this book because I watched the mmovie and I wanted to know more details about his privileged mind that was able to find a way to deal with his mental illness without the medication that made him be someone different from who he wanted to be. This idea of having to sacrifice oneself's essence in order to avoid the horrible sympthoms of mental illness is a conundrum that many mental patients face. A lot of them decide one way or the other, and this is one notorious case about one who decided to deal with his demons himself, and had to pay a high price for that.This is the cover and editorial page of the book I read:

I really liked this book, and think that the movie is a really good first approach to read about this punctual experience of mental illness and a gifted mind.***I also have a blog! Link here: http://lunairereadings.blogspot.com"
277,0571212921,http://goodreads.com/user/show/49938-anastacia,5,"Though it was a bit slow in places (which is probably to be expected given John Nash’s career in mathematics), I really enjoyed reading A Beautiful Mind. I’m interested in history and mental illness and, lately, I have become absolutely fascinated by some of the history of mathematical geniuses, as they tend to be quite a rather unique bunch. I saw the movie version of the book when it was released several years ago, and while I don’t remember much about it other than I liked it, I’m pretty sure the movie was extremely sugarcoated. This was a raw, real account that is somehow simultaneously joyous and tragic. One of the things I am coming to appreciate most in a biography is when the author resists painting a one-dimensional, rosy picture of the subject. Even the best people are imperfect and I resent when all the subject’s flaws are just glossed over as though they never existed. The author did a fabulous job here in painting the entire picture of the great man; a man that is not perfect and, in many ways, an extremely difficult person to deal with. Nash was an incredibly complex man and his genius was both a gift and a curse. He didn’t get along well with people, he was arrogant at times, lacking in social skills and struggled with his sexuality. Rather than coming off as unlikable, though, I was rooting for him and I finished the book with a deep appreciation for the man and his legacy, which, I should add, I don’t completely understand as I am not a part of the mathematics world. And that was another aspect of the book I appreciated – I don’t think it is necessary to be a part of the mathematics world – or even have a deep appreciation for it – to enjoy the book. I’m more interested in the way the brain works and in psychological illnesses than I am math, but on the other hand, I am close to several deeply mathematical-minded people and that may make reading about it more interesting to me. The book was, as I mentioned, very slow in some places and I would have appreciated reading more about his illness than all the great detail about his mathematical achievements, but I suppose that I can’t complain about it because I knew what I was getting into. I just feel that it could have been more interesting if more attention were paid to other details. I ended up skimming some of the last chapters on the history and procedures of the Nobel. I just didn’t find any of that very interesting, and, again, the time and detail could have been better spent on other aspects, in my opinion.I’m on the fence about giving the book 3 or 4 stars. 3 seems unnecessarily harsh, but because it was slow in the beginning and a bit slow in a few chapters toward the end, I can’t really give it a 4. This is another instance where I wish GoodReads would implement half-stars in the rating system. I’d recommend this book to those interested in history, mathematics, biographies of geniuses, and those deeply interested in not only mental illness but also how the brain works in many different ways. I do know that some may find it boring. Even something with the slightest hint of math can be a turn-off for some folks. So, while I would recommend, I’d also add the caveat that one understands that it is not merely about his schizophrenia but his life as a mathematical genius in general."
278,0571212921,http://goodreads.com/user/show/33019-leonora,4,"Having read the book, I don't think I can see the movie. From what I've heard the film is quite good and tells the story of a genius gone mad. I gather that's where the similarity ends.John Nash is (for most of the book) an egotist who enjoys playing dangerous pranks on others, brags that he is one of three smartest men at Princeton, treats his lovers (male and female) as though they are only there for his amusement/pleasure. He is smart, cruel, and completely socially inept. Until his illness, it almost seems like he has Asperger Syndrome (a mild form of autism).However, as Nasar beautifully describes, this is all in line with his personality, which would eventually become schizoid. And, despite his faults I did root for him as he attempts to solve problems no one, even other top mathematicians, have the guts (or audacity) to attempt.Nasar, for the most part, is my favorite kind of biographer. She knows her subject well and doesn't treat him with kid gloves. She accurately interprets his personality in terms of his past and makes him human, understandable, despite his shortcomings. In this way, she reminded me of Jack El-Hai who wrote the brilliant biography, ""The Lobotomist"".Sidenote: his gay relationships were known at Princeton & MIT. I had no idea the math community in the 50s wasn't horribly homophobic! This was one of the most interesting things in the book."
279,0571212921,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2154122-a,1,"Well, I will not read this book again. Nor do I recommend it to anyone.I admit it was interesting to learn more about John Nash, particularly just how good he was, and what his colleagues had to say about his brilliant, beautiful mind. It was eye opening to read about the time of his life when he actively began struggling with his illness, and his subsequent recovery. It was gratifying to read about his Nobel Prize experience.All that said, it was not at all ""good"" enough to entice me to spend my time reading again. First of all, it's a book about a mathematician. A brilliant mathematician whose works I don't really understand even when they are put in ""plain"" English, as she occasionally did. And since he had essentially no life outside of his mathematics, until you get to the part where he is ill, and can no longer do math, it talks a lot about things I don't understand.Also, while there was not a language problem per se, the instances where there was a foul word used it was one of the foulest, and quite off-putting.And last but probably most of all I will not read it again because some of the anecdotes she chose to include about his life just plain made me uncomfortable. I felt a little bit like I had invaded his private life, because even though she never really gave details or was graphic, it just felt too inimately personal."
280,0571212921,http://goodreads.com/user/show/263190-jill,4,"Though I am severely dull when it comes to mathematics (I can’t do any math that moves), I found this biography fascinating and very moving. I enjoyed it all the way through and thought very interesting the story behind Nash’s Nobel Prize. I thought the book was really well written and not off-putting to people like me, who have a hard time wrapping their head around anything mathematically complicated. It’s rather a sad story, but much, much better than the film. I also learned a ton about game theory, what it’s about, and its usage in business, government, and personal strategy. I also learned that mathematics is considered a young man’s field. It seems perfectly reasonable to me, that because of the intense mental rigor, you’d wear out as you age. I love that Nash went back to work after he recovered. I was also very impressed by the strength of his wife, Alicia. His son’s mental illness is really tragic, but I love that Nash takes care of him. A really great, worthwhile, and enjoyable read."

288,0571212921,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3816725-larry-bassett,3,"It is hard to know how to say that John Nash is a fairly unique individual. You have to start with the fact that he was a brilliant mathematician. To be a mathematician with a brain that works in fairly amazing ways is hard enough to explain in words I suspect. When I was in graduate school I lived in a house with two other women, one of whom was a graduate student in mathematics. I wish I could find Janet Woodruff today to talk with her about John Nash.John Nash was also someone who suffered from schizophrenia and apparently came back from that after 25 years of suffering and treatment and hospitalization. The book says that mathematics is a specialty of young people and that people in that field rise to the heights of their profession at a young age. The book follows the life of John Nash through a long period of severe disability that also displayed how mathematical Rockstars experience life in academia. It talks about how people who are extremely bright also often have peculiar social disabilities. We follow the life of John Nash through many ups and downs. He is a unique individual from many different points of view. Once again the fact that I experience this as an audible book was an asset for me in getting through a story that I might not have managed to overcome if I had to turn paper pages."
289,0571212921,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1769011-arminzerella,3,"John Nash was a prominent mathematician in the prime of his career – best known for his work on game theory (and its applications in economics) – when he was diagnosed with schizophrenia. Already somewhat eccentric and socially awkward, his illness pushed him over into paranoid and delusional. He was unable to function in the real world and had to be institutionalized. He received treatments, some of which were more successful than others, and like other schizophrenics he relapsed many times. It seemed for many years that John Nash would never recover the thing he valued most – his mind. And then, seemingly out of nowhere, he got better. He became accustomed to the extra noise in his head and found that he was able to distinguish between the thoughts/ideas that were “normal” and the ones that were “crazy.” He began working again as a mathematician and making contributions to his field. Sylvia Nasar’s book is much more detailed than the movie that was based on it, but the way that Nash’s illness is revealed in the movie is much more dramatic (because you’re seeing things from inside of Nash’s head and he doesn’t realize he’s delusional). Although he is described as tall and attractive, there was much about John Nash that was off-putting to many. He could be arrogant and cruel and during his young life he often found himself on the outside – the social outcast of the social outcasts. His brilliance, however, was unquestionable. Nasar spares us most of the mathematical details (which the layperson wouldn’t grasp – even Nash’s colleagues were often gobsmacked at his unique approaches to problems), but brings the man to life. I don’t really follow the mathematics (computations! proofs! reasoning!) or understand the importance of the work that he’s done/doing, but I found his breakthrough out of schizophrenia fascinating. Nash has a son who is also afflicted with this illness."
290,0571212921,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2393446-anne-hawn-smith,5,"The story of the brilliant John Nash is an incredibly complicated one. Did his madness contribute to his difficult, arrogant personality or was he just one of those people who has a severe social disability? I came up with more questions than answers after reading this book. Did he have Asbergers syndrome? Was this why he was so inept at social relations, or was he so contemptuous of everyone around him because he recognized early that he was intellectually so far superior to everyone he knew? Did his brilliance allow him to triumph over schizophrenia of was it just one of those miracles that happen for no reason? I think what I learned from this book was the fragility of the human mind and the weakness of our human vessels. How could someone this brilliant be beset by so many problems? Why is it that genius of any type, intellectual, artistic or diplomatic seems to be so closely related to deficits in other areas of development? Do all great gifts come with a cost? Is the idiot/savant just an extreme version of this paradox? Why couldn't a mind so brilliant find some way to protect himself from madness? "
291,0571212921,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10918354-nurul-badriah,5,"I rarely read autobiography book because it's quite boring for me. But this book is such an amazing and touching book. This is my all time favorite book that I will read over and over again and will recommend to all the people around the world to read it. In my opinion all the smart people have some mental illness problems, not all of them but plenty of them do have psychological problems. This book shows us about how people undergoes psychological problems like schizophrenia in this story and to overcome them by the help of family, friends and society. This book talk about John Nash and about his theory and illness, the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences. This book just took me by storm by the uniqueness, ironically enough because it was based on a real life situation. This book touched me on many levels. The psychology was intriguing, the mathematical philosophies was actually amazing and the humanistic side of love. A Beautiful Mind was by far the most original,realistic, intelligent and heart touching book that I have ever read. John Nash was truly worthy of the Noble Prize."
292,0571212921,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1354567-melissa,4,"This was a tough read. Halfway through I disliked John Nash so intensely that I wasn't sure I could finish the book. He was arrogant, rude, selfish, sexist, and even frightening. The book also highlighted how culturally we are willing to accept not only difficult but harmful behavior from people who are highly gifted, which I hate. However, it's also nearly impossible to disentangle Nash from his illness, and I couldn't help wondering how his mental condition figured into his behavior even before he became obviously ill. By the end of the book, I had much more sympathy for what he endured as a product of his time (the 50s and 60s) as well as what he endured from his illness (insulin shock therapy sounds horrific). The moment toward the end when he asks if it's okay for him to enter a cafeteria at Princeton because he wasn't faculty actually drew tears because it was such a contrast from his earlier arrogance. Nash was a fascinating, complicated, messy, unlikeable person who, in the words of one of his colleagues, was still ""worth saving."" This book is an unflinching look at all of the different facets of that reality."

But I will say the movie definitely Hollywoodized him. In the book he is very disturbing, especially in his younger years. He did and said some terrible things. He had a son by his mistress and pretty much abandoned him. He was arrested for exposing himself, tried to come on to other men etc. Sometimes the book was hard to get through as I didn't want to spend so much time with such a creeper! But I still found it interesting, especially how he managed to control his mental health issues over the years. His love story was strange to me- what did Alyssa see in him? I didn't understand all the math background, so I would skim some of that. It was sad to hear how he struggled and was treated in his mental illness. Also sad to hear his second son struggles with schizophrenia too. I would still recommend it as in interesting book, especially to someone with a math background."

However, the book was far more indepth, interesting, and potent that I could have imagined. The story was much more real, wrought with tragedy, beauty, and poignancy. I think if the movie would have adhered more to the truth it would have been far more interesting but it was still well done. Not only did the book provide indepth information in the personal life and accomplishments of Nash, but it also branched into the history of mathematics(related to Nash), Princeton, the Cold War mathematicians, sanitariums and pyschiatric methods during the time, and the nomination and debate related to Nobel prize nominees. At times however I found the mathematical information a bit confusing but I'm only in 11th grade so my incomprehension can not be completely blamed on the book itself. All together it was a fascinating, detailed work."

Since the story begins right at the birth, we come to understand the kind of person that he is. I appreciate the fact that the book paints the good, the bad and the ugly all with the same brush. This helps us to come to know exactly what kind of a person John Nash was.A beautiful mind is more on the fact that if a person really puts his mind to it, he can come out of a disease that was presumably incurable than the mathematical as well as the economic contributions. The book deals more with the life events than the mathematical equations. I was hoping to read something about how he came upon the Game Theory as well as other discoveries that he made in the field, but I suppose the reason it was omitted was that the field in which Nash worked was so abstract that it would have put off many readers."
296,0571212921,http://goodreads.com/user/show/445677-scott,5,"A very well-written and engaging biography of John Nash. While many readers may have already seen the movie version, I had not. Nash certainly presents a difficult character; at times it is hard to muster sympathy for him, but ultimately I was heartbroken by his schizophrenia and ""lost years."" The fact that he has enjoyed a remission of this disease, and a return to a somewhat normal life, is a testament to the will and love of those around him who rallied support and resources to care for him during his long periods of bizarre behavior. Author Nasar describes the mathematics without getting mired in the details, so the reader has a sense of the import of Nash's achievements without a learned appreciation of them. I enjoyed this book, but will want to read something more light-hearted next!"

I've always believed in numbers; and the equations and logics that lead to reason. But after a lifetime of such pursuits, I ask, ""What truly is logic? Who decides reason?"" My quest has taken me through the physical, the metaphysical, the delusional -- and back. And I have made the most important discovery of my career, the most important discovery of my life: It is only in the mysterious equations of love that any logic or reasons can be found. I'm only here tonight because of you. (his wife, Alicia) You are the reason I am. You are all my reasons."""

He developed a game and later focuses on game theory. He got a position in MIT. Here it’s mostly personal stories: he impregnated a woman he dated but refused to marry her; he eventually married a student from an upper class family; he started to show signs of schizophrenia, including turning down a professorship at Chicago because he is becoming emperor of Antarctica. Many years later, he is getting better. And his earlier work is becoming central for economists. He was then awarded the Nobel Prize in economics and returned to Princeton.[Need to scan: the part on Nobel Prize committee sounds interesting]"

I enjoyed the movie more.To be fair, it is easier to paint a tale with more likable characters, intrigue and fairy-tale turnaround, when not restrained by real life. I had no idea how much real-life was altered for the movie. What bothered me most about the book was that at several points, I felt I was reading less of a biography about Nash, and more a story about the lives of people around him and the academic world that he wandered through... with occasional notes about Nash behaving brashly."
