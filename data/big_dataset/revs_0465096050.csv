This ought to be a question of burning interest to almost everyone, and yet, for some reason, hardly anybody over the age of seventeen seems to take it seriously. If you ask the adults, no one's sure whose responsibility it is. They send you over to talk to the sociologists, who shrug their shoulders; sorry guv, nuffin to do wiv us. Try philosophy, they're just down the street. The philosophers look embarrassed, and explain that yes, absolutely, they used to be in charge of it, but now it's been handed over to physics. The physicists tell you that of course they know the answer: there is no such thing as reality. If you aren't happy with that, go and talk with the sociologists. And round you go again. This book, I am pleased to say, does take the question seriously. Rather than limiting himself to one single viewpoint, which as we've seen lets it get away, Adam Becker pursues all three lines of investigation simultaneously, and manages to present something which looks surprisingly like an answer. It's a complicated answer, and you need a three hundred page book to explain it properly, but I would summarise it like this. About a hundred years ago, a group of physicists made some astonishing discoveries. This work, which soon started going by the name of ""quantum mechanics"", had enormous philosophical implications: in comparison, the Copernican revolution was no more than a minor footnote. It showed that the nature of reality was completely different from what had previously been believed. It was also, unfortunately, rather difficult to understand, and could only be explained well in mathematical language. Even worse, it turned out to be a source of incredible military and economic power: it made possible the development of weapons and technologies that had previously not even been dreamed of. Power, as is well known, corrupts, and this new power corrupted at every level. In particular, it corrupted intellectually. Physicists, who in the 1920s had been familiar with philosophy and well-disposed towards philosophical ways of thinking, became arrogant and impatient with the philosophers. What were they doing, sitting around dreaming about eternal verities, when physicists had important work to do? The physicists decided they could take care of the philosophy themselves. They cobbled together some theories from the currently fashionable positivist school and breathed a sigh of relief. We don't need to worry about what ""reality"" is; there is no such thing as ""reality"", and the mere fact that you ask the question shows you are an ignorant layman. We have a picture of what happens in quantum mechanics which we call the ""Copenhagen interpretation"", and it's the only possible answer. We have mathematically proved it. A few people whispered that the proof seemed to have a hole in it and the Copenhagen interpretation didn't actually make sense, but they were ignored. Who cared what these crazy dissidents thought, when physics departments were being showered with money by people who wanted more magical devices? The math worked: it didn't matter what it ""meant"". In a phrase which came to encapsulate this whole world-view, shut up and calculate. The philosophers, who should have been keeping an eye on things under the academic world's informal separation-of-powers system, had lost all confidence. They no longer had any power. When they tried to object, they were slapped down by the physicists: no one cares what you say, when you don't understand the complex math on which quantum mechanics is based. Physicists who did understand the math and still had a philosophical outlook were contained in other ways. If they tried to publish work, it was usually rejected as ""not real physics"". If they persisted, they were labelled as unemployable, and refused promotion or worse.It's an absolutely fascinating chapter in the development of human thought, and Adam Becker, who's done a huge amount of background research, explains it very well. He starts off with a quote from Ursula Le Guin, and if you're a fan of The Dispossessed you'll soon recognise the story: this is Shevek, but not as a fictional character. Read it and find out what's really been going on."

There are as many views of reality as there are observers. Thankfully in all instances, given the depth of some of the possible interpretations, the interaction of the observer state wave and that of the rest of the universe is extremely asymmetrical - the universe has a great effect on the observer but the latter's effect on the universe is mercifully, infinitesimally small. There is no doubt that the philosophical implications of the developments in modern scientific thinking are in lagging mode. This is because of the extreme complexities of the formalisms created to describe the reality as seen by human observers with a certain evolved sense of perception. The modern philosopher has to tread wearily through the theory before emerging tired and almost at wit's end to be in a position to even expound a valid opinion, least of all an emerging new philosophy, on the ontological basis of the quantum world. This is the first time I’ve read a book on Quantum Mechanics wherein three of the major outlier physicists appear: David Bohm, Hugh Everett III, and John Stewart Bell."
2,0465096050,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1444651-david-katzman,5,"A truly fantastic, lucid overview of the competing theories that purport to explain quantum mechanics. Becker takes an interesting approach that I’ve never read before, which is to put all the different theories into historical context. We learn a great deal about both the philosophical context and personalities that surrounded, supported and challenged the competing theories. What is at stake here is our understanding of the very nature of reality.Although I’ve read a great deal about quantum theory, this book was an eye-opener. There are currently three leading theories to explain the Schrodinger Equation and what it says about the nature of the universe. The Copenhagen Interpretation, which was the first explanation and the most widely known, the de Broglie–Bohm Pilot Wave Theory, and the Many-Worlds Interpretation. There are several others out there as well, but these are the leading three at present and the ones that Becker spends the majority of his book explaining. There is a fourth, for example, that proposes the random collapse of the wave function, but it is not very popular at the moment. It seems a bit gimmicky to me, but it can’t be dismissed on that basis.Becker demonstrates that although Copenhagen is still the most widely accepted by physicists, it has tremendous gaping holes of logic in it that fail to justify its popularity. Becker educates us thoroughly on how it came to be so popular despite the weakness of it. Much of it has to do with the cult of personality around key physicists who promoted it when it first came out—along with various political events, cultural and philosophical currents that complemented this theory. Since then, the challenges of understanding quantum mechanics have kept a kind of inertia among physicists, which creates reluctance for them to consider new theories. Einstein didn’t trust the Copenhagen interpretation and invented thought experiments that challenged it. The story goes that Niels Bohr overcame and dismissed Einstein’s objections and “won” the debate. But as Becker presents it, in fact, Bohr was a confusing, muddled communicator and a slow thinker who never actually understood Einstein’s thought experiments and only rejected them rhetorically not through actual logical debate. In the end, much of the defense of Copenhagen was simply assertion.Einstein had two primary objections to the Copenhagen interpretation. The first was non-locality or what he called “spooky action at a distance.” He said there was no reason to trust that particles can instantaneously move from one location to another or instantaneously communicate over vast distances as is required by the Copenhagen Interpretation. He also objected to the mushy undefined nature of how an observation causes the collapse of the Schrodinger Wave function. Do events not occur in deep space if they aren’t being observed? And if not, then how do the processes continue on in time until they are observed? (For example, imagine an unobserved sun exploding far from any life forms. I million years later it collapses into a white dwarf star. Imagine no observer has “seen” the sun for the first million years but then a space-ship whizzes nearby and sees the white dwarf star. Did the sun not exist for the first million years of its explosion but then instantaneously leaps into white dwarf star state as if it had been observed in the past million years? You can see the absurdity of this. It would have to instantaneously assume a state and also instantaneously assume one million years of past history.) Does observation require consciousness to read a piece of data? Or does a mouse collapse the wave function? The theory can’t answer that question. There is also another big hole in the Copenhagen Interpretation, which is that it must posit a distinction between the quantum world and the “classic” world. Right now the theory proposes that “classical” objects—those that obey Newtonian physics—are just…bigger. And “small” objects obey quantum effects. An observation must be enacted by a “big” object that is classical in order to collapse the wave function. But Copenhagen can’t explain why bigger objects aren’t subject to quantum effects and where the boundary is between big and small. Nothing in the Schrodinger Equation itself ever signals that a collapse should occur. As far as the Schrodinger Equation knows, particles will continue in their undefinable states forever. Measurement is invented as an outside justification for finding particles somewhere rather than everywhere at once.Copenhagen seems bankrupt to me. Too many holes are unexplained by it…it is clearly incomplete. The Pilot-Wave Theory plugs a few of the holes although it still suffers from non-locality, but in fewer cases than Copenhagen does. In general, Pilot-Wave theory solves the issue of the particle/wave duality. Particles ride on waves essentially so their behavior is not nearly as mysterious as it is in Copenhagen. Pilot Wave Theory does a great job of explaining the mysterious double-slit experiment, for example. Particles have definite locations within an atom, but we just can’t see them. They aren’t mysteriously smeared everywhere at the same time; they are moving along, following their pilot wave, and are simply found where they are found when measured. An observer isn’t required per se, so it solves the measurement problem. But it still requires non-locality in some situations. Some physicists still believe Einstein was wrong and the world may not be local. Particles may make faster-than-light instantaneous changes. Since Pilot-Wave theory is equivalent to the Schrodinger Equation mathematically, it is worth considering. The Many-Worlds Interpretation has become much more recognized in recent years in popular culture as well as physics circles, but there still remains a lot of resistance to it as a theory because it requires you to adopt a very, very, very strange view of reality. Really, the Copenhagen explanation is also very, very strange, but because it maintains a certain mystery “we can never know,” it perhaps leaves some of that strangeness disguised.On the plus side, the Many-Worlds Interpretation does in fact eliminate non-locality as an issue. Particles do not in fact ever instantly assume positions or change positions instantly nor do they communicate with their pasts to assume some certain state. Many Worlds also solves the observer issue. No observation is required. It also explains the related measurement issue. Similarly, no measurement is required to collapse the Schrodinger Equation. Nor is there any need to distinguish between classical or “big” objects and “small” or quantum objects. Everything is subject to quantum effects all the time. When a quantum particle interacts with another larger object, such as a “measurement device” they become entangled and unite into a larger and more complex Schrodinger Equation. There is no collapse, only constant entanglement.It’s weirder than that though. In fact, it proposes that every single quantum state that has ever existed breaks off into a separate universe. The entire universe is an infinite multiplicity of universes that are all united as one giant quantum Schrodinger Equation. Every single state spins off as a new universe. Now that is supremely weird. But mathematically, it is also equivalent to the Copenhagen Interpretation and produces the same results. There are some challenges with the meaning of probability however, so it’s not a fully solved model for the universe. But it certainly answers many questions that Copenhagen doesn’t. And it also cures non-locality, which Einstein believed was impossible.All that said, Becker points out that it is quite possible that a new interpretation could arise that would supersede all these as well, but he encourages the scientific pursuit of the meaning of the Schrodinger Equation and demonstrates why there is so much value in pursuing these mysteries.What a great book. Recommended for anyone who enjoys cutting edge physics and written in a fashion that seems comprehensible to the layperson."
3,0465096050,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8079403-max,5,"Becker explores the interpretation of quantum mechanics. He and the scientists he cites all accept the functionality, accuracy and mathematics of quantum mechanics, but disagree on what it tells us about the world. Does it merely provide information useful in making predictions for experiments and designing new technology or does it reveal an underlying reality. Becker digs into Niels Bohr’s Copenhagen Interpretation. He discusses alternatives such as David Bohm’s pilot-wave interpretation, Hugh Everett’s many-worlds interpretation, the spontaneous-collapse theory and decoherence. Becker gives us a brief history of the development of quantum mechanics and its interpretations beginning with Bohr and Einstein and their life long debate over the meaning of quantum mechanics. Particularly interesting was material about the development of alternative interpretations and how difficult it was for young physicists to challenge accepted beliefs. Becker, who has studied both physics and philosophy, makes the case for the important role of philosophy in interpreting what all the experiments and weird results tell us about the real world. Becker reviews the double-slit experiment and well known thought experiments such as Schrodinger’s cat-in-box experiment. He uses these to illustrate his issues with the Copenhagen interpretation. Foremost is the Measurement Problem. In quantum mechanics fundamental particles are represented by a wave function which gives the probability of their being found in a particular location. However the Copenhagen interpretation holds that when we measure the particle the wave function collapses and only then do we find the particle in one specific place. This collapse is not supported by Schrodinger’s equation which is the math establishing the wave function of quantum mechanics. But it is a widely accepted postulate of many scientists who believe in the Copenhagen Interpretation. What constitutes a measurement is not clear. Is it when the particle is observed? Observed by who or what? Is it when the particle encounters a larger object?Another important issue is that of a boundary between the quantum world and the everyday world. Bohr, the acknowledged father of the Copenhagen Interpretation, held that there was a separation between the quantum world where particles could be found almost anywhere until measured and the normal macro world we see every day. Where is that dividing line? How can the particles that are the building blocks for macro objects like us behave so differently and still create the world we observe? Recent experiments reveal quantum behavior in larger objects. One experiment coaxed a sixty carbon atom “buckyball” into a quantum state where it demonstrated interference with itself just like a photon in the double-slit experiment. More physicists today accept that quantum waves apply to macro objects further complicating the issues of measurement induced wave collapse and boundaries.In 1952 David Bohm building on the work of Louis of de Broglie proposed a theory of pilot waves guiding particles. Both the waves and particles are always there even when no one is looking. The particle “surfs” the wave which determines its position. No need of an observer for the particle to materialize. A couple of years later Hugh Everett III determined that the “Copenhagen Interpretation is hopelessly incomplete…excluding in principle any deduction of classical physics from quantum theory, or any adequate investigation of the measuring process…as well as a philosophic monstrosity with a ‘reality’ concept for the macroscopic world and denial of the same for the microcosm.” He proposed that the wave function never collapsed. It simply split with each outcome continuing on and splitting again ad infinitum. Everett didn’t discuss many worlds in his “relative-state” theory. Bryce DeWitt in a 1957 Physics Today article dubbed it the many-worlds theory stoking the imagination leading to its popularization. Modern concepts in cosmology such as inflation and string theory invoked the multiverse making Everett’s many-worlds seem less strange and by the 21st century it was second in popularity among physicists to the Copenhagen interpretation.Bohm, Everett and others who proposed solutions that encompassed a quantum reality were derided by the physics establishment. Their work was not deemed worthy of consideration by serious scientists even though Bohm and Everett were brilliant physicists. As the century wore on more physicists became receptive to alternative interpretations. Becker recounts the frustrations of many young physicists interested in the foundations of quantum mechanics who were actively discouraged or ostracized for questioning an accepted successful theory. One inspiration was the work of John Bell. Bell started his investigation of quantum mechanics after reading Bohm. In a 1964 paper Bell put forth a convincing argument that nature was nonlocal, a feature of Bohm’s pilot wave interpretation that had been heavily criticized by the Copenhagen adherents. Nonlocality means that entangled photons share a single wave function thus they synchronize their quantum states instantaneously at any distance violating special relativity. Subsequent experiments have supported Bell’s theorem which has been referred to as “the most profound discovery of science.” However, if the wave function splits into multiple branching worlds as Hugh Everett III proposed, locality would be maintained.The Copenhagen Interpretation holds that quantum mechanics provides useful information, but does not reveal any underlying reality. Until the wave function collapses there is only a mathematical probability of the location of a particle. The particle is nowhere. It only appears when a measurement is made. While this became the widely accepted view, some respected physicists did not buy in. These included Einstein and Schrodinger in the 1920s and 50 years later Nobel Prize winner Murray Gell-Mann. Gell-Mann wrote “The fact that an adequate philosophical presentation [of quantum physics] has been so long delayed is no doubt caused by the fact that Niels Bohr brainwashed a whole generation of theorists.” Bohr was a charismatic figure with great influence over other top physicists. His complete disdain of alternative interpretations became conventional wisdom stifling any young physicist interested in being taken seriously from pursuing alternatives. The rise of cosmology in the last half of the twentieth century helped create support for those who didn’t accept Bohr’s views. Gell-Mann and James Hartle noted “Measurements and observers cannot be fundamental notions in a theory that seeks to discuss the early universe when neither existed.”Bohr’s views were likely influenced by the trending philosophy in Weimar Germany. Logical Positivism developed by the “Vienna Circle” built on the work of physicist and philosopher Ernst Mach. The positivists believed that anything not observable was meaningless. Applied to the quantum this means imputing the existence of particles prior to observation is meaningless. Mach was Wolfgang Pauli’s godfather. Pauli, a preeminent physicist born and raised in Vienna, was an influential supporter of positivism and Bohr. Bohr stated flatly “There is no quantum world.” “Isolated material particles are abstractions…” This begs the question where do particles come from when an observation is made. Reacting to such views Einstein noted “What I dislike in this kind of argumentation is the basic positivistic attitude which seems to me to come to the same thing as [Irish philosopher George] Berkeley’s principle, esse est percipi [to be is to be perceived].” Einstein believed there was a real quantum world that existed when not observed. He believed quantum mechanics was an incomplete theory.One may ask why different interpretations of the same mathematics matter. Regardless of interpretation the math delivers the same results. Schrodinger’s equation still applies whether interpreted as Copenhagen or many-worlds. Becker offers a good example. In the sixteenth century Tycho Brahe proposed that the sun and moon rotated around the earth and the other planets around the sun. Copernicus had earth rotating around the sun too. At the time both models gave the same predictions of the planets motions. So why care which was right? Obviously only the Copernicus model led to a better understanding and more fruitful research.The disparity in interpretation reflects that between physicists and philosophers. One hundred years ago scientific curricula included course work in philosophy. Einstein studied Mach and Bohr studied Kant. Few physicists today get training in philosophy changing their approach to interpretation. Many scientists associate philosophy with Continental philosophers who are suspicious of scientific claims. However, Becker points out that philosophers of physics use an analytic approach that accepts science and applies logical rigor to the interpretation of its results. Becker with training in both concludes “Stating that the conclusions of the Copenhagen interpretation are ‘inevitable’ or ‘forced upon us by the mathematics of the theory’ is simply wrong. It is not true that it’s meaningless to talk about reality existing independently of perceptions, that we must think of the world solely as the subject of our observations. Solipsism and idealism are not the message of quantum physics.” “There is something real out in the world, that somehow resembles the quantum. We just don’t know what that means yet. And it’s the job of physics to find out.”"

Becker takes the reader effortlessly through nearly a hundred years of back-and-forth debate as what quantum mechanics implies about the universe we live in. The history itself is fascinating. I had no idea (blush) that Heisenberg (of uncertainty fame) was actually a Nazi who headed the Nazi's atomic bomb project, which according to Heisenberg (postwar) was unsuccessful as he was really a nice guy who didn't want to blow up things, and according to Becker was incompetent. According to Becker, Heisenberg was actually the one who coined the ""Copenhagen Agreement"" in the postwar period as a way of cementing his role in the foundation of QMs and upgrading his status post-Hitler, and by doing so made it seem there was a standard interpretation when there wasn't. Einstein (who I had been raised to think of as just never getting QM) comes across as particularly sharp in his critique, and was concerned about the implications of non-locality that he saw lurking at the heart of the standard interpretation of QM; which is of course at the heart of Bell's inequality theorem. QM's grandfather Bohr comes as a bit of an arsehole, stopping any dissent into his standard positivist interpretation of QM. His waving away of the measurement problem, of there being two worlds (a QM world of the small, and a classical world of the big), can be seen in retrospect as incoherent and vastly damaging to the field.(If I understood things correctly) Einstein's major concern with the Copenhagen Interpretation of QM was that not only were a particle's properties (momentum, energy etc) unknown until the collapse of QM wave function, they in didn't exist according to the Copenhagen Interpretation until that point. Einstein saw that this led to two possibilities: either QM was incomplete and these properties existed but were unmeasurable (i.e., there were ""hidden variables - God doesn't play dice!) or the nature of the properties was fixed at the time of measurement (i.e., the Copenhagen Interpretation). If the latter, this would in turn imply that in certain situations (i.e., where particles were quantumly entangled) information about these properties would be transmitted instantaneously (i.e., faster than the speed of light and locality would fail). Naturally Einstein preferred the situation where QM was incomplete and locality was upheld.David Bohm, later derived a model of QM that was completely consistent with the maths of the Copenhagen Interpretation, but did involve hidden non-local variables (i.e., at any particular moment a particle has a definite momentum, energy, spin etc). As a bonus this Bohmian interpretation gave simple explanations of classic problems like the double-slit experiment, as well as QM entanglement, but perhaps because it involved non-locality (or because it contradicted the Copenhagen Interpretation) was largely dismissed and forgotten. Hugh Everett, looking for a quick doctoral topic, decided to avoid the measurement problem altogether by supposing the wave function never collapsed, and thereby developed what has become known as the Many Worlds interpretation of QM. Naturally his work was also ignored by the physics establishment at the time, and he had to radically reedit his thesis in order to pass.Later John Bell (a particle physicist at CERN, who by his own account worked on QM foundations on Sundays) developed a theoretical test to see if local hidden variables could exist within QM. His paper, published in an obscure journal, was eventually tested years later at Berkeley for the first time in the early 1970s, and showed that non-locality was upheld (i.e., there were no local hidden variables - God does play with dice!). What this means for the World is hard to get your head around, and I join my better Einstein in thinking this is a very weird result indeed. It is shocking to learn that the postdoc who did these brilliant experiments, was unable to get tenure afterwards, because this work was regarded as quasi-worthless by the general physics community in the 1970s. In an irony of fate, this very non-locality is the very basis for modern quantum computing.Strongly recommended. 5-stars."
5,0465096050,http://goodreads.com/user/show/16077597-matt,5,"Gee-whiz! What is real? How the Heisenberg should I know? This book left me more in doubt about our (my?) reality than before I read it but I guess that’s a good thing.When you hear the words Quantum Theory and you only have a vague notion about some cat in a box, that’s neither dead nor alive (or perhaps both at the same time?) but want to learn more, this is the book for you. Although QT usually involves some rather complicated and evolved maths, this text gets by completely without it. Instead you’ll get a coherent picture about the history, philosophy, and, naturally, the science around QT from the early stages to current time. Although the equations and formulas of QT obviously can predict events and qualities of the universe with astonishing precision, even after more than ninety years there is still no conclusive/unique interpretation of those formulas, which means we still don’t know “the inmost force which binds the world, and guides its course”. I find this rather weird, and, honestly, a bit unsettling. So much of our current technology depends on results of Quantum research, but we don’t even know exactly how and why it works!?The acting characters in this story, mostly physicists, are introduced to the reader through biographical notes, anecdotes, quotations and so on: Bohr and Born (there’s also another called Bohm, and it’s hard to tell those three apart), Einstein, of course, and Schrödinger (the cat guy), Heisenberg (the uncertainty guy). Those I heard about before. But I only had a vague picture of Everett and his many-world-interpretation as well as Bell and his theorem. All of these and many others are introduced in detail and it’s a pleasure to read about them, about their struggles in search of reality (or refusal to do so). Given the fact that some of the people were German and Jewish and a great part of the story is set around the Nazi reign and WWII gives the book an additional historic flavor that I quite liked.The concluding chapter wraps up with some intriguing discussion about what science in general could mean for us, how it should work, and why it matters. We are all born scientists, explorers of the world we perceive around us, until it’s educated out of us. Get some of it back and read this book, why don’t you?

6,0465096050,http://goodreads.com/user/show/78485297-mario-the-lone-bookwolf,5,"Interdisciplinarity between scientists, philosophers and neuroscientists will eventually crack the well-deciphered code of reality.Please note that I have put the original German text to the end of this review. Just if you might be interested.The game of knowledge acquisition has always been played back and forth between three groups. The philosophers, scientists and, more recently, the neuroscientists. Philosophers can design the inspirational ideas for the other two groups in the field and make colorful mixtures together. Scientists work on experiments, detection methods and ever better instruments.The case of neuroscientists and brain researchers is more complicated. They have the option to observe the thoughts of physicists and philosophers live in practice. What makes them even more interdisciplinary than the two other groups. Because all together, the theories for consciousness, its function and the forces acting on it can be observed. For instance which neuronal level defines which state of consciousness in reality. Which, in turn, raises new questions for the philosophers, who pass these on to the natural scientists, ...The fact that quantum mechanics was also the key to unleashing atomic forces is often overlooked in the face of spooky, distant effects. But it were these theories that created the foundations for further insights in physics and astrophysics, which in turn inspired the earliest nuclear weapons. If such potential could be used more than 70 years ago, then what would happen in 700 years? What kind of weapon would that be that doesn´t use the clumsy and sluggish atoms but the even smaller bricks of reality? Which chain reactions could be unleashed?How long the misery of the science war around the Copenhagen interpretation served as an impediment on one of the significant fields of research is one example of discord in science. To remain serious and publishable, researchers had to pay attention to their reputation and, above all, circumvent the vague hypotheses of philosophy and some humanities. And to prevent any ideological debates and vendettas between oppositely arguing scientists or to question their own belief too critically. They should only research in a given direction under a certain paradigm.From soon 100 years ago, with the debate beginning in the early 20th century, until now, this was a reason for the disunity of many researchers. Besides, there was the danger of losing their own life's work legitimacy. If even Einstein doubted and sometimes despaired because that much dissonance existed between his theories and the hypotheses. Or if, like John Bell, one just got ingratitude and problems for working out the basics of quantum computing. What's more, it was more economical to begin with real applications than marketing just ideas, which finally discredited the philosophers.As so often, one has tended to think in extremes. Instead of finding insight in the middle between and perhaps the solution too. In the case of quantum physics, one extreme is the opinion that in observation there is only one unpredictable, random reality. One of two conditions or possibilities and just one form of reality at the same time for an observing person. Indeed the misunderstood ""choice"" between two conditions or properties and also complementary theories. But definitely not more that, which is explainable or examinable. The long-prevailing Copenhagen interpretation (Bohr) that blocked other approaches for a long time. ""This one random state may perhaps be complementary to another state and thus there is no real reality because we cant´ observe it."" Point and end of the debate. The other party fundamentally questions the validity of the accessible reality and suspects unknown factors. (Einstein). The beginning of a dispute that continues to this day.Either everything is so clear and easy, or everything is just fake and signifies nothing. So everything, almost solipsistic, only related to the ego or the total dissolution of ego. Absolute behavioral patterns of particles without individual properties or hidden variables that ""God uses to throw dice."" A dead or alive cat or endless variations of necromantic zombie cats. Determinism or variations of free will in all orders of magnitude. Predetermination by a higher entity or it's own decision. Two pretty opposing points of view.It is difficult to reconcile both understandable experiments and mathematics as well as pure thought experiments. Now, after a long period of stagnation, the time has come to test the theories in practice thanks to better technology. And subsequently, rehabilitate the advocates of the once ridiculed theses. But there is also the option that different approaches are right in different circumstances because there is not just one reality.Today (2018) the allegedly specific hypotheses are under attack by two sides. On a large scale by gravitational waves, black holes, ... and on a small scale by neutrinos, quanta,…. Today, just as Bohr, many researchers make the mistake of defending their doctrine like a clucking hen on top of their eggs and aggressively picking each helpless doctorand or student who dares to choose a different point of view. Funny to look at, but more in the field of tragedy. Because the real greatness is to revise a life's work occasionally and to search with the obtained wisdom for the new, better theory of everything. Because incomplete hypotheses are not perfect formulas, but only auxiliary vehicles to finding a better theory.Interdisziplinarität zwischen Naturwissenschaftlern, Philosophen und Neurowissenschaftlern wird irgendwann den gut dechiffrierten Code der Realität knacken.Der Spielball der Erkenntnis wird seit jeher zwischen drei Gruppen hin und her gespielt. Den Philosophen, Naturwissenschaftler und, seit jüngerer Vergangenheit, den Hirnforschern. Philosophen können die inspirierenden Ideen für die zwei anderen Gruppen in der Praxis konzipieren und bunte Mischungen zusammen basteln. Naturwissenschaftler tüfteln an Experimenten, Nachweisverfahren und immer besseren Instrumenten. Der Fall der Neurowissenschaftler und Gehirnforscher ist diffiziler. Ihnen eröffnet sich die Option, die Gedanken der Physiker und Philosophen in der Praxis live zu beobachten. Was sie noch interdisziplinärer als die 2 anderen Gruppen macht. Denn sowohl die Theorien für Bewusstsein, seine Funktion als auch die darauf wirkenden Kräfte lassen sich beobachten. Etwa für welches neuronale Level welcher Grad an Bewusstsein Realität definiert. Was wiederum neue Fragen für die Philosophen aufwirft, die diese an die Naturwissenschaflter weiter reichen,…Dass an der Quantenmechanik auch der Schlüssel zur Entfesselung der atomaren Kräfte lag, wird angesichts von spukhafter Fernwirkung gern übersehen. Doch schufen erst diese Theorien die Grundlagen für weitere Erkenntnisse der Physik und Astrophysik, die wiederum die ersten Kernwaffen inspirierten. Wenn vor über 70 Jahren derartiges Potential freigesetzt werden konnte, was dann erst in 700 Jahren? Was wäre das für eine Waffe, die sich nicht den plumpen und trägen Atomen, sondern der noch kleineren Ebenen der Realität bedient? Wie lange die Misere um den Wissenschaftskrieg der Kopenhagen Interpretation als Hemmschuh gedient hat, zeigt einen der großen Zwiespälte der Forschung auf. Um seriös und publizierbar zu bleiben, mussten Forscher auf ihre Renommee achten und vor allem die Hypothesen der Philosophie und mancher Geisteswissenschaften umgehen. Und um etwaigen ideologischen Debatten und Vendettas zwischen gegensätzlich argumentierenden Wissenschaftlern vorzubeugen oder ihren eigenen Glauben nicht zu kritisch zu hinterfragen. Sie dürften nur in eine vorgegeben Richtung unter einem Paradigma forschen.Das war vor 100 Jahren mit Beginn der Debatte bis weit ins 20 Jahrhundert hinein ein Grund für die Zerrissenheit vieler Forscher. Noch dazu, wenn dabei die Gefahr bestand, eigenen Lebenswerken die Legitimation abzuerkennen. Wenn selbst Einstein zweifelte und mitunter verzweifelte, weil genau diese Dissonanz zwischen seinen Theorien und den Hypothesen bestand. Oder wenn man, wie John Bell, nur Undank für die Erarbeitung der Grundlagen der Quantencomputer bekam. Noch dazu kam, dass sich ökonomisch mit realen Anwendungen mehr anfangen ließ als mit der Vermarktung von Ideen, was die Philosophen endgültig diskreditierte.Wie so oft tendierte der Mensch dazu, in Extremen zu denken. Anstatt im Mittelweg sein Glück und vielleicht die Lösung zu finden. Im Fall der Quantenphysik ist das die Meinung, dass es in der Beobachtung nur die eine unvorhersagbare, zufällige Realität gibt. Den einen von zwei Zuständen oder Möglichkeiten, beziehungsweise nur eine Form von Realität zur selben Zeit für eine beobachtende Person. Zwar schon die unverstandene ""Wahl"" zwischen zwei Zuständen oder Eigenschaften und auch komplementäre Theorien, aber definitiv nicht mehr als das. Die lange vorherrschende und andere Ansätze blockierende Kopenhagener Interpretation (Bohr). Dieser eine zufällige Zustand kann vielleicht komplementär mit einem anderen Zustand sein und damit gibt es keine echte Realität. Punkt und Ende der Debatte. Die andere Partei zweifelt die Aussagekraft der zugänglichen Realität grundsätzlich an und vermutet unbekannte Faktoren. (Einstein). Der Beginn eines bis heute andauernden Streits.Entweder alles ist so was von eindeutig oder alles ist nur fake und Schall und Rauch. Also alles, fast solipsistisch, nur auf das Ego bezogen oder die totale Auflösung von Ego. Absolute, durch Naturkonstanten bestimmte Verhaltensmuster von Teilchen ohne individuelle Eigenschaften oder versteckte Variablen, nach denen Gott doch würfelt. Eine tote oder eine lebendige Katze oder unendliche Variationen von nekromantischen Zombiekatzen. Determinismus oder Variationen von freiem Willen in allen Größenordnungen. Vorbestimmung durch eine höhere Entität oder eigene Entscheidung. Zwei ziemlich extreme Standpunkte. Es ist schwer, sowohl nochvollziehbare Experimente und Mathematik als auch reine Gedankenxperimente unter einen Hut zu bringen. Nun ist, nach langer Stagnation, die Zeit gekommen, um die Theorien dank besserer Technik in der Praxis zu testen. Und nachträglich die Verfechter der einst lächerlich gemachten Thesen zu rehabilitieren. Wobei auch die Option bestünde, dass verschiedene Theorien unter verschiedenen Umständen recht haben, weil es einfach nicht nur die eine Realität gibt. Heute (2018) werden die sicher gemeinten Hypothesen von zwei Seiten angenagt. Im Großen mit den Gravitationswellen, schwarzen Löchern, … und im Kleinen mit Neutrinos und Quanten. Wie auch Bohr begehen heute viele Forscher den Fehler, wie die Glucke auf dem Ei auf ihrer Lehrmeinung sitzen zu bleiben und aggessiv jeden hilflosen Doktoranden zu picken, der eine andere Ansicht vertritt. Lustig anzusehen, aber eher im Bereich der Tragik. Weil wirkliche Größe darin besteht, auch mitunter ein Lebenswerk zu revidieren und mit der erlangten Weisheit an der neuen, besseren Theorie von allem zu forschen. Denn unvollständige Hypothesen sind keine absoluten Formeln, sondern nur Hilfsvehikel bis zum Finden einer besseren Theorie."

Indeed I read it a second time and chose to listen to Sean Carroll's Mysteries of Modern Physics lectures, from The Great Courses series, as the accompanying glass of wine and dessert because it reenforced the ideas presented in Becker's book. Listening to Sean Carroll's lecture series along with reading this book allowed me to think about how all of the discoveries made in the quantum world apply to time. I warn you though, it's a rabbit hole. Since there are no final answers yet, your brain might get caught in an obsessive trap. I have now moved on to re-reading Lisa Ranall's Warped passages, not because I am convinced of other dimensions, but because thinking about pocket dimensions and/or bubble universes seemed extremely important to me after reading Becker and Carroll together. I also can't seem to stop thinking about how all of this relates to gravity, and keep rereading sections of Gravity's Engines by Caleb Scharf. Sometimes I feel so sad when I realize I will die before someone can answer the burning questions in my mind about the way the universe works, but nothing feels better than thinking about what we do know.While mainly focusing on the measurement problem in quantum physics (does the wave function collapse) , Becker recounts the history of many of the major discoveries and provided an extremely intuitive account of the following aspects of quantum mechanics: Heisenberg's uncertainty principleDouble slitSchrödinger's catEverett's many worldsCopenhagen Interpretation (probability / wave function collapse)The Bohr - Einstein debatesEPR paradoxBecker included in depth and intensely refreshing biographies of John Bell and his inequality and David Bohm's unorthodox ideas. The biography of Bohm was particularly of interest to me because not too long ago I finished a series of books about the discovery of quantum theory and while many of those books covered the other people highlighted in this book, none of them covered Bohm in the manner Becker did. I really cannot recommend this book highly enough. Rating a book like this always makes me realize how my previous 5 star ratings muddy the waters. I want there to be a 6 star rating you could use once or twice a year, so that you can really set a book apart from others. This book would be worthy of that 6 star rating."
8,0465096050,http://goodreads.com/user/show/169508-ramin,4,"Here's a brief excerpt of my review of ""What is Real?"" for Nature magazine, which was just published today. Please check out the full review here: https://www.nature.com/articles/d4158...All hell broke loose in physics some 90 years ago. Quantum theory emerged — partly in heated clashes between Albert Einstein and Niels Bohr. It posed a challenge to the very nature of science, and arguably continues to do so, by severely straining the relationship between theory and the nature of reality. Adam Becker, a science writer and astrophysicist, explores this tangled tale in What Is Real?.Becker questions the hegemony of the Copenhagen interpretation of quantum mechanics. Propounded by Bohr and Werner Heisenberg in the 1920s, this theory holds that physical systems have only probabilities, rather than specific properties, until they’re measured. Becker argues that trying to parse how this interpretation reflects the world we live in is an exercise in opacity. Showing that the evolution of science is affected by historical events — including sociological, cultural, political and economic factors — he explores alternative explanations. Had events played out differently in the 1920s, he asserts, our view of physics might be very different.Becker lingers on the 1927 Solvay Conference in Brussels, where 29 brilliant scientists gathered to discuss the fledgling quantum theory. Here, the disagreements between Bohr, Einstein and others, including Erwin Schrödinger and Louis de Broglie, came to a head. Whereas Bohr proposed that entities (such as electrons) had only probabilities if they weren’t observed, Einstein argued that they had independent reality, prompting his famous claim that “God does not play dice”. Years later, he added a gloss: “What we call science has the sole purpose of determining what is.” Suddenly, scientific realism — the idea that confirmed scientific theories roughly reflect reality — was at stake..."

Adam Becker gives both a historical run-down of how the theory of Quantum Physics came to be, and an explanation of the different interpretations thereof. I tend to think of physics as a ""hard science"" and this was such an eye-opener in how much ignorance, cultural norms and customs, psychology and trends come into play when it comes to what we count as scientific and not, and which theories we take seriously (those that already fit our perceived notions) and which not. Coming from the field of philosophy, I really appreciated and admired Becker's analytical approach (and his explanation of analytical and continental philosophy). You can really tell he's studied both physics and philosophy. Although the book tries to give a more or less neutral overview, Becker's clearly not a fan of the classical Copenhagen interpretation. Neither am I, but of course I just read a biased account of it, so that might be part of it. I'm no less confused about quantum physics than I was before, but I have learnt a lot and I'm even more intrigued now. Although I'm really glad this books was virtually free of maths, and easy to read, I do wish I could understand more of the maths behind the theory. "

Covers Einstein's qualms of around the probabilities and the EPR thought experiment which was meant to show that QM couldn't be the whole picture because it involved entanglement which implied a spooky action at a distance between particles. Also talks about the Vienna's Circle's logical positive being used for the Copenhagen interpretation which denied any deeper metaphysic to the mystery of the Quantum essentially ""Shut up and Calculate"". However, these questions came back in the sixties as metaphysics was taken up by a newer generation in a return of the repressed. The picture is now much debated on the metaphysics of QM including Many Worlds, Bohmians, Bayesians, GRWs and what have you. Good intellectual history of this subject."""
11,0465096050,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9856135-david,5,"This reads like an edge-of-the-seat detective story about quantum physics. I never thought this subject was particularly friendly to being portrayed with this kind of drama. Most reading on sub-atomic physics is a kind of slog; a perfunctory sweat-labor with the objective of obtaining a walking around knowledge of the subject. This book sets out the characters and the stakes involved with great narrative momentum. The assumptions behind the phenomenally successful equations of quantum physics (known as the ""quantum foundations"") are exposed as unresolved philosophical issues. The questions surrounding the measurement problem (""who is doing the measuring"", ""what constitutes a 'measurer'?"", ""why does physics insist on a discontinuity between laws ruling the very small and large?"") are still out there. And the fundamental ontological dilemma of exactly what is being measured goes begging.This detective story never does find its culprit. That could be a problem for some but merely the effort to re-frame the basic assumptions and ask questions that have gone neglected through the power of the ""Copenhagen interpretation"" to squelch dissent turns this into a delicious peek into the politics of scientific discourse in general and physics in particular.The book also considers the disaster that is logical positivism and the absolute necessity we face today of moving beyond excuses of solipsism, moral relativism and the primacy of a strictly measurable universe in this time of monumental crisis. The dilemma of living life as fully human and allowing for all humankind to continue to flourish hinges crucially on our ability to see where we have been misled by these pernicious philosophical assumptions."

13,0465096050,http://goodreads.com/user/show/85852005-sato,5,"What a delightful adventure! I really appreciate what Adam Becker has done, probably not only because of his incredible book, but also because I belong to the minority who think the Copenhagen Interpretation is not satisfying and “Shut up and Calculate” doesn’t add up. Quantum physics is tremendously successful and although it is considered the physics of ultra-small but there is really no boundary to its incredible contribution to the present progress in life. Niels Bohr, Heisenberg, Pauli and others are truly founders of the first interpretation of quantum physics,the Copenhagen Interpretation. But the Copenhagen interpretation assumes a mysterious division between the microscopic world governed by quantum mechanics and a macroscopic world of [measurement] apparatus and observers that obeys classical physics.For what matter, why should we care? Its mathematics makes accurate predictions; isn’t that enough?Quantum physics works, but ignoring what it tells us about reality means papering over a hole in our understanding of the world—and ignoring a larger story about science as a human process.As Einstein said this “epistemology-soaked orgy” should come to an end. Albert Einstein was someone who was not on the same track with Copenhagen Interpretation, mainly because of its inability to have a realist approach about the real phenomena, and to some degree for its “spooky action at a distance” nature or its non-locality. Schrodinger, was also someone who never made compromise with Neils Bohr’s vague discussions and there were few physicists who dared to question the Copenhagen Interpretation. A misunderstanding: Based on the 1926 Einstein’s famous “God doesn’t play dice”, almost all the Copenhagen physicists reffered Einstein’s problem to uncertainty principle, but in fact Einstein’s concern was with non-locality not uncertainty principle.Schrodinger’s discovery of wave function and Max Born discovery of “a particle’s wave function in a location yields the probability of measuring the particle in that location “ were potential motives for further elaboration for Heisenberg to present “Uncertainty principle”. But Heisenberg and Schrodinger’s quest to show a more coherent nature of Quantum mechanics is probably the first interesting quests over the Copenhagen Interpretation.Von Neuman’s interepretation: Von Neumann’s solution was to make the observer—whoever was looking—responsible for wave function collapse. “We must always divide the world into two parts, the one being the observed system, the other the observer,” Von Neumann said. “Quantum mechanics describes the events which occur in the observed portion of the world, so long as they do not interact with the observing portion, with the aid of the [Schrödinger equation], but as soon as such an interaction occurs, i.e. a measurement, it requires the [collapse of the wave function].”Von Neuman’s character as the most brilliant mathematician of his age never let the voice of Grete Hermann, someone who proved him wrong be listened just because she was a woman. Von Neuman’s proof and credit helped the popularity of Copenhagen Interpretation for decades later after the World war and the Manhattan Project. Bohm’s interpretation: In Bohm’s interpretation of quantum physics, much of the mystery of the quantum world simply falls away. Objects have definite positions at all times, whether or not anyone is looking at them. Particles have a wave nature, but there’s nothing “complementary” about it—particles are just particles, and their motions are guided by pilot waves. This simple idea allowed Bohm to cut through the thicket of quantum paradoxes. The Copenhagen interpretation doesn’t let you ask what’s happening to Schrödinger’s cat before you look in the box, insisting only that it’s meaningless to talk about the unobservable. But, in Bohm’s pilot-wave interpretation, not only can you ask but there’s an answer: before you look in the box, the cat is either dead or alive, and opening the box merely reveals which is true. The act of observation has nothing to do with the condition of the cat.The theory of quantum gravity: John Wheeler, was obsessed with his own disreputable problem, general relativity. Despite the theory’s universal acceptance, it wasn’t seen as a reasonable field of research at the time. Wheeler was interested in the same problem Einstein was trying to solve: marrying general relativity to quantum physics in a single theory of quantum gravity, with the ultimate goal of describing the entire universe, including its origin, in the still more disreputable nascent field of quantum cosmology. The many world interpretation: Rejecting both von Neumann and Bohr, Everett came up with his own solution to the measurement problem. Rather than explaining wave function collapse, Everett stated that wave functions never collapse at all. This in itself was not new; Bohm said the same thing. But Bohm had also added particles with definite positions into the theory, which accounted for the outcomes of measurements. Everett didn’t add particles—he didn’t think he needed them. Instead, he insisted that a single universal wave function was all there was: a massive mathematical object describing the quantum states of all objects in the entire universe. This universal wave function, according to Everett, obeyed the Schrödinger equation at all times, never collapsing, but splitting instead. Each experiment, each quantum event, spun off new branches of the universal wave function, creating a multitude of universes in which that one event had every possible outcome. Everett’s shocking idea came to be known as the “many-worlds” interpretation of quantum physics.Bell’s theorem: Bell’s theorem really leaves only three unequivocal possibilities: either nature is nonlocal in some way, or we live in branching multiple worlds despite appearances to the contrary, or quantum physics gives incorrect predictions about certain experimental setups. No matter the outcome, Bell’s work presents a threat to the Copenhagen interpretation. Perhaps because it contradicts the widely received wisdom, physicists have long had particular difficulty understanding the true implications of Bell’s theorem—in fact, the misunderstandings began before it was even published. Bell’s work had inspired a full-blown quantum rebellion, the first truly widespread and serious challenge to the Copenhagen interpretation from within the physics community since the Bohr-Einstein debates."
14,0465096050,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1411444-ed-erwin,5,"QM is undeniably non-intuitive and weird, but the Copenhagen Interpretation(s) are far more weird than necessary, and have been used to sell a lot of quack-pot ideas. There are other interpretations, which are still weird, but much less so. The other interpretations don't require crazy claims about conscious observers affecting the behavior of electrons or cats that are alive and dead at the same time and so forth.This book has ZERO equations and very few diagrams. You do not need to be a math whiz to understand it. It still might make your brain hurt, but it is mostly stories about people and history.This book explains, briefly, what some of these other interpretations are, and why they aren't as well known.* Firstly, the Copenhagen Interpretation works fine for practical purposes. As long as you can accept some hand-waving arguments about what situations cause ""wave function collapse"" you can just go about your business and solve practical equations and you will get the right answer.* University physics courses today are all about solving practical problems. Physics students aren't expected to worry about philosophical underpinnings, and professors don't have time to try to teach it anyway.* David Bohm had trouble spreading his ideas largely because the FBI or CIA got him run out of the country and stuck in Brazil due to the red scare. He was unable to attend conferences or visit other physicists.* Hugh Everett left the world of Physics for personal reasons, so didn't publicize his ideas much.* Niels Bohr had close personal relationships with many physicists, and they tended to accept his interpretations over those of Einstein or others, even when Bohr's writings are so confusing that nobody knows what they mean.* Respectable physics journals refused to publish articles about interpretation issues.Adam Becker is trained in both physics and philosophy and that gives him the tools he needs to tell this story. He even managed to convince me that philosophy is not totally useless (though I still think some of it is.)I would give this book 6 stars if it could tell me which interpretation of QM is correct. Unfortunately nobody can do that yet. But at least people are actively studying the problem again.My favorite part is probably the appendix where he works through an experiment and shows how it is interpreted in the Copenhagen interpretation as well as three other interpretations. In CI, it appears like magic is happening. In all others, it is still weird, but much less so."
15,0465096050,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8101737-peter-tillman,3,"This is a pretty good science-history account of the birth and progress of quantum physics in the early to mid 2oth century. It's not riveting reading, but I learned a fair amount about some of the scientists working in the field, and the zeitgeist in Europe then. Especially memorable was the mid-1930s, when Hitler came to power and promptly fired all the Jewish scientists in German (and later, other) universities. What a foolish move on his part, and what a bonanza of scientific talent for America and the West! (And far worse was to come . . .) Max Planck tried to reason with the new Chancellor, telling him how much damage he would do to German science. Hitler practically foamed at the mouth, and snapped ""Then we shall have to do without science for a few years!"" How fortunate for the (soon to be) Allies that Hitler was no better as a Commander in Chief. Though he did ample damage before his defeat. . . But I digress.Particularly interesting was the account of the career of Niels Bohr, who mumbled at seminars and wrote scientific papers so rambling and opaque that no one else seemed to really understand him. Yet he remained an icon of 20th century physics. And he was capable of great kindness, as when he told Enrico Fermi that he was certain to get the Nobel prize (and US$ 1 million) in the near future. Fermi and family were more than ready to move out of Fascist Italy, as Hitler's anti-Jew campaign was being pressed there too. Fermi asked for the Prize that year (1938), took his family to Stockholm for the ceremony, and never looked back. When Fermi arrived in the US, he immediately began work on nuclear fission, and helped build the world's first nuclear reactor. He became a key scientist for the Manhattan Project, and has been called the ""architect of the nuclear age."" Other scientists at Los Alamos were in awe of his quick thinking and scientific abilities. Good thing the Nazis and Fascists ran him off, eh?I'd read more of the book, but it's already overdue, and I have so many others lined up on the shelf, competing for my attention.

16,0465096050,http://goodreads.com/user/show/105482-ari,5,"Quantum mechanics is one of the most solid, well-tested parts of physics. Everybody (at least, everybody relevant to this book) agrees how to use quantum mechanics to do things like predict the behavior of semiconductors and molecular bonds. But not everybody agrees on what the theory ""means"" -- what sorts of things exist in the universe and so forth.This is not a tightly focused book. Instead of stating a claim and then proving it, the reader is treated to a loosely chronological discussion of the history of interpretation of quantum mechanics, with long biographical, philosophical, and technical asides. A knowledgeable reader may find themselves skimming a lot. While the book lacks academic crispness, it does have a full machinery of notes and references, and an academic reader shouldn't have any trouble putting it in the context of the relevant professional literature. The book has a few controversial claims at its core: Becker argues that the ""Copenhagen interpretation"" is a mishmash of slogans that lack coherence, and that cannot even be applied without some tacit notion of what qualifies as a measurement. Becker reconstructs the Bohr-Einstein debates and shows that Bohr largely missed the point Einstein was making: Bohr managed to vindicate the uncertainty principle, but Einstein was bothered by nonlocality, not uncertainty. It happens that the universe really is non-local, as Bell showed, but that is strange and alarming and should be acknowledged squarely and not hidden in talk of waveness or particle-ness.I should summarize the problem that interpretations of quantum mechanics address.In quantum mechanics, there's a rule that describes how a system evolves, called the wave equation. The {Schroedinger, Dirac} wave function is deterministic, continuous, and it assigns a certain amplitude to every point in space: it says ""there is this much electron at this point,"" where the amount of electron is a complex number. There is also a rule (the Born Rule) that says that if you do a measurement, the chance of finding a particle at a given point is squared amplitude of the wave function at that point. The Born Rule is probabilistic and discontinuous. A big part of the problem of interpreting quantum mechanics is to explain how those pieces fit together.Most physics books will tell you that ""the standard interpretation is the Copenhagen Interpretation, worked out by Bohr et al, and it goes like this..."" As Becker shows, however, there isn't any real agreement about what the Copenhagen interpretation actually says. There is a whole set of claims that get lumped together under that label -- and these claims are distinct and sometimes incompatible. There is a Copenhageny mood or style, not a clear interpretation. Bohr personally was both very charismatic, widely respected, and highly obscure. This made it easy for different people to offer distinct views while sincerely or otherwise ascribing them to Bohr.All those confusing and quasi-mystical explanations -- ""particles are sometimes waves and sometimes particles but you can't see both at once"", ""wave functions collapse after measurement"", etc are all Copenhagen-ish tropes. Bohr talked that way and was avowedly mystical about it. And ""consciousness causes collapse"" was floated by ultra-respectable hard-headed physicist and Nobellist Eugene Wigner; even von Neumann might have inclined to that view.Disclaimer: Adam is a classmate and friend of mine -- I'm in the acknowledgements -- I went into this book highly sympathetic to his view. I am not a physicist, but have done considerable reading and coursework related to the physics, philosophy, and history in this book; I'm not quite an expert but was already aware of most of the facts."
17,0465096050,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1639329-erik,4,"In his book Superintelligence, philosopher Nick Bostrom tells a story about an evolutionary algorithm tasked with designing an efficient oscillator. After running through many generations, it eventually presented a “solution” with a strange absence: it had no power source!At first, the engineers declared the design a failure. Upon closer examination, however, they discovered the algorithm had reconfigured its circuit board into a makeshift radio receiver to pick up oscillating signals from nearby lab computers. The circuit then amplified this signal to produce the desired oscillation pattern. It was a solution that certainly worked… but only at that exact location in those exact circumstances.This is an interesting story because it reveals an opaqueness that’s already becoming a major issue in the type of ‘black box’ machine learning that’s become popular recently. Because neural network deep learning or genetic algorithms aren’t ‘rule-based’ like the old expert systems were, their solutions are often beyond the understanding of those who created them. Which is a little worrying. Sure, it’s no big deal that AlphaGo is much better at Go than any of its designers - Go is just a game - but what about future black-box AIs that design governments or medicines - or new laws of physics?In a way, that last one is already true. If you’re not familiar with it already, go read the wikipedia article on Schrodinger’s Equation. It’s very clear it’s a mathematical trick that is quantitatively accurate, but provides almost no qualitative explanation. Indeed, the article admits as much: The Schrödinger equation provides a way to calculate the wave function of a system and how it changes dynamically in time. However, the Schrödinger equation does not directly say what, exactly, the wave function is. What a remarkable state of affairs that is! We don’t even know what it is we’re calculating the values of! It’d be like if I handed you a phone and asked, “How many grozoiacs is this?” You did some math and found the phone was 19.3 grozoiacs. On the basis of that calculation, we knew the phone required 70 watts of power. But… wtf is a grozoiac?And of course, there’s the strange relationship between the equation and waveform collapse caused by a ‘measurement’ or an ‘observation.’ No one actually seems to know what exactly those words mean either. As John Bell asked, “Was the wave function waiting to [collapse] for thousands of millions of years until a single-celled living creature appeared? Or did it have to wait a little longer for some highly qualified measurer - with a PhD?”That’s what I mean about physics already being opaque. In a way, quantum mechanics is like a black-box AI system that serves up accurate calculations but whose inner workings remain mysterious.That’s the core idea explored in What is Real?: this weird tension between how incredibly accurate and useful Quantum Mechanics is and how it nevertheless doesn’t seem to help us understand anything.Now, there’s two sides to this book. On one hand, it’s a tome of science history. I have nothing but good to say about this aspect. It’s exhaustively researched and gives a real sense of being ‘in the room’ with physics greats like Niels Bohr and Albert Einstein. While I found myself a little disillusioned to see these scientific luminaries engage in petty tribalism and stubborn close-mindedness (fool that I am, I expected better), I nevertheless thoroughly enjoyed getting to know these legends more as humans than as mere names attached to equations. And I really do think learning WHERE and HOW equations came about actually assists in understanding them.For example, when I first learned Schrodinger’s Equation, it felt so different than previous math theories and equations. Honestly, for the longest time, I thought I just didn’t get it. I could do the math, but I didn’t know what it meant or how it worked. It felt like magic. Well, after reading this book, it’s clear the very people who created it, didn’t get it either. Knowing that, I see I was pondering the equation in the wrong way. I was trying to decipher a hidden meaning that I thought already existed, when my task should have been more about creating a hidden meaning that has not yet been found.Now I do have some issues with this book. Because, in addition to being a science history, there is a second side: an argument against the Copenhagen Interpretation and its underlying philosophy of logical positivism. While I’m sympathetic to that aim, I was less impressed by how the author went about it.As a quick summary, the Copenhagen Interpretation essentially draws a sharp line between the ‘quantum world’ (if it even admits that such a thing exists) and the ‘classical world’ (the macroscopic world that we inhabit). In this interpretation, quantum systems don’t really have definite, deterministic states UNTIL they are ‘observed’ or ‘measured.’As I briefly mentioned above, there’s quite a few problems with this interpretation, which is why Einstein himself disliked it. What constitutes a measurement or observation? And is there really such a distinction between the quantum world and the classical world? All objects - a cup, you, me, a measuring device - are themselves made up of quantum particles. Shouldn’t that make them subject to the rules of quantum mechanics too?What is Real? explores these problems in great depth and vivacity, and I’m completely on board in seeing the Copenhagen Interpretation as a flawed or incomplete interpretation that needs to be evolved. However, as I said, I was less impressed with how the author went about making this argument. In particular, he seems to fall into two very common philosophy traps:Major Flaw #1: AbsolutismExtreme skepticism is a hallmark of philosophy. Rene Descartes’ famous Cogito Ergo Sum (I think, therefore I am) represents the only absolutely true statement he thought he could say, at least to begin with. Because he’s thinking, he knows he exists in some form. But everything else? Uncertain. Every sense experience he has might be the result of a deception by some demon. This type of radical skepticism is not only not rare in philosophy, I’d say it’s the norm. To a great many philosophers and thinkers (including, apparently, the writer of this book), unless you can be 100% absolutely certain about something, then you should treat it with absolute skepticism. This is what I call Absolutism, and I find it an entirely ludicrous stance to take, ill-suited to practicing useful philosophy or thought.Consider this passage from the book, which purports to counter the falsification/verification ideas of Karl Popper and logical positivism (that is, that any good scientific theory should be able to be proven wrong): Looking out your window and saying, “It’s raining outside” [would be foolish because it] assumes that your view through the window’s glass gives you an accurate picture of the outside world, and that your eyes are functioning properly, and that the dimmed light and falling droplets are in fact caused by a rain cloud and not an alien spaceship blotting out the Sun and dropping some exotic substance onto your front lawn.Is this a reasonable stance to take?Sure, it’s possible that my window has suddenly become a TV screen or that - despite there never being an alien spaceship before - there suddenly is one now, but if quantum mechanics has given us any one lesson to be applied to normal life, it’s that the question shouldn’t be “is it possible?” but rather “is it probable?”Indeed, the great skeptic David Hume himself acknowledged the silliness of extreme skepticism when he invoked his ‘problem of induction’: just because something happened in the past doesn’t mean it will continue to happen in the future. Because of this, it is actually impossible to state anything with 100% certainty. Therefore, extreme skepticism is simply not a valid approach to philosophy or science.In the final chapter, the author laments - a sadness I share - the disrespect modern scientists such as Stephen Hawking have for philosophy. But is it any wonder they do so, when philosophers seriously suggest that we ought to be skeptical that the raindrops we see and feel are even real?Major Flaw #2: One-sided PragmatismThis is a rhetorical fallacy I witness often. It’s a form of ‘moving the goalposts’, in which a person makes an argument rooted in pragmatism (i.e. that we’re interested in an idea’s practical effects upon ourselves and the world rather than any inherent truth or reality) without considering the pragmatic arguments of the other side. It’s kinda like if my opponent and I are playing a game of tennis, but right in the middle of it, I run off the court and onto a basketball court and slam dunk the ball and say, “Booya, I just won.” It’s like well… that wasn’t the game we were even playing…?Let me give an example. Suppose I’m arguing about the truth claims of religion. Let’s say, Christianity. I say something like, Well we have all these dinosaur fossils. Why aren’t dinosaurs mentioned in Genesis? Did God just accidentally leave that whole epoch out, in His account of the creation of Earth? If He did, or if we must pretend He didn’t by taking a metaphorical approach, doesn’t that constitute a serious flaw in the Bible?To which a Christian might respond, Well, you know what? Sure there’s some mysteries, but it doesn’t matter. I don’t want to live in a universe in which there isn’t a God, where it’s all just chaos. Believing in God gives me purpose in life. It makes me feel good.This is what I mean about one-sided pragmatism. To avoid the issue, the Christian switched to a pragmatic argument that would be, of course, easily countered by an opposing pragmatic argument: Do you really want to live in a universe created and managed by a God who failed the (relatively) simple task of writing an accurate book?Well the author of What Is Real? does this very thing. He makes various pragmatic arguments about opposing the Copenhagen interpretation & logical positivism not necessarily because they are more true but because diversity of perspective has pragmatically positive outcomes.Which I don’t disagree with. But nowhere does the author then discuss the pragmatic positives of the Copenhagen Interpretation, logical positivism, and the ‘shut up and calculate’ approach to doing physics: they grant peace to the pursuit of science.I sometimes say that one of the big differences between science and almost everything else is that science offers a means of resolving a dispute without resorting to violence.If I say the universe was created by the flying spaghetti monster and you say the universe was created by Yahweh, how can we resolve this dispute? Or if I say that Republicans are ruining the US and you say that Democrats are ruining it, is there any mathematical process or conclusive evidence we can offer to prove our side correct? Well, no. Both of those situations are rooted in natural language, which is rife with ambiguity. As such, there really is no way to resolve our dispute, except by some form of violence.But that isn’t the case with science - at least science when restricted by a logical positivist or instrumentalist perspective. If I claim the Many-worlds Interpretation is correct and you claim the Bohm pilot-wave theory is correct, we actually do have a non-violent means of resolving our dispute. We go to the math and say, Which one of these makes accurate predictions? If they are both equally accurate, then - functionally speaking - there is no difference. We’re both correct, we’re both accurate, until such time as the experimentally testable predictions of our theories diverge.But again, that’s only within a logical positivist perspective. A scientific realist perspective - which the author advocates and which holds that science should NOT merely be limited to math and experimental verification - has a weakness in this regard. From a realist’s perspective, there IS a difference between the pilot-wave theory and many-worlds interpretation, and only one of us can be correct. But since I’ve not restricted my perspective to what can be mathematically, experimentally verifiable, then what means do we have to resolve our dispute?Well, none.Now of course I’m not suggesting that ‘realist’ scientists with competing theories are running around bashing each other with canes or maces, as politicians and zealots are wont to do. But there is something to be said about nurturing a perspective that says we should do our best to restrict our view of the world only to what we can verify and for everything else, let us admit our ignorance.To conclude, I quite liked this book. I’m a firm believer that living in the universe without understanding physics or math is like living in France without being able to speak French. Sure you can get along just fine… but what beauty, what clarity, what meaning will you be missing? In that respect, I consider this book - flaws and all - nothing less than a primer for the Universe, at least as we currently understand it. If you’re at all sympathetic to that perspective, then you’ll probably enjoy What is Real? too.[Note: Though I use the word 'math' a lot in my review, this book doesn't actually contain any and you don't need any to enjoy or understand it]"
18,0465096050,http://goodreads.com/user/show/30020229-seth-benzell,3,"I am ambivalent about this book. On the one hand, I nearly put the book down a few chapters in. The early material about the initial development of quantum theory was all old news to me, covered (better) in books like ``Thirty Years Which Shook Physics."" The actual mechanics of quantum theory are not covered in depth. The only part of this book I felt was novel was the details of how central Bohr was to how QM is thought about.The book's novelty for me starts about halfway in, after WWII. The discussion of how alternatives to the Copenhagen Interpretation arose and were suppressed is compelling and provocative. The discussion of why the 'Measurement Problem' is indeed a problem is very well articulated. The social science in the background-- which posits that government funding (which favored 'shut up and calculate' pragmatism), path dependence, Bohr's network centrality -- are all interesting hypotheses that point to both the 'incommensurablity' of different paradigms as well as the role of the political and social in the development of science. I wish the author had speculated on how lessons we learn from this history might help us to do better science in the future.The book also has very good, if perhaps too extreme, takedowns of logical positivism and verificationism. I agree that they are inadequate (logical positivism is on its face an oxymoron, and 'the decisive experiment'-- as pointed out by 'Two Dogmas'-- can always be dodged by the modification of ancillary hypotheses), but do think they have something to say. One difference between science and non-science is testable prediction (if not the only difference), if not the only one. The example used in the book -- of heliocentrism being observationally equivalent to ptolemyic astronomy -- was only true temporarily. Foundations of Physics, then, might be thought of as proto- or pre- science, until it is able to generate predictions different from Copenhagen. As an alternative to LP and verificationism, the author proposes a very vague demarcation principle -- one so broad (i.e. science 'tries to integrate distinct knowledges into a unified theory') that I think astrology or theology fit snugly. His more practical demarcation, that e.g. religious groups 'aren't really interested in scientific truth' is inadequate philosophically, because as he points out normal science is often motivated by things outside real science. The author just seems to assume Scientific Realism as true (claiming that this is the consensus of philosophers of science, and painting all continental philosophers' opinions as being prima facie not relevant for some reason; dissing Kuhn for not being sufficiently realist). This is a position I lean towards as well, but needs to be actually argued against a idealist stance (although I think he does well arguing against the instrumentalist stance -- does that term appear? -- in his takedown of positivism). Finally the book's actually descriptions of quantum riddles -- such as Bell's Thm -- were adequate but still left me with lots of questions. His first appendix -- explaining the 'delayed choice' experiment through 4 different QM interpretations -- also left me looking for clarification. I would also have appreciated more discussion of actual attempts to test different interpretations -- doesn't Deutch have one for many worlds he pushes?Overall recommended to someone interested in philosophy of science. ""Beginning of Infinity"" I would recommend first though. "
19,0465096050,http://goodreads.com/user/show/36489698-r-nair,5,"Terrific work not only on the history of quantum mechanics but also the dogmatic influence of Bohr's Copenhagen interpretation of Quantum mechanics on Physics. This book really delves into how physicists correctly pointing out the problems within the Copenhagen interpretation were not taken seriously for decades based purely on blind faith that reality could not be explained within the Quantum mechanical framework. The 'shut-up and calculate' paradigm has been the workhorse of physics for such a long time that actual philosophy has been pushed out of mainstream physics as almost pseudoscience. Incidentally the last time such foundational questions about the meaning of reality in quantum mechanics were raised, it was by physicists like Albert Einstein who had had a solid education in philosophical thought. This book is reminiscent of Manjit Kumar's well written  Quantum: Einstein, Bohr and the Great Debate About the Nature of Reality but more updated and so far, having the best explanation of Bell's theorem and its significance to modern physics for the layman in recent times that I have come across. Having read this in conjunction with Anil Ananthaswamy's  Through Two Doors at Once: The Elegant Experiment That Captures the Enigma of Our Quantum Reality only enhanced the practical aspects of the complex experiments referred to in this book. This book also deals with Bohmian mechanics (Pilot wave theory), Spontaneous collapse theories and the Many worlds interpretation of quantum mechanics very well."
20,0465096050,http://goodreads.com/user/show/14180908-adrian-buck,4,"Niels Bohr, famous for the lack of clarity in his use of words, once suggested that clarity was complementary to truth; this suggests the clearer a statement is the less true it is, and the truer a statement is the less clear it is. Becker is a very clear writer: I was surprised that I was able to read a book on quantum physics so fluently. The way that Becker has done this without peddling us a load of falsehoods, is by not writing about quantum physics as such, but by writing a book about the historical and philosophical conditions in which quantum mechanics was developed. He has also eliminated all the equations and much of the philosophical argument from his account. This probably made it much easier for me to read, I studied philosophy at college, and wish I studied history. But I'm feeling short changed on the physics front. Becker wants to argue that although the majority of researchers working in quantum physics are happy to accept the Copenhagen Interpretation of the meaning of quantum mechanics, they shouldn't be: the Copenhagen Interpretation has stopped the development of physics and the discovery of quantum relativity - the theory of everything. He argues that this situation came about for three main reasons:-	The influence of Logical Positivism on the development of quantum theory-	Complacency about Neumann’s proof the of Copenhagen Interpretation-	Government funding of quantum research that isn’t interested in the foundations of quantum theoryI would like my review to offer a succinct definition of the Copenhagen Interpretation but find that on reading and understanding ‘What is real?’ I am unable to do so. In Becker’s defence he does suggest that the Copenhagen Interpretation is a bit of a cover up term, alluding to how the initial generation quantum physicists understood their own work with and around Niels Bohr at the University of Copenhagen’s Institute of Theoretical Physics. A term later coined and promoted by Werner Heisenberg to distract people from what he did during the war. Becker suggests a key element of the Copenhagen Interpretation is that physics doesn’t actually have to explain the nature of quantum reality. He argues that under the influence of Logical Positivism, the early quantum physicists believed that science's job was to merely account for observable phenomena, not to explain how the ‘real’ nature of the ‘objects’ that cause that behaviour. Interestingly Bohr was not a logical positivist, but a Kantian and as such was open to the idea of a idealist metaphysics. I like Kant and would have liked to see a Kantian discussion of quantum physics. A Kantian for example could argue not that the reality of quantum objects is not outside the remit of science, but it outside the 'Bounds of Sense' a non-empirical world which we cannot subsume under the concepts of our understanding: a theory of everything will always lie outside the realm of empirical knowledge. Despite the absence of reality from the Copenhagen Interpretation, another reason that the majority of scientists are happy to accept it is because they believe that John von Neumann mathematically proved that the Copenhagen Interpretation is not only true, but the only one possible. But Becker argues not only that Neumann's proof is wrong, but foolish, and to add further insult a mere girl had shown it as such way back in 1935, of course the girl was ignored because male chauvinism, and the quantum research world had to wait until 1966 when John Bell put them straight. Wow! Suddenly, reading this book was no mere exercise in curiosity - I had skin in the game.I teach British and American Civilisation in a Hungarian secondary school, one of the topics I have to cover is Hungarians that have contributed to the civilisation of the UK or US, so I cover John von Neumann. I teach my kids about his contribution to quantum mechanics, this is what I tell them:""Neumann’s work in Germany with David Hilbert culminated in his book 'The Mathematical Foundations of Quantum Mechanics' (1932), which reconciled the apparently contradictory theories of Erwin Schrödinger and Werner Heisenberg. It concluded that quantum phenomena really were indeterminate, not the result of as yet undiscovered deterministic physics. This convinced most physicists to accept the indeterminacy of the quantum world. Albert Einstein, however, refused to abandon his belief in determinism, insisting that “God does not play dice.""""Having read ""What is real?"" I have some problems with my own teaching materials. Most immediately, the meaning of 'indeterminate'. In the context of Einstein's 'dice' quotation, this seems to mean unpredictable. Another meaning of indeterminate is unmeasurable, and the measurement problem, unlike the random nature of quantum processes, is given much discussion in this book. Unfortunately understanding the measurement problem involves understanding the Schrödinger equation which gives rise to it, and that equation - like all others - although oft alluded to doesn't make it onto the page. This certainly makes it easier to read, but doesn't leave me in a position to correct my own teaching materials. My professional issues aside, the status of Neumann's proof is not adequately established in the book. Although described as failed, flawed and foolish, I can't say why: to do so would probably involve getting - again - some equations on the page, explaining what they mean and pointing out the errors in them. But then things would quickly get pretty murky pretty quickly. Becker moves on, concluding that Einstein's real problem was actually with the nonlocality - action at a 'spooky' distance - inherent in quantum mechanics, rather than the indeterminacy. The real thrust of the book is that the Copenhagen Interpretation needs to be replaced with a metaphysics that makes sense of the quantum world. Becker’s observations about the effort of Government Research funding on the development of quantum physics are indisputable, he makes a nice comparison with quantum research in Nazi Germany and the Soviet Union. Thank God for America. Becker concludes that to make progress in their science again, Physicists need to return to Philosophy, I'm not so sure. Kant's Critique of Pure Reason was expressly developed to epistemologically underwrite the classical world of Newtonian physics: i.e. the science came first, the philosophy later. Quantum physics is yet to find its Kant. But philosophical underpinnings, Kantian or Positivist seem to hold physics up as much spur it on. What physicists really need to do is come up with experimental ideas that test their theories, Bell showed this. In that the experimental demonstration on nonlocality in quantum physics is the big thing I learned from this book. Interestingly the result is a physically distribution of photons that are not reflect what we would expect to find statistically if locality was true. The use of statistics to produce the result is interesting to me. When I was introduced to quantum physics in Advanced Physics and Chemistry at secondary school, I remember not being phased by the unpredictable nature of particles at the quantum level, because of the very large numbers of particles involved at the classical level. At the time I was also studying statistics, and we used the idea of approximate distributions, when very large numbers are involved, the (discrete) binomial distribution begins to look like the (continuous) normal distribution. When very large numbers of random quantum behaviours are aggregated the result is indistinguishable from classical behaviour. I've never seen the need for a boundary between quantum and classical worlds. We live in a quantum world that is usually classical, the difference is merely one of scale."
21,0465096050,http://goodreads.com/user/show/180643-jim-coughenour,4,"One of the grand narratives of the 20th century is the history of physics – the elucidation of relativity by Einstein and the subsequent development of quantum physics by Bohr, Heisenberg, Schroedinger et al. Richard Rhodes provides a superlative account in The Making of the Atomic Bomb, but there is a wealth to choose from, and I seem to pick up one or another of these histories every year because I enjoy the story so much. Becker’s book is something different, more serious despite its sometimes jocular tone. He argues that many physicists have surrendered the search for the nature of reality, accepting an interpretation of quantum physics that works astonishingly well in practice but is fundamentally obscure, if not mistaken.I won’t summarize the argument: if you’ve read this far you’ve probably already decided if this is your kind of book or not. For those who might be interested I’ll just say that Becker tells the standard story differently. Neils Bohr, treated as a secular saint by virtually everyone, is less winning here, and Heisenberg doesn’t get the usual pass for his activities during World War II. Einstein is treated as more perceptive than his challengers (he’s usually characterized as an old genius who can’t accept the fabled uncertainty of quantum reality). Even more interesting is the cast of characters Becker introduces from what was once the fringe of physics: David Bohm, Hugh Everett, and John Stewart Bell. Bohm and Bell have long fascinated me – Bohm for his theory of pilot waves and the “implicate order,” Bell for his theory of entanglement. I’d never heard of Everett, who is quite a character. In Becker’s account Bohr’s “Copenhagen interpretation” is a “tranquilizing philosophy,” an orthodoxy of dubious merit, and its doubters and heretics are punished by the faithful. Bright young physicists suffer from asking the wrong questions – Becker brings a few of their stories to life.It’s a fascinating story, presented in terms a non-scientist can understand. Given Becker’s perspective, I’d expect some harsh reviews from other side of the debate. It demonstrates that long-standing philosophical questions endure, that clarity and honesty require responsibility and courage, and that the world is stranger than we think even when we make a fetish of its strangeness."
22,0465096050,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1717479-terry,3,"This book is a consideration on the failures of the Copenhagen interpretation of quantum mechanics and the difficulties in advancing a science without a model. The Copenhagen interpretation states that quantum states collapse when a measurement is made but seemingly every word in that description is open to interpretation. The messiest being the word ""measurement"". What counts as a measurement or observation or interaction? If large systems are built of quantum mechanical systems and measurements involve the interaction of a large and a small system isn't that just a set of quantum interactions. The Copenhagen interpretation received the seal of approval from John Von Neumann and few people bothered to think about quantum foundations again. This book follows those who didn't just accept the Copenhagen interpretation.  The models discussed are pilot wave, Bohmian QM, Everett or many worlds, and random collapse. The preponderance of time is spent on the personalities and how science is viewed and comparatively less on the theories themselves. All address questions that the Copenhagen interpretation fails on. The final section of the book is a consideration of the view of physicists on the philosophy of science and how wildly uneducated many big name physicists are regarding how important interpretation is. Overall the book is enjoyable. I'd have preferred more information on theories as well as their implications and any possibilities to test them but eh, that may be suited for another text. The book dwells extensively on Niels Bohr and his cult of personality, which, while important, took up more space than was necessary.  If you're more curious about the interpretation of quantum mechanics than merely just learning about its weirdness, this is a good start."

25,0465096050,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4651295-jason-furman,5,"An excellent book that does not answer the title question—but is mostly convincing that the question is worth asking and that we can make scientific progress in addressing it. The book is well written with an interspersing of human stories, scientific description, and Becker’s own more original analysis/arguments/interpretation of the historical field of “quantum foundations”, which is to say understanding what the weird equations of quantum mechanics mean.Unlike most histories of science, Adam Becker’s book in some ways is about failure and going badly off track not success. Specifically, the failure of physicists to think seriously about the origins and meanings of quantum mechanics, the marginalization of those who tried to, and the problems that come from physicists acting as amateur philosophers without being aware of major developments in philosophy (like realism overcoming logical positivism/empiricism).Adam Becker borders on scathing on Bohr and the circle’s around him’s devleopment of what came to be called the “Copenhagen Interpretation” of quantum mechanics. The interpretation centered around probabilistic waves becoming deterministic particles when they are somehow measured by a measuring apparatus that is itself deterministic. In effect, they were assuming that classical mechanics applied to large objects but quantum mechanics to small ones. And more to the point, they were taking an attitude that has been described as “shut up and calculate.”Becker has four arguments against the Copenhagen interpretation: (i) that it was actually a lot of different interpretations by a lot of different people and never actually a single interpretation; (ii) that all of these failed basic tests of logical consistency; (iii) that all of this was reinforced by Bohr’s charisma and his circle’s antagonism to challenging the intreptation; and (iv) that this is consequential because it inhibits the devlopment of new scientific questions and potential experiments.Becker then develops some of the alternative interpretations at great length together with mini-biograophies and descriptions of the process of discovery, placing the most emphasis on Bohm’s deterministic pilot waves idea, Everett’s Many Worlds hypothesis and Bell’s inequality. He then rushes briefly through some other ideas towards the end of the book, including superdeterminism, and information theory.The biographies he tells of these scientists—including Bohr’s exile to Brazil, Everett’s greater interest in drinking/womanizing than in physics, and Bell publishing in a random journal rather than a top one—is not just ancillary entertainment but a core part of the argument. Most science stories are about progress and triumph. This one is to some degree about contingency and chance and the ways it can lead science astray. Bohr’s charisma vs. the problems of the alternative messengers are treated as historical accidents that affected the ability to have a more full debate/research program on the foundations of quantum mechanics. When this was combined with incentives (e.g., all the funding for physics coming from the military) the effects were powerful.One strength of Becker’s book is his serious intergration of analytic philosophy, his excellent explanations of it, and his relating this to developments in quantum mechanics. He takes the reader through the establishment of logical positivism/empiricism/falsifiability as theories, shows how they were linked to/supported the Copenhagen interpretation, but then shows how these theories have since been superseded in philosophy by a recognition that you cannot just limit yourself to testing empirical predictions but have to embed these tests in a broader theory of underlying reality. Becker is very critical of physicists who are still in a positivist mold which he views as being unaware of the last 50 years of developments in analytical philosophy.Becker’s book leaves me partially convinced by his conclusion but only partially. He is convincing that the Copenhagen interpretation is wrong/incoherent but is less convincing about the utility of developing alternatives. The proliferation of so many alternatives, the inability to decide between them, and the lack of any large convincing progresss that came out their development leave me wondering whether their marginalization is a self-fulfilling prophecy or maybe inherent in their approach. That said, given uncertainty about where/how we will make scientific progress continuing along the path of better understanding the reality underlying the weirdness of quantum mechanics seems like a worthwhile activity for at least a small fraction of physicists—and Becker is completely convincing that outdated philosophy and internally inconsistent arguments should not be used to deter these investigations."
26,0465096050,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7644121-scott-schlotfelt,2,"This isn't a bad book. It's just poorly titled. The title should have been ""The History and Hidden Politics Behind Quantum Physics."" That title won't sell books though. It seems to me that the publisher had a conversation with the author and said, ""Let's call it 'What Is Real?' It will be intriguing and will broaden your audience so that more people will buy it. The author agreed and at the tail end of the book, figured he should probably go ahead and address this ""What Is Real?"" question so he tacked on the last two pages (literally, I'm pretty sure that's the only time he addressed that question).Understand, I am not a physics genius in any way, shape or form. The book did give a good overview of the evolution of thought in quantum physics over the last 100 years so that I had a better understanding. I learned that there have been two schools of thought in quantum physics that have been highly influenced by politics among scientists and how the science got supported by the government or universities. I'm not sure what I was expecting from this book but I definitely didn't expect it to really read like a history book. Only in the last chapter does the author address more of what quantum physics (or foundations?) means for everyday life and ponder some of the larger questions. Also, if you are thinking that this book will even mildly entertain theories by Deepak Chopra (whom I haven't studied enough to have an informed opinion) or his ilk with regard to how quantum physics could be influencing the mind, the body, the spirit, etc., don't bother. Chopra is essentially lumped in with the other, as the author puts it, ""quantum health-care scams."" I find it interesting that for most of the book, the author subtly defends scientists who were willing to entertain what used to be considered pseudo-science and then turns around to quickly criticize what is considered pseudo-science today. Seemed a little hypocritical.Again, great book if you're interested in the history of quantum thought. Retitle it please!"

This is the popsci book I've been waiting for. Most books of this type take way too long detailing the history of physics and then don't have much steam or space left to talk about recent advances in the field, like quantum physics. This book does the opposite of that. It jumps right in, devoting most of its pages to the many interpretations of the quantum world (the... many worlds... you could say +bah dum tiss+), as well as the characters and politics that shaped them. It also does a great service to philosophy which has been horribly belittled and greatly neglected in recent years by many popular science personalities which I will not namedrop here.

But it's so much more in ways I did not anticipate.It is a redemption of Albert Einstein who, the common lore (even among physicists) would have us know, has lost touch as he got older and never really accepted the strange reality of the quantum physics despite his early contributions to the field. That view is at best wildly distorted.It is a story of Niels Bohr, who's cult of personality gathered a mysticism and following that resulted in arguably the most embarrassing chapter in modern science. Their dogmatic views (summed up as the Copenhagen Interpretation) prevented physicists to probe deep into the foundations of quantum physics and our universe.Anyone who tried to understand what was actually going on would face ridicule, risk losing their job (or not being able to find one after they graduated) and would not be able to get their papers published. Even a mere association with someone questioning the dogma was risky to one's career.Questioning the status quo, trying to look for alternative interpretations, coming up with experiments that can show us holes in the current understanding are at the core of science. And yet, this pushback against even the slightest rocking of the boat was going on for several decades.Pushback that was perpetuated by extremely talented people. You'd have an easier time counting who *didn't* get a Nobel Price in the book's cast of characters. Indeed, it may be because of the unprecedented success in prediction and precision of the quantum theory that people were told to ""shut up and calculate"", killing any enquiries about the nature of the field and how it relates to our world.It is also, tragically, a story of the second World War and its disruption in the scientific field. In the thirties, the American physics was seriously behind and the vast majority of the research was going on in Berlin, Vienna and Copenhagen. A lot of that by scientists who were either of Jewish origin or who had a Jewish spouse.Hitler's anti-semitism played a large role in the quantum physics research leaving central Europe and the first atomic bomb being developed in the USA.Even though the book pushes hard against the Copenhagen interpretation and the behaviour surrounding the dogmatic positions at the time, I find it is fair to all the people involved. All of these people were brilliant scientists and that is not dismissed here.It would for example be easy to paint Niels Bohr as the villain of the story, but in addition to his undeniable contributions to physics, he was helping Jewish scientists by finding them jobs, financial help and helping them leave their countries that were about to arrest them. Other than Hitler, there are no villains here, just multi-faceted people.What is Real is a fascinating account of the physics in the last hundred years. It also made me really frustrated and often quite angry. You don't need to really know any physics to get the same out of it. It is beautifully written and I could not put it down."

Schrödinger’s cat or collapse of Quantum Wave function when a measurement is made. So the cat is neither dead or alive before measurement, but once an observation is made it has to settle in either of one state. Bohr received a Nobel prize for discovering the different energy states (quanta) of electrons in an atom. Together with Planck and Einstein, quantum theory was born. When Schrödinger discovered the wave equation, it correctly predicted the probabilistic position of the electron in an hydrogen atom. Heisenberg later discovered his uncertainty principle and then together with Bohr built the Copenhagen interpretation: ‘Shut up and calculate’. They posited that quantum theory cannot be understood the way that we experience every day life, and is only a useful equation for accurate prediction of every day effects. This infuriated many nonconformist physicists!Einstein, Podolsy and Rosen published a paper about entanglement, the paradox that entangled particles can transmit information faster than the speed of light. ‘Spooky actions at a distance’. Recent experiments seem to confirm this. Bohm suggested a pilot wave theory that helped explain the dual wave particle nature of electrons during a double slit experiment: the presence of a detector changed the wave interference pattern of the electron! It is interesting to know that Heisenberg supported Nazi Germany, while his mentor Bohr and Einstein had to flee Germany because of their Jewish lineage. That however prevented Germany from developing the atomic bomb first, since Heisenberg was a lousy practical physicist. Bohm’s theory aaa not well accepted because he was a communist. Everett suggested that wave functions do not collapse and there are actually infinite worlds. So is the cat dead or alive? Bohr says don’t ask. Everett says both but in different worlds. I am still confused. This is a great book about Quantum physics, I am sure I misunderstand large parts of it, but still learn a lot from it. "

At the heart of quantum mechanics is the ""weirdness"" summed up by Heisenberg's uncertainty principle that binds the combined accuracy with which both the position and momentum of a particle can be measured, even though the wavefunction underlying a quantum state is entirely determined by the Schrodinger equation. Most physicists rely on the Copenhagen interpretation of Quantum mechanics which separates the quantum world being measured from the classical measuring instrument and keeps the measurement process itself outside the realm of quantum mechanics. The quantum state is then interpreted as probabilistically collapsing into the measured state. This interpretation allows quantum mechanical calculations to make multiple predictions that have held up to the level of our most accurate measurements. Throughout the 20th century, the dominant view, exemplified by Richard Feynman and others, was to focus on observable and falsifiable predictions of quantum mechanics than to question whether it is complete. Einstein, Podolsky and Rosen had famously shown that Quantum mechanics is either incomplete or non-local. Although out of the mainstream, many scientists had proposed alternative interpretations of quantum mechanics to address Copenhagen's mysteries. De Broglie and Bohm developed the pilot-wave interpretation, where every particle is associated with a pilot wave, that avoids the Copenhagen collapse but introduces non-locality. Hugh Everett developed the Many Worlds interpretation where interaction between any two quantum particles leads to the creation of multiple joint wave functions in multiple universes, only one of which (the observed) is accessible to us. A third is Spontaneous Collapse in which, unlike Copenhagen, the measurement system is also a quantum object and collapse happens spontaneously, at a high probability due to the large number of quantum interactions happening when a macroscopic measurement system is used. Becker's narrative is fascinating and he is correct that insufficient attention has been paid to the fundamentals of quantum mechanics while we have reaped the benefits of its accuracy. However, it is also correct that, while intellectually illuminating, many of the alternative interpretations themselves introduce further weirdness like non-locality or are non-falsifiability. Becker is spotty when he attacks the necessity of Popperian falsifiability in a physical theory. On the one hand, it is correct that scientific progress is often inductive and grand theories are often created in retrospect to fit facts, but his central argument that a universally applied theory is falsifiable only by invoking something outside the universe itself sets too high a bar. It is often more satisfying and beneficial to keep a problem open rather than to rely on theories that do not offer measurements to falsify them. However, this is no reason not to stymie research into an area. While this book is greatly illuminating, Becker gives short shrift to the practical reasons why most physicists are more excited to work on the physics of quantum mechanics rather than its philosophical underpinnings- because physics today is a material science more than it is natural philosophy. There doesn't seem to be a conspiracy stopping research into alternatives to Copenhagen, just a preponderance of interest in testable Physics with real consequences. "
34,0465096050,http://goodreads.com/user/show/70474434-carsten,5,"Quantum Mechanics is one of the foundations of physics (jointly with relativity). Its predictions have been confirmed time and time again and underpins modern technology. It has helped us to understand how the electromagnetic and the two nuclear forces work. It is a remarkable theory. But what does the mathematical formalism mean? This book tells the story how the interpretation of Quantum Mechanics has evolved over the last 90 years or so. It is a very well written book, with a lot of historical details I was not aware of. It doesn’t cover all interpretations of Quantum Mechanics (for example, the transactional interpretation is not mentioned at all, but it has not many followers). But the author describes nicely the troubles scientists went through to make sense of this remarkable theory. Of course, John Bell’s story is told, but so are the stories of David Bohm , Hugh Everett III, Heinz-Dieter Zeh (who died in April this year) and Wojciech Zurek. It is a great book. I couldn’t put it down and managed to read it in three days. Well done, Adam Becker. "

I'm particularly satisfied with it as I thought I was the the dummy for not buying into some of that Bohr's stuff. Einstein wasn't convinced either, so there's that. But then all the scientists who expresses doubts about the totally vague and convoluted theory (don't ask why it works, it just works; you can't measure it so never mind; It only happens when you're watching it; etc) were ostracized, unpublished, unemployed by universities; they had a tough go of it. Now people are actually seriously daring to question the unfathomable Niels Bohr. Interesting coverage of the theory and the controversy."

Becker includes layman's explanations of the key concepts and helpful diagrams to visualise the most complex thought experiments. The history is compellingly told; no mathematical equations in sight!As a newbie to this field, I opened this book expecting to find that quantum theory had all the answers. Instead what I've learned is that science is held back by the usual challenges of close mindedness and narrowed focus and that a philosophical approach is critical to a real understanding of the universe."

In short, it appears: there's no external reality; there is a an external reality, but it's bizarre in one or more of any number of ways (depending on specific theory you subscribe to); or there are infinitely many external realities, only one of which I have access to as I type this review (and an infinite number of fellow me's, in an infinity of other worlds, do more or less the same). The author does an exceptional job of telling the history, describing the science, and explaining both the related sociology and philosophy of science, and why it all matters. I've long been fascinated by the subject matter of this book, and have read numerous popular treatments of it. WIR ranks among the finest. I recommend it highly."
40,0465096050,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5917740-nilesh,5,"What is Real is a masterpiece in the way it narrates the quest to find the meaning behind the quantum equations.Quantum science works, like almost nothing else humans have ever invented. Yet, the equations that have come to define the field are impossible to interpret in human languages and in a way that our rationality could accept. It took a while for the greatest minds of the era to even suggest that the wave function is Schrodinger’s wave equation was a probability distribution. The debate took a material turn for the worse with Heisenberg’s uncertainty principle. How does everything so probabilistic theoretically and when unseen actualize into something concrete whenever observed?The book wonderfully elaborates on the details of the problem that splintered the scientific world and had the greatest human minds of all time metaphorically in arms against each other. The debates between Einstein, Bohr, Schrodinger, Pauli, Dirac, Heisenberg, De Broglie and others captivated the world even nearly a century later. After all, what was at stake boiled down to what is real!Hundreds of books wonderfully explain the debates that dominated the pre-war years including the EPR construct. Mr Becker’s work covers the same grounds competently, but cannot add to what has been exhaustively rehashed for decades.  The book’s true value is not in covering the rise of the Copenhagen interpretation, but its fall. The author makes the story of the Copenhagen decline and rise of alternative explanations as understandable, exciting, meaningful and absorbing as the rise - something few who have covered Bohm, Bell, Everett, Wheeler etc have been able to do. This is because the issues at hand turn materially more complex when one attempts to appreciate the equally groundbreaking and relevant work of these scientists. At philosophical and metaphysical levels, the war was between positivism and scientific realism and their sub-schools. Mathematically, even relativity came under pressure with the insertion, deletion and re-insertion of the cosmological constants. This was in the space which was easily narratable, but the mathematical debates kept on intensifying at every stage of the development of unification theories. For the lay folks, it appeared more like fights over the number of dimensions our reality has, their sizes and similar, but scientists disagreed on almost everything as the observations proved reality to be ever more bizarre. The book side-steps the arrival of dozens of subatomic particles and stops before the string theories begin their domination of the discussion, and this helps the book in keeping the focus on quantum reality. The author spends a lot of time on describing the scientists involved and their travesties. While this is often distracting, it helps humanize the story and provides relief to the non-technical readers from the mind-numbing intricacies of the quantum world.  The book makes the collapse of the Copenhagen and rise of Many Worlds far more definitive than it is in the scientific community. Even non-scientists would need dozens of books over the lifetime to develop a basic understanding of the still-shifting reality debates sparked by the quantum revolution. This book is one for any such a list because it focuses on a particular time-frame and a set of issues that are pivotal and not as well covered by almost anyone else."
41,0465096050,http://goodreads.com/user/show/22428213-ian-scuffling,5,"It was a bastardization of Schrödinger's cat that introduced me to the ideas of quantum physics, and since then the topic has been something that I've held deep interest in (albeit from a very amateur's view, not really digging into the nuances other than to understand the prevailing ideas)—my interest has been particularly in terms of the philosophy and existentialism inherent in the problems that the theories present to our experience of the world. To be honest, before reading Adam Becker's What is Real? I had no idea what the Copenhagen Interpretation (CI) was, much less that there was contention in the fundamental foundations of quantum physics and what significance that has for everyday ""classic"" (Newtonian) physics. Becker's book isn't just a really great primer on the material of what quantum physics is and does, but also a bountiful, if not slanted, biography of the science itself—its historical players, their public arguments, the political impacts of scientific pursuits and philosophies. I say slanted because Becker here does not even have pretenses about his feelings towards what he sees as Neils Bohr's egotistical ironclad grip on developing physics students minds and dispositions towards quantum physics and how it's to be seen simply as a mathematical ""world"" separate from the Newtonian ""classic"" world we experience. That is, it's not an observable state, so therefore it's simply a mathematical understanding of particle physics that doesn't necessarily mean something about how we experience or understand the physical realms.Becker, in his biases, however, lays out a compelling and seemingly pat philosophical reasoning for giving more credence to thinkers/physicists like John Bell and Hugh Everett's many worlds formulation. Particularly convincing in this regard are Becker's arguments against the philosophical position of falsifiability, which he posits is a logical fallacy in the sciences because of it's solipsistic myopia, and egotistical ignorance toward what may seem unsavory or overly complex.This book really has something for all tastes—some sections, particularly the ones on the Vienna Circle and their weirdly firm positions as logical positivists, seemed pulled straight out of Pynchon (specifically Against the Day). Finally, Becker's analysis of the STEM resistance to philosophy of science is informative, and slightly depressing as it almost signals a weird strain of anti-intellectual pursuit within the scientific community—a position that seems at odds with everything the sciences stand for—to be clear, the sciences need philosophy as much as philosophy needs the sciences.I would highly recommend anyone with even glancing interest in quantum physics, entanglement, the history of physics and philosophical physics to read What is Real?. Because of Becker's expertise in both writing and physics, I could well see someone even deeply immersed in quantum physics getting something of use out of the book through Becker's precise rendering of the concepts in his experiment examples and his crystal clear—yet engaging—prose. Probably one of the best pop-sci books I've read in the past 10 years."
42,0465096050,http://goodreads.com/user/show/68014166-eric-hulburd,5,"Take my review from a computer/environmental engineer's perspective, not a physicist's. I thought this book was excellent. I've read a few other books on QM that really focused on the math (Leonard Susskind's was great for this). However, while understanding the math is important for applications of QM, my interest really lies in the unintuitive mysteries of quantum physics.This book brings that mystery down to Earth in a somewhat ironic way. As the book explains, ""Shut up and calculate"" is often invoked as a defense of the persistence of ""the"" Copenhagen interpretation. It has brought us wonders in modern science and technology. Becker leaves no doubt about that. However, the irony is that Mermin (original author of quote) went on to explain that he won't shut up. There is something deeply incomplete about the Copenhagen interpretation. In fact, the skepticism towards quantum foundation research (and philosophy of science more broadly) has, in part, enabled an interpretation of QM that feeds wishy washy pseudo-science spirituality (eg Deepak Chopra's insistence that's we exist within a quantum soup through which we can will our desires into existence). Rather than clearly calling out Copenhagen's implicit philosophical reliance on the role of observation/consciousness in creating our knowable reality, it's waved away, along with equally robust, but perhaps more philosophically feasible explanations for what we widely refer to as QM wave function collapse.Perhaps most powerfully, the book defends its philosophical concerns by pointing out, through science history, that truth, even scientific truth, is often shaped powerfully by personalities and culture. Predominance of Bohr's Copenhagen interpretation may be due to Bohr's greater charisma and personableness relative to that of Einstein's, Bohm's willingness to voice sympathy for socialism, or Everett's distaste for public speaking. Or perhaps, simply because the Copenhagen interpretation was the first interpretation to be defined, if not in terms of a coherent theory, at least semantically. Overall, an approachable and clear look at the philosophical implications and history of quantum mechanics. I highly recommend to anyone interested in either of those topics.PS I'm pursuing both criticisms and alternative perspectives to Becker's since this is my first foray into the topic."
43,0465096050,http://goodreads.com/user/show/19059859-sean,5,"Excellent book. You really need to like physics to fully follow this book. It might not have equations, but it requires you to be ready to discuss serious meanings of quantum physics. Extremely well researched. Fantastic insight to all the personalities involved. The author respects all the players, but talks very frankly about them as people with histories, political motives, academic motives and their time/place in human history. As a physics teacher, I fully understand today's ""Shut up and Calculate"" approach to teaching. It is so refreshing to read about how some of the greatest minds to walk the Earth debated and rethought their own ideas on the meaning of all this quantum weirdness.The index and bibliography are great. Even though I teach physics, I still would have liked a glossary section with brief explanations of terms like: complimentarity, Copenhagen interpretation, positivism, logical empiricism, falsifiability, many-worlds, measurement problem, pilot wave, spontaneous collapse. This could really help the non-physics majors.Reading recommendation: try reading the 6 pages at the end first: ""Appendix: Four Views of the Strangest Experiment"". The experiment is easy to understand. The four views then represent the views discussed in the book. Sure, the terminology hasn't yet been explained if you read this first, but I still think it would make a perfect 1st chapter to fully set the stage.I borrowed this book from my local library. I believe I need to buy a copy and read it again with my notebook/pen handy. Again, the bibliography represents a gold-mine of material I really haven't explored (physics philosophy)."
44,0465096050,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7413398-ken-dilella,4,"too early to review but a lot of history. A different view of the history of quantum mechanics but none the less still history. I should add it's the build up of the Copenhagen interpretation leading to Einsteins famous quote ""God does not play dice"".added a star. first half was saturated with history. second half ripe with reality. especially interesting that hugh everett gets more attention than any book I've read except a book about hugh everett. finally someone writes a book exposing the Copenhagen interpretation and doesn't bog you down with silly string theory. (there is a mention in the book) almost finished.the second half of this book is about as good as it gets on quantum interpretations. well worth the revisionist first half."

When I got to (only) page 18 I had a very clear idea regarding why the Copenhagen Interpretation is wrong and quite possibly why and I wrote down my thoughts. When I got to page 286 the author indicated Roger Penrose had the same thought. You could have knocked me over with a feather. If an author can help me understand something and have an insight on a topic I have struggled to understand for 30 years in only 18 pages, I would suggest it is a book worth reading, if you are interested in this particular subject. If you have every tried to understand the ""weirdness"" of quantum theory, this is the book to read."
46,0465096050,http://goodreads.com/user/show/85723871-thomas-dietert,5,"I thoroughly enjoyed this well-written account of the past hundred years of the theory of quantum mechanics, it's inception as a popular field of theoretical physics, and the steady progression and development of the Copenhagen interpretation along with rival theories including Everett's ""many worlds"" theorem, Bohm's pilot-wave theory, and Bell's proof that physics must be ""nonlocal"" (seemingly refuting the notion of Einstein's theory of relativity).The author does a wonderful job of setting the stage in the first third of the book, choosing to focus on the contributions, formulations, and theories of Heisenberg, Schrodinger, De-Broglie, Pierls, Einstein, Bohr, and other notable physicists at the time, and how they all came together to concoct an ""interpretation"" of quantum mechanics known as The Copenhagen interpretation. Not all physicists during the early years of quantum mechanical theory agreed on this interpretation, and the author does a great job of referencing cited material about the theories of these seminal scientists, and intriguingly describes the ways in which they disagreed about such an interpretation; i.e. Einstein was convinced that the ""measurement problem"" was a deep-seated flaw in the interpretation, whereas Bohr (and Heisenberg and friend) all argued was irrelevant. The author follows the development of such conflicting ideas, suggests reasons for why such disagreements weren't easily reconciled, and connects such ideological conflicts with the global political and economic climate (WWI, WWII), also illustrating the influence of classic philosophical movements (such as logical positivism via Mach & The Vienna Circle) on the ""accepted"" interpretation of quantum mechanics.The second third of the book describes the development of such theorems as Bohm's pilot-wave interpretation of quantum w decades go by and the measurement problem still hasn't been solved; The Copenhagen Interpretation still reigns supreme (though nobody can adequately define the collection of theories and experiments that comprise it), and anyone who thinks that there might be more to the ""quantum realm"" than is summed up in the Denmark Dogma is voraciously attacked and all but chased out of the academic field of physics. Fortunately, there are a few physicists with enough notoriety and clout (e.g. Bohm, Bell, etc) that produce some theories and proofs that offer alternative interpretations to Bohr's Copenhagen interpretation, as well as a few physicists (e.g. Everett) who are just in it for the fun of the field and could care less about whether or not their theories are accepted by the majority of physicists. In the latter half of the second third, and well into the last third of the book, the author continues to contextualize the sub-field of quantum physics with the rest of history, and describes the trials and tribulations of such physicists as Zeh, Clauser, and Wheeler (whom never really knew what theory to advocate for) whom continued to develop such esoteric and heretical theories and experiments (Zeh: many worlds, Clauser: Bell's inequality, etc). It was unfortunate to learn that perhaps the greatest reason for the lack of acceptance of such ""progress"" was that the field of physics became far too focused on pragmatic engineering applications following World War II, and dismissed any such reformulation of the ""foundations of quantum mechanics"" as ""Metaphysical Nonsense"" (continuing the trend of the Copenhagen cabal of the earls 1900s); Luckily for us, this was not enough to stop the creation or discovery of quantum field theory, which attempts to answer some of the further questions asked by such alternative theories as Zeh's ""decoherence"" principle (extending/reformulating Everett's many-worlds theorem) and Bell's inequality.The story ends with an account of the current state of these theories, the experimental result contributing to or refuting currently widely accepted theories of quantum mechanics, introducing potential solutions to the existing theoretical gaps (such as quantum gravity), describing the origins of and contextual placement of the application of quantum mechanics to computation (quantum computing a la Deutsch), and adequately and pleasingly summarizing the current state of the field.The author does a great job of conveying that the point of the book is to illustrate the philosophical (and truly quantum-physical) gaps in the (still) widely popular Copenhagen interpretation of quantum physics. Fortunately for all of humanity, there have been several physicists throughout the past 100 years who didn't let the potential destruction of their careers, or their surely negatively impacted academic reputation get in the way of their imagination enough to discourage or extinguish their desire to truly get to the bottom of such an complex theory of everything. Quantum mechanics, quantum field theory, particle physics, and other related sub-disciplines of the study of the quantum realm are still FAR from solved, and this book comprehensively explains exactly why.To conclude, I would recommend this book to anyone who desires to learn more about exactly what quantum mechanics is at a high enough level as to not get lost in the weeds along the way to a higher level understanding of the physics and philosophical questions that are simultaneously answered and asked by modern quantum-physical theories. If you have only a tangential and/or superficial understanding of quantum mechanics and enjoy a well-told history of such a field, you will enjoy this book and be inspired to learn even more in the future! 5/5 stars."
47,0465096050,http://goodreads.com/user/show/15608248-stefan-poth,2,This book is so redundant. Could relate all the details in half the pages if things were not repeated so many times.
48,0465096050,http://goodreads.com/user/show/29427094-babak,4,"The book mounts a systematic offensive against the Copenhagen Interpretation of quantum mechanics along with the historical narrative of how it came to be the dominant interpretation among physicists, especially in the era of ""big science"" after WWII funded by governments. We learn about differences in the views among the architects of quantum theory (Einstein, Bohr, de Broglie, Schrödinger, Heisenberg, Pauli, Born, and others) on what quantum theory is really about. We meet the heretics (Bohm, Everett, Bell, Clauser, Zeh, and others) who insist on a different conception of what is really out there, sometimes at great personal and professional cost. We also get a glimpse of the philosophical underpinnings of these different interpretations and the intellectual currents that reshaped them. We witness the fragile balance that physicists maintain between their daily work and professional aspirations and the fraught business of delving deeper into what that work really means for the world at large. Overall, this is a very enjoyable and informative read. On the weaker side, I wished that the discussion of the philosophy of science was done more comprehensively. Unfortunately, it only receives a shallow treatment in the book and, perhaps as a result, it contains some mischaracterizations. For example, the work of Popper is reduced to an inaccurate sketch of his demarcation criteria, i.e. ""falsifiability,"" and is attacked on this thin basis. However, Popper's philosophy of science is much more extensive and substantive than falsifiability: it's a coherent structure of rational criticism (which, in fact, the author partially spells out in his attack), in which falsifiability is but a small part.Another confusing aspect of the book's narrative is its treatment of the meaning of Bell's inequality. Multiple times, in his commentary as well as quotations of various physicists and philosophers, the author states that the violation of Bell's inequality forces us to abandon locality. However, we are also told that the many-worlds interpretation actually escapes this. This inconsistency threads through various passages and leaves a confused impression of the consequences of Bell's work and subsequent experimental findings. For example, after a dramatic discussion following the description of Bell's inequalities, we read on p. 160:""In short, Bell's Theorem really leaves only three unequivocal possibilities: either nature is nonlocal in some way, or we live in branching multiple worlds despite appearances to the contrary, or quantum physics gives incorrect predictions about certain experimental setups.""Ok. But then, when discussing the experiments of Clauser and others showing the violation of Bell's inequalities we read on p. 210:""In 1976, both Clauser and the Texas team announced their results: quantum mechanics was vindicated, and Clauser and Freedman's original result stood. Quantum nonlocality was real.""Um, really?! So, what about branching multiple worlds? This inconsistency of statements pervades the rest of the book. The many-worlds interpretation resurfaces again and again but somehow Bell proves that reality is nonlocal all the same.Much of the motivation for the book is drawn from the debate between Bohr and Einstein, which revolves (as the author clearly and correctly states) about locality. Locality is foundational in Einstein's conception of reality and a postulate of his relativity theory. However, this thread is somewhat lost in the later parts of the story. I wished it had been followed and its consequences stated more clearly. We do have a local interpretation of quantum theory without collapse and vague rumination about measurement: it is Everett's ""relative-state"" formulation and its subsequent substantiation by DeWitt, Zeh, Deutsch, and others, which leads to (not postulate) the real existence of many worlds, and provides a basis for understanding what probability means in the theory (again, instead of postulating it).

50,0465096050,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3870575-sean,5,"This was a fantastic read! At the surface level, Becker provides a lot of the necessary background in the history of both modern quantum mechanics and philosophy in order to have spirited debates at cocktail parties. What makes the read so enjoyable, however, is that the entire discussion is couched in the personalities and the interactions of the people there, originally arguing the ideas. Some of those tales are quite tragic, causing me to shout at how terrible and terribly wrong some people were or at how unfortunate the political environment was. At other times I was truly encouraged by how good ideas and rigorous, honest arguments eventually find a foothold. My only criticism might be of a span of something like 10 pages which dove into the parallel development of philosophy regarding logical positivism — I felt like the tenants of positivism were already laid out sufficiently, the history there dragged a bit and didn’t seem very necessary to the transition to realism. Anyway, there is a fair amount of philosophy within the context of interpreting quantum science, but that is part of Becker’s point that physics after WWII lost a lot of its introspection due to specialization and excessive pragmatism. I am too close to all of this stuff to say strongly that anyone would love this book but I’d certainly recommend it be given a shot."

What I mean by that is that do not expect this book to reveal to you the deep truths of quantum mechanics, or the one favoured interpretation among Copenhagen, many-worlds, pilot wave etc. Nobody knows the answers to this questions, that is the bottomline. The book is all about the journey of better understanding reality. Along the way, it reveals the fascinating personalities of key people in behind major developments in QM, and some of the intellectual impostures of the Copenhangen interpretation defenders.In my opinion, you will enjoy this book much more if you took some QM course, and is familiar with the basics of probabilities.

60,0465096050,http://goodreads.com/user/show/57803005-tomas-sedovic,5,"I picked this book up thinking it would be an accessible overview of the state of the art of quantum physics peppered up with the history of this extremely successful century-old theory and some anecdotes about the people involved.Technically, What is Real is just that. But it's so much more in ways I did not anticipate.It is a redemption of Albert Einstein who, the common lore (even among physicists) would have us know, has lost touch as he got older and never really accepted the strange reality of the quantum physics despite his early contributions to the field. That view is at best wildly distorted.It is a story of Niels Bohr, who's cult of personality gathered a mysticism and following that resulted in arguably the most embarrassing chapter in modern science. Their dogmatic views (summed up as the Copenhagen Interpretation) prevented physicists to probe deep into the foundations of quantum physics and our universe.Anyone who tried to understand what was actually going on would face ridicule, risk losing their job (or not being able to find one after they graduated) and would not be able to get their papers published. Even a mere association with someone questioning the dogma was risky to one's career.Questioning the status quo, trying to look for alternative interpretations, coming up with experiments that can show us holes in the current understanding are at the core of science. And yet, this pushback against even the slightest rocking of the boat was going on for several decades.Pushback that was perpetuated by extremely talented people. You'd have an easier time counting who *didn't* get a Nobel Price in the book's cast of characters. Indeed, it may be because of the unprecedented success in prediction and precision of the quantum theory that people were told to ""shut up and calculate"", killing any enquiries about the nature of the field and how it relates to our world.It is also, tragically, a story of the second World War and its disruption in the scientific field. In the thirties, the American physics was seriously behind and the vast majority of the research was going on in Berlin, Vienna and Copenhagen. A lot of that by scientists who were either of Jewish origin or who had a Jewish spouse.Hitler's anti-semitism played a large role in the quantum physics research leaving central Europe and the first atomic bomb being developed in the USA.Even though the book pushes hard against the Copenhagen interpretation and the behaviour surrounding the dogmatic positions at the time, I find it is fair to all the people involved. All of these people were brilliant scientists and that is not dismissed here.It would for example be easy to paint Niels Bohr as the villain of the story, but in addition to his undeniable contributions to physics, he was helping Jewish scientists by finding them jobs, financial help and helping them leave their countries that were about to arrest them. Other than Hitler, there are no villains here, just multi-faceted people.What is Real is a fascinating account of the physics in the last hundred years. It also made me really frustrated and often quite angry. You don't need to really know any physics to get the same out of it. It is beautifully written and I could not put it down."

Schrödinger’s cat or collapse of Quantum Wave function when a measurement is made. So the cat is neither dead or alive before measurement, but once an observation is made it has to settle in either of one state. Bohr received a Nobel prize for discovering the different energy states (quanta) of electrons in an atom. Together with Planck and Einstein, quantum theory was born. When Schrödinger discovered the wave equation, it correctly predicted the probabilistic position of the electron in an hydrogen atom. Heisenberg later discovered his uncertainty principle and then together with Bohr built the Copenhagen interpretation: ‘Shut up and calculate’. They posited that quantum theory cannot be understood the way that we experience every day life, and is only a useful equation for accurate prediction of every day effects. This infuriated many nonconformist physicists!Einstein, Podolsy and Rosen published a paper about entanglement, the paradox that entangled particles can transmit information faster than the speed of light. ‘Spooky actions at a distance’. Recent experiments seem to confirm this. Bohm suggested a pilot wave theory that helped explain the dual wave particle nature of electrons during a double slit experiment: the presence of a detector changed the wave interference pattern of the electron! It is interesting to know that Heisenberg supported Nazi Germany, while his mentor Bohr and Einstein had to flee Germany because of their Jewish lineage. That however prevented Germany from developing the atomic bomb first, since Heisenberg was a lousy practical physicist. Bohm’s theory aaa not well accepted because he was a communist. Everett suggested that wave functions do not collapse and there are actually infinite worlds. So is the cat dead or alive? Bohr says don’t ask. Everett says both but in different worlds. I am still confused. This is a great book about Quantum physics, I am sure I misunderstand large parts of it, but still learn a lot from it. "

63,0465096050,http://goodreads.com/user/show/15728519-r-hul,4,"Adam Becker, a Ph. D. in Physics, writes about interpretation of Quantum Mechanics, the enormously successful 20th century theory underpinning everything from semiconductor electronics to satellite navigation. At the heart of quantum mechanics is the ""weirdness"" summed up by Heisenberg's uncertainty principle that binds the combined accuracy with which both the position and momentum of a particle can be measured, even though the wavefunction underlying a quantum state is entirely determined by the Schrodinger equation. Most physicists rely on the Copenhagen interpretation of Quantum mechanics which separates the quantum world being measured from the classical measuring instrument and keeps the measurement process itself outside the realm of quantum mechanics. The quantum state is then interpreted as probabilistically collapsing into the measured state. This interpretation allows quantum mechanical calculations to make multiple predictions that have held up to the level of our most accurate measurements. Throughout the 20th century, the dominant view, exemplified by Richard Feynman and others, was to focus on observable and falsifiable predictions of quantum mechanics than to question whether it is complete. Einstein, Podolsky and Rosen had famously shown that Quantum mechanics is either incomplete or non-local. Although out of the mainstream, many scientists had proposed alternative interpretations of quantum mechanics to address Copenhagen's mysteries. De Broglie and Bohm developed the pilot-wave interpretation, where every particle is associated with a pilot wave, that avoids the Copenhagen collapse but introduces non-locality. Hugh Everett developed the Many Worlds interpretation where interaction between any two quantum particles leads to the creation of multiple joint wave functions in multiple universes, only one of which (the observed) is accessible to us. A third is Spontaneous Collapse in which, unlike Copenhagen, the measurement system is also a quantum object and collapse happens spontaneously, at a high probability due to the large number of quantum interactions happening when a macroscopic measurement system is used. Becker's narrative is fascinating and he is correct that insufficient attention has been paid to the fundamentals of quantum mechanics while we have reaped the benefits of its accuracy. However, it is also correct that, while intellectually illuminating, many of the alternative interpretations themselves introduce further weirdness like non-locality or are non-falsifiability. Becker is spotty when he attacks the necessity of Popperian falsifiability in a physical theory. On the one hand, it is correct that scientific progress is often inductive and grand theories are often created in retrospect to fit facts, but his central argument that a universally applied theory is falsifiable only by invoking something outside the universe itself sets too high a bar. It is often more satisfying and beneficial to keep a problem open rather than to rely on theories that do not offer measurements to falsify them. However, this is no reason not to stymie research into an area. While this book is greatly illuminating, Becker gives short shrift to the practical reasons why most physicists are more excited to work on the physics of quantum mechanics rather than its philosophical underpinnings- because physics today is a material science more than it is natural philosophy. There doesn't seem to be a conspiracy stopping research into alternatives to Copenhagen, just a preponderance of interest in testable Physics with real consequences. "

Its predictions have been confirmed time and time again and underpins modern technology. It has helped us to understand how the electromagnetic and the two nuclear forces work. It is a remarkable theory. But what does the mathematical formalism mean? This book tells the story how the interpretation of Quantum Mechanics has evolved over the last 90 years or so. It is a very well written book, with a lot of historical details I was not aware of. It doesn’t cover all interpretations of Quantum Mechanics (for example, the transactional interpretation is not mentioned at all, but it has not many followers). But the author describes nicely the troubles scientists went through to make sense of this remarkable theory. Of course, John Bell’s story is told, but so are the stories of David Bohm , Hugh Everett III, Heinz-Dieter Zeh (who died in April this year) and Wojciech Zurek. It is a great book.

70,0465096050,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5917740-nilesh,5,"What is Real is a masterpiece in the way it narrates the quest to find the meaning behind the quantum equations.Quantum science works, like almost nothing else humans have ever invented. Yet, the equations that have come to define the field are impossible to interpret in human languages and in a way that our rationality could accept. It took a while for the greatest minds of the era to even suggest that the wave function is Schrodinger’s wave equation was a probability distribution. The debate took a material turn for the worse with Heisenberg’s uncertainty principle. How does everything so probabilistic theoretically and when unseen actualize into something concrete whenever observed?The book wonderfully elaborates on the details of the problem that splintered the scientific world and had the greatest human minds of all time metaphorically in arms against each other. The debates between Einstein, Bohr, Schrodinger, Pauli, Dirac, Heisenberg, De Broglie and others captivated the world even nearly a century later. After all, what was at stake boiled down to what is real!Hundreds of books wonderfully explain the debates that dominated the pre-war years including the EPR construct. Mr Becker’s work covers the same grounds competently, but cannot add to what has been exhaustively rehashed for decades.  The book’s true value is not in covering the rise of the Copenhagen interpretation, but its fall. The author makes the story of the Copenhagen decline and rise of alternative explanations as understandable, exciting, meaningful and absorbing as the rise - something few who have covered Bohm, Bell, Everett, Wheeler etc have been able to do. This is because the issues at hand turn materially more complex when one attempts to appreciate the equally groundbreaking and relevant work of these scientists. At philosophical and metaphysical levels, the war was between positivism and scientific realism and their sub-schools. Mathematically, even relativity came under pressure with the insertion, deletion and re-insertion of the cosmological constants. This was in the space which was easily narratable, but the mathematical debates kept on intensifying at every stage of the development of unification theories. For the lay folks, it appeared more like fights over the number of dimensions our reality has, their sizes and similar, but scientists disagreed on almost everything as the observations proved reality to be ever more bizarre. The book side-steps the arrival of dozens of subatomic particles and stops before the string theories begin their domination of the discussion, and this helps the book in keeping the focus on quantum reality. The author spends a lot of time on describing the scientists involved and their travesties. While this is often distracting, it helps humanize the story and provides relief to the non-technical readers from the mind-numbing intricacies of the quantum world.  The book makes the collapse of the Copenhagen and rise of Many Worlds far more definitive than it is in the scientific community. Even non-scientists would need dozens of books over the lifetime to develop a basic understanding of the still-shifting reality debates sparked by the quantum revolution. This book is one for any such a list because it focuses on a particular time-frame and a set of issues that are pivotal and not as well covered by almost anyone else."
71,0465096050,http://goodreads.com/user/show/22428213-ian-scuffling,5,"It was a bastardization of Schrödinger's cat that introduced me to the ideas of quantum physics, and since then the topic has been something that I've held deep interest in (albeit from a very amateur's view, not really digging into the nuances other than to understand the prevailing ideas)—my interest has been particularly in terms of the philosophy and existentialism inherent in the problems that the theories present to our experience of the world. To be honest, before reading Adam Becker's What is Real? I had no idea what the Copenhagen Interpretation (CI) was, much less that there was contention in the fundamental foundations of quantum physics and what significance that has for everyday ""classic"" (Newtonian) physics. Becker's book isn't just a really great primer on the material of what quantum physics is and does, but also a bountiful, if not slanted, biography of the science itself—its historical players, their public arguments, the political impacts of scientific pursuits and philosophies. I say slanted because Becker here does not even have pretenses about his feelings towards what he sees as Neils Bohr's egotistical ironclad grip on developing physics students minds and dispositions towards quantum physics and how it's to be seen simply as a mathematical ""world"" separate from the Newtonian ""classic"" world we experience. That is, it's not an observable state, so therefore it's simply a mathematical understanding of particle physics that doesn't necessarily mean something about how we experience or understand the physical realms.Becker, in his biases, however, lays out a compelling and seemingly pat philosophical reasoning for giving more credence to thinkers/physicists like John Bell and Hugh Everett's many worlds formulation. Particularly convincing in this regard are Becker's arguments against the philosophical position of falsifiability, which he posits is a logical fallacy in the sciences because of it's solipsistic myopia, and egotistical ignorance toward what may seem unsavory or overly complex.This book really has something for all tastes—some sections, particularly the ones on the Vienna Circle and their weirdly firm positions as logical positivists, seemed pulled straight out of Pynchon (specifically Against the Day). Finally, Becker's analysis of the STEM resistance to philosophy of science is informative, and slightly depressing as it almost signals a weird strain of anti-intellectual pursuit within the scientific community—a position that seems at odds with everything the sciences stand for—to be clear, the sciences need philosophy as much as philosophy needs the sciences.I would highly recommend anyone with even glancing interest in quantum physics, entanglement, the history of physics and philosophical physics to read What is Real?. Because of Becker's expertise in both writing and physics, I could well see someone even deeply immersed in quantum physics getting something of use out of the book through Becker's precise rendering of the concepts in his experiment examples and his crystal clear—yet engaging—prose. Probably one of the best pop-sci books I've read in the past 10 years."
72,0465096050,http://goodreads.com/user/show/68014166-eric-hulburd,5,"Take my review from a computer/environmental engineer's perspective, not a physicist's. I thought this book was excellent. I've read a few other books on QM that really focused on the math (Leonard Susskind's was great for this). However, while understanding the math is important for applications of QM, my interest really lies in the unintuitive mysteries of quantum physics.This book brings that mystery down to Earth in a somewhat ironic way. As the book explains, ""Shut up and calculate"" is often invoked as a defense of the persistence of ""the"" Copenhagen interpretation. It has brought us wonders in modern science and technology. Becker leaves no doubt about that. However, the irony is that Mermin (original author of quote) went on to explain that he won't shut up. There is something deeply incomplete about the Copenhagen interpretation. In fact, the skepticism towards quantum foundation research (and philosophy of science more broadly) has, in part, enabled an interpretation of QM that feeds wishy washy pseudo-science spirituality (eg Deepak Chopra's insistence that's we exist within a quantum soup through which we can will our desires into existence). Rather than clearly calling out Copenhagen's implicit philosophical reliance on the role of observation/consciousness in creating our knowable reality, it's waved away, along with equally robust, but perhaps more philosophically feasible explanations for what we widely refer to as QM wave function collapse.Perhaps most powerfully, the book defends its philosophical concerns by pointing out, through science history, that truth, even scientific truth, is often shaped powerfully by personalities and culture. Predominance of Bohr's Copenhagen interpretation may be due to Bohr's greater charisma and personableness relative to that of Einstein's, Bohm's willingness to voice sympathy for socialism, or Everett's distaste for public speaking. Or perhaps, simply because the Copenhagen interpretation was the first interpretation to be defined, if not in terms of a coherent theory, at least semantically. Overall, an approachable and clear look at the philosophical implications and history of quantum mechanics. I highly recommend to anyone interested in either of those topics.PS I'm pursuing both criticisms and alternative perspectives to Becker's since this is my first foray into the topic."
73,0465096050,http://goodreads.com/user/show/19059859-sean,5,"Excellent book. You really need to like physics to fully follow this book. It might not have equations, but it requires you to be ready to discuss serious meanings of quantum physics. Extremely well researched. Fantastic insight to all the personalities involved. The author respects all the players, but talks very frankly about them as people with histories, political motives, academic motives and their time/place in human history. As a physics teacher, I fully understand today's ""Shut up and Calculate"" approach to teaching. It is so refreshing to read about how some of the greatest minds to walk the Earth debated and rethought their own ideas on the meaning of all this quantum weirdness.The index and bibliography are great. Even though I teach physics, I still would have liked a glossary section with brief explanations of terms like: complimentarity, Copenhagen interpretation, positivism, logical empiricism, falsifiability, many-worlds, measurement problem, pilot wave, spontaneous collapse. This could really help the non-physics majors.Reading recommendation: try reading the 6 pages at the end first: ""Appendix: Four Views of the Strangest Experiment"". The experiment is easy to understand. The four views then represent the views discussed in the book. Sure, the terminology hasn't yet been explained if you read this first, but I still think it would make a perfect 1st chapter to fully set the stage.I borrowed this book from my local library. I believe I need to buy a copy and read it again with my notebook/pen handy. Again, the bibliography represents a gold-mine of material I really haven't explored (physics philosophy)."

If an author can help me understand something and have an insight on a topic I have struggled to understand for 30 years in only 18 pages, I would suggest it is a book worth reading, if you are interested in this particular subject.

76,0465096050,http://goodreads.com/user/show/85723871-thomas-dietert,5,"I thoroughly enjoyed this well-written account of the past hundred years of the theory of quantum mechanics, it's inception as a popular field of theoretical physics, and the steady progression and development of the Copenhagen interpretation along with rival theories including Everett's ""many worlds"" theorem, Bohm's pilot-wave theory, and Bell's proof that physics must be ""nonlocal"" (seemingly refuting the notion of Einstein's theory of relativity).The author does a wonderful job of setting the stage in the first third of the book, choosing to focus on the contributions, formulations, and theories of Heisenberg, Schrodinger, De-Broglie, Pierls, Einstein, Bohr, and other notable physicists at the time, and how they all came together to concoct an ""interpretation"" of quantum mechanics known as The Copenhagen interpretation. Not all physicists during the early years of quantum mechanical theory agreed on this interpretation, and the author does a great job of referencing cited material about the theories of these seminal scientists, and intriguingly describes the ways in which they disagreed about such an interpretation; i.e. Einstein was convinced that the ""measurement problem"" was a deep-seated flaw in the interpretation, whereas Bohr (and Heisenberg and friend) all argued was irrelevant. The author follows the development of such conflicting ideas, suggests reasons for why such disagreements weren't easily reconciled, and connects such ideological conflicts with the global political and economic climate (WWI, WWII), also illustrating the influence of classic philosophical movements (such as logical positivism via Mach & The Vienna Circle) on the ""accepted"" interpretation of quantum mechanics.The second third of the book describes the development of such theorems as Bohm's pilot-wave interpretation of quantum w decades go by and the measurement problem still hasn't been solved; The Copenhagen Interpretation still reigns supreme (though nobody can adequately define the collection of theories and experiments that comprise it), and anyone who thinks that there might be more to the ""quantum realm"" than is summed up in the Denmark Dogma is voraciously attacked and all but chased out of the academic field of physics. Fortunately, there are a few physicists with enough notoriety and clout (e.g. Bohm, Bell, etc) that produce some theories and proofs that offer alternative interpretations to Bohr's Copenhagen interpretation, as well as a few physicists (e.g. Everett) who are just in it for the fun of the field and could care less about whether or not their theories are accepted by the majority of physicists. In the latter half of the second third, and well into the last third of the book, the author continues to contextualize the sub-field of quantum physics with the rest of history, and describes the trials and tribulations of such physicists as Zeh, Clauser, and Wheeler (whom never really knew what theory to advocate for) whom continued to develop such esoteric and heretical theories and experiments (Zeh: many worlds, Clauser: Bell's inequality, etc). It was unfortunate to learn that perhaps the greatest reason for the lack of acceptance of such ""progress"" was that the field of physics became far too focused on pragmatic engineering applications following World War II, and dismissed any such reformulation of the ""foundations of quantum mechanics"" as ""Metaphysical Nonsense"" (continuing the trend of the Copenhagen cabal of the earls 1900s); Luckily for us, this was not enough to stop the creation or discovery of quantum field theory, which attempts to answer some of the further questions asked by such alternative theories as Zeh's ""decoherence"" principle (extending/reformulating Everett's many-worlds theorem) and Bell's inequality.The story ends with an account of the current state of these theories, the experimental result contributing to or refuting currently widely accepted theories of quantum mechanics, introducing potential solutions to the existing theoretical gaps (such as quantum gravity), describing the origins of and contextual placement of the application of quantum mechanics to computation (quantum computing a la Deutsch), and adequately and pleasingly summarizing the current state of the field.The author does a great job of conveying that the point of the book is to illustrate the philosophical (and truly quantum-physical) gaps in the (still) widely popular Copenhagen interpretation of quantum physics. Fortunately for all of humanity, there have been several physicists throughout the past 100 years who didn't let the potential destruction of their careers, or their surely negatively impacted academic reputation get in the way of their imagination enough to discourage or extinguish their desire to truly get to the bottom of such an complex theory of everything. Quantum mechanics, quantum field theory, particle physics, and other related sub-disciplines of the study of the quantum realm are still FAR from solved, and this book comprehensively explains exactly why.To conclude, I would recommend this book to anyone who desires to learn more about exactly what quantum mechanics is at a high enough level as to not get lost in the weeds along the way to a higher level understanding of the physics and philosophical questions that are simultaneously answered and asked by modern quantum-physical theories. If you have only a tangential and/or superficial understanding of quantum mechanics and enjoy a well-told history of such a field, you will enjoy this book and be inspired to learn even more in the future! 5/5 stars."
77,0465096050,http://goodreads.com/user/show/15608248-stefan-poth,2,This book is so redundant. Could relate all the details in half the pages if things were not repeated so many times.
78,0465096050,http://goodreads.com/user/show/29427094-babak,4,"The book mounts a systematic offensive against the Copenhagen Interpretation of quantum mechanics along with the historical narrative of how it came to be the dominant interpretation among physicists, especially in the era of ""big science"" after WWII funded by governments. We learn about differences in the views among the architects of quantum theory (Einstein, Bohr, de Broglie, Schrödinger, Heisenberg, Pauli, Born, and others) on what quantum theory is really about. We meet the heretics (Bohm, Everett, Bell, Clauser, Zeh, and others) who insist on a different conception of what is really out there, sometimes at great personal and professional cost. We also get a glimpse of the philosophical underpinnings of these different interpretations and the intellectual currents that reshaped them. We witness the fragile balance that physicists maintain between their daily work and professional aspirations and the fraught business of delving deeper into what that work really means for the world at large. Overall, this is a very enjoyable and informative read. On the weaker side, I wished that the discussion of the philosophy of science was done more comprehensively. Unfortunately, it only receives a shallow treatment in the book and, perhaps as a result, it contains some mischaracterizations. For example, the work of Popper is reduced to an inaccurate sketch of his demarcation criteria, i.e. ""falsifiability,"" and is attacked on this thin basis. However, Popper's philosophy of science is much more extensive and substantive than falsifiability: it's a coherent structure of rational criticism (which, in fact, the author partially spells out in his attack), in which falsifiability is but a small part.Another confusing aspect of the book's narrative is its treatment of the meaning of Bell's inequality. Multiple times, in his commentary as well as quotations of various physicists and philosophers, the author states that the violation of Bell's inequality forces us to abandon locality. However, we are also told that the many-worlds interpretation actually escapes this. This inconsistency threads through various passages and leaves a confused impression of the consequences of Bell's work and subsequent experimental findings. For example, after a dramatic discussion following the description of Bell's inequalities, we read on p. 160:""In short, Bell's Theorem really leaves only three unequivocal possibilities: either nature is nonlocal in some way, or we live in branching multiple worlds despite appearances to the contrary, or quantum physics gives incorrect predictions about certain experimental setups.""Ok. But then, when discussing the experiments of Clauser and others showing the violation of Bell's inequalities we read on p. 210:""In 1976, both Clauser and the Texas team announced their results: quantum mechanics was vindicated, and Clauser and Freedman's original result stood. Quantum nonlocality was real.""Um, really?! So, what about branching multiple worlds? This inconsistency of statements pervades the rest of the book. The many-worlds interpretation resurfaces again and again but somehow Bell proves that reality is nonlocal all the same.Much of the motivation for the book is drawn from the debate between Bohr and Einstein, which revolves (as the author clearly and correctly states) about locality. Locality is foundational in Einstein's conception of reality and a postulate of his relativity theory. However, this thread is somewhat lost in the later parts of the story. I wished it had been followed and its consequences stated more clearly. We do have a local interpretation of quantum theory without collapse and vague rumination about measurement: it is Everett's ""relative-state"" formulation and its subsequent substantiation by DeWitt, Zeh, Deutsch, and others, which leads to (not postulate) the real existence of many worlds, and provides a basis for understanding what probability means in the theory (again, instead of postulating it).

80,0465096050,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3870575-sean,5,"This was a fantastic read! At the surface level, Becker provides a lot of the necessary background in the history of both modern quantum mechanics and philosophy in order to have spirited debates at cocktail parties. What makes the read so enjoyable, however, is that the entire discussion is couched in the personalities and the interactions of the people there, originally arguing the ideas. Some of those tales are quite tragic, causing me to shout at how terrible and terribly wrong some people were or at how unfortunate the political environment was. At other times I was truly encouraged by how good ideas and rigorous, honest arguments eventually find a foothold. My only criticism might be of a span of something like 10 pages which dove into the parallel development of philosophy regarding logical positivism — I felt like the tenants of positivism were already laid out sufficiently, the history there dragged a bit and didn’t seem very necessary to the transition to realism. Anyway, there is a fair amount of philosophy within the context of interpreting quantum science, but that is part of Becker’s point that physics after WWII lost a lot of its introspection due to specialization and excessive pragmatism. I am too close to all of this stuff to say strongly that anyone would love this book but I’d certainly recommend it be given a shot."

What I mean by that is that do not expect this book to reveal to you the deep truths of quantum mechanics, or the one favoured interpretation among Copenhagen, many-worlds, pilot wave etc. Nobody knows the answers to this questions, that is the bottomline. The book is all about the journey of better understanding reality. Along the way, it reveals the fascinating personalities of key people in behind major developments in QM, and some of the intellectual impostures of the Copenhangen interpretation defenders.In my opinion, you will enjoy this book much more if you took some QM course, and is familiar with the basics of probabilities.

But it's so much more in ways I did not anticipate.It is a redemption of Albert Einstein who, the common lore (even among physicists) would have us know, has lost touch as he got older and never really accepted the strange reality of the quantum physics despite his early contributions to the field. That view is at best wildly distorted.It is a story of Niels Bohr, who's cult of personality gathered a mysticism and following that resulted in arguably the most embarrassing chapter in modern science. Their dogmatic views (summed up as the Copenhagen Interpretation) prevented physicists to probe deep into the foundations of quantum physics and our universe.Anyone who tried to understand what was actually going on would face ridicule, risk losing their job (or not being able to find one after they graduated) and would not be able to get their papers published. Even a mere association with someone questioning the dogma was risky to one's career.Questioning the status quo, trying to look for alternative interpretations, coming up with experiments that can show us holes in the current understanding are at the core of science. And yet, this pushback against even the slightest rocking of the boat was going on for several decades.Pushback that was perpetuated by extremely talented people. You'd have an easier time counting who *didn't* get a Nobel Price in the book's cast of characters. Indeed, it may be because of the unprecedented success in prediction and precision of the quantum theory that people were told to ""shut up and calculate"", killing any enquiries about the nature of the field and how it relates to our world.It is also, tragically, a story of the second World War and its disruption in the scientific field. In the thirties, the American physics was seriously behind and the vast majority of the research was going on in Berlin, Vienna and Copenhagen. A lot of that by scientists who were either of Jewish origin or who had a Jewish spouse.Hitler's anti-semitism played a large role in the quantum physics research leaving central Europe and the first atomic bomb being developed in the USA.Even though the book pushes hard against the Copenhagen interpretation and the behaviour surrounding the dogmatic positions at the time, I find it is fair to all the people involved. All of these people were brilliant scientists and that is not dismissed here.It would for example be easy to paint Niels Bohr as the villain of the story, but in addition to his undeniable contributions to physics, he was helping Jewish scientists by finding them jobs, financial help and helping them leave their countries that were about to arrest them. Other than Hitler, there are no villains here, just multi-faceted people.What is Real is a fascinating account of the physics in the last hundred years. It also made me really frustrated and often quite angry. You don't need to really know any physics to get the same out of it. It is beautifully written and I could not put it down."

Schrödinger’s cat or collapse of Quantum Wave function when a measurement is made. So the cat is neither dead or alive before measurement, but once an observation is made it has to settle in either of one state. Bohr received a Nobel prize for discovering the different energy states (quanta) of electrons in an atom. Together with Planck and Einstein, quantum theory was born. When Schrödinger discovered the wave equation, it correctly predicted the probabilistic position of the electron in an hydrogen atom. Heisenberg later discovered his uncertainty principle and then together with Bohr built the Copenhagen interpretation: ‘Shut up and calculate’. They posited that quantum theory cannot be understood the way that we experience every day life, and is only a useful equation for accurate prediction of every day effects. This infuriated many nonconformist physicists!Einstein, Podolsy and Rosen published a paper about entanglement, the paradox that entangled particles can transmit information faster than the speed of light. ‘Spooky actions at a distance’. Recent experiments seem to confirm this. Bohm suggested a pilot wave theory that helped explain the dual wave particle nature of electrons during a double slit experiment: the presence of a detector changed the wave interference pattern of the electron! It is interesting to know that Heisenberg supported Nazi Germany, while his mentor Bohr and Einstein had to flee Germany because of their Jewish lineage. That however prevented Germany from developing the atomic bomb first, since Heisenberg was a lousy practical physicist. Bohm’s theory aaa not well accepted because he was a communist. Everett suggested that wave functions do not collapse and there are actually infinite worlds. So is the cat dead or alive? Bohr says don’t ask. Everett says both but in different worlds. I am still confused. This is a great book about Quantum physics, I am sure I misunderstand large parts of it, but still learn a lot from it. "

93,0465096050,http://goodreads.com/user/show/15728519-r-hul,4,"Adam Becker, a Ph. D. in Physics, writes about interpretation of Quantum Mechanics, the enormously successful 20th century theory underpinning everything from semiconductor electronics to satellite navigation. At the heart of quantum mechanics is the ""weirdness"" summed up by Heisenberg's uncertainty principle that binds the combined accuracy with which both the position and momentum of a particle can be measured, even though the wavefunction underlying a quantum state is entirely determined by the Schrodinger equation. Most physicists rely on the Copenhagen interpretation of Quantum mechanics which separates the quantum world being measured from the classical measuring instrument and keeps the measurement process itself outside the realm of quantum mechanics. The quantum state is then interpreted as probabilistically collapsing into the measured state. This interpretation allows quantum mechanical calculations to make multiple predictions that have held up to the level of our most accurate measurements. Throughout the 20th century, the dominant view, exemplified by Richard Feynman and others, was to focus on observable and falsifiable predictions of quantum mechanics than to question whether it is complete. Einstein, Podolsky and Rosen had famously shown that Quantum mechanics is either incomplete or non-local. Although out of the mainstream, many scientists had proposed alternative interpretations of quantum mechanics to address Copenhagen's mysteries. De Broglie and Bohm developed the pilot-wave interpretation, where every particle is associated with a pilot wave, that avoids the Copenhagen collapse but introduces non-locality. Hugh Everett developed the Many Worlds interpretation where interaction between any two quantum particles leads to the creation of multiple joint wave functions in multiple universes, only one of which (the observed) is accessible to us. A third is Spontaneous Collapse in which, unlike Copenhagen, the measurement system is also a quantum object and collapse happens spontaneously, at a high probability due to the large number of quantum interactions happening when a macroscopic measurement system is used. Becker's narrative is fascinating and he is correct that insufficient attention has been paid to the fundamentals of quantum mechanics while we have reaped the benefits of its accuracy. However, it is also correct that, while intellectually illuminating, many of the alternative interpretations themselves introduce further weirdness like non-locality or are non-falsifiability. Becker is spotty when he attacks the necessity of Popperian falsifiability in a physical theory. On the one hand, it is correct that scientific progress is often inductive and grand theories are often created in retrospect to fit facts, but his central argument that a universally applied theory is falsifiable only by invoking something outside the universe itself sets too high a bar. It is often more satisfying and beneficial to keep a problem open rather than to rely on theories that do not offer measurements to falsify them. However, this is no reason not to stymie research into an area. While this book is greatly illuminating, Becker gives short shrift to the practical reasons why most physicists are more excited to work on the physics of quantum mechanics rather than its philosophical underpinnings- because physics today is a material science more than it is natural philosophy. There doesn't seem to be a conspiracy stopping research into alternatives to Copenhagen, just a preponderance of interest in testable Physics with real consequences. "
94,0465096050,http://goodreads.com/user/show/70474434-carsten,5,"Quantum Mechanics is one of the foundations of physics (jointly with relativity). Its predictions have been confirmed time and time again and underpins modern technology. It has helped us to understand how the electromagnetic and the two nuclear forces work. It is a remarkable theory. But what does the mathematical formalism mean? This book tells the story how the interpretation of Quantum Mechanics has evolved over the last 90 years or so. It is a very well written book, with a lot of historical details I was not aware of. It doesn’t cover all interpretations of Quantum Mechanics (for example, the transactional interpretation is not mentioned at all, but it has not many followers). But the author describes nicely the troubles scientists went through to make sense of this remarkable theory. Of course, John Bell’s story is told, but so are the stories of David Bohm , Hugh Everett III, Heinz-Dieter Zeh (who died in April this year) and Wojciech Zurek. It is a great book.

Yet, the equations that have come to define the field are impossible to interpret in human languages and in a way that our rationality could accept. It took a while for the greatest minds of the era to even suggest that the wave function is Schrodinger’s wave equation was a probability distribution. The debate took a material turn for the worse with Heisenberg’s uncertainty principle. How does everything so probabilistic theoretically and when unseen actualize into something concrete whenever observed?The book wonderfully elaborates on the details of the problem that splintered the scientific world and had the greatest human minds of all time metaphorically in arms against each other. The debates between Einstein, Bohr, Schrodinger, Pauli, Dirac, Heisenberg, De Broglie and others captivated the world even nearly a century later. After all, what was at stake boiled down to what is real!Hundreds of books wonderfully explain the debates that dominated the pre-war years including the EPR construct. Mr Becker’s work covers the same grounds competently, but cannot add to what has been exhaustively rehashed for decades.  The book’s true value is not in covering the rise of the Copenhagen interpretation, but its fall. The author makes the story of the Copenhagen decline and rise of alternative explanations as understandable, exciting, meaningful and absorbing as the rise - something few who have covered Bohm, Bell, Everett, Wheeler etc have been able to do. This is because the issues at hand turn materially more complex when one attempts to appreciate the equally groundbreaking and relevant work of these scientists. At philosophical and metaphysical levels, the war was between positivism and scientific realism and their sub-schools. Mathematically, even relativity came under pressure with the insertion, deletion and re-insertion of the cosmological constants. This was in the space which was easily narratable, but the mathematical debates kept on intensifying at every stage of the development of unification theories. For the lay folks, it appeared more like fights over the number of dimensions our reality has, their sizes and similar, but scientists disagreed on almost everything as the observations proved reality to be ever more bizarre. The book side-steps the arrival of dozens of subatomic particles and stops before the string theories begin their domination of the discussion, and this helps the book in keeping the focus on quantum reality. The author spends a lot of time on describing the scientists involved and their travesties. While this is often distracting, it helps humanize the story and provides relief to the non-technical readers from the mind-numbing intricacies of the quantum world.  The book makes the collapse of the Copenhagen and rise of Many Worlds far more definitive than it is in the scientific community. Even non-scientists would need dozens of books over the lifetime to develop a basic understanding of the still-shifting reality debates sparked by the quantum revolution. This book is one for any such a list because it focuses on a particular time-frame and a set of issues that are pivotal and not as well covered by almost anyone else."
101,0465096050,http://goodreads.com/user/show/22428213-ian-scuffling,5,"It was a bastardization of Schrödinger's cat that introduced me to the ideas of quantum physics, and since then the topic has been something that I've held deep interest in (albeit from a very amateur's view, not really digging into the nuances other than to understand the prevailing ideas)—my interest has been particularly in terms of the philosophy and existentialism inherent in the problems that the theories present to our experience of the world. To be honest, before reading Adam Becker's What is Real? I had no idea what the Copenhagen Interpretation (CI) was, much less that there was contention in the fundamental foundations of quantum physics and what significance that has for everyday ""classic"" (Newtonian) physics. Becker's book isn't just a really great primer on the material of what quantum physics is and does, but also a bountiful, if not slanted, biography of the science itself—its historical players, their public arguments, the political impacts of scientific pursuits and philosophies. I say slanted because Becker here does not even have pretenses about his feelings towards what he sees as Neils Bohr's egotistical ironclad grip on developing physics students minds and dispositions towards quantum physics and how it's to be seen simply as a mathematical ""world"" separate from the Newtonian ""classic"" world we experience. That is, it's not an observable state, so therefore it's simply a mathematical understanding of particle physics that doesn't necessarily mean something about how we experience or understand the physical realms.Becker, in his biases, however, lays out a compelling and seemingly pat philosophical reasoning for giving more credence to thinkers/physicists like John Bell and Hugh Everett's many worlds formulation. Particularly convincing in this regard are Becker's arguments against the philosophical position of falsifiability, which he posits is a logical fallacy in the sciences because of it's solipsistic myopia, and egotistical ignorance toward what may seem unsavory or overly complex.This book really has something for all tastes—some sections, particularly the ones on the Vienna Circle and their weirdly firm positions as logical positivists, seemed pulled straight out of Pynchon (specifically Against the Day). Finally, Becker's analysis of the STEM resistance to philosophy of science is informative, and slightly depressing as it almost signals a weird strain of anti-intellectual pursuit within the scientific community—a position that seems at odds with everything the sciences stand for—to be clear, the sciences need philosophy as much as philosophy needs the sciences.I would highly recommend anyone with even glancing interest in quantum physics, entanglement, the history of physics and philosophical physics to read What is Real?. Because of Becker's expertise in both writing and physics, I could well see someone even deeply immersed in quantum physics getting something of use out of the book through Becker's precise rendering of the concepts in his experiment examples and his crystal clear—yet engaging—prose. Probably one of the best pop-sci books I've read in the past 10 years."
102,0465096050,http://goodreads.com/user/show/68014166-eric-hulburd,5,"Take my review from a computer/environmental engineer's perspective, not a physicist's. I thought this book was excellent. I've read a few other books on QM that really focused on the math (Leonard Susskind's was great for this). However, while understanding the math is important for applications of QM, my interest really lies in the unintuitive mysteries of quantum physics.This book brings that mystery down to Earth in a somewhat ironic way. As the book explains, ""Shut up and calculate"" is often invoked as a defense of the persistence of ""the"" Copenhagen interpretation. It has brought us wonders in modern science and technology. Becker leaves no doubt about that. However, the irony is that Mermin (original author of quote) went on to explain that he won't shut up. There is something deeply incomplete about the Copenhagen interpretation. In fact, the skepticism towards quantum foundation research (and philosophy of science more broadly) has, in part, enabled an interpretation of QM that feeds wishy washy pseudo-science spirituality (eg Deepak Chopra's insistence that's we exist within a quantum soup through which we can will our desires into existence). Rather than clearly calling out Copenhagen's implicit philosophical reliance on the role of observation/consciousness in creating our knowable reality, it's waved away, along with equally robust, but perhaps more philosophically feasible explanations for what we widely refer to as QM wave function collapse.Perhaps most powerfully, the book defends its philosophical concerns by pointing out, through science history, that truth, even scientific truth, is often shaped powerfully by personalities and culture. Predominance of Bohr's Copenhagen interpretation may be due to Bohr's greater charisma and personableness relative to that of Einstein's, Bohm's willingness to voice sympathy for socialism, or Everett's distaste for public speaking. Or perhaps, simply because the Copenhagen interpretation was the first interpretation to be defined, if not in terms of a coherent theory, at least semantically. Overall, an approachable and clear look at the philosophical implications and history of quantum mechanics. I highly recommend to anyone interested in either of those topics.PS I'm pursuing both criticisms and alternative perspectives to Becker's since this is my first foray into the topic."

It might not have equations, but it requires you to be ready to discuss serious meanings of quantum physics. Extremely well researched. Fantastic insight to all the personalities involved. The author respects all the players, but talks very frankly about them as people with histories, political motives, academic motives and their time/place in human history. As a physics teacher, I fully understand today's ""Shut up and Calculate"" approach to teaching. It is so refreshing to read about how some of the greatest minds to walk the Earth debated and rethought their own ideas on the meaning of all this quantum weirdness.The index and bibliography are great. Even though I teach physics, I still would have liked a glossary section with brief explanations of terms like: complimentarity, Copenhagen interpretation, positivism, logical empiricism, falsifiability, many-worlds, measurement problem, pilot wave, spontaneous collapse. This could really help the non-physics majors.Reading recommendation: try reading the 6 pages at the end first: ""Appendix: Four Views of the Strangest Experiment"". The experiment is easy to understand. The four views then represent the views discussed in the book. Sure, the terminology hasn't yet been explained if you read this first, but I still think it would make a perfect 1st chapter to fully set the stage.I borrowed this book from my local library. I believe I need to buy a copy and read it again with my notebook/pen handy. Again, the bibliography represents a gold-mine of material I really haven't explored (physics philosophy)."

If an author can help me understand something and have an insight on a topic I have struggled to understand for 30 years in only 18 pages, I would suggest it is a book worth reading, if you are interested in this particular subject.

Not all physicists during the early years of quantum mechanical theory agreed on this interpretation, and the author does a great job of referencing cited material about the theories of these seminal scientists, and intriguingly describes the ways in which they disagreed about such an interpretation; i.e. Einstein was convinced that the ""measurement problem"" was a deep-seated flaw in the interpretation, whereas Bohr (and Heisenberg and friend) all argued was irrelevant. The author follows the development of such conflicting ideas, suggests reasons for why such disagreements weren't easily reconciled, and connects such ideological conflicts with the global political and economic climate (WWI, WWII), also illustrating the influence of classic philosophical movements (such as logical positivism via Mach & The Vienna Circle) on the ""accepted"" interpretation of quantum mechanics.The second third of the book describes the development of such theorems as Bohm's pilot-wave interpretation of quantum w decades go by and the measurement problem still hasn't been solved; The Copenhagen Interpretation still reigns supreme (though nobody can adequately define the collection of theories and experiments that comprise it), and anyone who thinks that there might be more to the ""quantum realm"" than is summed up in the Denmark Dogma is voraciously attacked and all but chased out of the academic field of physics. Fortunately, there are a few physicists with enough notoriety and clout (e.g. Bohm, Bell, etc) that produce some theories and proofs that offer alternative interpretations to Bohr's Copenhagen interpretation, as well as a few physicists (e.g. Everett) who are just in it for the fun of the field and could care less about whether or not their theories are accepted by the majority of physicists. In the latter half of the second third, and well into the last third of the book, the author continues to contextualize the sub-field of quantum physics with the rest of history, and describes the trials and tribulations of such physicists as Zeh, Clauser, and Wheeler (whom never really knew what theory to advocate for) whom continued to develop such esoteric and heretical theories and experiments (Zeh: many worlds, Clauser: Bell's inequality, etc). It was unfortunate to learn that perhaps the greatest reason for the lack of acceptance of such ""progress"" was that the field of physics became far too focused on pragmatic engineering applications following World War II, and dismissed any such reformulation of the ""foundations of quantum mechanics"" as ""Metaphysical Nonsense"" (continuing the trend of the Copenhagen cabal of the earls 1900s); Luckily for us, this was not enough to stop the creation or discovery of quantum field theory, which attempts to answer some of the further questions asked by such alternative theories as Zeh's ""decoherence"" principle (extending/reformulating Everett's many-worlds theorem) and Bell's inequality.The story ends with an account of the current state of these theories, the experimental result contributing to or refuting currently widely accepted theories of quantum mechanics, introducing potential solutions to the existing theoretical gaps (such as quantum gravity), describing the origins of and contextual placement of the application of quantum mechanics to computation (quantum computing a la Deutsch), and adequately and pleasingly summarizing the current state of the field.The author does a great job of conveying that the point of the book is to illustrate the philosophical (and truly quantum-physical) gaps in the (still) widely popular Copenhagen interpretation of quantum physics. Fortunately for all of humanity, there have been several physicists throughout the past 100 years who didn't let the potential destruction of their careers, or their surely negatively impacted academic reputation get in the way of their imagination enough to discourage or extinguish their desire to truly get to the bottom of such an complex theory of everything. Quantum mechanics, quantum field theory, particle physics, and other related sub-disciplines of the study of the quantum realm are still FAR from solved, and this book comprehensively explains exactly why.To conclude, I would recommend this book to anyone who desires to learn more about exactly what quantum mechanics is at a high enough level as to not get lost in the weeds along the way to a higher level understanding of the physics and philosophical questions that are simultaneously answered and asked by modern quantum-physical theories. If you have only a tangential and/or superficial understanding of quantum mechanics and enjoy a well-told history of such a field, you will enjoy this book and be inspired to learn even more in the future! 5/5 stars."
107,0465096050,http://goodreads.com/user/show/15608248-stefan-poth,2,This book is so redundant. Could relate all the details in half the pages if things were not repeated so many times.
108,0465096050,http://goodreads.com/user/show/29427094-babak,4,"The book mounts a systematic offensive against the Copenhagen Interpretation of quantum mechanics along with the historical narrative of how it came to be the dominant interpretation among physicists, especially in the era of ""big science"" after WWII funded by governments. We learn about differences in the views among the architects of quantum theory (Einstein, Bohr, de Broglie, Schrödinger, Heisenberg, Pauli, Born, and others) on what quantum theory is really about. We meet the heretics (Bohm, Everett, Bell, Clauser, Zeh, and others) who insist on a different conception of what is really out there, sometimes at great personal and professional cost. We also get a glimpse of the philosophical underpinnings of these different interpretations and the intellectual currents that reshaped them. We witness the fragile balance that physicists maintain between their daily work and professional aspirations and the fraught business of delving deeper into what that work really means for the world at large. Overall, this is a very enjoyable and informative read. On the weaker side, I wished that the discussion of the philosophy of science was done more comprehensively. Unfortunately, it only receives a shallow treatment in the book and, perhaps as a result, it contains some mischaracterizations. For example, the work of Popper is reduced to an inaccurate sketch of his demarcation criteria, i.e. ""falsifiability,"" and is attacked on this thin basis. However, Popper's philosophy of science is much more extensive and substantive than falsifiability: it's a coherent structure of rational criticism (which, in fact, the author partially spells out in his attack), in which falsifiability is but a small part.Another confusing aspect of the book's narrative is its treatment of the meaning of Bell's inequality. Multiple times, in his commentary as well as quotations of various physicists and philosophers, the author states that the violation of Bell's inequality forces us to abandon locality. However, we are also told that the many-worlds interpretation actually escapes this. This inconsistency threads through various passages and leaves a confused impression of the consequences of Bell's work and subsequent experimental findings. For example, after a dramatic discussion following the description of Bell's inequalities, we read on p. 160:""In short, Bell's Theorem really leaves only three unequivocal possibilities: either nature is nonlocal in some way, or we live in branching multiple worlds despite appearances to the contrary, or quantum physics gives incorrect predictions about certain experimental setups.""Ok. But then, when discussing the experiments of Clauser and others showing the violation of Bell's inequalities we read on p. 210:""In 1976, both Clauser and the Texas team announced their results: quantum mechanics was vindicated, and Clauser and Freedman's original result stood. Quantum nonlocality was real.""Um, really?! So, what about branching multiple worlds? This inconsistency of statements pervades the rest of the book. The many-worlds interpretation resurfaces again and again but somehow Bell proves that reality is nonlocal all the same.Much of the motivation for the book is drawn from the debate between Bohr and Einstein, which revolves (as the author clearly and correctly states) about locality. Locality is foundational in Einstein's conception of reality and a postulate of his relativity theory. However, this thread is somewhat lost in the later parts of the story. I wished it had been followed and its consequences stated more clearly. We do have a local interpretation of quantum theory without collapse and vague rumination about measurement: it is Everett's ""relative-state"" formulation and its subsequent substantiation by DeWitt, Zeh, Deutsch, and others, which leads to (not postulate) the real existence of many worlds, and provides a basis for understanding what probability means in the theory (again, instead of postulating it).

110,0465096050,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3870575-sean,5,"This was a fantastic read! At the surface level, Becker provides a lot of the necessary background in the history of both modern quantum mechanics and philosophy in order to have spirited debates at cocktail parties. What makes the read so enjoyable, however, is that the entire discussion is couched in the personalities and the interactions of the people there, originally arguing the ideas. Some of those tales are quite tragic, causing me to shout at how terrible and terribly wrong some people were or at how unfortunate the political environment was. At other times I was truly encouraged by how good ideas and rigorous, honest arguments eventually find a foothold. My only criticism might be of a span of something like 10 pages which dove into the parallel development of philosophy regarding logical positivism — I felt like the tenants of positivism were already laid out sufficiently, the history there dragged a bit and didn’t seem very necessary to the transition to realism. Anyway, there is a fair amount of philosophy within the context of interpreting quantum science, but that is part of Becker’s point that physics after WWII lost a lot of its introspection due to specialization and excessive pragmatism. I am too close to all of this stuff to say strongly that anyone would love this book but I’d certainly recommend it be given a shot."

What I mean by that is that do not expect this book to reveal to you the deep truths of quantum mechanics, or the one favoured interpretation among Copenhagen, many-worlds, pilot wave etc. Nobody knows the answers to this questions, that is the bottomline. The book is all about the journey of better understanding reality. Along the way, it reveals the fascinating personalities of key people in behind major developments in QM, and some of the intellectual impostures of the Copenhangen interpretation defenders.In my opinion, you will enjoy this book much more if you took some QM course, and is familiar with the basics of probabilities.

But it's so much more in ways I did not anticipate.It is a redemption of Albert Einstein who, the common lore (even among physicists) would have us know, has lost touch as he got older and never really accepted the strange reality of the quantum physics despite his early contributions to the field. That view is at best wildly distorted.It is a story of Niels Bohr, who's cult of personality gathered a mysticism and following that resulted in arguably the most embarrassing chapter in modern science. Their dogmatic views (summed up as the Copenhagen Interpretation) prevented physicists to probe deep into the foundations of quantum physics and our universe.Anyone who tried to understand what was actually going on would face ridicule, risk losing their job (or not being able to find one after they graduated) and would not be able to get their papers published. Even a mere association with someone questioning the dogma was risky to one's career.Questioning the status quo, trying to look for alternative interpretations, coming up with experiments that can show us holes in the current understanding are at the core of science. And yet, this pushback against even the slightest rocking of the boat was going on for several decades.Pushback that was perpetuated by extremely talented people. You'd have an easier time counting who *didn't* get a Nobel Price in the book's cast of characters. Indeed, it may be because of the unprecedented success in prediction and precision of the quantum theory that people were told to ""shut up and calculate"", killing any enquiries about the nature of the field and how it relates to our world.It is also, tragically, a story of the second World War and its disruption in the scientific field. In the thirties, the American physics was seriously behind and the vast majority of the research was going on in Berlin, Vienna and Copenhagen. A lot of that by scientists who were either of Jewish origin or who had a Jewish spouse.Hitler's anti-semitism played a large role in the quantum physics research leaving central Europe and the first atomic bomb being developed in the USA.Even though the book pushes hard against the Copenhagen interpretation and the behaviour surrounding the dogmatic positions at the time, I find it is fair to all the people involved. All of these people were brilliant scientists and that is not dismissed here.It would for example be easy to paint Niels Bohr as the villain of the story, but in addition to his undeniable contributions to physics, he was helping Jewish scientists by finding them jobs, financial help and helping them leave their countries that were about to arrest them. Other than Hitler, there are no villains here, just multi-faceted people.What is Real is a fascinating account of the physics in the last hundred years. It also made me really frustrated and often quite angry. You don't need to really know any physics to get the same out of it. It is beautifully written and I could not put it down."
121,0465096050,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4756170-daniel,5,"What physics question can’t Einstein solve? The meaning of Quantum Physics, the ‘Measurement problem’ a.k.a. Schrödinger’s cat or collapse of Quantum Wave function when a measurement is made. So the cat is neither dead or alive before measurement, but once an observation is made it has to settle in either of one state. Bohr received a Nobel prize for discovering the different energy states (quanta) of electrons in an atom. Together with Planck and Einstein, quantum theory was born. When Schrödinger discovered the wave equation, it correctly predicted the probabilistic position of the electron in an hydrogen atom. Heisenberg later discovered his uncertainty principle and then together with Bohr built the Copenhagen interpretation: ‘Shut up and calculate’. They posited that quantum theory cannot be understood the way that we experience every day life, and is only a useful equation for accurate prediction of every day effects. This infuriated many nonconformist physicists!Einstein, Podolsy and Rosen published a paper about entanglement, the paradox that entangled particles can transmit information faster than the speed of light. ‘Spooky actions at a distance’. Recent experiments seem to confirm this. Bohm suggested a pilot wave theory that helped explain the dual wave particle nature of electrons during a double slit experiment: the presence of a detector changed the wave interference pattern of the electron! It is interesting to know that Heisenberg supported Nazi Germany, while his mentor Bohr and Einstein had to flee Germany because of their Jewish lineage. That however prevented Germany from developing the atomic bomb first, since Heisenberg was a lousy practical physicist. Bohm’s theory aaa not well accepted because he was a communist. Everett suggested that wave functions do not collapse and there are actually infinite worlds. So is the cat dead or alive? Bohr says don’t ask. Everett says both but in different worlds. I am still confused. This is a great book about Quantum physics, I am sure I misunderstand large parts of it, but still learn a lot from it. "

123,0465096050,http://goodreads.com/user/show/15728519-r-hul,4,"Adam Becker, a Ph. D. in Physics, writes about interpretation of Quantum Mechanics, the enormously successful 20th century theory underpinning everything from semiconductor electronics to satellite navigation. At the heart of quantum mechanics is the ""weirdness"" summed up by Heisenberg's uncertainty principle that binds the combined accuracy with which both the position and momentum of a particle can be measured, even though the wavefunction underlying a quantum state is entirely determined by the Schrodinger equation. Most physicists rely on the Copenhagen interpretation of Quantum mechanics which separates the quantum world being measured from the classical measuring instrument and keeps the measurement process itself outside the realm of quantum mechanics. The quantum state is then interpreted as probabilistically collapsing into the measured state. This interpretation allows quantum mechanical calculations to make multiple predictions that have held up to the level of our most accurate measurements. Throughout the 20th century, the dominant view, exemplified by Richard Feynman and others, was to focus on observable and falsifiable predictions of quantum mechanics than to question whether it is complete. Einstein, Podolsky and Rosen had famously shown that Quantum mechanics is either incomplete or non-local. Although out of the mainstream, many scientists had proposed alternative interpretations of quantum mechanics to address Copenhagen's mysteries. De Broglie and Bohm developed the pilot-wave interpretation, where every particle is associated with a pilot wave, that avoids the Copenhagen collapse but introduces non-locality. Hugh Everett developed the Many Worlds interpretation where interaction between any two quantum particles leads to the creation of multiple joint wave functions in multiple universes, only one of which (the observed) is accessible to us. A third is Spontaneous Collapse in which, unlike Copenhagen, the measurement system is also a quantum object and collapse happens spontaneously, at a high probability due to the large number of quantum interactions happening when a macroscopic measurement system is used. Becker's narrative is fascinating and he is correct that insufficient attention has been paid to the fundamentals of quantum mechanics while we have reaped the benefits of its accuracy. However, it is also correct that, while intellectually illuminating, many of the alternative interpretations themselves introduce further weirdness like non-locality or are non-falsifiability. Becker is spotty when he attacks the necessity of Popperian falsifiability in a physical theory. On the one hand, it is correct that scientific progress is often inductive and grand theories are often created in retrospect to fit facts, but his central argument that a universally applied theory is falsifiable only by invoking something outside the universe itself sets too high a bar. It is often more satisfying and beneficial to keep a problem open rather than to rely on theories that do not offer measurements to falsify them. However, this is no reason not to stymie research into an area. While this book is greatly illuminating, Becker gives short shrift to the practical reasons why most physicists are more excited to work on the physics of quantum mechanics rather than its philosophical underpinnings- because physics today is a material science more than it is natural philosophy. There doesn't seem to be a conspiracy stopping research into alternatives to Copenhagen, just a preponderance of interest in testable Physics with real consequences. "
124,0465096050,http://goodreads.com/user/show/70474434-carsten,5,"Quantum Mechanics is one of the foundations of physics (jointly with relativity). Its predictions have been confirmed time and time again and underpins modern technology. It has helped us to understand how the electromagnetic and the two nuclear forces work. It is a remarkable theory. But what does the mathematical formalism mean? This book tells the story how the interpretation of Quantum Mechanics has evolved over the last 90 years or so. It is a very well written book, with a lot of historical details I was not aware of. It doesn’t cover all interpretations of Quantum Mechanics (for example, the transactional interpretation is not mentioned at all, but it has not many followers). But the author describes nicely the troubles scientists went through to make sense of this remarkable theory. Of course, John Bell’s story is told, but so are the stories of David Bohm , Hugh Everett III, Heinz-Dieter Zeh (who died in April this year) and Wojciech Zurek. It is a great book.

Yet, the equations that have come to define the field are impossible to interpret in human languages and in a way that our rationality could accept. It took a while for the greatest minds of the era to even suggest that the wave function is Schrodinger’s wave equation was a probability distribution. The debate took a material turn for the worse with Heisenberg’s uncertainty principle. How does everything so probabilistic theoretically and when unseen actualize into something concrete whenever observed?The book wonderfully elaborates on the details of the problem that splintered the scientific world and had the greatest human minds of all time metaphorically in arms against each other. The debates between Einstein, Bohr, Schrodinger, Pauli, Dirac, Heisenberg, De Broglie and others captivated the world even nearly a century later. After all, what was at stake boiled down to what is real!Hundreds of books wonderfully explain the debates that dominated the pre-war years including the EPR construct. Mr Becker’s work covers the same grounds competently, but cannot add to what has been exhaustively rehashed for decades.  The book’s true value is not in covering the rise of the Copenhagen interpretation, but its fall. The author makes the story of the Copenhagen decline and rise of alternative explanations as understandable, exciting, meaningful and absorbing as the rise - something few who have covered Bohm, Bell, Everett, Wheeler etc have been able to do. This is because the issues at hand turn materially more complex when one attempts to appreciate the equally groundbreaking and relevant work of these scientists. At philosophical and metaphysical levels, the war was between positivism and scientific realism and their sub-schools. Mathematically, even relativity came under pressure with the insertion, deletion and re-insertion of the cosmological constants. This was in the space which was easily narratable, but the mathematical debates kept on intensifying at every stage of the development of unification theories. For the lay folks, it appeared more like fights over the number of dimensions our reality has, their sizes and similar, but scientists disagreed on almost everything as the observations proved reality to be ever more bizarre. The book side-steps the arrival of dozens of subatomic particles and stops before the string theories begin their domination of the discussion, and this helps the book in keeping the focus on quantum reality. The author spends a lot of time on describing the scientists involved and their travesties. While this is often distracting, it helps humanize the story and provides relief to the non-technical readers from the mind-numbing intricacies of the quantum world.  The book makes the collapse of the Copenhagen and rise of Many Worlds far more definitive than it is in the scientific community. Even non-scientists would need dozens of books over the lifetime to develop a basic understanding of the still-shifting reality debates sparked by the quantum revolution. This book is one for any such a list because it focuses on a particular time-frame and a set of issues that are pivotal and not as well covered by almost anyone else."

To be honest, before reading Adam Becker's What is Real? I had no idea what the Copenhagen Interpretation (CI) was, much less that there was contention in the fundamental foundations of quantum physics and what significance that has for everyday ""classic"" (Newtonian) physics. Becker's book isn't just a really great primer on the material of what quantum physics is and does, but also a bountiful, if not slanted, biography of the science itself—its historical players, their public arguments, the political impacts of scientific pursuits and philosophies. I say slanted because Becker here does not even have pretenses about his feelings towards what he sees as Neils Bohr's egotistical ironclad grip on developing physics students minds and dispositions towards quantum physics and how it's to be seen simply as a mathematical ""world"" separate from the Newtonian ""classic"" world we experience. That is, it's not an observable state, so therefore it's simply a mathematical understanding of particle physics that doesn't necessarily mean something about how we experience or understand the physical realms.Becker, in his biases, however, lays out a compelling and seemingly pat philosophical reasoning for giving more credence to thinkers/physicists like John Bell and Hugh Everett's many worlds formulation. Particularly convincing in this regard are Becker's arguments against the philosophical position of falsifiability, which he posits is a logical fallacy in the sciences because of it's solipsistic myopia, and egotistical ignorance toward what may seem unsavory or overly complex.This book really has something for all tastes—some sections, particularly the ones on the Vienna Circle and their weirdly firm positions as logical positivists, seemed pulled straight out of Pynchon (specifically Against the Day). Finally, Becker's analysis of the STEM resistance to philosophy of science is informative, and slightly depressing as it almost signals a weird strain of anti-intellectual pursuit within the scientific community—a position that seems at odds with everything the sciences stand for—to be clear, the sciences need philosophy as much as philosophy needs the sciences.I would highly recommend anyone with even glancing interest in quantum physics, entanglement, the history of physics and philosophical physics to read What is Real?. Because of Becker's expertise in both writing and physics, I could well see someone even deeply immersed in quantum physics getting something of use out of the book through Becker's precise rendering of the concepts in his experiment examples and his crystal clear—yet engaging—prose. Probably one of the best pop-sci books I've read in the past 10 years."
132,0465096050,http://goodreads.com/user/show/68014166-eric-hulburd,5,"Take my review from a computer/environmental engineer's perspective, not a physicist's. I thought this book was excellent. I've read a few other books on QM that really focused on the math (Leonard Susskind's was great for this). However, while understanding the math is important for applications of QM, my interest really lies in the unintuitive mysteries of quantum physics.This book brings that mystery down to Earth in a somewhat ironic way. As the book explains, ""Shut up and calculate"" is often invoked as a defense of the persistence of ""the"" Copenhagen interpretation. It has brought us wonders in modern science and technology. Becker leaves no doubt about that. However, the irony is that Mermin (original author of quote) went on to explain that he won't shut up. There is something deeply incomplete about the Copenhagen interpretation. In fact, the skepticism towards quantum foundation research (and philosophy of science more broadly) has, in part, enabled an interpretation of QM that feeds wishy washy pseudo-science spirituality (eg Deepak Chopra's insistence that's we exist within a quantum soup through which we can will our desires into existence). Rather than clearly calling out Copenhagen's implicit philosophical reliance on the role of observation/consciousness in creating our knowable reality, it's waved away, along with equally robust, but perhaps more philosophically feasible explanations for what we widely refer to as QM wave function collapse.Perhaps most powerfully, the book defends its philosophical concerns by pointing out, through science history, that truth, even scientific truth, is often shaped powerfully by personalities and culture. Predominance of Bohr's Copenhagen interpretation may be due to Bohr's greater charisma and personableness relative to that of Einstein's, Bohm's willingness to voice sympathy for socialism, or Everett's distaste for public speaking. Or perhaps, simply because the Copenhagen interpretation was the first interpretation to be defined, if not in terms of a coherent theory, at least semantically. Overall, an approachable and clear look at the philosophical implications and history of quantum mechanics. I highly recommend to anyone interested in either of those topics.PS I'm pursuing both criticisms and alternative perspectives to Becker's since this is my first foray into the topic."
133,0465096050,http://goodreads.com/user/show/19059859-sean,5,"Excellent book. You really need to like physics to fully follow this book. It might not have equations, but it requires you to be ready to discuss serious meanings of quantum physics. Extremely well researched. Fantastic insight to all the personalities involved. The author respects all the players, but talks very frankly about them as people with histories, political motives, academic motives and their time/place in human history. As a physics teacher, I fully understand today's ""Shut up and Calculate"" approach to teaching. It is so refreshing to read about how some of the greatest minds to walk the Earth debated and rethought their own ideas on the meaning of all this quantum weirdness.The index and bibliography are great. Even though I teach physics, I still would have liked a glossary section with brief explanations of terms like: complimentarity, Copenhagen interpretation, positivism, logical empiricism, falsifiability, many-worlds, measurement problem, pilot wave, spontaneous collapse. This could really help the non-physics majors.Reading recommendation: try reading the 6 pages at the end first: ""Appendix: Four Views of the Strangest Experiment"". The experiment is easy to understand. The four views then represent the views discussed in the book. Sure, the terminology hasn't yet been explained if you read this first, but I still think it would make a perfect 1st chapter to fully set the stage.I borrowed this book from my local library. I believe I need to buy a copy and read it again with my notebook/pen handy. Again, the bibliography represents a gold-mine of material I really haven't explored (physics philosophy)."

When I got to page 286 the author indicated Roger Penrose had the same thought. You could have knocked me over with a feather. If an author can help me understand something and have an insight on a topic I have struggled to understand for 30 years in only 18 pages, I would suggest it is a book worth reading, if you are interested in this particular subject. If you have every tried to understand the ""weirdness"" of quantum theory, this is the book to read."
136,0465096050,http://goodreads.com/user/show/85723871-thomas-dietert,5,"I thoroughly enjoyed this well-written account of the past hundred years of the theory of quantum mechanics, it's inception as a popular field of theoretical physics, and the steady progression and development of the Copenhagen interpretation along with rival theories including Everett's ""many worlds"" theorem, Bohm's pilot-wave theory, and Bell's proof that physics must be ""nonlocal"" (seemingly refuting the notion of Einstein's theory of relativity).The author does a wonderful job of setting the stage in the first third of the book, choosing to focus on the contributions, formulations, and theories of Heisenberg, Schrodinger, De-Broglie, Pierls, Einstein, Bohr, and other notable physicists at the time, and how they all came together to concoct an ""interpretation"" of quantum mechanics known as The Copenhagen interpretation. Not all physicists during the early years of quantum mechanical theory agreed on this interpretation, and the author does a great job of referencing cited material about the theories of these seminal scientists, and intriguingly describes the ways in which they disagreed about such an interpretation; i.e. Einstein was convinced that the ""measurement problem"" was a deep-seated flaw in the interpretation, whereas Bohr (and Heisenberg and friend) all argued was irrelevant. The author follows the development of such conflicting ideas, suggests reasons for why such disagreements weren't easily reconciled, and connects such ideological conflicts with the global political and economic climate (WWI, WWII), also illustrating the influence of classic philosophical movements (such as logical positivism via Mach & The Vienna Circle) on the ""accepted"" interpretation of quantum mechanics.The second third of the book describes the development of such theorems as Bohm's pilot-wave interpretation of quantum w decades go by and the measurement problem still hasn't been solved; The Copenhagen Interpretation still reigns supreme (though nobody can adequately define the collection of theories and experiments that comprise it), and anyone who thinks that there might be more to the ""quantum realm"" than is summed up in the Denmark Dogma is voraciously attacked and all but chased out of the academic field of physics. Fortunately, there are a few physicists with enough notoriety and clout (e.g. Bohm, Bell, etc) that produce some theories and proofs that offer alternative interpretations to Bohr's Copenhagen interpretation, as well as a few physicists (e.g. Everett) who are just in it for the fun of the field and could care less about whether or not their theories are accepted by the majority of physicists. In the latter half of the second third, and well into the last third of the book, the author continues to contextualize the sub-field of quantum physics with the rest of history, and describes the trials and tribulations of such physicists as Zeh, Clauser, and Wheeler (whom never really knew what theory to advocate for) whom continued to develop such esoteric and heretical theories and experiments (Zeh: many worlds, Clauser: Bell's inequality, etc). It was unfortunate to learn that perhaps the greatest reason for the lack of acceptance of such ""progress"" was that the field of physics became far too focused on pragmatic engineering applications following World War II, and dismissed any such reformulation of the ""foundations of quantum mechanics"" as ""Metaphysical Nonsense"" (continuing the trend of the Copenhagen cabal of the earls 1900s); Luckily for us, this was not enough to stop the creation or discovery of quantum field theory, which attempts to answer some of the further questions asked by such alternative theories as Zeh's ""decoherence"" principle (extending/reformulating Everett's many-worlds theorem) and Bell's inequality.The story ends with an account of the current state of these theories, the experimental result contributing to or refuting currently widely accepted theories of quantum mechanics, introducing potential solutions to the existing theoretical gaps (such as quantum gravity), describing the origins of and contextual placement of the application of quantum mechanics to computation (quantum computing a la Deutsch), and adequately and pleasingly summarizing the current state of the field.The author does a great job of conveying that the point of the book is to illustrate the philosophical (and truly quantum-physical) gaps in the (still) widely popular Copenhagen interpretation of quantum physics. Fortunately for all of humanity, there have been several physicists throughout the past 100 years who didn't let the potential destruction of their careers, or their surely negatively impacted academic reputation get in the way of their imagination enough to discourage or extinguish their desire to truly get to the bottom of such an complex theory of everything. Quantum mechanics, quantum field theory, particle physics, and other related sub-disciplines of the study of the quantum realm are still FAR from solved, and this book comprehensively explains exactly why.To conclude, I would recommend this book to anyone who desires to learn more about exactly what quantum mechanics is at a high enough level as to not get lost in the weeds along the way to a higher level understanding of the physics and philosophical questions that are simultaneously answered and asked by modern quantum-physical theories. If you have only a tangential and/or superficial understanding of quantum mechanics and enjoy a well-told history of such a field, you will enjoy this book and be inspired to learn even more in the future! 5/5 stars."
137,0465096050,http://goodreads.com/user/show/15608248-stefan-poth,2,This book is so redundant. Could relate all the details in half the pages if things were not repeated so many times.
138,0465096050,http://goodreads.com/user/show/29427094-babak,4,"The book mounts a systematic offensive against the Copenhagen Interpretation of quantum mechanics along with the historical narrative of how it came to be the dominant interpretation among physicists, especially in the era of ""big science"" after WWII funded by governments. We learn about differences in the views among the architects of quantum theory (Einstein, Bohr, de Broglie, Schrödinger, Heisenberg, Pauli, Born, and others) on what quantum theory is really about. We meet the heretics (Bohm, Everett, Bell, Clauser, Zeh, and others) who insist on a different conception of what is really out there, sometimes at great personal and professional cost. We also get a glimpse of the philosophical underpinnings of these different interpretations and the intellectual currents that reshaped them. We witness the fragile balance that physicists maintain between their daily work and professional aspirations and the fraught business of delving deeper into what that work really means for the world at large. Overall, this is a very enjoyable and informative read. On the weaker side, I wished that the discussion of the philosophy of science was done more comprehensively. Unfortunately, it only receives a shallow treatment in the book and, perhaps as a result, it contains some mischaracterizations. For example, the work of Popper is reduced to an inaccurate sketch of his demarcation criteria, i.e. ""falsifiability,"" and is attacked on this thin basis. However, Popper's philosophy of science is much more extensive and substantive than falsifiability: it's a coherent structure of rational criticism (which, in fact, the author partially spells out in his attack), in which falsifiability is but a small part.Another confusing aspect of the book's narrative is its treatment of the meaning of Bell's inequality. Multiple times, in his commentary as well as quotations of various physicists and philosophers, the author states that the violation of Bell's inequality forces us to abandon locality. However, we are also told that the many-worlds interpretation actually escapes this. This inconsistency threads through various passages and leaves a confused impression of the consequences of Bell's work and subsequent experimental findings. For example, after a dramatic discussion following the description of Bell's inequalities, we read on p. 160:""In short, Bell's Theorem really leaves only three unequivocal possibilities: either nature is nonlocal in some way, or we live in branching multiple worlds despite appearances to the contrary, or quantum physics gives incorrect predictions about certain experimental setups.""Ok. But then, when discussing the experiments of Clauser and others showing the violation of Bell's inequalities we read on p. 210:""In 1976, both Clauser and the Texas team announced their results: quantum mechanics was vindicated, and Clauser and Freedman's original result stood. Quantum nonlocality was real.""Um, really?! So, what about branching multiple worlds? This inconsistency of statements pervades the rest of the book. The many-worlds interpretation resurfaces again and again but somehow Bell proves that reality is nonlocal all the same.Much of the motivation for the book is drawn from the debate between Bohr and Einstein, which revolves (as the author clearly and correctly states) about locality. Locality is foundational in Einstein's conception of reality and a postulate of his relativity theory. However, this thread is somewhat lost in the later parts of the story. I wished it had been followed and its consequences stated more clearly. We do have a local interpretation of quantum theory without collapse and vague rumination about measurement: it is Everett's ""relative-state"" formulation and its subsequent substantiation by DeWitt, Zeh, Deutsch, and others, which leads to (not postulate) the real existence of many worlds, and provides a basis for understanding what probability means in the theory (again, instead of postulating it).

140,0465096050,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3870575-sean,5,"This was a fantastic read! At the surface level, Becker provides a lot of the necessary background in the history of both modern quantum mechanics and philosophy in order to have spirited debates at cocktail parties. What makes the read so enjoyable, however, is that the entire discussion is couched in the personalities and the interactions of the people there, originally arguing the ideas. Some of those tales are quite tragic, causing me to shout at how terrible and terribly wrong some people were or at how unfortunate the political environment was. At other times I was truly encouraged by how good ideas and rigorous, honest arguments eventually find a foothold. My only criticism might be of a span of something like 10 pages which dove into the parallel development of philosophy regarding logical positivism — I felt like the tenants of positivism were already laid out sufficiently, the history there dragged a bit and didn’t seem very necessary to the transition to realism. Anyway, there is a fair amount of philosophy within the context of interpreting quantum science, but that is part of Becker’s point that physics after WWII lost a lot of its introspection due to specialization and excessive pragmatism. I am too close to all of this stuff to say strongly that anyone would love this book but I’d certainly recommend it be given a shot."

The book is all about the journey of better understanding reality. Along the way, it reveals the fascinating personalities of key people in behind major developments in QM, and some of the intellectual impostures of the Copenhangen interpretation defenders.In my opinion, you will enjoy this book much more if you took some QM course, and is familiar with the basics of probabilities.

But it's so much more in ways I did not anticipate.It is a redemption of Albert Einstein who, the common lore (even among physicists) would have us know, has lost touch as he got older and never really accepted the strange reality of the quantum physics despite his early contributions to the field. That view is at best wildly distorted.It is a story of Niels Bohr, who's cult of personality gathered a mysticism and following that resulted in arguably the most embarrassing chapter in modern science. Their dogmatic views (summed up as the Copenhagen Interpretation) prevented physicists to probe deep into the foundations of quantum physics and our universe.Anyone who tried to understand what was actually going on would face ridicule, risk losing their job (or not being able to find one after they graduated) and would not be able to get their papers published. Even a mere association with someone questioning the dogma was risky to one's career.Questioning the status quo, trying to look for alternative interpretations, coming up with experiments that can show us holes in the current understanding are at the core of science. And yet, this pushback against even the slightest rocking of the boat was going on for several decades.Pushback that was perpetuated by extremely talented people. You'd have an easier time counting who *didn't* get a Nobel Price in the book's cast of characters. Indeed, it may be because of the unprecedented success in prediction and precision of the quantum theory that people were told to ""shut up and calculate"", killing any enquiries about the nature of the field and how it relates to our world.It is also, tragically, a story of the second World War and its disruption in the scientific field. In the thirties, the American physics was seriously behind and the vast majority of the research was going on in Berlin, Vienna and Copenhagen. A lot of that by scientists who were either of Jewish origin or who had a Jewish spouse.Hitler's anti-semitism played a large role in the quantum physics research leaving central Europe and the first atomic bomb being developed in the USA.Even though the book pushes hard against the Copenhagen interpretation and the behaviour surrounding the dogmatic positions at the time, I find it is fair to all the people involved. All of these people were brilliant scientists and that is not dismissed here.It would for example be easy to paint Niels Bohr as the villain of the story, but in addition to his undeniable contributions to physics, he was helping Jewish scientists by finding them jobs, financial help and helping them leave their countries that were about to arrest them. Other than Hitler, there are no villains here, just multi-faceted people.What is Real is a fascinating account of the physics in the last hundred years. It also made me really frustrated and often quite angry. You don't need to really know any physics to get the same out of it. It is beautifully written and I could not put it down."

Schrödinger’s cat or collapse of Quantum Wave function when a measurement is made. So the cat is neither dead or alive before measurement, but once an observation is made it has to settle in either of one state. Bohr received a Nobel prize for discovering the different energy states (quanta) of electrons in an atom. Together with Planck and Einstein, quantum theory was born. When Schrödinger discovered the wave equation, it correctly predicted the probabilistic position of the electron in an hydrogen atom. Heisenberg later discovered his uncertainty principle and then together with Bohr built the Copenhagen interpretation: ‘Shut up and calculate’. They posited that quantum theory cannot be understood the way that we experience every day life, and is only a useful equation for accurate prediction of every day effects. This infuriated many nonconformist physicists!Einstein, Podolsy and Rosen published a paper about entanglement, the paradox that entangled particles can transmit information faster than the speed of light. ‘Spooky actions at a distance’. Recent experiments seem to confirm this. Bohm suggested a pilot wave theory that helped explain the dual wave particle nature of electrons during a double slit experiment: the presence of a detector changed the wave interference pattern of the electron! It is interesting to know that Heisenberg supported Nazi Germany, while his mentor Bohr and Einstein had to flee Germany because of their Jewish lineage. That however prevented Germany from developing the atomic bomb first, since Heisenberg was a lousy practical physicist. Bohm’s theory aaa not well accepted because he was a communist. Everett suggested that wave functions do not collapse and there are actually infinite worlds. So is the cat dead or alive? Bohr says don’t ask. Everett says both but in different worlds.

153,0465096050,http://goodreads.com/user/show/15728519-r-hul,4,"Adam Becker, a Ph. D. in Physics, writes about interpretation of Quantum Mechanics, the enormously successful 20th century theory underpinning everything from semiconductor electronics to satellite navigation. At the heart of quantum mechanics is the ""weirdness"" summed up by Heisenberg's uncertainty principle that binds the combined accuracy with which both the position and momentum of a particle can be measured, even though the wavefunction underlying a quantum state is entirely determined by the Schrodinger equation. Most physicists rely on the Copenhagen interpretation of Quantum mechanics which separates the quantum world being measured from the classical measuring instrument and keeps the measurement process itself outside the realm of quantum mechanics. The quantum state is then interpreted as probabilistically collapsing into the measured state. This interpretation allows quantum mechanical calculations to make multiple predictions that have held up to the level of our most accurate measurements. Throughout the 20th century, the dominant view, exemplified by Richard Feynman and others, was to focus on observable and falsifiable predictions of quantum mechanics than to question whether it is complete. Einstein, Podolsky and Rosen had famously shown that Quantum mechanics is either incomplete or non-local. Although out of the mainstream, many scientists had proposed alternative interpretations of quantum mechanics to address Copenhagen's mysteries. De Broglie and Bohm developed the pilot-wave interpretation, where every particle is associated with a pilot wave, that avoids the Copenhagen collapse but introduces non-locality. Hugh Everett developed the Many Worlds interpretation where interaction between any two quantum particles leads to the creation of multiple joint wave functions in multiple universes, only one of which (the observed) is accessible to us. A third is Spontaneous Collapse in which, unlike Copenhagen, the measurement system is also a quantum object and collapse happens spontaneously, at a high probability due to the large number of quantum interactions happening when a macroscopic measurement system is used. Becker's narrative is fascinating and he is correct that insufficient attention has been paid to the fundamentals of quantum mechanics while we have reaped the benefits of its accuracy. However, it is also correct that, while intellectually illuminating, many of the alternative interpretations themselves introduce further weirdness like non-locality or are non-falsifiability. Becker is spotty when he attacks the necessity of Popperian falsifiability in a physical theory. On the one hand, it is correct that scientific progress is often inductive and grand theories are often created in retrospect to fit facts, but his central argument that a universally applied theory is falsifiable only by invoking something outside the universe itself sets too high a bar. It is often more satisfying and beneficial to keep a problem open rather than to rely on theories that do not offer measurements to falsify them. However, this is no reason not to stymie research into an area. While this book is greatly illuminating, Becker gives short shrift to the practical reasons why most physicists are more excited to work on the physics of quantum mechanics rather than its philosophical underpinnings- because physics today is a material science more than it is natural philosophy. There doesn't seem to be a conspiracy stopping research into alternatives to Copenhagen, just a preponderance of interest in testable Physics with real consequences. "

Its predictions have been confirmed time and time again and underpins modern technology. It has helped us to understand how the electromagnetic and the two nuclear forces work. It is a remarkable theory. But what does the mathematical formalism mean? This book tells the story how the interpretation of Quantum Mechanics has evolved over the last 90 years or so. It is a very well written book, with a lot of historical details I was not aware of. It doesn’t cover all interpretations of Quantum Mechanics (for example, the transactional interpretation is not mentioned at all, but it has not many followers). But the author describes nicely the troubles scientists went through to make sense of this remarkable theory. Of course, John Bell’s story is told, but so are the stories of David Bohm , Hugh Everett III, Heinz-Dieter Zeh (who died in April this year) and Wojciech Zurek. It is a great book.

But then all the scientists who expresses doubts about the totally vague and convoluted theory (don't ask why it works, it just works; you can't measure it so never mind; It only happens when you're watching it; etc) were ostracized, unpublished, unemployed by universities; they had a tough go of it. Now people are actually seriously daring to question the unfathomable Niels Bohr. Interesting coverage of the theory and the controversy."

In short, it appears: there's no external reality; there is a an external reality, but it's bizarre in one or more of any number of ways (depending on specific theory you subscribe to); or there are infinitely many external realities, only one of which I have access to as I type this review (and an infinite number of fellow me's, in an infinity of other worlds, do more or less the same). The author does an exceptional job of telling the history, describing the science, and explaining both the related sociology and philosophy of science, and why it all matters.

160,0465096050,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5917740-nilesh,5,"What is Real is a masterpiece in the way it narrates the quest to find the meaning behind the quantum equations.Quantum science works, like almost nothing else humans have ever invented. Yet, the equations that have come to define the field are impossible to interpret in human languages and in a way that our rationality could accept. It took a while for the greatest minds of the era to even suggest that the wave function is Schrodinger’s wave equation was a probability distribution. The debate took a material turn for the worse with Heisenberg’s uncertainty principle. How does everything so probabilistic theoretically and when unseen actualize into something concrete whenever observed?The book wonderfully elaborates on the details of the problem that splintered the scientific world and had the greatest human minds of all time metaphorically in arms against each other. The debates between Einstein, Bohr, Schrodinger, Pauli, Dirac, Heisenberg, De Broglie and others captivated the world even nearly a century later. After all, what was at stake boiled down to what is real!Hundreds of books wonderfully explain the debates that dominated the pre-war years including the EPR construct. Mr Becker’s work covers the same grounds competently, but cannot add to what has been exhaustively rehashed for decades.  The book’s true value is not in covering the rise of the Copenhagen interpretation, but its fall. The author makes the story of the Copenhagen decline and rise of alternative explanations as understandable, exciting, meaningful and absorbing as the rise - something few who have covered Bohm, Bell, Everett, Wheeler etc have been able to do. This is because the issues at hand turn materially more complex when one attempts to appreciate the equally groundbreaking and relevant work of these scientists. At philosophical and metaphysical levels, the war was between positivism and scientific realism and their sub-schools. Mathematically, even relativity came under pressure with the insertion, deletion and re-insertion of the cosmological constants. This was in the space which was easily narratable, but the mathematical debates kept on intensifying at every stage of the development of unification theories. For the lay folks, it appeared more like fights over the number of dimensions our reality has, their sizes and similar, but scientists disagreed on almost everything as the observations proved reality to be ever more bizarre. The book side-steps the arrival of dozens of subatomic particles and stops before the string theories begin their domination of the discussion, and this helps the book in keeping the focus on quantum reality. The author spends a lot of time on describing the scientists involved and their travesties. While this is often distracting, it helps humanize the story and provides relief to the non-technical readers from the mind-numbing intricacies of the quantum world.  The book makes the collapse of the Copenhagen and rise of Many Worlds far more definitive than it is in the scientific community. Even non-scientists would need dozens of books over the lifetime to develop a basic understanding of the still-shifting reality debates sparked by the quantum revolution. This book is one for any such a list because it focuses on a particular time-frame and a set of issues that are pivotal and not as well covered by almost anyone else."
161,0465096050,http://goodreads.com/user/show/22428213-ian-scuffling,5,"It was a bastardization of Schrödinger's cat that introduced me to the ideas of quantum physics, and since then the topic has been something that I've held deep interest in (albeit from a very amateur's view, not really digging into the nuances other than to understand the prevailing ideas)—my interest has been particularly in terms of the philosophy and existentialism inherent in the problems that the theories present to our experience of the world. To be honest, before reading Adam Becker's What is Real? I had no idea what the Copenhagen Interpretation (CI) was, much less that there was contention in the fundamental foundations of quantum physics and what significance that has for everyday ""classic"" (Newtonian) physics. Becker's book isn't just a really great primer on the material of what quantum physics is and does, but also a bountiful, if not slanted, biography of the science itself—its historical players, their public arguments, the political impacts of scientific pursuits and philosophies. I say slanted because Becker here does not even have pretenses about his feelings towards what he sees as Neils Bohr's egotistical ironclad grip on developing physics students minds and dispositions towards quantum physics and how it's to be seen simply as a mathematical ""world"" separate from the Newtonian ""classic"" world we experience. That is, it's not an observable state, so therefore it's simply a mathematical understanding of particle physics that doesn't necessarily mean something about how we experience or understand the physical realms.Becker, in his biases, however, lays out a compelling and seemingly pat philosophical reasoning for giving more credence to thinkers/physicists like John Bell and Hugh Everett's many worlds formulation. Particularly convincing in this regard are Becker's arguments against the philosophical position of falsifiability, which he posits is a logical fallacy in the sciences because of it's solipsistic myopia, and egotistical ignorance toward what may seem unsavory or overly complex.This book really has something for all tastes—some sections, particularly the ones on the Vienna Circle and their weirdly firm positions as logical positivists, seemed pulled straight out of Pynchon (specifically Against the Day). Finally, Becker's analysis of the STEM resistance to philosophy of science is informative, and slightly depressing as it almost signals a weird strain of anti-intellectual pursuit within the scientific community—a position that seems at odds with everything the sciences stand for—to be clear, the sciences need philosophy as much as philosophy needs the sciences.I would highly recommend anyone with even glancing interest in quantum physics, entanglement, the history of physics and philosophical physics to read What is Real?. Because of Becker's expertise in both writing and physics, I could well see someone even deeply immersed in quantum physics getting something of use out of the book through Becker's precise rendering of the concepts in his experiment examples and his crystal clear—yet engaging—prose. Probably one of the best pop-sci books I've read in the past 10 years."
162,0465096050,http://goodreads.com/user/show/68014166-eric-hulburd,5,"Take my review from a computer/environmental engineer's perspective, not a physicist's. I thought this book was excellent. I've read a few other books on QM that really focused on the math (Leonard Susskind's was great for this). However, while understanding the math is important for applications of QM, my interest really lies in the unintuitive mysteries of quantum physics.This book brings that mystery down to Earth in a somewhat ironic way. As the book explains, ""Shut up and calculate"" is often invoked as a defense of the persistence of ""the"" Copenhagen interpretation. It has brought us wonders in modern science and technology. Becker leaves no doubt about that. However, the irony is that Mermin (original author of quote) went on to explain that he won't shut up. There is something deeply incomplete about the Copenhagen interpretation. In fact, the skepticism towards quantum foundation research (and philosophy of science more broadly) has, in part, enabled an interpretation of QM that feeds wishy washy pseudo-science spirituality (eg Deepak Chopra's insistence that's we exist within a quantum soup through which we can will our desires into existence). Rather than clearly calling out Copenhagen's implicit philosophical reliance on the role of observation/consciousness in creating our knowable reality, it's waved away, along with equally robust, but perhaps more philosophically feasible explanations for what we widely refer to as QM wave function collapse.Perhaps most powerfully, the book defends its philosophical concerns by pointing out, through science history, that truth, even scientific truth, is often shaped powerfully by personalities and culture. Predominance of Bohr's Copenhagen interpretation may be due to Bohr's greater charisma and personableness relative to that of Einstein's, Bohm's willingness to voice sympathy for socialism, or Everett's distaste for public speaking. Or perhaps, simply because the Copenhagen interpretation was the first interpretation to be defined, if not in terms of a coherent theory, at least semantically. Overall, an approachable and clear look at the philosophical implications and history of quantum mechanics. I highly recommend to anyone interested in either of those topics.PS I'm pursuing both criticisms and alternative perspectives to Becker's since this is my first foray into the topic."
163,0465096050,http://goodreads.com/user/show/19059859-sean,5,"Excellent book. You really need to like physics to fully follow this book. It might not have equations, but it requires you to be ready to discuss serious meanings of quantum physics. Extremely well researched. Fantastic insight to all the personalities involved. The author respects all the players, but talks very frankly about them as people with histories, political motives, academic motives and their time/place in human history. As a physics teacher, I fully understand today's ""Shut up and Calculate"" approach to teaching. It is so refreshing to read about how some of the greatest minds to walk the Earth debated and rethought their own ideas on the meaning of all this quantum weirdness.The index and bibliography are great. Even though I teach physics, I still would have liked a glossary section with brief explanations of terms like: complimentarity, Copenhagen interpretation, positivism, logical empiricism, falsifiability, many-worlds, measurement problem, pilot wave, spontaneous collapse. This could really help the non-physics majors.Reading recommendation: try reading the 6 pages at the end first: ""Appendix: Four Views of the Strangest Experiment"". The experiment is easy to understand. The four views then represent the views discussed in the book. Sure, the terminology hasn't yet been explained if you read this first, but I still think it would make a perfect 1st chapter to fully set the stage.I borrowed this book from my local library. I believe I need to buy a copy and read it again with my notebook/pen handy. Again, the bibliography represents a gold-mine of material I really haven't explored (physics philosophy)."

If an author can help me understand something and have an insight on a topic I have struggled to understand for 30 years in only 18 pages, I would suggest it is a book worth reading, if you are interested in this particular subject. If you have every tried to understand the ""weirdness"" of quantum theory, this is the book to read."
166,0465096050,http://goodreads.com/user/show/85723871-thomas-dietert,5,"I thoroughly enjoyed this well-written account of the past hundred years of the theory of quantum mechanics, it's inception as a popular field of theoretical physics, and the steady progression and development of the Copenhagen interpretation along with rival theories including Everett's ""many worlds"" theorem, Bohm's pilot-wave theory, and Bell's proof that physics must be ""nonlocal"" (seemingly refuting the notion of Einstein's theory of relativity).The author does a wonderful job of setting the stage in the first third of the book, choosing to focus on the contributions, formulations, and theories of Heisenberg, Schrodinger, De-Broglie, Pierls, Einstein, Bohr, and other notable physicists at the time, and how they all came together to concoct an ""interpretation"" of quantum mechanics known as The Copenhagen interpretation. Not all physicists during the early years of quantum mechanical theory agreed on this interpretation, and the author does a great job of referencing cited material about the theories of these seminal scientists, and intriguingly describes the ways in which they disagreed about such an interpretation; i.e. Einstein was convinced that the ""measurement problem"" was a deep-seated flaw in the interpretation, whereas Bohr (and Heisenberg and friend) all argued was irrelevant. The author follows the development of such conflicting ideas, suggests reasons for why such disagreements weren't easily reconciled, and connects such ideological conflicts with the global political and economic climate (WWI, WWII), also illustrating the influence of classic philosophical movements (such as logical positivism via Mach & The Vienna Circle) on the ""accepted"" interpretation of quantum mechanics.The second third of the book describes the development of such theorems as Bohm's pilot-wave interpretation of quantum w decades go by and the measurement problem still hasn't been solved; The Copenhagen Interpretation still reigns supreme (though nobody can adequately define the collection of theories and experiments that comprise it), and anyone who thinks that there might be more to the ""quantum realm"" than is summed up in the Denmark Dogma is voraciously attacked and all but chased out of the academic field of physics. Fortunately, there are a few physicists with enough notoriety and clout (e.g. Bohm, Bell, etc) that produce some theories and proofs that offer alternative interpretations to Bohr's Copenhagen interpretation, as well as a few physicists (e.g. Everett) who are just in it for the fun of the field and could care less about whether or not their theories are accepted by the majority of physicists. In the latter half of the second third, and well into the last third of the book, the author continues to contextualize the sub-field of quantum physics with the rest of history, and describes the trials and tribulations of such physicists as Zeh, Clauser, and Wheeler (whom never really knew what theory to advocate for) whom continued to develop such esoteric and heretical theories and experiments (Zeh: many worlds, Clauser: Bell's inequality, etc). It was unfortunate to learn that perhaps the greatest reason for the lack of acceptance of such ""progress"" was that the field of physics became far too focused on pragmatic engineering applications following World War II, and dismissed any such reformulation of the ""foundations of quantum mechanics"" as ""Metaphysical Nonsense"" (continuing the trend of the Copenhagen cabal of the earls 1900s); Luckily for us, this was not enough to stop the creation or discovery of quantum field theory, which attempts to answer some of the further questions asked by such alternative theories as Zeh's ""decoherence"" principle (extending/reformulating Everett's many-worlds theorem) and Bell's inequality.The story ends with an account of the current state of these theories, the experimental result contributing to or refuting currently widely accepted theories of quantum mechanics, introducing potential solutions to the existing theoretical gaps (such as quantum gravity), describing the origins of and contextual placement of the application of quantum mechanics to computation (quantum computing a la Deutsch), and adequately and pleasingly summarizing the current state of the field.The author does a great job of conveying that the point of the book is to illustrate the philosophical (and truly quantum-physical) gaps in the (still) widely popular Copenhagen interpretation of quantum physics. Fortunately for all of humanity, there have been several physicists throughout the past 100 years who didn't let the potential destruction of their careers, or their surely negatively impacted academic reputation get in the way of their imagination enough to discourage or extinguish their desire to truly get to the bottom of such an complex theory of everything. Quantum mechanics, quantum field theory, particle physics, and other related sub-disciplines of the study of the quantum realm are still FAR from solved, and this book comprehensively explains exactly why.To conclude, I would recommend this book to anyone who desires to learn more about exactly what quantum mechanics is at a high enough level as to not get lost in the weeds along the way to a higher level understanding of the physics and philosophical questions that are simultaneously answered and asked by modern quantum-physical theories. If you have only a tangential and/or superficial understanding of quantum mechanics and enjoy a well-told history of such a field, you will enjoy this book and be inspired to learn even more in the future! 5/5 stars."
167,0465096050,http://goodreads.com/user/show/15608248-stefan-poth,2,This book is so redundant. Could relate all the details in half the pages if things were not repeated so many times.
168,0465096050,http://goodreads.com/user/show/29427094-babak,4,"The book mounts a systematic offensive against the Copenhagen Interpretation of quantum mechanics along with the historical narrative of how it came to be the dominant interpretation among physicists, especially in the era of ""big science"" after WWII funded by governments. We learn about differences in the views among the architects of quantum theory (Einstein, Bohr, de Broglie, Schrödinger, Heisenberg, Pauli, Born, and others) on what quantum theory is really about. We meet the heretics (Bohm, Everett, Bell, Clauser, Zeh, and others) who insist on a different conception of what is really out there, sometimes at great personal and professional cost. We also get a glimpse of the philosophical underpinnings of these different interpretations and the intellectual currents that reshaped them. We witness the fragile balance that physicists maintain between their daily work and professional aspirations and the fraught business of delving deeper into what that work really means for the world at large. Overall, this is a very enjoyable and informative read. On the weaker side, I wished that the discussion of the philosophy of science was done more comprehensively. Unfortunately, it only receives a shallow treatment in the book and, perhaps as a result, it contains some mischaracterizations. For example, the work of Popper is reduced to an inaccurate sketch of his demarcation criteria, i.e. ""falsifiability,"" and is attacked on this thin basis. However, Popper's philosophy of science is much more extensive and substantive than falsifiability: it's a coherent structure of rational criticism (which, in fact, the author partially spells out in his attack), in which falsifiability is but a small part.Another confusing aspect of the book's narrative is its treatment of the meaning of Bell's inequality. Multiple times, in his commentary as well as quotations of various physicists and philosophers, the author states that the violation of Bell's inequality forces us to abandon locality. However, we are also told that the many-worlds interpretation actually escapes this. This inconsistency threads through various passages and leaves a confused impression of the consequences of Bell's work and subsequent experimental findings. For example, after a dramatic discussion following the description of Bell's inequalities, we read on p. 160:""In short, Bell's Theorem really leaves only three unequivocal possibilities: either nature is nonlocal in some way, or we live in branching multiple worlds despite appearances to the contrary, or quantum physics gives incorrect predictions about certain experimental setups.""Ok. But then, when discussing the experiments of Clauser and others showing the violation of Bell's inequalities we read on p. 210:""In 1976, both Clauser and the Texas team announced their results: quantum mechanics was vindicated, and Clauser and Freedman's original result stood. Quantum nonlocality was real.""Um, really?! So, what about branching multiple worlds? This inconsistency of statements pervades the rest of the book. The many-worlds interpretation resurfaces again and again but somehow Bell proves that reality is nonlocal all the same.Much of the motivation for the book is drawn from the debate between Bohr and Einstein, which revolves (as the author clearly and correctly states) about locality. Locality is foundational in Einstein's conception of reality and a postulate of his relativity theory. However, this thread is somewhat lost in the later parts of the story. I wished it had been followed and its consequences stated more clearly. We do have a local interpretation of quantum theory without collapse and vague rumination about measurement: it is Everett's ""relative-state"" formulation and its subsequent substantiation by DeWitt, Zeh, Deutsch, and others, which leads to (not postulate) the real existence of many worlds, and provides a basis for understanding what probability means in the theory (again, instead of postulating it).

170,0465096050,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3870575-sean,5,"This was a fantastic read! At the surface level, Becker provides a lot of the necessary background in the history of both modern quantum mechanics and philosophy in order to have spirited debates at cocktail parties. What makes the read so enjoyable, however, is that the entire discussion is couched in the personalities and the interactions of the people there, originally arguing the ideas. Some of those tales are quite tragic, causing me to shout at how terrible and terribly wrong some people were or at how unfortunate the political environment was. At other times I was truly encouraged by how good ideas and rigorous, honest arguments eventually find a foothold. My only criticism might be of a span of something like 10 pages which dove into the parallel development of philosophy regarding logical positivism — I felt like the tenants of positivism were already laid out sufficiently, the history there dragged a bit and didn’t seem very necessary to the transition to realism. Anyway, there is a fair amount of philosophy within the context of interpreting quantum science, but that is part of Becker’s point that physics after WWII lost a lot of its introspection due to specialization and excessive pragmatism. I am too close to all of this stuff to say strongly that anyone would love this book but I’d certainly recommend it be given a shot."

The book is all about the journey of better understanding reality. Along the way, it reveals the fascinating personalities of key people in behind major developments in QM, and some of the intellectual impostures of the Copenhangen interpretation defenders.In my opinion, you will enjoy this book much more if you took some QM course, and is familiar with the basics of probabilities.

But it's so much more in ways I did not anticipate.It is a redemption of Albert Einstein who, the common lore (even among physicists) would have us know, has lost touch as he got older and never really accepted the strange reality of the quantum physics despite his early contributions to the field. That view is at best wildly distorted.It is a story of Niels Bohr, who's cult of personality gathered a mysticism and following that resulted in arguably the most embarrassing chapter in modern science. Their dogmatic views (summed up as the Copenhagen Interpretation) prevented physicists to probe deep into the foundations of quantum physics and our universe.Anyone who tried to understand what was actually going on would face ridicule, risk losing their job (or not being able to find one after they graduated) and would not be able to get their papers published. Even a mere association with someone questioning the dogma was risky to one's career.Questioning the status quo, trying to look for alternative interpretations, coming up with experiments that can show us holes in the current understanding are at the core of science. And yet, this pushback against even the slightest rocking of the boat was going on for several decades.Pushback that was perpetuated by extremely talented people. You'd have an easier time counting who *didn't* get a Nobel Price in the book's cast of characters. Indeed, it may be because of the unprecedented success in prediction and precision of the quantum theory that people were told to ""shut up and calculate"", killing any enquiries about the nature of the field and how it relates to our world.It is also, tragically, a story of the second World War and its disruption in the scientific field. In the thirties, the American physics was seriously behind and the vast majority of the research was going on in Berlin, Vienna and Copenhagen. A lot of that by scientists who were either of Jewish origin or who had a Jewish spouse.Hitler's anti-semitism played a large role in the quantum physics research leaving central Europe and the first atomic bomb being developed in the USA.Even though the book pushes hard against the Copenhagen interpretation and the behaviour surrounding the dogmatic positions at the time, I find it is fair to all the people involved. All of these people were brilliant scientists and that is not dismissed here.It would for example be easy to paint Niels Bohr as the villain of the story, but in addition to his undeniable contributions to physics, he was helping Jewish scientists by finding them jobs, financial help and helping them leave their countries that were about to arrest them. Other than Hitler, there are no villains here, just multi-faceted people.What is Real is a fascinating account of the physics in the last hundred years. It also made me really frustrated and often quite angry. You don't need to really know any physics to get the same out of it. It is beautifully written and I could not put it down."

Bohr received a Nobel prize for discovering the different energy states (quanta) of electrons in an atom. Together with Planck and Einstein, quantum theory was born. When Schrödinger discovered the wave equation, it correctly predicted the probabilistic position of the electron in an hydrogen atom. Heisenberg later discovered his uncertainty principle and then together with Bohr built the Copenhagen interpretation: ‘Shut up and calculate’. They posited that quantum theory cannot be understood the way that we experience every day life, and is only a useful equation for accurate prediction of every day effects. This infuriated many nonconformist physicists!Einstein, Podolsy and Rosen published a paper about entanglement, the paradox that entangled particles can transmit information faster than the speed of light. ‘Spooky actions at a distance’. Recent experiments seem to confirm this. Bohm suggested a pilot wave theory that helped explain the dual wave particle nature of electrons during a double slit experiment: the presence of a detector changed the wave interference pattern of the electron! It is interesting to know that Heisenberg supported Nazi Germany, while his mentor Bohr and Einstein had to flee Germany because of their Jewish lineage. That however prevented Germany from developing the atomic bomb first, since Heisenberg was a lousy practical physicist. Bohm’s theory aaa not well accepted because he was a communist. Everett suggested that wave functions do not collapse and there are actually infinite worlds. So is the cat dead or alive? Bohr says don’t ask. Everett says both but in different worlds. I am still confused. This is a great book about Quantum physics, I am sure I misunderstand large parts of it, but still learn a lot from it. "

I’m sure that Adam Becker can take it. I thought his research was outstanding. He mentioned so many quantum physicists whose works contributed to knowledge and discovery, that I was amazed. They struggled and persevered in their own ways, in the face of resistance and stubbornness within a pretty weird environment. You think the quantum world is weird? Check out academia!

183,0465096050,http://goodreads.com/user/show/15728519-r-hul,4,"Adam Becker, a Ph. D. in Physics, writes about interpretation of Quantum Mechanics, the enormously successful 20th century theory underpinning everything from semiconductor electronics to satellite navigation. At the heart of quantum mechanics is the ""weirdness"" summed up by Heisenberg's uncertainty principle that binds the combined accuracy with which both the position and momentum of a particle can be measured, even though the wavefunction underlying a quantum state is entirely determined by the Schrodinger equation. Most physicists rely on the Copenhagen interpretation of Quantum mechanics which separates the quantum world being measured from the classical measuring instrument and keeps the measurement process itself outside the realm of quantum mechanics. The quantum state is then interpreted as probabilistically collapsing into the measured state. This interpretation allows quantum mechanical calculations to make multiple predictions that have held up to the level of our most accurate measurements. Throughout the 20th century, the dominant view, exemplified by Richard Feynman and others, was to focus on observable and falsifiable predictions of quantum mechanics than to question whether it is complete. Einstein, Podolsky and Rosen had famously shown that Quantum mechanics is either incomplete or non-local. Although out of the mainstream, many scientists had proposed alternative interpretations of quantum mechanics to address Copenhagen's mysteries. De Broglie and Bohm developed the pilot-wave interpretation, where every particle is associated with a pilot wave, that avoids the Copenhagen collapse but introduces non-locality. Hugh Everett developed the Many Worlds interpretation where interaction between any two quantum particles leads to the creation of multiple joint wave functions in multiple universes, only one of which (the observed) is accessible to us. A third is Spontaneous Collapse in which, unlike Copenhagen, the measurement system is also a quantum object and collapse happens spontaneously, at a high probability due to the large number of quantum interactions happening when a macroscopic measurement system is used. Becker's narrative is fascinating and he is correct that insufficient attention has been paid to the fundamentals of quantum mechanics while we have reaped the benefits of its accuracy. However, it is also correct that, while intellectually illuminating, many of the alternative interpretations themselves introduce further weirdness like non-locality or are non-falsifiability. Becker is spotty when he attacks the necessity of Popperian falsifiability in a physical theory. On the one hand, it is correct that scientific progress is often inductive and grand theories are often created in retrospect to fit facts, but his central argument that a universally applied theory is falsifiable only by invoking something outside the universe itself sets too high a bar. It is often more satisfying and beneficial to keep a problem open rather than to rely on theories that do not offer measurements to falsify them. However, this is no reason not to stymie research into an area. While this book is greatly illuminating, Becker gives short shrift to the practical reasons why most physicists are more excited to work on the physics of quantum mechanics rather than its philosophical underpinnings- because physics today is a material science more than it is natural philosophy. There doesn't seem to be a conspiracy stopping research into alternatives to Copenhagen, just a preponderance of interest in testable Physics with real consequences. "

Its predictions have been confirmed time and time again and underpins modern technology. It has helped us to understand how the electromagnetic and the two nuclear forces work. It is a remarkable theory. But what does the mathematical formalism mean? This book tells the story how the interpretation of Quantum Mechanics has evolved over the last 90 years or so. It is a very well written book, with a lot of historical details I was not aware of. It doesn’t cover all interpretations of Quantum Mechanics (for example, the transactional interpretation is not mentioned at all, but it has not many followers). But the author describes nicely the troubles scientists went through to make sense of this remarkable theory. Of course, John Bell’s story is told, but so are the stories of David Bohm , Hugh Everett III, Heinz-Dieter Zeh (who died in April this year) and Wojciech Zurek. It is a great book. I couldn’t put it down and managed to read it in three days. Well done, Adam Becker. "

I'm particularly satisfied with it as I thought I was the the dummy for not buying into some of that Bohr's stuff. Einstein wasn't convinced either, so there's that. But then all the scientists who expresses doubts about the totally vague and convoluted theory (don't ask why it works, it just works; you can't measure it so never mind; It only happens when you're watching it; etc) were ostracized, unpublished, unemployed by universities; they had a tough go of it. Now people are actually seriously daring to question the unfathomable Niels Bohr. Interesting coverage of the theory and the controversy."

Becker includes layman's explanations of the key concepts and helpful diagrams to visualise the most complex thought experiments. The history is compellingly told; no mathematical equations in sight!As a newbie to this field, I opened this book expecting to find that quantum theory had all the answers. Instead what I've learned is that science is held back by the usual challenges of close mindedness and narrowed focus and that a philosophical approach is critical to a real understanding of the universe."

In short, it appears: there's no external reality; there is a an external reality, but it's bizarre in one or more of any number of ways (depending on specific theory you subscribe to); or there are infinitely many external realities, only one of which I have access to as I type this review (and an infinite number of fellow me's, in an infinity of other worlds, do more or less the same). The author does an exceptional job of telling the history, describing the science, and explaining both the related sociology and philosophy of science, and why it all matters.

190,0465096050,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5917740-nilesh,5,"What is Real is a masterpiece in the way it narrates the quest to find the meaning behind the quantum equations.Quantum science works, like almost nothing else humans have ever invented. Yet, the equations that have come to define the field are impossible to interpret in human languages and in a way that our rationality could accept. It took a while for the greatest minds of the era to even suggest that the wave function is Schrodinger’s wave equation was a probability distribution. The debate took a material turn for the worse with Heisenberg’s uncertainty principle. How does everything so probabilistic theoretically and when unseen actualize into something concrete whenever observed?The book wonderfully elaborates on the details of the problem that splintered the scientific world and had the greatest human minds of all time metaphorically in arms against each other. The debates between Einstein, Bohr, Schrodinger, Pauli, Dirac, Heisenberg, De Broglie and others captivated the world even nearly a century later. After all, what was at stake boiled down to what is real!Hundreds of books wonderfully explain the debates that dominated the pre-war years including the EPR construct. Mr Becker’s work covers the same grounds competently, but cannot add to what has been exhaustively rehashed for decades.  The book’s true value is not in covering the rise of the Copenhagen interpretation, but its fall. The author makes the story of the Copenhagen decline and rise of alternative explanations as understandable, exciting, meaningful and absorbing as the rise - something few who have covered Bohm, Bell, Everett, Wheeler etc have been able to do. This is because the issues at hand turn materially more complex when one attempts to appreciate the equally groundbreaking and relevant work of these scientists. At philosophical and metaphysical levels, the war was between positivism and scientific realism and their sub-schools. Mathematically, even relativity came under pressure with the insertion, deletion and re-insertion of the cosmological constants. This was in the space which was easily narratable, but the mathematical debates kept on intensifying at every stage of the development of unification theories. For the lay folks, it appeared more like fights over the number of dimensions our reality has, their sizes and similar, but scientists disagreed on almost everything as the observations proved reality to be ever more bizarre. The book side-steps the arrival of dozens of subatomic particles and stops before the string theories begin their domination of the discussion, and this helps the book in keeping the focus on quantum reality. The author spends a lot of time on describing the scientists involved and their travesties. While this is often distracting, it helps humanize the story and provides relief to the non-technical readers from the mind-numbing intricacies of the quantum world.  The book makes the collapse of the Copenhagen and rise of Many Worlds far more definitive than it is in the scientific community. Even non-scientists would need dozens of books over the lifetime to develop a basic understanding of the still-shifting reality debates sparked by the quantum revolution. This book is one for any such a list because it focuses on a particular time-frame and a set of issues that are pivotal and not as well covered by almost anyone else."
191,0465096050,http://goodreads.com/user/show/22428213-ian-scuffling,5,"It was a bastardization of Schrödinger's cat that introduced me to the ideas of quantum physics, and since then the topic has been something that I've held deep interest in (albeit from a very amateur's view, not really digging into the nuances other than to understand the prevailing ideas)—my interest has been particularly in terms of the philosophy and existentialism inherent in the problems that the theories present to our experience of the world. To be honest, before reading Adam Becker's What is Real? I had no idea what the Copenhagen Interpretation (CI) was, much less that there was contention in the fundamental foundations of quantum physics and what significance that has for everyday ""classic"" (Newtonian) physics. Becker's book isn't just a really great primer on the material of what quantum physics is and does, but also a bountiful, if not slanted, biography of the science itself—its historical players, their public arguments, the political impacts of scientific pursuits and philosophies. I say slanted because Becker here does not even have pretenses about his feelings towards what he sees as Neils Bohr's egotistical ironclad grip on developing physics students minds and dispositions towards quantum physics and how it's to be seen simply as a mathematical ""world"" separate from the Newtonian ""classic"" world we experience. That is, it's not an observable state, so therefore it's simply a mathematical understanding of particle physics that doesn't necessarily mean something about how we experience or understand the physical realms.Becker, in his biases, however, lays out a compelling and seemingly pat philosophical reasoning for giving more credence to thinkers/physicists like John Bell and Hugh Everett's many worlds formulation. Particularly convincing in this regard are Becker's arguments against the philosophical position of falsifiability, which he posits is a logical fallacy in the sciences because of it's solipsistic myopia, and egotistical ignorance toward what may seem unsavory or overly complex.This book really has something for all tastes—some sections, particularly the ones on the Vienna Circle and their weirdly firm positions as logical positivists, seemed pulled straight out of Pynchon (specifically Against the Day). Finally, Becker's analysis of the STEM resistance to philosophy of science is informative, and slightly depressing as it almost signals a weird strain of anti-intellectual pursuit within the scientific community—a position that seems at odds with everything the sciences stand for—to be clear, the sciences need philosophy as much as philosophy needs the sciences.I would highly recommend anyone with even glancing interest in quantum physics, entanglement, the history of physics and philosophical physics to read What is Real?. Because of Becker's expertise in both writing and physics, I could well see someone even deeply immersed in quantum physics getting something of use out of the book through Becker's precise rendering of the concepts in his experiment examples and his crystal clear—yet engaging—prose. Probably one of the best pop-sci books I've read in the past 10 years."
192,0465096050,http://goodreads.com/user/show/68014166-eric-hulburd,5,"Take my review from a computer/environmental engineer's perspective, not a physicist's. I thought this book was excellent. I've read a few other books on QM that really focused on the math (Leonard Susskind's was great for this). However, while understanding the math is important for applications of QM, my interest really lies in the unintuitive mysteries of quantum physics.This book brings that mystery down to Earth in a somewhat ironic way. As the book explains, ""Shut up and calculate"" is often invoked as a defense of the persistence of ""the"" Copenhagen interpretation. It has brought us wonders in modern science and technology. Becker leaves no doubt about that. However, the irony is that Mermin (original author of quote) went on to explain that he won't shut up. There is something deeply incomplete about the Copenhagen interpretation. In fact, the skepticism towards quantum foundation research (and philosophy of science more broadly) has, in part, enabled an interpretation of QM that feeds wishy washy pseudo-science spirituality (eg Deepak Chopra's insistence that's we exist within a quantum soup through which we can will our desires into existence). Rather than clearly calling out Copenhagen's implicit philosophical reliance on the role of observation/consciousness in creating our knowable reality, it's waved away, along with equally robust, but perhaps more philosophically feasible explanations for what we widely refer to as QM wave function collapse.Perhaps most powerfully, the book defends its philosophical concerns by pointing out, through science history, that truth, even scientific truth, is often shaped powerfully by personalities and culture. Predominance of Bohr's Copenhagen interpretation may be due to Bohr's greater charisma and personableness relative to that of Einstein's, Bohm's willingness to voice sympathy for socialism, or Everett's distaste for public speaking. Or perhaps, simply because the Copenhagen interpretation was the first interpretation to be defined, if not in terms of a coherent theory, at least semantically. Overall, an approachable and clear look at the philosophical implications and history of quantum mechanics. I highly recommend to anyone interested in either of those topics.PS I'm pursuing both criticisms and alternative perspectives to Becker's since this is my first foray into the topic."
193,0465096050,http://goodreads.com/user/show/19059859-sean,5,"Excellent book. You really need to like physics to fully follow this book. It might not have equations, but it requires you to be ready to discuss serious meanings of quantum physics. Extremely well researched. Fantastic insight to all the personalities involved. The author respects all the players, but talks very frankly about them as people with histories, political motives, academic motives and their time/place in human history. As a physics teacher, I fully understand today's ""Shut up and Calculate"" approach to teaching. It is so refreshing to read about how some of the greatest minds to walk the Earth debated and rethought their own ideas on the meaning of all this quantum weirdness.The index and bibliography are great. Even though I teach physics, I still would have liked a glossary section with brief explanations of terms like: complimentarity, Copenhagen interpretation, positivism, logical empiricism, falsifiability, many-worlds, measurement problem, pilot wave, spontaneous collapse. This could really help the non-physics majors.Reading recommendation: try reading the 6 pages at the end first: ""Appendix: Four Views of the Strangest Experiment"". The experiment is easy to understand. The four views then represent the views discussed in the book. Sure, the terminology hasn't yet been explained if you read this first, but I still think it would make a perfect 1st chapter to fully set the stage.I borrowed this book from my local library. I believe I need to buy a copy and read it again with my notebook/pen handy. Again, the bibliography represents a gold-mine of material I really haven't explored (physics philosophy)."

When I got to page 286 the author indicated Roger Penrose had the same thought. You could have knocked me over with a feather. If an author can help me understand something and have an insight on a topic I have struggled to understand for 30 years in only 18 pages, I would suggest it is a book worth reading, if you are interested in this particular subject. If you have every tried to understand the ""weirdness"" of quantum theory, this is the book to read."
196,0465096050,http://goodreads.com/user/show/85723871-thomas-dietert,5,"I thoroughly enjoyed this well-written account of the past hundred years of the theory of quantum mechanics, it's inception as a popular field of theoretical physics, and the steady progression and development of the Copenhagen interpretation along with rival theories including Everett's ""many worlds"" theorem, Bohm's pilot-wave theory, and Bell's proof that physics must be ""nonlocal"" (seemingly refuting the notion of Einstein's theory of relativity).The author does a wonderful job of setting the stage in the first third of the book, choosing to focus on the contributions, formulations, and theories of Heisenberg, Schrodinger, De-Broglie, Pierls, Einstein, Bohr, and other notable physicists at the time, and how they all came together to concoct an ""interpretation"" of quantum mechanics known as The Copenhagen interpretation. Not all physicists during the early years of quantum mechanical theory agreed on this interpretation, and the author does a great job of referencing cited material about the theories of these seminal scientists, and intriguingly describes the ways in which they disagreed about such an interpretation; i.e. Einstein was convinced that the ""measurement problem"" was a deep-seated flaw in the interpretation, whereas Bohr (and Heisenberg and friend) all argued was irrelevant. The author follows the development of such conflicting ideas, suggests reasons for why such disagreements weren't easily reconciled, and connects such ideological conflicts with the global political and economic climate (WWI, WWII), also illustrating the influence of classic philosophical movements (such as logical positivism via Mach & The Vienna Circle) on the ""accepted"" interpretation of quantum mechanics.The second third of the book describes the development of such theorems as Bohm's pilot-wave interpretation of quantum w decades go by and the measurement problem still hasn't been solved; The Copenhagen Interpretation still reigns supreme (though nobody can adequately define the collection of theories and experiments that comprise it), and anyone who thinks that there might be more to the ""quantum realm"" than is summed up in the Denmark Dogma is voraciously attacked and all but chased out of the academic field of physics. Fortunately, there are a few physicists with enough notoriety and clout (e.g. Bohm, Bell, etc) that produce some theories and proofs that offer alternative interpretations to Bohr's Copenhagen interpretation, as well as a few physicists (e.g. Everett) who are just in it for the fun of the field and could care less about whether or not their theories are accepted by the majority of physicists. In the latter half of the second third, and well into the last third of the book, the author continues to contextualize the sub-field of quantum physics with the rest of history, and describes the trials and tribulations of such physicists as Zeh, Clauser, and Wheeler (whom never really knew what theory to advocate for) whom continued to develop such esoteric and heretical theories and experiments (Zeh: many worlds, Clauser: Bell's inequality, etc). It was unfortunate to learn that perhaps the greatest reason for the lack of acceptance of such ""progress"" was that the field of physics became far too focused on pragmatic engineering applications following World War II, and dismissed any such reformulation of the ""foundations of quantum mechanics"" as ""Metaphysical Nonsense"" (continuing the trend of the Copenhagen cabal of the earls 1900s); Luckily for us, this was not enough to stop the creation or discovery of quantum field theory, which attempts to answer some of the further questions asked by such alternative theories as Zeh's ""decoherence"" principle (extending/reformulating Everett's many-worlds theorem) and Bell's inequality.The story ends with an account of the current state of these theories, the experimental result contributing to or refuting currently widely accepted theories of quantum mechanics, introducing potential solutions to the existing theoretical gaps (such as quantum gravity), describing the origins of and contextual placement of the application of quantum mechanics to computation (quantum computing a la Deutsch), and adequately and pleasingly summarizing the current state of the field.The author does a great job of conveying that the point of the book is to illustrate the philosophical (and truly quantum-physical) gaps in the (still) widely popular Copenhagen interpretation of quantum physics. Fortunately for all of humanity, there have been several physicists throughout the past 100 years who didn't let the potential destruction of their careers, or their surely negatively impacted academic reputation get in the way of their imagination enough to discourage or extinguish their desire to truly get to the bottom of such an complex theory of everything. Quantum mechanics, quantum field theory, particle physics, and other related sub-disciplines of the study of the quantum realm are still FAR from solved, and this book comprehensively explains exactly why.To conclude, I would recommend this book to anyone who desires to learn more about exactly what quantum mechanics is at a high enough level as to not get lost in the weeds along the way to a higher level understanding of the physics and philosophical questions that are simultaneously answered and asked by modern quantum-physical theories. If you have only a tangential and/or superficial understanding of quantum mechanics and enjoy a well-told history of such a field, you will enjoy this book and be inspired to learn even more in the future! 5/5 stars."
197,0465096050,http://goodreads.com/user/show/15608248-stefan-poth,2,This book is so redundant. Could relate all the details in half the pages if things were not repeated so many times.
198,0465096050,http://goodreads.com/user/show/29427094-babak,4,"The book mounts a systematic offensive against the Copenhagen Interpretation of quantum mechanics along with the historical narrative of how it came to be the dominant interpretation among physicists, especially in the era of ""big science"" after WWII funded by governments. We learn about differences in the views among the architects of quantum theory (Einstein, Bohr, de Broglie, Schrödinger, Heisenberg, Pauli, Born, and others) on what quantum theory is really about. We meet the heretics (Bohm, Everett, Bell, Clauser, Zeh, and others) who insist on a different conception of what is really out there, sometimes at great personal and professional cost. We also get a glimpse of the philosophical underpinnings of these different interpretations and the intellectual currents that reshaped them. We witness the fragile balance that physicists maintain between their daily work and professional aspirations and the fraught business of delving deeper into what that work really means for the world at large. Overall, this is a very enjoyable and informative read. On the weaker side, I wished that the discussion of the philosophy of science was done more comprehensively. Unfortunately, it only receives a shallow treatment in the book and, perhaps as a result, it contains some mischaracterizations. For example, the work of Popper is reduced to an inaccurate sketch of his demarcation criteria, i.e. ""falsifiability,"" and is attacked on this thin basis. However, Popper's philosophy of science is much more extensive and substantive than falsifiability: it's a coherent structure of rational criticism (which, in fact, the author partially spells out in his attack), in which falsifiability is but a small part.Another confusing aspect of the book's narrative is its treatment of the meaning of Bell's inequality. Multiple times, in his commentary as well as quotations of various physicists and philosophers, the author states that the violation of Bell's inequality forces us to abandon locality. However, we are also told that the many-worlds interpretation actually escapes this. This inconsistency threads through various passages and leaves a confused impression of the consequences of Bell's work and subsequent experimental findings. For example, after a dramatic discussion following the description of Bell's inequalities, we read on p. 160:""In short, Bell's Theorem really leaves only three unequivocal possibilities: either nature is nonlocal in some way, or we live in branching multiple worlds despite appearances to the contrary, or quantum physics gives incorrect predictions about certain experimental setups.""Ok. But then, when discussing the experiments of Clauser and others showing the violation of Bell's inequalities we read on p. 210:""In 1976, both Clauser and the Texas team announced their results: quantum mechanics was vindicated, and Clauser and Freedman's original result stood. Quantum nonlocality was real.""Um, really?! So, what about branching multiple worlds? This inconsistency of statements pervades the rest of the book. The many-worlds interpretation resurfaces again and again but somehow Bell proves that reality is nonlocal all the same.Much of the motivation for the book is drawn from the debate between Bohr and Einstein, which revolves (as the author clearly and correctly states) about locality. Locality is foundational in Einstein's conception of reality and a postulate of his relativity theory. However, this thread is somewhat lost in the later parts of the story. I wished it had been followed and its consequences stated more clearly. We do have a local interpretation of quantum theory without collapse and vague rumination about measurement: it is Everett's ""relative-state"" formulation and its subsequent substantiation by DeWitt, Zeh, Deutsch, and others, which leads to (not postulate) the real existence of many worlds, and provides a basis for understanding what probability means in the theory (again, instead of postulating it).

200,0465096050,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3870575-sean,5,"This was a fantastic read! At the surface level, Becker provides a lot of the necessary background in the history of both modern quantum mechanics and philosophy in order to have spirited debates at cocktail parties. What makes the read so enjoyable, however, is that the entire discussion is couched in the personalities and the interactions of the people there, originally arguing the ideas. Some of those tales are quite tragic, causing me to shout at how terrible and terribly wrong some people were or at how unfortunate the political environment was. At other times I was truly encouraged by how good ideas and rigorous, honest arguments eventually find a foothold. My only criticism might be of a span of something like 10 pages which dove into the parallel development of philosophy regarding logical positivism — I felt like the tenants of positivism were already laid out sufficiently, the history there dragged a bit and didn’t seem very necessary to the transition to realism. Anyway, there is a fair amount of philosophy within the context of interpreting quantum science, but that is part of Becker’s point that physics after WWII lost a lot of its introspection due to specialization and excessive pragmatism. I am too close to all of this stuff to say strongly that anyone would love this book but I’d certainly recommend it be given a shot."
201,0465096050,http://goodreads.com/user/show/23648829-rodrigo-nemmen,4,"This book is not about certainties, but about uncertainties. What I mean by that is that do not expect this book to reveal to you the deep truths of quantum mechanics, or the one favoured interpretation among Copenhagen, many-worlds, pilot wave etc. Nobody knows the answers to this questions, that is the bottomline. The book is all about the journey of better understanding reality. Along the way, it reveals the fascinating personalities of key people in behind major developments in QM, and some of the intellectual impostures of the Copenhangen interpretation defenders.In my opinion, you will enjoy this book much more if you took some QM course, and is familiar with the basics of probabilities.

But it's so much more in ways I did not anticipate.It is a redemption of Albert Einstein who, the common lore (even among physicists) would have us know, has lost touch as he got older and never really accepted the strange reality of the quantum physics despite his early contributions to the field. That view is at best wildly distorted.It is a story of Niels Bohr, who's cult of personality gathered a mysticism and following that resulted in arguably the most embarrassing chapter in modern science. Their dogmatic views (summed up as the Copenhagen Interpretation) prevented physicists to probe deep into the foundations of quantum physics and our universe.Anyone who tried to understand what was actually going on would face ridicule, risk losing their job (or not being able to find one after they graduated) and would not be able to get their papers published. Even a mere association with someone questioning the dogma was risky to one's career.Questioning the status quo, trying to look for alternative interpretations, coming up with experiments that can show us holes in the current understanding are at the core of science. And yet, this pushback against even the slightest rocking of the boat was going on for several decades.Pushback that was perpetuated by extremely talented people. You'd have an easier time counting who *didn't* get a Nobel Price in the book's cast of characters. Indeed, it may be because of the unprecedented success in prediction and precision of the quantum theory that people were told to ""shut up and calculate"", killing any enquiries about the nature of the field and how it relates to our world.It is also, tragically, a story of the second World War and its disruption in the scientific field. In the thirties, the American physics was seriously behind and the vast majority of the research was going on in Berlin, Vienna and Copenhagen. A lot of that by scientists who were either of Jewish origin or who had a Jewish spouse.Hitler's anti-semitism played a large role in the quantum physics research leaving central Europe and the first atomic bomb being developed in the USA.Even though the book pushes hard against the Copenhagen interpretation and the behaviour surrounding the dogmatic positions at the time, I find it is fair to all the people involved. All of these people were brilliant scientists and that is not dismissed here.It would for example be easy to paint Niels Bohr as the villain of the story, but in addition to his undeniable contributions to physics, he was helping Jewish scientists by finding them jobs, financial help and helping them leave their countries that were about to arrest them. Other than Hitler, there are no villains here, just multi-faceted people.What is Real is a fascinating account of the physics in the last hundred years. It also made me really frustrated and often quite angry. You don't need to really know any physics to get the same out of it. It is beautifully written and I could not put it down."

Schrödinger’s cat or collapse of Quantum Wave function when a measurement is made. So the cat is neither dead or alive before measurement, but once an observation is made it has to settle in either of one state. Bohr received a Nobel prize for discovering the different energy states (quanta) of electrons in an atom. Together with Planck and Einstein, quantum theory was born. When Schrödinger discovered the wave equation, it correctly predicted the probabilistic position of the electron in an hydrogen atom. Heisenberg later discovered his uncertainty principle and then together with Bohr built the Copenhagen interpretation: ‘Shut up and calculate’. They posited that quantum theory cannot be understood the way that we experience every day life, and is only a useful equation for accurate prediction of every day effects. This infuriated many nonconformist physicists!Einstein, Podolsy and Rosen published a paper about entanglement, the paradox that entangled particles can transmit information faster than the speed of light. ‘Spooky actions at a distance’. Recent experiments seem to confirm this. Bohm suggested a pilot wave theory that helped explain the dual wave particle nature of electrons during a double slit experiment: the presence of a detector changed the wave interference pattern of the electron! It is interesting to know that Heisenberg supported Nazi Germany, while his mentor Bohr and Einstein had to flee Germany because of their Jewish lineage. That however prevented Germany from developing the atomic bomb first, since Heisenberg was a lousy practical physicist. Bohm’s theory aaa not well accepted because he was a communist. Everett suggested that wave functions do not collapse and there are actually infinite worlds. So is the cat dead or alive? Bohr says don’t ask. Everett says both but in different worlds. I am still confused. This is a great book about Quantum physics, I am sure I misunderstand large parts of it, but still learn a lot from it. "

213,0465096050,http://goodreads.com/user/show/15728519-r-hul,4,"Adam Becker, a Ph. D. in Physics, writes about interpretation of Quantum Mechanics, the enormously successful 20th century theory underpinning everything from semiconductor electronics to satellite navigation. At the heart of quantum mechanics is the ""weirdness"" summed up by Heisenberg's uncertainty principle that binds the combined accuracy with which both the position and momentum of a particle can be measured, even though the wavefunction underlying a quantum state is entirely determined by the Schrodinger equation. Most physicists rely on the Copenhagen interpretation of Quantum mechanics which separates the quantum world being measured from the classical measuring instrument and keeps the measurement process itself outside the realm of quantum mechanics. The quantum state is then interpreted as probabilistically collapsing into the measured state. This interpretation allows quantum mechanical calculations to make multiple predictions that have held up to the level of our most accurate measurements. Throughout the 20th century, the dominant view, exemplified by Richard Feynman and others, was to focus on observable and falsifiable predictions of quantum mechanics than to question whether it is complete. Einstein, Podolsky and Rosen had famously shown that Quantum mechanics is either incomplete or non-local. Although out of the mainstream, many scientists had proposed alternative interpretations of quantum mechanics to address Copenhagen's mysteries. De Broglie and Bohm developed the pilot-wave interpretation, where every particle is associated with a pilot wave, that avoids the Copenhagen collapse but introduces non-locality. Hugh Everett developed the Many Worlds interpretation where interaction between any two quantum particles leads to the creation of multiple joint wave functions in multiple universes, only one of which (the observed) is accessible to us. A third is Spontaneous Collapse in which, unlike Copenhagen, the measurement system is also a quantum object and collapse happens spontaneously, at a high probability due to the large number of quantum interactions happening when a macroscopic measurement system is used. Becker's narrative is fascinating and he is correct that insufficient attention has been paid to the fundamentals of quantum mechanics while we have reaped the benefits of its accuracy. However, it is also correct that, while intellectually illuminating, many of the alternative interpretations themselves introduce further weirdness like non-locality or are non-falsifiability. Becker is spotty when he attacks the necessity of Popperian falsifiability in a physical theory. On the one hand, it is correct that scientific progress is often inductive and grand theories are often created in retrospect to fit facts, but his central argument that a universally applied theory is falsifiable only by invoking something outside the universe itself sets too high a bar. It is often more satisfying and beneficial to keep a problem open rather than to rely on theories that do not offer measurements to falsify them. However, this is no reason not to stymie research into an area. While this book is greatly illuminating, Becker gives short shrift to the practical reasons why most physicists are more excited to work on the physics of quantum mechanics rather than its philosophical underpinnings- because physics today is a material science more than it is natural philosophy. There doesn't seem to be a conspiracy stopping research into alternatives to Copenhagen, just a preponderance of interest in testable Physics with real consequences. "
214,0465096050,http://goodreads.com/user/show/70474434-carsten,5,"Quantum Mechanics is one of the foundations of physics (jointly with relativity). Its predictions have been confirmed time and time again and underpins modern technology. It has helped us to understand how the electromagnetic and the two nuclear forces work. It is a remarkable theory. But what does the mathematical formalism mean? This book tells the story how the interpretation of Quantum Mechanics has evolved over the last 90 years or so. It is a very well written book, with a lot of historical details I was not aware of. It doesn’t cover all interpretations of Quantum Mechanics (for example, the transactional interpretation is not mentioned at all, but it has not many followers). But the author describes nicely the troubles scientists went through to make sense of this remarkable theory. Of course, John Bell’s story is told, but so are the stories of David Bohm , Hugh Everett III, Heinz-Dieter Zeh (who died in April this year) and Wojciech Zurek. It is a great book.

220,0465096050,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5917740-nilesh,5,"What is Real is a masterpiece in the way it narrates the quest to find the meaning behind the quantum equations.Quantum science works, like almost nothing else humans have ever invented. Yet, the equations that have come to define the field are impossible to interpret in human languages and in a way that our rationality could accept. It took a while for the greatest minds of the era to even suggest that the wave function is Schrodinger’s wave equation was a probability distribution. The debate took a material turn for the worse with Heisenberg’s uncertainty principle. How does everything so probabilistic theoretically and when unseen actualize into something concrete whenever observed?The book wonderfully elaborates on the details of the problem that splintered the scientific world and had the greatest human minds of all time metaphorically in arms against each other. The debates between Einstein, Bohr, Schrodinger, Pauli, Dirac, Heisenberg, De Broglie and others captivated the world even nearly a century later. After all, what was at stake boiled down to what is real!Hundreds of books wonderfully explain the debates that dominated the pre-war years including the EPR construct. Mr Becker’s work covers the same grounds competently, but cannot add to what has been exhaustively rehashed for decades.  The book’s true value is not in covering the rise of the Copenhagen interpretation, but its fall. The author makes the story of the Copenhagen decline and rise of alternative explanations as understandable, exciting, meaningful and absorbing as the rise - something few who have covered Bohm, Bell, Everett, Wheeler etc have been able to do. This is because the issues at hand turn materially more complex when one attempts to appreciate the equally groundbreaking and relevant work of these scientists. At philosophical and metaphysical levels, the war was between positivism and scientific realism and their sub-schools. Mathematically, even relativity came under pressure with the insertion, deletion and re-insertion of the cosmological constants. This was in the space which was easily narratable, but the mathematical debates kept on intensifying at every stage of the development of unification theories. For the lay folks, it appeared more like fights over the number of dimensions our reality has, their sizes and similar, but scientists disagreed on almost everything as the observations proved reality to be ever more bizarre. The book side-steps the arrival of dozens of subatomic particles and stops before the string theories begin their domination of the discussion, and this helps the book in keeping the focus on quantum reality. The author spends a lot of time on describing the scientists involved and their travesties. While this is often distracting, it helps humanize the story and provides relief to the non-technical readers from the mind-numbing intricacies of the quantum world.  The book makes the collapse of the Copenhagen and rise of Many Worlds far more definitive than it is in the scientific community. Even non-scientists would need dozens of books over the lifetime to develop a basic understanding of the still-shifting reality debates sparked by the quantum revolution. This book is one for any such a list because it focuses on a particular time-frame and a set of issues that are pivotal and not as well covered by almost anyone else."
221,0465096050,http://goodreads.com/user/show/22428213-ian-scuffling,5,"It was a bastardization of Schrödinger's cat that introduced me to the ideas of quantum physics, and since then the topic has been something that I've held deep interest in (albeit from a very amateur's view, not really digging into the nuances other than to understand the prevailing ideas)—my interest has been particularly in terms of the philosophy and existentialism inherent in the problems that the theories present to our experience of the world. To be honest, before reading Adam Becker's What is Real? I had no idea what the Copenhagen Interpretation (CI) was, much less that there was contention in the fundamental foundations of quantum physics and what significance that has for everyday ""classic"" (Newtonian) physics. Becker's book isn't just a really great primer on the material of what quantum physics is and does, but also a bountiful, if not slanted, biography of the science itself—its historical players, their public arguments, the political impacts of scientific pursuits and philosophies. I say slanted because Becker here does not even have pretenses about his feelings towards what he sees as Neils Bohr's egotistical ironclad grip on developing physics students minds and dispositions towards quantum physics and how it's to be seen simply as a mathematical ""world"" separate from the Newtonian ""classic"" world we experience. That is, it's not an observable state, so therefore it's simply a mathematical understanding of particle physics that doesn't necessarily mean something about how we experience or understand the physical realms.Becker, in his biases, however, lays out a compelling and seemingly pat philosophical reasoning for giving more credence to thinkers/physicists like John Bell and Hugh Everett's many worlds formulation. Particularly convincing in this regard are Becker's arguments against the philosophical position of falsifiability, which he posits is a logical fallacy in the sciences because of it's solipsistic myopia, and egotistical ignorance toward what may seem unsavory or overly complex.This book really has something for all tastes—some sections, particularly the ones on the Vienna Circle and their weirdly firm positions as logical positivists, seemed pulled straight out of Pynchon (specifically Against the Day). Finally, Becker's analysis of the STEM resistance to philosophy of science is informative, and slightly depressing as it almost signals a weird strain of anti-intellectual pursuit within the scientific community—a position that seems at odds with everything the sciences stand for—to be clear, the sciences need philosophy as much as philosophy needs the sciences.I would highly recommend anyone with even glancing interest in quantum physics, entanglement, the history of physics and philosophical physics to read What is Real?. Because of Becker's expertise in both writing and physics, I could well see someone even deeply immersed in quantum physics getting something of use out of the book through Becker's precise rendering of the concepts in his experiment examples and his crystal clear—yet engaging—prose. Probably one of the best pop-sci books I've read in the past 10 years."
222,0465096050,http://goodreads.com/user/show/68014166-eric-hulburd,5,"Take my review from a computer/environmental engineer's perspective, not a physicist's. I thought this book was excellent. I've read a few other books on QM that really focused on the math (Leonard Susskind's was great for this). However, while understanding the math is important for applications of QM, my interest really lies in the unintuitive mysteries of quantum physics.This book brings that mystery down to Earth in a somewhat ironic way. As the book explains, ""Shut up and calculate"" is often invoked as a defense of the persistence of ""the"" Copenhagen interpretation. It has brought us wonders in modern science and technology. Becker leaves no doubt about that. However, the irony is that Mermin (original author of quote) went on to explain that he won't shut up. There is something deeply incomplete about the Copenhagen interpretation. In fact, the skepticism towards quantum foundation research (and philosophy of science more broadly) has, in part, enabled an interpretation of QM that feeds wishy washy pseudo-science spirituality (eg Deepak Chopra's insistence that's we exist within a quantum soup through which we can will our desires into existence). Rather than clearly calling out Copenhagen's implicit philosophical reliance on the role of observation/consciousness in creating our knowable reality, it's waved away, along with equally robust, but perhaps more philosophically feasible explanations for what we widely refer to as QM wave function collapse.Perhaps most powerfully, the book defends its philosophical concerns by pointing out, through science history, that truth, even scientific truth, is often shaped powerfully by personalities and culture. Predominance of Bohr's Copenhagen interpretation may be due to Bohr's greater charisma and personableness relative to that of Einstein's, Bohm's willingness to voice sympathy for socialism, or Everett's distaste for public speaking. Or perhaps, simply because the Copenhagen interpretation was the first interpretation to be defined, if not in terms of a coherent theory, at least semantically. Overall, an approachable and clear look at the philosophical implications and history of quantum mechanics. I highly recommend to anyone interested in either of those topics.PS I'm pursuing both criticisms and alternative perspectives to Becker's since this is my first foray into the topic."
223,0465096050,http://goodreads.com/user/show/19059859-sean,5,"Excellent book. You really need to like physics to fully follow this book. It might not have equations, but it requires you to be ready to discuss serious meanings of quantum physics. Extremely well researched. Fantastic insight to all the personalities involved. The author respects all the players, but talks very frankly about them as people with histories, political motives, academic motives and their time/place in human history. As a physics teacher, I fully understand today's ""Shut up and Calculate"" approach to teaching. It is so refreshing to read about how some of the greatest minds to walk the Earth debated and rethought their own ideas on the meaning of all this quantum weirdness.The index and bibliography are great. Even though I teach physics, I still would have liked a glossary section with brief explanations of terms like: complimentarity, Copenhagen interpretation, positivism, logical empiricism, falsifiability, many-worlds, measurement problem, pilot wave, spontaneous collapse. This could really help the non-physics majors.Reading recommendation: try reading the 6 pages at the end first: ""Appendix: Four Views of the Strangest Experiment"". The experiment is easy to understand. The four views then represent the views discussed in the book. Sure, the terminology hasn't yet been explained if you read this first, but I still think it would make a perfect 1st chapter to fully set the stage.I borrowed this book from my local library. I believe I need to buy a copy and read it again with my notebook/pen handy. Again, the bibliography represents a gold-mine of material I really haven't explored (physics philosophy)."

If an author can help me understand something and have an insight on a topic I have struggled to understand for 30 years in only 18 pages, I would suggest it is a book worth reading, if you are interested in this particular subject.

226,0465096050,http://goodreads.com/user/show/85723871-thomas-dietert,5,"I thoroughly enjoyed this well-written account of the past hundred years of the theory of quantum mechanics, it's inception as a popular field of theoretical physics, and the steady progression and development of the Copenhagen interpretation along with rival theories including Everett's ""many worlds"" theorem, Bohm's pilot-wave theory, and Bell's proof that physics must be ""nonlocal"" (seemingly refuting the notion of Einstein's theory of relativity).The author does a wonderful job of setting the stage in the first third of the book, choosing to focus on the contributions, formulations, and theories of Heisenberg, Schrodinger, De-Broglie, Pierls, Einstein, Bohr, and other notable physicists at the time, and how they all came together to concoct an ""interpretation"" of quantum mechanics known as The Copenhagen interpretation. Not all physicists during the early years of quantum mechanical theory agreed on this interpretation, and the author does a great job of referencing cited material about the theories of these seminal scientists, and intriguingly describes the ways in which they disagreed about such an interpretation; i.e. Einstein was convinced that the ""measurement problem"" was a deep-seated flaw in the interpretation, whereas Bohr (and Heisenberg and friend) all argued was irrelevant. The author follows the development of such conflicting ideas, suggests reasons for why such disagreements weren't easily reconciled, and connects such ideological conflicts with the global political and economic climate (WWI, WWII), also illustrating the influence of classic philosophical movements (such as logical positivism via Mach & The Vienna Circle) on the ""accepted"" interpretation of quantum mechanics.The second third of the book describes the development of such theorems as Bohm's pilot-wave interpretation of quantum w decades go by and the measurement problem still hasn't been solved; The Copenhagen Interpretation still reigns supreme (though nobody can adequately define the collection of theories and experiments that comprise it), and anyone who thinks that there might be more to the ""quantum realm"" than is summed up in the Denmark Dogma is voraciously attacked and all but chased out of the academic field of physics. Fortunately, there are a few physicists with enough notoriety and clout (e.g. Bohm, Bell, etc) that produce some theories and proofs that offer alternative interpretations to Bohr's Copenhagen interpretation, as well as a few physicists (e.g. Everett) who are just in it for the fun of the field and could care less about whether or not their theories are accepted by the majority of physicists. In the latter half of the second third, and well into the last third of the book, the author continues to contextualize the sub-field of quantum physics with the rest of history, and describes the trials and tribulations of such physicists as Zeh, Clauser, and Wheeler (whom never really knew what theory to advocate for) whom continued to develop such esoteric and heretical theories and experiments (Zeh: many worlds, Clauser: Bell's inequality, etc). It was unfortunate to learn that perhaps the greatest reason for the lack of acceptance of such ""progress"" was that the field of physics became far too focused on pragmatic engineering applications following World War II, and dismissed any such reformulation of the ""foundations of quantum mechanics"" as ""Metaphysical Nonsense"" (continuing the trend of the Copenhagen cabal of the earls 1900s); Luckily for us, this was not enough to stop the creation or discovery of quantum field theory, which attempts to answer some of the further questions asked by such alternative theories as Zeh's ""decoherence"" principle (extending/reformulating Everett's many-worlds theorem) and Bell's inequality.The story ends with an account of the current state of these theories, the experimental result contributing to or refuting currently widely accepted theories of quantum mechanics, introducing potential solutions to the existing theoretical gaps (such as quantum gravity), describing the origins of and contextual placement of the application of quantum mechanics to computation (quantum computing a la Deutsch), and adequately and pleasingly summarizing the current state of the field.The author does a great job of conveying that the point of the book is to illustrate the philosophical (and truly quantum-physical) gaps in the (still) widely popular Copenhagen interpretation of quantum physics. Fortunately for all of humanity, there have been several physicists throughout the past 100 years who didn't let the potential destruction of their careers, or their surely negatively impacted academic reputation get in the way of their imagination enough to discourage or extinguish their desire to truly get to the bottom of such an complex theory of everything. Quantum mechanics, quantum field theory, particle physics, and other related sub-disciplines of the study of the quantum realm are still FAR from solved, and this book comprehensively explains exactly why.To conclude, I would recommend this book to anyone who desires to learn more about exactly what quantum mechanics is at a high enough level as to not get lost in the weeds along the way to a higher level understanding of the physics and philosophical questions that are simultaneously answered and asked by modern quantum-physical theories. If you have only a tangential and/or superficial understanding of quantum mechanics and enjoy a well-told history of such a field, you will enjoy this book and be inspired to learn even more in the future! 5/5 stars."

We meet the heretics (Bohm, Everett, Bell, Clauser, Zeh, and others) who insist on a different conception of what is really out there, sometimes at great personal and professional cost. We also get a glimpse of the philosophical underpinnings of these different interpretations and the intellectual currents that reshaped them. We witness the fragile balance that physicists maintain between their daily work and professional aspirations and the fraught business of delving deeper into what that work really means for the world at large. Overall, this is a very enjoyable and informative read. On the weaker side, I wished that the discussion of the philosophy of science was done more comprehensively. Unfortunately, it only receives a shallow treatment in the book and, perhaps as a result, it contains some mischaracterizations. For example, the work of Popper is reduced to an inaccurate sketch of his demarcation criteria, i.e. ""falsifiability,"" and is attacked on this thin basis. However, Popper's philosophy of science is much more extensive and substantive than falsifiability: it's a coherent structure of rational criticism (which, in fact, the author partially spells out in his attack), in which falsifiability is but a small part.Another confusing aspect of the book's narrative is its treatment of the meaning of Bell's inequality. Multiple times, in his commentary as well as quotations of various physicists and philosophers, the author states that the violation of Bell's inequality forces us to abandon locality. However, we are also told that the many-worlds interpretation actually escapes this. This inconsistency threads through various passages and leaves a confused impression of the consequences of Bell's work and subsequent experimental findings. For example, after a dramatic discussion following the description of Bell's inequalities, we read on p. 160:""In short, Bell's Theorem really leaves only three unequivocal possibilities: either nature is nonlocal in some way, or we live in branching multiple worlds despite appearances to the contrary, or quantum physics gives incorrect predictions about certain experimental setups.""Ok. But then, when discussing the experiments of Clauser and others showing the violation of Bell's inequalities we read on p. 210:""In 1976, both Clauser and the Texas team announced their results: quantum mechanics was vindicated, and Clauser and Freedman's original result stood. Quantum nonlocality was real.""Um, really?! So, what about branching multiple worlds? This inconsistency of statements pervades the rest of the book. The many-worlds interpretation resurfaces again and again but somehow Bell proves that reality is nonlocal all the same.Much of the motivation for the book is drawn from the debate between Bohr and Einstein, which revolves (as the author clearly and correctly states) about locality. Locality is foundational in Einstein's conception of reality and a postulate of his relativity theory. However, this thread is somewhat lost in the later parts of the story. I wished it had been followed and its consequences stated more clearly. We do have a local interpretation of quantum theory without collapse and vague rumination about measurement: it is Everett's ""relative-state"" formulation and its subsequent substantiation by DeWitt, Zeh, Deutsch, and others, which leads to (not postulate) the real existence of many worlds, and provides a basis for understanding what probability means in the theory (again, instead of postulating it).

230,0465096050,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3870575-sean,5,"This was a fantastic read! At the surface level, Becker provides a lot of the necessary background in the history of both modern quantum mechanics and philosophy in order to have spirited debates at cocktail parties. What makes the read so enjoyable, however, is that the entire discussion is couched in the personalities and the interactions of the people there, originally arguing the ideas. Some of those tales are quite tragic, causing me to shout at how terrible and terribly wrong some people were or at how unfortunate the political environment was. At other times I was truly encouraged by how good ideas and rigorous, honest arguments eventually find a foothold. My only criticism might be of a span of something like 10 pages which dove into the parallel development of philosophy regarding logical positivism — I felt like the tenants of positivism were already laid out sufficiently, the history there dragged a bit and didn’t seem very necessary to the transition to realism. Anyway, there is a fair amount of philosophy within the context of interpreting quantum science, but that is part of Becker’s point that physics after WWII lost a lot of its introspection due to specialization and excessive pragmatism. I am too close to all of this stuff to say strongly that anyone would love this book but I’d certainly recommend it be given a shot."

What I mean by that is that do not expect this book to reveal to you the deep truths of quantum mechanics, or the one favoured interpretation among Copenhagen, many-worlds, pilot wave etc. Nobody knows the answers to this questions, that is the bottomline. The book is all about the journey of better understanding reality. Along the way, it reveals the fascinating personalities of key people in behind major developments in QM, and some of the intellectual impostures of the Copenhangen interpretation defenders.In my opinion, you will enjoy this book much more if you took some QM course, and is familiar with the basics of probabilities.

But it's so much more in ways I did not anticipate.It is a redemption of Albert Einstein who, the common lore (even among physicists) would have us know, has lost touch as he got older and never really accepted the strange reality of the quantum physics despite his early contributions to the field. That view is at best wildly distorted.It is a story of Niels Bohr, who's cult of personality gathered a mysticism and following that resulted in arguably the most embarrassing chapter in modern science. Their dogmatic views (summed up as the Copenhagen Interpretation) prevented physicists to probe deep into the foundations of quantum physics and our universe.Anyone who tried to understand what was actually going on would face ridicule, risk losing their job (or not being able to find one after they graduated) and would not be able to get their papers published. Even a mere association with someone questioning the dogma was risky to one's career.Questioning the status quo, trying to look for alternative interpretations, coming up with experiments that can show us holes in the current understanding are at the core of science. And yet, this pushback against even the slightest rocking of the boat was going on for several decades.Pushback that was perpetuated by extremely talented people. You'd have an easier time counting who *didn't* get a Nobel Price in the book's cast of characters. Indeed, it may be because of the unprecedented success in prediction and precision of the quantum theory that people were told to ""shut up and calculate"", killing any enquiries about the nature of the field and how it relates to our world.It is also, tragically, a story of the second World War and its disruption in the scientific field. In the thirties, the American physics was seriously behind and the vast majority of the research was going on in Berlin, Vienna and Copenhagen. A lot of that by scientists who were either of Jewish origin or who had a Jewish spouse.Hitler's anti-semitism played a large role in the quantum physics research leaving central Europe and the first atomic bomb being developed in the USA.Even though the book pushes hard against the Copenhagen interpretation and the behaviour surrounding the dogmatic positions at the time, I find it is fair to all the people involved. All of these people were brilliant scientists and that is not dismissed here.It would for example be easy to paint Niels Bohr as the villain of the story, but in addition to his undeniable contributions to physics, he was helping Jewish scientists by finding them jobs, financial help and helping them leave their countries that were about to arrest them. Other than Hitler, there are no villains here, just multi-faceted people.What is Real is a fascinating account of the physics in the last hundred years. It also made me really frustrated and often quite angry. You don't need to really know any physics to get the same out of it. It is beautifully written and I could not put it down."
241,0465096050,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4756170-daniel,5,"What physics question can’t Einstein solve? The meaning of Quantum Physics, the ‘Measurement problem’ a.k.a. Schrödinger’s cat or collapse of Quantum Wave function when a measurement is made. So the cat is neither dead or alive before measurement, but once an observation is made it has to settle in either of one state. Bohr received a Nobel prize for discovering the different energy states (quanta) of electrons in an atom. Together with Planck and Einstein, quantum theory was born. When Schrödinger discovered the wave equation, it correctly predicted the probabilistic position of the electron in an hydrogen atom. Heisenberg later discovered his uncertainty principle and then together with Bohr built the Copenhagen interpretation: ‘Shut up and calculate’. They posited that quantum theory cannot be understood the way that we experience every day life, and is only a useful equation for accurate prediction of every day effects. This infuriated many nonconformist physicists!Einstein, Podolsy and Rosen published a paper about entanglement, the paradox that entangled particles can transmit information faster than the speed of light. ‘Spooky actions at a distance’. Recent experiments seem to confirm this. Bohm suggested a pilot wave theory that helped explain the dual wave particle nature of electrons during a double slit experiment: the presence of a detector changed the wave interference pattern of the electron! It is interesting to know that Heisenberg supported Nazi Germany, while his mentor Bohr and Einstein had to flee Germany because of their Jewish lineage. That however prevented Germany from developing the atomic bomb first, since Heisenberg was a lousy practical physicist. Bohm’s theory aaa not well accepted because he was a communist. Everett suggested that wave functions do not collapse and there are actually infinite worlds. So is the cat dead or alive? Bohr says don’t ask. Everett says both but in different worlds. I am still confused. This is a great book about Quantum physics, I am sure I misunderstand large parts of it, but still learn a lot from it. "

243,0465096050,http://goodreads.com/user/show/15728519-r-hul,4,"Adam Becker, a Ph. D. in Physics, writes about interpretation of Quantum Mechanics, the enormously successful 20th century theory underpinning everything from semiconductor electronics to satellite navigation. At the heart of quantum mechanics is the ""weirdness"" summed up by Heisenberg's uncertainty principle that binds the combined accuracy with which both the position and momentum of a particle can be measured, even though the wavefunction underlying a quantum state is entirely determined by the Schrodinger equation. Most physicists rely on the Copenhagen interpretation of Quantum mechanics which separates the quantum world being measured from the classical measuring instrument and keeps the measurement process itself outside the realm of quantum mechanics. The quantum state is then interpreted as probabilistically collapsing into the measured state. This interpretation allows quantum mechanical calculations to make multiple predictions that have held up to the level of our most accurate measurements. Throughout the 20th century, the dominant view, exemplified by Richard Feynman and others, was to focus on observable and falsifiable predictions of quantum mechanics than to question whether it is complete. Einstein, Podolsky and Rosen had famously shown that Quantum mechanics is either incomplete or non-local. Although out of the mainstream, many scientists had proposed alternative interpretations of quantum mechanics to address Copenhagen's mysteries. De Broglie and Bohm developed the pilot-wave interpretation, where every particle is associated with a pilot wave, that avoids the Copenhagen collapse but introduces non-locality. Hugh Everett developed the Many Worlds interpretation where interaction between any two quantum particles leads to the creation of multiple joint wave functions in multiple universes, only one of which (the observed) is accessible to us. A third is Spontaneous Collapse in which, unlike Copenhagen, the measurement system is also a quantum object and collapse happens spontaneously, at a high probability due to the large number of quantum interactions happening when a macroscopic measurement system is used. Becker's narrative is fascinating and he is correct that insufficient attention has been paid to the fundamentals of quantum mechanics while we have reaped the benefits of its accuracy. However, it is also correct that, while intellectually illuminating, many of the alternative interpretations themselves introduce further weirdness like non-locality or are non-falsifiability. Becker is spotty when he attacks the necessity of Popperian falsifiability in a physical theory. On the one hand, it is correct that scientific progress is often inductive and grand theories are often created in retrospect to fit facts, but his central argument that a universally applied theory is falsifiable only by invoking something outside the universe itself sets too high a bar. It is often more satisfying and beneficial to keep a problem open rather than to rely on theories that do not offer measurements to falsify them. However, this is no reason not to stymie research into an area. While this book is greatly illuminating, Becker gives short shrift to the practical reasons why most physicists are more excited to work on the physics of quantum mechanics rather than its philosophical underpinnings- because physics today is a material science more than it is natural philosophy. There doesn't seem to be a conspiracy stopping research into alternatives to Copenhagen, just a preponderance of interest in testable Physics with real consequences. "
244,0465096050,http://goodreads.com/user/show/70474434-carsten,5,"Quantum Mechanics is one of the foundations of physics (jointly with relativity). Its predictions have been confirmed time and time again and underpins modern technology. It has helped us to understand how the electromagnetic and the two nuclear forces work. It is a remarkable theory. But what does the mathematical formalism mean? This book tells the story how the interpretation of Quantum Mechanics has evolved over the last 90 years or so. It is a very well written book, with a lot of historical details I was not aware of. It doesn’t cover all interpretations of Quantum Mechanics (for example, the transactional interpretation is not mentioned at all, but it has not many followers). But the author describes nicely the troubles scientists went through to make sense of this remarkable theory. Of course, John Bell’s story is told, but so are the stories of David Bohm , Hugh Everett III, Heinz-Dieter Zeh (who died in April this year) and Wojciech Zurek. It is a great book.

250,0465096050,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5917740-nilesh,5,"What is Real is a masterpiece in the way it narrates the quest to find the meaning behind the quantum equations.Quantum science works, like almost nothing else humans have ever invented. Yet, the equations that have come to define the field are impossible to interpret in human languages and in a way that our rationality could accept. It took a while for the greatest minds of the era to even suggest that the wave function is Schrodinger’s wave equation was a probability distribution. The debate took a material turn for the worse with Heisenberg’s uncertainty principle. How does everything so probabilistic theoretically and when unseen actualize into something concrete whenever observed?The book wonderfully elaborates on the details of the problem that splintered the scientific world and had the greatest human minds of all time metaphorically in arms against each other. The debates between Einstein, Bohr, Schrodinger, Pauli, Dirac, Heisenberg, De Broglie and others captivated the world even nearly a century later. After all, what was at stake boiled down to what is real!Hundreds of books wonderfully explain the debates that dominated the pre-war years including the EPR construct. Mr Becker’s work covers the same grounds competently, but cannot add to what has been exhaustively rehashed for decades.  The book’s true value is not in covering the rise of the Copenhagen interpretation, but its fall. The author makes the story of the Copenhagen decline and rise of alternative explanations as understandable, exciting, meaningful and absorbing as the rise - something few who have covered Bohm, Bell, Everett, Wheeler etc have been able to do. This is because the issues at hand turn materially more complex when one attempts to appreciate the equally groundbreaking and relevant work of these scientists. At philosophical and metaphysical levels, the war was between positivism and scientific realism and their sub-schools. Mathematically, even relativity came under pressure with the insertion, deletion and re-insertion of the cosmological constants. This was in the space which was easily narratable, but the mathematical debates kept on intensifying at every stage of the development of unification theories. For the lay folks, it appeared more like fights over the number of dimensions our reality has, their sizes and similar, but scientists disagreed on almost everything as the observations proved reality to be ever more bizarre. The book side-steps the arrival of dozens of subatomic particles and stops before the string theories begin their domination of the discussion, and this helps the book in keeping the focus on quantum reality. The author spends a lot of time on describing the scientists involved and their travesties. While this is often distracting, it helps humanize the story and provides relief to the non-technical readers from the mind-numbing intricacies of the quantum world.  The book makes the collapse of the Copenhagen and rise of Many Worlds far more definitive than it is in the scientific community. Even non-scientists would need dozens of books over the lifetime to develop a basic understanding of the still-shifting reality debates sparked by the quantum revolution. This book is one for any such a list because it focuses on a particular time-frame and a set of issues that are pivotal and not as well covered by almost anyone else."
251,0465096050,http://goodreads.com/user/show/22428213-ian-scuffling,5,"It was a bastardization of Schrödinger's cat that introduced me to the ideas of quantum physics, and since then the topic has been something that I've held deep interest in (albeit from a very amateur's view, not really digging into the nuances other than to understand the prevailing ideas)—my interest has been particularly in terms of the philosophy and existentialism inherent in the problems that the theories present to our experience of the world. To be honest, before reading Adam Becker's What is Real? I had no idea what the Copenhagen Interpretation (CI) was, much less that there was contention in the fundamental foundations of quantum physics and what significance that has for everyday ""classic"" (Newtonian) physics. Becker's book isn't just a really great primer on the material of what quantum physics is and does, but also a bountiful, if not slanted, biography of the science itself—its historical players, their public arguments, the political impacts of scientific pursuits and philosophies. I say slanted because Becker here does not even have pretenses about his feelings towards what he sees as Neils Bohr's egotistical ironclad grip on developing physics students minds and dispositions towards quantum physics and how it's to be seen simply as a mathematical ""world"" separate from the Newtonian ""classic"" world we experience. That is, it's not an observable state, so therefore it's simply a mathematical understanding of particle physics that doesn't necessarily mean something about how we experience or understand the physical realms.Becker, in his biases, however, lays out a compelling and seemingly pat philosophical reasoning for giving more credence to thinkers/physicists like John Bell and Hugh Everett's many worlds formulation. Particularly convincing in this regard are Becker's arguments against the philosophical position of falsifiability, which he posits is a logical fallacy in the sciences because of it's solipsistic myopia, and egotistical ignorance toward what may seem unsavory or overly complex.This book really has something for all tastes—some sections, particularly the ones on the Vienna Circle and their weirdly firm positions as logical positivists, seemed pulled straight out of Pynchon (specifically Against the Day). Finally, Becker's analysis of the STEM resistance to philosophy of science is informative, and slightly depressing as it almost signals a weird strain of anti-intellectual pursuit within the scientific community—a position that seems at odds with everything the sciences stand for—to be clear, the sciences need philosophy as much as philosophy needs the sciences.I would highly recommend anyone with even glancing interest in quantum physics, entanglement, the history of physics and philosophical physics to read What is Real?. Because of Becker's expertise in both writing and physics, I could well see someone even deeply immersed in quantum physics getting something of use out of the book through Becker's precise rendering of the concepts in his experiment examples and his crystal clear—yet engaging—prose. Probably one of the best pop-sci books I've read in the past 10 years."
252,0465096050,http://goodreads.com/user/show/68014166-eric-hulburd,5,"Take my review from a computer/environmental engineer's perspective, not a physicist's. I thought this book was excellent. I've read a few other books on QM that really focused on the math (Leonard Susskind's was great for this). However, while understanding the math is important for applications of QM, my interest really lies in the unintuitive mysteries of quantum physics.This book brings that mystery down to Earth in a somewhat ironic way. As the book explains, ""Shut up and calculate"" is often invoked as a defense of the persistence of ""the"" Copenhagen interpretation. It has brought us wonders in modern science and technology. Becker leaves no doubt about that. However, the irony is that Mermin (original author of quote) went on to explain that he won't shut up. There is something deeply incomplete about the Copenhagen interpretation. In fact, the skepticism towards quantum foundation research (and philosophy of science more broadly) has, in part, enabled an interpretation of QM that feeds wishy washy pseudo-science spirituality (eg Deepak Chopra's insistence that's we exist within a quantum soup through which we can will our desires into existence). Rather than clearly calling out Copenhagen's implicit philosophical reliance on the role of observation/consciousness in creating our knowable reality, it's waved away, along with equally robust, but perhaps more philosophically feasible explanations for what we widely refer to as QM wave function collapse.Perhaps most powerfully, the book defends its philosophical concerns by pointing out, through science history, that truth, even scientific truth, is often shaped powerfully by personalities and culture. Predominance of Bohr's Copenhagen interpretation may be due to Bohr's greater charisma and personableness relative to that of Einstein's, Bohm's willingness to voice sympathy for socialism, or Everett's distaste for public speaking. Or perhaps, simply because the Copenhagen interpretation was the first interpretation to be defined, if not in terms of a coherent theory, at least semantically. Overall, an approachable and clear look at the philosophical implications and history of quantum mechanics. I highly recommend to anyone interested in either of those topics.PS I'm pursuing both criticisms and alternative perspectives to Becker's since this is my first foray into the topic."
253,0465096050,http://goodreads.com/user/show/19059859-sean,5,"Excellent book. You really need to like physics to fully follow this book. It might not have equations, but it requires you to be ready to discuss serious meanings of quantum physics. Extremely well researched. Fantastic insight to all the personalities involved. The author respects all the players, but talks very frankly about them as people with histories, political motives, academic motives and their time/place in human history. As a physics teacher, I fully understand today's ""Shut up and Calculate"" approach to teaching. It is so refreshing to read about how some of the greatest minds to walk the Earth debated and rethought their own ideas on the meaning of all this quantum weirdness.The index and bibliography are great. Even though I teach physics, I still would have liked a glossary section with brief explanations of terms like: complimentarity, Copenhagen interpretation, positivism, logical empiricism, falsifiability, many-worlds, measurement problem, pilot wave, spontaneous collapse. This could really help the non-physics majors.Reading recommendation: try reading the 6 pages at the end first: ""Appendix: Four Views of the Strangest Experiment"". The experiment is easy to understand. The four views then represent the views discussed in the book. Sure, the terminology hasn't yet been explained if you read this first, but I still think it would make a perfect 1st chapter to fully set the stage.I borrowed this book from my local library. I believe I need to buy a copy and read it again with my notebook/pen handy. Again, the bibliography represents a gold-mine of material I really haven't explored (physics philosophy)."

When I got to (only) page 18 I had a very clear idea regarding why the Copenhagen Interpretation is wrong and quite possibly why and I wrote down my thoughts. When I got to page 286 the author indicated Roger Penrose had the same thought. You could have knocked me over with a feather. If an author can help me understand something and have an insight on a topic I have struggled to understand for 30 years in only 18 pages, I would suggest it is a book worth reading, if you are interested in this particular subject.

256,0465096050,http://goodreads.com/user/show/85723871-thomas-dietert,5,"I thoroughly enjoyed this well-written account of the past hundred years of the theory of quantum mechanics, it's inception as a popular field of theoretical physics, and the steady progression and development of the Copenhagen interpretation along with rival theories including Everett's ""many worlds"" theorem, Bohm's pilot-wave theory, and Bell's proof that physics must be ""nonlocal"" (seemingly refuting the notion of Einstein's theory of relativity).The author does a wonderful job of setting the stage in the first third of the book, choosing to focus on the contributions, formulations, and theories of Heisenberg, Schrodinger, De-Broglie, Pierls, Einstein, Bohr, and other notable physicists at the time, and how they all came together to concoct an ""interpretation"" of quantum mechanics known as The Copenhagen interpretation. Not all physicists during the early years of quantum mechanical theory agreed on this interpretation, and the author does a great job of referencing cited material about the theories of these seminal scientists, and intriguingly describes the ways in which they disagreed about such an interpretation; i.e. Einstein was convinced that the ""measurement problem"" was a deep-seated flaw in the interpretation, whereas Bohr (and Heisenberg and friend) all argued was irrelevant. The author follows the development of such conflicting ideas, suggests reasons for why such disagreements weren't easily reconciled, and connects such ideological conflicts with the global political and economic climate (WWI, WWII), also illustrating the influence of classic philosophical movements (such as logical positivism via Mach & The Vienna Circle) on the ""accepted"" interpretation of quantum mechanics.The second third of the book describes the development of such theorems as Bohm's pilot-wave interpretation of quantum w decades go by and the measurement problem still hasn't been solved; The Copenhagen Interpretation still reigns supreme (though nobody can adequately define the collection of theories and experiments that comprise it), and anyone who thinks that there might be more to the ""quantum realm"" than is summed up in the Denmark Dogma is voraciously attacked and all but chased out of the academic field of physics. Fortunately, there are a few physicists with enough notoriety and clout (e.g. Bohm, Bell, etc) that produce some theories and proofs that offer alternative interpretations to Bohr's Copenhagen interpretation, as well as a few physicists (e.g. Everett) who are just in it for the fun of the field and could care less about whether or not their theories are accepted by the majority of physicists. In the latter half of the second third, and well into the last third of the book, the author continues to contextualize the sub-field of quantum physics with the rest of history, and describes the trials and tribulations of such physicists as Zeh, Clauser, and Wheeler (whom never really knew what theory to advocate for) whom continued to develop such esoteric and heretical theories and experiments (Zeh: many worlds, Clauser: Bell's inequality, etc). It was unfortunate to learn that perhaps the greatest reason for the lack of acceptance of such ""progress"" was that the field of physics became far too focused on pragmatic engineering applications following World War II, and dismissed any such reformulation of the ""foundations of quantum mechanics"" as ""Metaphysical Nonsense"" (continuing the trend of the Copenhagen cabal of the earls 1900s); Luckily for us, this was not enough to stop the creation or discovery of quantum field theory, which attempts to answer some of the further questions asked by such alternative theories as Zeh's ""decoherence"" principle (extending/reformulating Everett's many-worlds theorem) and Bell's inequality.The story ends with an account of the current state of these theories, the experimental result contributing to or refuting currently widely accepted theories of quantum mechanics, introducing potential solutions to the existing theoretical gaps (such as quantum gravity), describing the origins of and contextual placement of the application of quantum mechanics to computation (quantum computing a la Deutsch), and adequately and pleasingly summarizing the current state of the field.The author does a great job of conveying that the point of the book is to illustrate the philosophical (and truly quantum-physical) gaps in the (still) widely popular Copenhagen interpretation of quantum physics. Fortunately for all of humanity, there have been several physicists throughout the past 100 years who didn't let the potential destruction of their careers, or their surely negatively impacted academic reputation get in the way of their imagination enough to discourage or extinguish their desire to truly get to the bottom of such an complex theory of everything. Quantum mechanics, quantum field theory, particle physics, and other related sub-disciplines of the study of the quantum realm are still FAR from solved, and this book comprehensively explains exactly why.To conclude, I would recommend this book to anyone who desires to learn more about exactly what quantum mechanics is at a high enough level as to not get lost in the weeds along the way to a higher level understanding of the physics and philosophical questions that are simultaneously answered and asked by modern quantum-physical theories. If you have only a tangential and/or superficial understanding of quantum mechanics and enjoy a well-told history of such a field, you will enjoy this book and be inspired to learn even more in the future! 5/5 stars."
257,0465096050,http://goodreads.com/user/show/15608248-stefan-poth,2,This book is so redundant. Could relate all the details in half the pages if things were not repeated so many times.
258,0465096050,http://goodreads.com/user/show/29427094-babak,4,"The book mounts a systematic offensive against the Copenhagen Interpretation of quantum mechanics along with the historical narrative of how it came to be the dominant interpretation among physicists, especially in the era of ""big science"" after WWII funded by governments. We learn about differences in the views among the architects of quantum theory (Einstein, Bohr, de Broglie, Schrödinger, Heisenberg, Pauli, Born, and others) on what quantum theory is really about. We meet the heretics (Bohm, Everett, Bell, Clauser, Zeh, and others) who insist on a different conception of what is really out there, sometimes at great personal and professional cost. We also get a glimpse of the philosophical underpinnings of these different interpretations and the intellectual currents that reshaped them. We witness the fragile balance that physicists maintain between their daily work and professional aspirations and the fraught business of delving deeper into what that work really means for the world at large. Overall, this is a very enjoyable and informative read. On the weaker side, I wished that the discussion of the philosophy of science was done more comprehensively. Unfortunately, it only receives a shallow treatment in the book and, perhaps as a result, it contains some mischaracterizations. For example, the work of Popper is reduced to an inaccurate sketch of his demarcation criteria, i.e. ""falsifiability,"" and is attacked on this thin basis. However, Popper's philosophy of science is much more extensive and substantive than falsifiability: it's a coherent structure of rational criticism (which, in fact, the author partially spells out in his attack), in which falsifiability is but a small part.Another confusing aspect of the book's narrative is its treatment of the meaning of Bell's inequality. Multiple times, in his commentary as well as quotations of various physicists and philosophers, the author states that the violation of Bell's inequality forces us to abandon locality. However, we are also told that the many-worlds interpretation actually escapes this. This inconsistency threads through various passages and leaves a confused impression of the consequences of Bell's work and subsequent experimental findings. For example, after a dramatic discussion following the description of Bell's inequalities, we read on p. 160:""In short, Bell's Theorem really leaves only three unequivocal possibilities: either nature is nonlocal in some way, or we live in branching multiple worlds despite appearances to the contrary, or quantum physics gives incorrect predictions about certain experimental setups.""Ok. But then, when discussing the experiments of Clauser and others showing the violation of Bell's inequalities we read on p. 210:""In 1976, both Clauser and the Texas team announced their results: quantum mechanics was vindicated, and Clauser and Freedman's original result stood. Quantum nonlocality was real.""Um, really?! So, what about branching multiple worlds? This inconsistency of statements pervades the rest of the book. The many-worlds interpretation resurfaces again and again but somehow Bell proves that reality is nonlocal all the same.Much of the motivation for the book is drawn from the debate between Bohr and Einstein, which revolves (as the author clearly and correctly states) about locality. Locality is foundational in Einstein's conception of reality and a postulate of his relativity theory. However, this thread is somewhat lost in the later parts of the story. I wished it had been followed and its consequences stated more clearly. We do have a local interpretation of quantum theory without collapse and vague rumination about measurement: it is Everett's ""relative-state"" formulation and its subsequent substantiation by DeWitt, Zeh, Deutsch, and others, which leads to (not postulate) the real existence of many worlds, and provides a basis for understanding what probability means in the theory (again, instead of postulating it).

260,0465096050,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3870575-sean,5,"This was a fantastic read! At the surface level, Becker provides a lot of the necessary background in the history of both modern quantum mechanics and philosophy in order to have spirited debates at cocktail parties. What makes the read so enjoyable, however, is that the entire discussion is couched in the personalities and the interactions of the people there, originally arguing the ideas. Some of those tales are quite tragic, causing me to shout at how terrible and terribly wrong some people were or at how unfortunate the political environment was. At other times I was truly encouraged by how good ideas and rigorous, honest arguments eventually find a foothold. My only criticism might be of a span of something like 10 pages which dove into the parallel development of philosophy regarding logical positivism — I felt like the tenants of positivism were already laid out sufficiently, the history there dragged a bit and didn’t seem very necessary to the transition to realism. Anyway, there is a fair amount of philosophy within the context of interpreting quantum science, but that is part of Becker’s point that physics after WWII lost a lot of its introspection due to specialization and excessive pragmatism. I am too close to all of this stuff to say strongly that anyone would love this book but I’d certainly recommend it be given a shot."

The book is all about the journey of better understanding reality. Along the way, it reveals the fascinating personalities of key people in behind major developments in QM, and some of the intellectual impostures of the Copenhangen interpretation defenders.In my opinion, you will enjoy this book much more if you took some QM course, and is familiar with the basics of probabilities.

But it's so much more in ways I did not anticipate.It is a redemption of Albert Einstein who, the common lore (even among physicists) would have us know, has lost touch as he got older and never really accepted the strange reality of the quantum physics despite his early contributions to the field. That view is at best wildly distorted.It is a story of Niels Bohr, who's cult of personality gathered a mysticism and following that resulted in arguably the most embarrassing chapter in modern science. Their dogmatic views (summed up as the Copenhagen Interpretation) prevented physicists to probe deep into the foundations of quantum physics and our universe.Anyone who tried to understand what was actually going on would face ridicule, risk losing their job (or not being able to find one after they graduated) and would not be able to get their papers published. Even a mere association with someone questioning the dogma was risky to one's career.Questioning the status quo, trying to look for alternative interpretations, coming up with experiments that can show us holes in the current understanding are at the core of science. And yet, this pushback against even the slightest rocking of the boat was going on for several decades.Pushback that was perpetuated by extremely talented people. You'd have an easier time counting who *didn't* get a Nobel Price in the book's cast of characters. Indeed, it may be because of the unprecedented success in prediction and precision of the quantum theory that people were told to ""shut up and calculate"", killing any enquiries about the nature of the field and how it relates to our world.It is also, tragically, a story of the second World War and its disruption in the scientific field. In the thirties, the American physics was seriously behind and the vast majority of the research was going on in Berlin, Vienna and Copenhagen. A lot of that by scientists who were either of Jewish origin or who had a Jewish spouse.Hitler's anti-semitism played a large role in the quantum physics research leaving central Europe and the first atomic bomb being developed in the USA.Even though the book pushes hard against the Copenhagen interpretation and the behaviour surrounding the dogmatic positions at the time, I find it is fair to all the people involved. All of these people were brilliant scientists and that is not dismissed here.It would for example be easy to paint Niels Bohr as the villain of the story, but in addition to his undeniable contributions to physics, he was helping Jewish scientists by finding them jobs, financial help and helping them leave their countries that were about to arrest them. Other than Hitler, there are no villains here, just multi-faceted people.What is Real is a fascinating account of the physics in the last hundred years. It also made me really frustrated and often quite angry. You don't need to really know any physics to get the same out of it. It is beautifully written and I could not put it down."
271,0465096050,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4756170-daniel,5,"What physics question can’t Einstein solve? The meaning of Quantum Physics, the ‘Measurement problem’ a.k.a. Schrödinger’s cat or collapse of Quantum Wave function when a measurement is made. So the cat is neither dead or alive before measurement, but once an observation is made it has to settle in either of one state. Bohr received a Nobel prize for discovering the different energy states (quanta) of electrons in an atom. Together with Planck and Einstein, quantum theory was born. When Schrödinger discovered the wave equation, it correctly predicted the probabilistic position of the electron in an hydrogen atom. Heisenberg later discovered his uncertainty principle and then together with Bohr built the Copenhagen interpretation: ‘Shut up and calculate’. They posited that quantum theory cannot be understood the way that we experience every day life, and is only a useful equation for accurate prediction of every day effects. This infuriated many nonconformist physicists!Einstein, Podolsy and Rosen published a paper about entanglement, the paradox that entangled particles can transmit information faster than the speed of light. ‘Spooky actions at a distance’. Recent experiments seem to confirm this. Bohm suggested a pilot wave theory that helped explain the dual wave particle nature of electrons during a double slit experiment: the presence of a detector changed the wave interference pattern of the electron! It is interesting to know that Heisenberg supported Nazi Germany, while his mentor Bohr and Einstein had to flee Germany because of their Jewish lineage. That however prevented Germany from developing the atomic bomb first, since Heisenberg was a lousy practical physicist. Bohm’s theory aaa not well accepted because he was a communist. Everett suggested that wave functions do not collapse and there are actually infinite worlds. So is the cat dead or alive? Bohr says don’t ask. Everett says both but in different worlds. I am still confused. This is a great book about Quantum physics, I am sure I misunderstand large parts of it, but still learn a lot from it. "

273,0465096050,http://goodreads.com/user/show/15728519-r-hul,4,"Adam Becker, a Ph. D. in Physics, writes about interpretation of Quantum Mechanics, the enormously successful 20th century theory underpinning everything from semiconductor electronics to satellite navigation. At the heart of quantum mechanics is the ""weirdness"" summed up by Heisenberg's uncertainty principle that binds the combined accuracy with which both the position and momentum of a particle can be measured, even though the wavefunction underlying a quantum state is entirely determined by the Schrodinger equation. Most physicists rely on the Copenhagen interpretation of Quantum mechanics which separates the quantum world being measured from the classical measuring instrument and keeps the measurement process itself outside the realm of quantum mechanics. The quantum state is then interpreted as probabilistically collapsing into the measured state. This interpretation allows quantum mechanical calculations to make multiple predictions that have held up to the level of our most accurate measurements. Throughout the 20th century, the dominant view, exemplified by Richard Feynman and others, was to focus on observable and falsifiable predictions of quantum mechanics than to question whether it is complete. Einstein, Podolsky and Rosen had famously shown that Quantum mechanics is either incomplete or non-local. Although out of the mainstream, many scientists had proposed alternative interpretations of quantum mechanics to address Copenhagen's mysteries. De Broglie and Bohm developed the pilot-wave interpretation, where every particle is associated with a pilot wave, that avoids the Copenhagen collapse but introduces non-locality. Hugh Everett developed the Many Worlds interpretation where interaction between any two quantum particles leads to the creation of multiple joint wave functions in multiple universes, only one of which (the observed) is accessible to us. A third is Spontaneous Collapse in which, unlike Copenhagen, the measurement system is also a quantum object and collapse happens spontaneously, at a high probability due to the large number of quantum interactions happening when a macroscopic measurement system is used. Becker's narrative is fascinating and he is correct that insufficient attention has been paid to the fundamentals of quantum mechanics while we have reaped the benefits of its accuracy. However, it is also correct that, while intellectually illuminating, many of the alternative interpretations themselves introduce further weirdness like non-locality or are non-falsifiability. Becker is spotty when he attacks the necessity of Popperian falsifiability in a physical theory. On the one hand, it is correct that scientific progress is often inductive and grand theories are often created in retrospect to fit facts, but his central argument that a universally applied theory is falsifiable only by invoking something outside the universe itself sets too high a bar. It is often more satisfying and beneficial to keep a problem open rather than to rely on theories that do not offer measurements to falsify them. However, this is no reason not to stymie research into an area. While this book is greatly illuminating, Becker gives short shrift to the practical reasons why most physicists are more excited to work on the physics of quantum mechanics rather than its philosophical underpinnings- because physics today is a material science more than it is natural philosophy. There doesn't seem to be a conspiracy stopping research into alternatives to Copenhagen, just a preponderance of interest in testable Physics with real consequences. "

Its predictions have been confirmed time and time again and underpins modern technology. It has helped us to understand how the electromagnetic and the two nuclear forces work. It is a remarkable theory. But what does the mathematical formalism mean? This book tells the story how the interpretation of Quantum Mechanics has evolved over the last 90 years or so. It is a very well written book, with a lot of historical details I was not aware of. It doesn’t cover all interpretations of Quantum Mechanics (for example, the transactional interpretation is not mentioned at all, but it has not many followers). But the author describes nicely the troubles scientists went through to make sense of this remarkable theory. Of course, John Bell’s story is told, but so are the stories of David Bohm , Hugh Everett III, Heinz-Dieter Zeh (who died in April this year) and Wojciech Zurek. It is a great book.

Yet, the equations that have come to define the field are impossible to interpret in human languages and in a way that our rationality could accept. It took a while for the greatest minds of the era to even suggest that the wave function is Schrodinger’s wave equation was a probability distribution. The debate took a material turn for the worse with Heisenberg’s uncertainty principle. How does everything so probabilistic theoretically and when unseen actualize into something concrete whenever observed?The book wonderfully elaborates on the details of the problem that splintered the scientific world and had the greatest human minds of all time metaphorically in arms against each other. The debates between Einstein, Bohr, Schrodinger, Pauli, Dirac, Heisenberg, De Broglie and others captivated the world even nearly a century later. After all, what was at stake boiled down to what is real!Hundreds of books wonderfully explain the debates that dominated the pre-war years including the EPR construct. Mr Becker’s work covers the same grounds competently, but cannot add to what has been exhaustively rehashed for decades.  The book’s true value is not in covering the rise of the Copenhagen interpretation, but its fall. The author makes the story of the Copenhagen decline and rise of alternative explanations as understandable, exciting, meaningful and absorbing as the rise - something few who have covered Bohm, Bell, Everett, Wheeler etc have been able to do. This is because the issues at hand turn materially more complex when one attempts to appreciate the equally groundbreaking and relevant work of these scientists. At philosophical and metaphysical levels, the war was between positivism and scientific realism and their sub-schools. Mathematically, even relativity came under pressure with the insertion, deletion and re-insertion of the cosmological constants. This was in the space which was easily narratable, but the mathematical debates kept on intensifying at every stage of the development of unification theories. For the lay folks, it appeared more like fights over the number of dimensions our reality has, their sizes and similar, but scientists disagreed on almost everything as the observations proved reality to be ever more bizarre. The book side-steps the arrival of dozens of subatomic particles and stops before the string theories begin their domination of the discussion, and this helps the book in keeping the focus on quantum reality. The author spends a lot of time on describing the scientists involved and their travesties. While this is often distracting, it helps humanize the story and provides relief to the non-technical readers from the mind-numbing intricacies of the quantum world.  The book makes the collapse of the Copenhagen and rise of Many Worlds far more definitive than it is in the scientific community. Even non-scientists would need dozens of books over the lifetime to develop a basic understanding of the still-shifting reality debates sparked by the quantum revolution. This book is one for any such a list because it focuses on a particular time-frame and a set of issues that are pivotal and not as well covered by almost anyone else."
281,0465096050,http://goodreads.com/user/show/22428213-ian-scuffling,5,"It was a bastardization of Schrödinger's cat that introduced me to the ideas of quantum physics, and since then the topic has been something that I've held deep interest in (albeit from a very amateur's view, not really digging into the nuances other than to understand the prevailing ideas)—my interest has been particularly in terms of the philosophy and existentialism inherent in the problems that the theories present to our experience of the world. To be honest, before reading Adam Becker's What is Real? I had no idea what the Copenhagen Interpretation (CI) was, much less that there was contention in the fundamental foundations of quantum physics and what significance that has for everyday ""classic"" (Newtonian) physics. Becker's book isn't just a really great primer on the material of what quantum physics is and does, but also a bountiful, if not slanted, biography of the science itself—its historical players, their public arguments, the political impacts of scientific pursuits and philosophies. I say slanted because Becker here does not even have pretenses about his feelings towards what he sees as Neils Bohr's egotistical ironclad grip on developing physics students minds and dispositions towards quantum physics and how it's to be seen simply as a mathematical ""world"" separate from the Newtonian ""classic"" world we experience. That is, it's not an observable state, so therefore it's simply a mathematical understanding of particle physics that doesn't necessarily mean something about how we experience or understand the physical realms.Becker, in his biases, however, lays out a compelling and seemingly pat philosophical reasoning for giving more credence to thinkers/physicists like John Bell and Hugh Everett's many worlds formulation. Particularly convincing in this regard are Becker's arguments against the philosophical position of falsifiability, which he posits is a logical fallacy in the sciences because of it's solipsistic myopia, and egotistical ignorance toward what may seem unsavory or overly complex.This book really has something for all tastes—some sections, particularly the ones on the Vienna Circle and their weirdly firm positions as logical positivists, seemed pulled straight out of Pynchon (specifically Against the Day). Finally, Becker's analysis of the STEM resistance to philosophy of science is informative, and slightly depressing as it almost signals a weird strain of anti-intellectual pursuit within the scientific community—a position that seems at odds with everything the sciences stand for—to be clear, the sciences need philosophy as much as philosophy needs the sciences.I would highly recommend anyone with even glancing interest in quantum physics, entanglement, the history of physics and philosophical physics to read What is Real?. Because of Becker's expertise in both writing and physics, I could well see someone even deeply immersed in quantum physics getting something of use out of the book through Becker's precise rendering of the concepts in his experiment examples and his crystal clear—yet engaging—prose. Probably one of the best pop-sci books I've read in the past 10 years."
282,0465096050,http://goodreads.com/user/show/68014166-eric-hulburd,5,"Take my review from a computer/environmental engineer's perspective, not a physicist's. I thought this book was excellent. I've read a few other books on QM that really focused on the math (Leonard Susskind's was great for this). However, while understanding the math is important for applications of QM, my interest really lies in the unintuitive mysteries of quantum physics.This book brings that mystery down to Earth in a somewhat ironic way. As the book explains, ""Shut up and calculate"" is often invoked as a defense of the persistence of ""the"" Copenhagen interpretation. It has brought us wonders in modern science and technology. Becker leaves no doubt about that. However, the irony is that Mermin (original author of quote) went on to explain that he won't shut up. There is something deeply incomplete about the Copenhagen interpretation. In fact, the skepticism towards quantum foundation research (and philosophy of science more broadly) has, in part, enabled an interpretation of QM that feeds wishy washy pseudo-science spirituality (eg Deepak Chopra's insistence that's we exist within a quantum soup through which we can will our desires into existence). Rather than clearly calling out Copenhagen's implicit philosophical reliance on the role of observation/consciousness in creating our knowable reality, it's waved away, along with equally robust, but perhaps more philosophically feasible explanations for what we widely refer to as QM wave function collapse.Perhaps most powerfully, the book defends its philosophical concerns by pointing out, through science history, that truth, even scientific truth, is often shaped powerfully by personalities and culture. Predominance of Bohr's Copenhagen interpretation may be due to Bohr's greater charisma and personableness relative to that of Einstein's, Bohm's willingness to voice sympathy for socialism, or Everett's distaste for public speaking. Or perhaps, simply because the Copenhagen interpretation was the first interpretation to be defined, if not in terms of a coherent theory, at least semantically. Overall, an approachable and clear look at the philosophical implications and history of quantum mechanics. I highly recommend to anyone interested in either of those topics.PS I'm pursuing both criticisms and alternative perspectives to Becker's since this is my first foray into the topic."
283,0465096050,http://goodreads.com/user/show/19059859-sean,5,"Excellent book. You really need to like physics to fully follow this book. It might not have equations, but it requires you to be ready to discuss serious meanings of quantum physics. Extremely well researched. Fantastic insight to all the personalities involved. The author respects all the players, but talks very frankly about them as people with histories, political motives, academic motives and their time/place in human history. As a physics teacher, I fully understand today's ""Shut up and Calculate"" approach to teaching. It is so refreshing to read about how some of the greatest minds to walk the Earth debated and rethought their own ideas on the meaning of all this quantum weirdness.The index and bibliography are great. Even though I teach physics, I still would have liked a glossary section with brief explanations of terms like: complimentarity, Copenhagen interpretation, positivism, logical empiricism, falsifiability, many-worlds, measurement problem, pilot wave, spontaneous collapse. This could really help the non-physics majors.Reading recommendation: try reading the 6 pages at the end first: ""Appendix: Four Views of the Strangest Experiment"". The experiment is easy to understand. The four views then represent the views discussed in the book. Sure, the terminology hasn't yet been explained if you read this first, but I still think it would make a perfect 1st chapter to fully set the stage.I borrowed this book from my local library. I believe I need to buy a copy and read it again with my notebook/pen handy. Again, the bibliography represents a gold-mine of material I really haven't explored (physics philosophy)."
284,0465096050,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7413398-ken-dilella,4,"too early to review but a lot of history. A different view of the history of quantum mechanics but none the less still history. I should add it's the build up of the Copenhagen interpretation leading to Einsteins famous quote ""God does not play dice"".added a star. first half was saturated with history. second half ripe with reality. especially interesting that hugh everett gets more attention than any book I've read except a book about hugh everett. finally someone writes a book exposing the Copenhagen interpretation and doesn't bog you down with silly string theory. (there is a mention in the book) almost finished.the second half of this book is about as good as it gets on quantum interpretations. well worth the revisionist first half."
285,0465096050,http://goodreads.com/user/show/13477515-mike,5,"This was a WOW! book for me. When I got to (only) page 18 I had a very clear idea regarding why the Copenhagen Interpretation is wrong and quite possibly why and I wrote down my thoughts. When I got to page 286 the author indicated Roger Penrose had the same thought. You could have knocked me over with a feather. If an author can help me understand something and have an insight on a topic I have struggled to understand for 30 years in only 18 pages, I would suggest it is a book worth reading, if you are interested in this particular subject. If you have every tried to understand the ""weirdness"" of quantum theory, this is the book to read."
286,0465096050,http://goodreads.com/user/show/85723871-thomas-dietert,5,"I thoroughly enjoyed this well-written account of the past hundred years of the theory of quantum mechanics, it's inception as a popular field of theoretical physics, and the steady progression and development of the Copenhagen interpretation along with rival theories including Everett's ""many worlds"" theorem, Bohm's pilot-wave theory, and Bell's proof that physics must be ""nonlocal"" (seemingly refuting the notion of Einstein's theory of relativity).The author does a wonderful job of setting the stage in the first third of the book, choosing to focus on the contributions, formulations, and theories of Heisenberg, Schrodinger, De-Broglie, Pierls, Einstein, Bohr, and other notable physicists at the time, and how they all came together to concoct an ""interpretation"" of quantum mechanics known as The Copenhagen interpretation. Not all physicists during the early years of quantum mechanical theory agreed on this interpretation, and the author does a great job of referencing cited material about the theories of these seminal scientists, and intriguingly describes the ways in which they disagreed about such an interpretation; i.e. Einstein was convinced that the ""measurement problem"" was a deep-seated flaw in the interpretation, whereas Bohr (and Heisenberg and friend) all argued was irrelevant. The author follows the development of such conflicting ideas, suggests reasons for why such disagreements weren't easily reconciled, and connects such ideological conflicts with the global political and economic climate (WWI, WWII), also illustrating the influence of classic philosophical movements (such as logical positivism via Mach & The Vienna Circle) on the ""accepted"" interpretation of quantum mechanics.The second third of the book describes the development of such theorems as Bohm's pilot-wave interpretation of quantum w decades go by and the measurement problem still hasn't been solved; The Copenhagen Interpretation still reigns supreme (though nobody can adequately define the collection of theories and experiments that comprise it), and anyone who thinks that there might be more to the ""quantum realm"" than is summed up in the Denmark Dogma is voraciously attacked and all but chased out of the academic field of physics. Fortunately, there are a few physicists with enough notoriety and clout (e.g. Bohm, Bell, etc) that produce some theories and proofs that offer alternative interpretations to Bohr's Copenhagen interpretation, as well as a few physicists (e.g. Everett) who are just in it for the fun of the field and could care less about whether or not their theories are accepted by the majority of physicists. In the latter half of the second third, and well into the last third of the book, the author continues to contextualize the sub-field of quantum physics with the rest of history, and describes the trials and tribulations of such physicists as Zeh, Clauser, and Wheeler (whom never really knew what theory to advocate for) whom continued to develop such esoteric and heretical theories and experiments (Zeh: many worlds, Clauser: Bell's inequality, etc). It was unfortunate to learn that perhaps the greatest reason for the lack of acceptance of such ""progress"" was that the field of physics became far too focused on pragmatic engineering applications following World War II, and dismissed any such reformulation of the ""foundations of quantum mechanics"" as ""Metaphysical Nonsense"" (continuing the trend of the Copenhagen cabal of the earls 1900s); Luckily for us, this was not enough to stop the creation or discovery of quantum field theory, which attempts to answer some of the further questions asked by such alternative theories as Zeh's ""decoherence"" principle (extending/reformulating Everett's many-worlds theorem) and Bell's inequality.The story ends with an account of the current state of these theories, the experimental result contributing to or refuting currently widely accepted theories of quantum mechanics, introducing potential solutions to the existing theoretical gaps (such as quantum gravity), describing the origins of and contextual placement of the application of quantum mechanics to computation (quantum computing a la Deutsch), and adequately and pleasingly summarizing the current state of the field.The author does a great job of conveying that the point of the book is to illustrate the philosophical (and truly quantum-physical) gaps in the (still) widely popular Copenhagen interpretation of quantum physics. Fortunately for all of humanity, there have been several physicists throughout the past 100 years who didn't let the potential destruction of their careers, or their surely negatively impacted academic reputation get in the way of their imagination enough to discourage or extinguish their desire to truly get to the bottom of such an complex theory of everything. Quantum mechanics, quantum field theory, particle physics, and other related sub-disciplines of the study of the quantum realm are still FAR from solved, and this book comprehensively explains exactly why.To conclude, I would recommend this book to anyone who desires to learn more about exactly what quantum mechanics is at a high enough level as to not get lost in the weeds along the way to a higher level understanding of the physics and philosophical questions that are simultaneously answered and asked by modern quantum-physical theories. If you have only a tangential and/or superficial understanding of quantum mechanics and enjoy a well-told history of such a field, you will enjoy this book and be inspired to learn even more in the future! 5/5 stars."
287,0465096050,http://goodreads.com/user/show/15608248-stefan-poth,2,This book is so redundant. Could relate all the details in half the pages if things were not repeated so many times.
288,0465096050,http://goodreads.com/user/show/29427094-babak,4,"The book mounts a systematic offensive against the Copenhagen Interpretation of quantum mechanics along with the historical narrative of how it came to be the dominant interpretation among physicists, especially in the era of ""big science"" after WWII funded by governments. We learn about differences in the views among the architects of quantum theory (Einstein, Bohr, de Broglie, Schrödinger, Heisenberg, Pauli, Born, and others) on what quantum theory is really about. We meet the heretics (Bohm, Everett, Bell, Clauser, Zeh, and others) who insist on a different conception of what is really out there, sometimes at great personal and professional cost. We also get a glimpse of the philosophical underpinnings of these different interpretations and the intellectual currents that reshaped them. We witness the fragile balance that physicists maintain between their daily work and professional aspirations and the fraught business of delving deeper into what that work really means for the world at large. Overall, this is a very enjoyable and informative read. On the weaker side, I wished that the discussion of the philosophy of science was done more comprehensively. Unfortunately, it only receives a shallow treatment in the book and, perhaps as a result, it contains some mischaracterizations. For example, the work of Popper is reduced to an inaccurate sketch of his demarcation criteria, i.e. ""falsifiability,"" and is attacked on this thin basis. However, Popper's philosophy of science is much more extensive and substantive than falsifiability: it's a coherent structure of rational criticism (which, in fact, the author partially spells out in his attack), in which falsifiability is but a small part.Another confusing aspect of the book's narrative is its treatment of the meaning of Bell's inequality. Multiple times, in his commentary as well as quotations of various physicists and philosophers, the author states that the violation of Bell's inequality forces us to abandon locality. However, we are also told that the many-worlds interpretation actually escapes this. This inconsistency threads through various passages and leaves a confused impression of the consequences of Bell's work and subsequent experimental findings. For example, after a dramatic discussion following the description of Bell's inequalities, we read on p. 160:""In short, Bell's Theorem really leaves only three unequivocal possibilities: either nature is nonlocal in some way, or we live in branching multiple worlds despite appearances to the contrary, or quantum physics gives incorrect predictions about certain experimental setups.""Ok. But then, when discussing the experiments of Clauser and others showing the violation of Bell's inequalities we read on p. 210:""In 1976, both Clauser and the Texas team announced their results: quantum mechanics was vindicated, and Clauser and Freedman's original result stood. Quantum nonlocality was real.""Um, really?! So, what about branching multiple worlds? This inconsistency of statements pervades the rest of the book. The many-worlds interpretation resurfaces again and again but somehow Bell proves that reality is nonlocal all the same.Much of the motivation for the book is drawn from the debate between Bohr and Einstein, which revolves (as the author clearly and correctly states) about locality. Locality is foundational in Einstein's conception of reality and a postulate of his relativity theory. However, this thread is somewhat lost in the later parts of the story. I wished it had been followed and its consequences stated more clearly. We do have a local interpretation of quantum theory without collapse and vague rumination about measurement: it is Everett's ""relative-state"" formulation and its subsequent substantiation by DeWitt, Zeh, Deutsch, and others, which leads to (not postulate) the real existence of many worlds, and provides a basis for understanding what probability means in the theory (again, instead of postulating it).

290,0465096050,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3870575-sean,5,"This was a fantastic read! At the surface level, Becker provides a lot of the necessary background in the history of both modern quantum mechanics and philosophy in order to have spirited debates at cocktail parties. What makes the read so enjoyable, however, is that the entire discussion is couched in the personalities and the interactions of the people there, originally arguing the ideas. Some of those tales are quite tragic, causing me to shout at how terrible and terribly wrong some people were or at how unfortunate the political environment was. At other times I was truly encouraged by how good ideas and rigorous, honest arguments eventually find a foothold. My only criticism might be of a span of something like 10 pages which dove into the parallel development of philosophy regarding logical positivism — I felt like the tenants of positivism were already laid out sufficiently, the history there dragged a bit and didn’t seem very necessary to the transition to realism. Anyway, there is a fair amount of philosophy within the context of interpreting quantum science, but that is part of Becker’s point that physics after WWII lost a lot of its introspection due to specialization and excessive pragmatism. I am too close to all of this stuff to say strongly that anyone would love this book but I’d certainly recommend it be given a shot."
291,0465096050,http://goodreads.com/user/show/23648829-rodrigo-nemmen,4,"This book is not about certainties, but about uncertainties. What I mean by that is that do not expect this book to reveal to you the deep truths of quantum mechanics, or the one favoured interpretation among Copenhagen, many-worlds, pilot wave etc. Nobody knows the answers to this questions, that is the bottomline. The book is all about the journey of better understanding reality. Along the way, it reveals the fascinating personalities of key people in behind major developments in QM, and some of the intellectual impostures of the Copenhangen interpretation defenders.In my opinion, you will enjoy this book much more if you took some QM course, and is familiar with the basics of probabilities.
