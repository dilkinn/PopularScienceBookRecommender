The final chapter of the book, naturally. So skip to page 200 and save yourself a LOT of time wandering aimlessy through the groves of academe. Not that there isn't viable information in the preceding seven chapters, mind you, but it's a long slog of background before getting to the good stuff. I suppose they had to do something to make it more than a pamphlet. Trust me. Read Chapter 8, and then - if you feel so inclined - you can go back for the tedious build-up. But Chapter 8 really does have some good - and practical - information on how to learn (and how ""quick-fixes"" like cramming and rote memorization are not true fixes at all)."

Unfortunately, our default way of learning is terribly ineffective. Refer to  Full summary of make it stick: science of successfull learning Also how I use the techniques of this book to read faster and remember morePerhaps this has happened to you as well, asking a person’s name just to forget it a minute later. What’s worse is that we think to ourselves, gosh, I have a very bad memory. Just if I was a bit smarter…After reading more than 15 books on learning and pick-performance, I’ve noticed a recurring pattern: when it comes to learning, it doesn’t matter what kind of brain you have, what matters is how you use it.In fact, from Einstein, Mozart to Elon Musk, studies have demonstrated that world-class performers and prodigies reach that level of achievement due to the learning methods, practicing strategies, and the mindset they have, and not something that they are born with.I.

Click for full summary of key points II. The Illusion of learningLearning is deeper and more durable when it’s effortful. Learning that’s easy is like writing in sand, here today and gone tomorrow.This is how most of us initially study and try to learn: We start reading the text, underline and highlight the material.Then we dedicate our time to rereading them. We get fluent in the text and terminology which feels like learning.This familiarity with a text which is the product of rereading creates an illusion of learning. This fluency with the text is a misleading indicator of what you have learned, and how much you will remember.This way of learning is often very easy and comfortable. In fact, many teachers believe that learning should be made easier and faster.This intuition that leads us to rereading strategy is compelling and difficult to ignore for two reasons. First, as we keep repeating, we notice an increase in our performance. Second, we fail to notice that this improvement is coming from our short-term memory and will fade away quickly.III. The 5 Learning Strategies for Super Learning1. RetrievalIn essence, retrieval is trying to remember what you have already studied or learned.This is one of the most effective techniques of learning that burns the material into your brain. This should be the core strategy of your learning. How to use retrieval practice: When you study lecture notes or read a book, pause periodically and ask yourself:1. What are the key ideas?2. What terms or ideas are new to me?3. How would I define them?4. How do the ideas relate to what I already know?The harder it is to recall a new learning from memory, the greater the benefits.How it feels: Compared to rereading, retrieval and self-quizzing may feel uncomfortable and frustrating especially when the new learning is hard to recall. The irony is that this is exactly how you actually know that it’s working and you are in deep learning mode.2. Space out Your Retrieval PracticeSpaced practice means leaving a considerable time between your practicing sessions.How to use spaced Retrieval: Establish a schedule for self-quizzing sessions with some time to elapse between each session. How much time?Depends on the material. If you’re trying to remember words, names, faces, etc., practice the retrieval within a few minutes after the first encounter.New material from a text must be revisited within a day or so of your first encounter with it. After the second visit, you would need to let at least one week to pass before the next rehearsal.What your intuition tells you to do: If you’re like me, your intuition might convince you to dedicate stretches of time to mass practice; that is, single-mindedly engaging with repetitive practice until you pass out.Why spaced repetition is effective? When you leave some space between your retrieval practice or self-quizzing, some material is already forgotten. At this stage, when trying to recall, you are reconstructing what you have already studied from your long-term memory. This effort engages more neuronal pathways and strengthens the memory traces. Click for full summary of key points تقریبا همه متودهایی رو که ما برای خوندن و یاد گرفتن استفاده می کنیم رو این کتاب اثبات می کنه ضعیف و ناکارآمد هستن. از سیستم هایلات کردن گرفته تا مثلا تمرین کردن مسلط شدن به تکنیک های مختلف به صورت ترتیبی و ...توی این کتاب موثرترین تکنیک های یادگیری رو که علم عصب شناسی و علوم شناختی مغز تا به حال بهش رسیده رو یاد می گیرید که مختصر و مفید این اصول یادگیری شامل موارد زیر می شن:1. Practice Retrieving New Learning From Memoryبازیابی، یعنی به یاد آوردن چیزایی که یاد گرفتین از طریق کوییز گرفتن از خودتون. هر وقت تلاش می کنید که مطلبی که یاد گرفتین رو ""دقیق"" به خاطر بیارین، رشته های عصبی مرتبط با اون موضوع رو به شدت قوی تر می کنید به یاد آوردن اون مطلب براتون سریای بعد بسیار راحت تر می شه. هر وقت کتابی یا مطلبی دارید می خونید هر از چند صفحه ای تامل کنید و به خودتون بگید خوب تا الان چی یاد گرفتم. شخصا این کار رو خیلی وقته انجام می دم و واقعا اثر عجیب غریبی داره تو هک کردن اطلاعات روی مغز نازنینم. When reading, pause periodically to ask yourself questions like: What are the key ideas? What terms or ideas are new to me? How would I define them? How do the ideas relate to what I already know? Use quizzing to identify areas of weak mastery, and focus your studying to make them strong.تحقیق پشت تحقیق نشون می دن که این کار بسیار بسیار موثرتر بازخوانی همون متن هست. بازخوانی بزرگترین عیبش اینه که به آدم توهم یادگیری می ده و تنها با کوییز گرفتن از خود این حباب توهم می ترکه و متوجه می شیم چقد داغونیم.2. Space out your retrieval practiceاصل دوم می گه بین تمریناتتون یک فاصله ای در نظر بگیرید و دلیلش اینه که کلا هرچی فرآیند یادگیری تلاش و سختی بیشتری پشتش باشه موندگاری اون هم بیشتری. اما چقدر زمان بین تمرینات باید در نظر بگیریم؟ بستگی به مبحث داره. اگر می خواین یک سری اسم وچهره و عدد به خاطر بسپارید، چند دقیقه بعد از اولین برخوردتون با اونا باید عمل به یاد آوردنشون رو تمرین کنید. مباحث درسی بهتره یکی دو روز فاصله باشه برای اولین تمرین یا سلف کوییز. 3. Interleave the Study of different problem typesاین اصل خیلی اصطلاحا کَونتِر اینتوییتیو هست، یعنی با غریزمون همخونی نداره. این اصل می گه به صورت خطی مطالب رو یاد نگیرید بلکه ادغامشون کنید. یعنی مثلا اگر می خواین تیراندازی یاد بگیرید، اینجوری نباشه که بیاین هزارتا تیر به اهداف تو فاصله 100 متری بزنید بعد که ماهر شدین برید اهداف در فاصله 150 متری رو بزنید. بلکه باید بیاید به طور تصادفی اهداف تو فاصله های مختلف رو هم زمان توی تمرین هاتون قرار بدین.آزمایشای جالبیم درین خصوص انجام شده. مثلا به یه گروه تمرین انداختن توپ توی سبد در فاصله 3 و 5 متری رو می دن. و یک گروه منحصرا روی انداختن توپ توی سبد در فاصله 4 متری تمرکز می کنن. بعد بین این دو گروه مسابقه برگزار می کنن، اون هم با سبدهایی در فاصله 4 متری. جالب اینکه اون گروهی که توی فاصله های 3 و 5 متری داشتن عملکرد بسیار بهتری داشتن نسبت به اون گروه که مشخصا تمرینشون با سبد در فاصله 4 متری بوده.4. Elaborationاصل چهارم یکی از تکنیک های یادگیری ریچارد فاینمن برنده نوبل فیزیک هست. ایلبوریشن یا تشریح رو به فرآیند پیدا کردن لایه های دیگه از مفهوم در یک موضوع مورد مطالعه می گن. مثلا برقرار کردن یک سری لینک و ارتباط بین مطالبی که خوندین و یادگرفتین با مطالبی که از قبل بلد بودین. این موضوع به شدت توی موندگاری اون موضوع توی ذهنتون تاثیر می ذاره. هرچی لینک هایی که بین موضوع جدید و مطالبی که از قدیم تو ذهن دارید برقرار می کنید بیشتر باشه، موندگاریشون بیشتر و به خاطر آوردنشونم بسیار راحت تر میشه. تازه موضوع به همینجا ختم نمی شه، این سبک یادگیری توی بلند مدت باعث ایجاد یک شبکه دانش پیچیده توی مغزتون می شه که اونجا ایده های رنگ و وارنگ شروع می کنن به تراوش کردن.5. Generationاصل پنجم تولید هست، به این معنی که شما قبل از خوندن یا شروع به یادگیری کردن یک مطلبی، سعی کنی یک سری طوالات طرح کنی و به اونا پاسخ بدین. به همین خاطر توی آموزش های حرفه معمولا یه بخش به عنوان پری-کوییز همیشه وجود داره.انجام اینکار مثل شخم زدن زمین می مونه که اون رو حسابی آماده کاشت و برداشت می کنه. ((الان اینجا من ایلَبوریشن انجام دادم مثلا) :D6. Reflectionاصل ششم، ترکیبی از اصل اول و چهارم هست. یعنی مدت زمانی رو اختصاص بدین به اینکه فکر کنید احیرا چه چیزایی یاد گرفتین و از خودتون سوال بپرسید. چه چیزایی خوب پیش رفتن؟ چه چیزایی رو می تونم بهتر کنم؟ این مطالب یادآور چه مطالب دیگه ای هستن برای من؟ برای یادگیری بهتر چه مطالب دیگه ای رو باید فرا بگیرم>؟7. Calibrationاصل هفتم که خیلیم مهمه همون توهم زدایی خودمون هست. کلا نویسنده ها می گن دلیلی که اغلب مردم به صورت حرفه ای از این تکنیکا استفاده نمی کنن، رجوع کردن به غریزشون هست. مثلا فکر می کنن چند بار روخوانی کردن از روی یک متن باعث می شه اون مطلب رو بهتر یاد بگیرن. یا مثلا یه موضوعی رو تمرین کنن بعد برن سراغ موضوع بعد مطالب رو عمیق تر یاد می گیرن. اصل هفتم می گه به صورت دوره ای از خودتون کوییز بگیرید یا تمرینات جدیدی انجام بدین و سعی کنید کاراییتون رو با وقتی که این اصول یادگیری رو به کار می گیرید مقایسه کنید.کلام آخراین کتاب رو شدیدا و عمیقا به همه اونایی که می خوان چیز جدیدی یاد بگیرین از درس گرفته تا یک رشته ورزشی یا موسیقی توصیه می کنم. دلیلش هم اینه که این اصول رو شخصا خیلی به کار گرفتم و واقعا انقلابی توی سیستم یاد گیریم و پیچیده کردن ذهنم ایجاد کرده و دوم اینکه کلیه اصول با انجام آزمایش ها و تحقیقات منسجم به دست اومدن که حسابی قابل اتکا هستن. Happy thriving my friends."
2,0674729013,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2133142-patrik,5,"A very convincing and readable book about how to better learn and, as an extension, how to better teach. Two psychologists and (thankfully) one writer present the latest research on learning and, in so doing, refutes some of our most popular learning techniques (such as 'practice, practice, practice' and my favorite 'read and reread'). At the end of the book, the following eight concrete techniques are offered:1. Retrieving - practice retrieving new (and old) learning (self-quizzing).2. Spacing - space out your retrieval practice, leave time to forget in between practice sessions.3. Interleaving - alternate working on different problems facilitates spacing and forgetting (making learning more difficult, which improves learning).4. Elaboration - try to find additional layers of meaning in the new material.5. Generation - attempt to answer a question or solve a problem before looking at the answer (experiential learning).6. Reflection - a combination of retrieval practice and elaboration that adds layers to learning new material. Ask your self questions.7. Calibration - to avoid various cognitive illusions, use an objective instrument to adjust your sense of what you know and don't know.8. Mnemonic devices - build memory palaces to help yourself retrieve what you have learned.I will aim to incorporate several of these ideas into my courses - mainly through (1) generation, (2) elaboration, and (3) retrieval practice through frequent, predictable, low-stakes ""testing"" (including interleaving). I will not be promoting mnemonic devices... "
3,0674729013,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3897817-morgan-blackledge,4,"What's the first thing you (and everyone else) does when you're trying to learn a subject or text? Odds are good you read, highlight sections and then re-read the text. We all do that because it feels like we're learning. If this is you, than according to researchers who split test different learning strategies and compare results, you're wasting your precious time and energy and there's a much more effective way to learn. It's more difficult, but it's way more effective and takes way less time. Curious? Than by all means, read on.I remember when I was taking cognitive psychology and learning theory towards the end of my graduate training. The classes essentially described how people learn in very precise terms. Although the information in the classes was not presented in a prescriptive form (meaning they didn't tell you what to do in order to learn better). It wasn't difficult to convert the descriptive information into prescriptive practices. Applying these learning techniques informed by the hard science of cognitive psychology and learning theory revolutionized my study habits and dramatically improved my learning outcomes.I remember asking my professor ""why in the fuck didn't they teach us this at the beginning of the degree? I would have had better test scores and information retention with much less time and energy spent studying"". He a looked back at me with the grim tired face of someone who had done battle with university bureaucrats for the better part of two decades and he said ""if you manage to figure that out let me know"".Anyway, that's called counterfactual thinking (e.g. if I only knew then what I know now etc.) and it's a classic cognitive distortion, one of many maladaptive or counter productive ways of thinking identified in cognitive behavioral therapy, and it's pretty much a giant waste of thinking.The important point being that the findings of cognitive psychology and learning theory are like gold for people who teach, or for people who really need/want/love to learn, or for people who are just plain curious about how the mind works.If there were a book out there that was fun to read and that distilled all of these important findings and ideas into a potent short form, wouldn't you want to rush right out and get it? If the answer is yes, then I've got great news for you. Make It Stick is exactly that.So if your response is ""sure, I'll put that on my huge stack of reading that I'd like to do but probably won't"", than I'd at least like to give you some of the key ideas.Cognitive Multipliers:At this point in my life I feel comfortable enough with my masculinity to admit that I used to play Dungeons & Dragons (D&D). That being said, I think I'd like to take this opportunity to come out of the closet and admit to my friends family and to the world that, at age 47, I still spend way too much time playing a turn-based computer war game called Civilization (Civ). In Civ there's this really important core concept called cultural multipliers. They are these technologies that you can develop that don't just add to the power of your civilization, they multiply the power of your civilization.Well it turns out that your brain has somewhat equivalent little hacks called cognitive multipliers. They are simple little cognitive reframes and habits that can literally multiply your learning ability. The book is all about cognitive multiplayers. Here's a short list to (hopefully) spark your curiosity.1: Embracing a growth mindset:Mindset is a simple idea discovered by Stanford psychologist Carol Dweck. In a fixed mindset, people believe their basic qualities, like their intelligence or talent, are simply fixed traits. They spend their time trying to demonstrate their intelligence or talent instead of developing them. They also believe that talent alone creates success without effort. In a growth mindset, people believe that their most basic abilities can be developed through hard work. This view engenders a love of learning and resilience essential for accomplishing just about anything of value. Mindset all boils down to the following. Those who attribute failure to lack of innate ability become hopeless in the face of challenges. Those who attribute failure to insufficient effort double down and try harder in the face of challenges. Challenges are seen as opportunities to grow and improve skills.Adopting a growth mindset is probably the single most important cognitive multiplier. It sounds easy but it takes a lot of self monitoring in order to ferret out and replace all the subtle little ways we all think fixed. 2: practicing like an expert:It turns out that the effort of retrieving knowledge strengthens its staying power, and enhances your ability to retrieve it in the future. The authors advise periodically testing and strengthening new knowledge through self testing. The book goes into extensive detail about what the very best ways to self test are. So get it and read it if you want to know and trust me you do.3: constructing memory cues:The Method of loci (loci is Latin for ""places"") is a mnemonic device popular with ancient Roman and Greek orators (they needed it because didn't have power point back then). Basically, it's a method of memory enhancement which uses visualization to organize and recall information. In this technique you memorizes the layout of a location with a lot of different discrete places, like a street that you walk down a lot. When you're trying to remember a set of items (like cards in a deck) you mentally ""walk"" through the location and commit item to each one of the places "" e.g. the ace of clubs is by the Starbucks, the 3 of diamonds is by the old Blockbuster, the 5 of spades is by the gas station. Retrieval of items is achieved by imagining walking back through the place, allowing it to activate the desired items.It sounds like B.S. but it works. If you've ever seen those dudes who can memorize like four decks of cards, this is how they all do it.Liberally using mnemonic devices such as the method of loci and using other ways of associating new knowledge with vivid and unusual mental imagery is highly effective (for reasons described in detail in the book).Roy G. Biv is the classic mnemonic for remembering the color spectrum. You imagine a guy in a rainbow colored outfit who's name is Roy G. Biv. It's actually an anagram for: Red, Yellow, Green, Blue, Indigo, Violet. It's lame as hell, but it works.In anatomy, the sagittal plane is the vertical plane dividing the body into right and left halves. My anatomy instructor told us the STUPIDEST but extremely effective mnemonic device for remembering it, and I will never forget it.You hold out you hand like you're shaking hands, and with a vertical up and down karate chop gesture you say ""sagittal to meet you"". I know it's asinine, but it works. And those types of devices tend to be extremely effective in general.4: elaboration and personalization:Elaboration is the process of finding additional layers of meaning in new material. Its what's meant when we say ""let's unpack that idea"".It can be extremely useful to relate the material to a personal experience or to something you already know, explaining the idea to someone else, or explaining how it relates to your life outside of class. For example, one way to remember the principal of angular momentum in physics is the visualize the way a figure skaters spin velocity increases when she draws her arms closer to her body. But an even better way is to think of when you were playing on merry go round playground equipment when you were a kid, and it went faster when you pulled yourself from the outside to the center as it spun.5: generation:All that means is trying to solve a problem or answer a question before getting the actual answer. Even if you don't get the right answer it is extremely helpful for learning the right answer when you hear it.The bottom line is, learning is not a passive process. It takes effort. And the more effortful the practice, the more effective. But you also have to be a smart weasel. So I'm shit is proven to work better than others.I'm literally butchering these important points. So why don't I call it quits and just strongly suggest that you read this tremendously important helpful book."
4,0674729013,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4771466-john-martindale,5,"I am an audiobooks junkie and often soon after I finish a book, I go to the computer to write a review, but my mind feels completely void—it seems like I completely forget all I just heard, even the fascinating tidbits. All I feel left with is an impression concerning whether I liked the book or not. Since there is this mental blockage, most of the time I just don't write much of a review and consider those things I wanted to share, lost. Most of my life it has seemed the majority of what was imprinted in my mind was written with disappearing ink. But thank heaven, I download this audiobook “Make it Stick”!! The authors taught me that my initial blankness and difficulty recalling, is actually normal and is an import part in the learning process. That is, if I am diligent to search the recesses of my mind until I recall some of the content. Indeed it's this difficult act of retrieving, that will help cement it in our brain. An example a teacher gave her students was how our mind is like a forest, and the information is lost somewhere in it. The first time we go looking for it can be frustrating and difficult. But the next time will be easier and also will begin to form a trail, making it easier to find our way to the information in the future. One of my biggest hindrances to learning has been my foolish wish that learning might be easy—a stroll through a park. I've wanted to be able to be passive recipient, merely reading or listening, exerting no effort beyond this. But indeed, as the authors point out, merely listening or reading and re-reading material, though giving a sense of familiarity with it, will only result in the illusion of knowledge. We will feel like we know something, but there is no way to know what we actually don't know, unless we're quizzed or questioned. The authors make it clear that re-reading, listening again to a lecture and reviewing our notes, though it may help up past a test the following day, will not result in long term knowledge or mastery.  So yes, as I mentioned, if we want it to stick, we must recall, recall, recall. When we find it difficult, we must resist the temptation to just going back and glancing again at what we previously read, for this would be merely re-reading. We must first try hard to remember and only after this go back to the book/answers/notes and fill in the blanks and make sure we recalled correctly. But it's not merely searching the crannies of the mind and located something, we must reflect on it after finding it. We need to elaborate on the concepts, expressing them in our own words and thinking up examples and analogies, also we should seek to relate and connect the material with our past knowledge. All of this may seem like hard work, but the authors mentioned if learning ain't hard, it's like writing in the sand, it will all be washed away. Even though this requires effort. It is exciting to know that one of the best ways of learning is to actual seek to recall and reflect on the material. And just think, this can be done anywhere, it's like I can be learning and encoding things I had read, throughout the day.The authors point out, how testing, is not so much merely for making sure we learned the material, but testing is an excellent way to learn it. There was a study they mentioned in which one group spent an amount of time cramming, and another spent the same amount of time recalling and quizzing themselves, and then after an extended period of time, when tested, the crammers lost 50% while the recallers only lost 13% of the information they learned. The same amount of time was spent and recalling was obviously far more effective. This is encouraging. They also wrote a good deal about interweaving (I think that is what they called it.) examples would be things like the batter in baseball will do better if he practices with all kinds of pitches, rather than mastering curve balls, fast balls, etc... one at a time. Though the latter will seem more productive, it will give the illusion of mastery. The authors gave the example of those learning to associate artist names with their paintings, and how it's best to skip around, instead of spending much time on anyone. I suppose learning is in school is often like A-B-C-D-E-F-G, but real life is F-A-C-D-G-B-E. The Authors wrote on the importance of understanding the growth mentality, instead of thinking intelligence is static. If kids are told they're smart or that they're “a natural” it can have disastrous results, but if they're praised for diligence and hard work, this will often bear good fruit. People need to understand the brain is plastic and no matter the amount of intelligence we were endowed with, we can through tons of practice and work, master many, many things. But yeah, there is more, but the review is long enough. I will mention I employed the concepts they taught me as I went through the book. I likely spent almost as much time reflecting on it (out loud) while on walks, as I did listening to the book. And yes, I think reflecting on it several hours benefited me much more than merely re-listening to the audiobook."
5,0674729013,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7958239-elizabeth-theiss,4,"From the perspective of a professor with a good 20 years of experience, this book is a gem. The authors use research to demonstrate how students learn best and how teachers can structure courses to facilitate student learning. While I've read many books on teaching, few are as helpful as this one.For example, frequent recall of recent information cements learning. Teachers can help by providing frequent low stakes quizzes that require students to utilize Bloom's taxonomy. The authors provide basic principles and case studies of each principle in practice.Well worth reading for teachers and for students working at becoming more effective learners."

How did it work out?), enhanced with elaboration (What would I do differently next time?) --my comment: reflection and elaboration I think is most critical aspects in learning well.

The author refers to the science that backs up his points but mainly uses anecdotes. This is a readable and I think useful book about how to help people understand and retain information. 
9,0674729013,http://goodreads.com/user/show/31888091-marc-lais,3,"A very interesting subject that is covered thoroughly in this book. Unfortunately, I don't think the authors had enough novel ideas to fill 200 pages. This resulted initially in a lot of repeated information (sometimes almost verbatim), and later in the book losing focus and wandering all over the place. The two paragraph conclusion read like it had been written by a high schooler who suddenly realized she had met the word count requirement. Make it Stick would make an awesome TED Talk or a 3 page blog post, but the authors failed to justify the need for this to be a book."
10,0674729013,http://goodreads.com/user/show/12287031-kiwi-begs2differ,4,"A really interesting book making the case for non-traditional and often counter-intuitive learning techniques such as continuous testing vs. repetition, spacing and interleaving tasks requiring different efforts rather than sequential practice (i.e. complete mastery before moving onto the next level). The book promotes the concept that easier is not better in learning (i.e. effortful recall produces long lasting results) and analyses the evidence for the scientifically unproven but heavily marketed beliefs on preferred learning styles.The author states that IQ tests are only a static measure of what it is known and therefore are irrelevant in showing one’s potential for learning. The measure of other types of intelligence leading to important competencies can be missed by standard tests (e.g. street smarts). A better tool is dynamic testing which helps in the discovery one’s weaknesses and focus on improving in those areas (i.e. testing and trial and error strategy).Many of the examples (hockey, baseball, surgery and medical training, parachute jumping and plane engine failure manoeuvres) were not relevant to me but the arguments and the evidence presented in the book are compelling and convincing. The summary sections at the end of each chapter, “the takeaway” as the author labels them, are useful and so are the last chapter learning tips for students, lifelong learners and teachers. Well worth a read. Recommended."
11,0674729013,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1974052-milan,4,"This is a great book on how we learn and how we don’t learn. The three authors provide basic principles of learning with numerous examples. There are 8 chapters in this book which elaborate on these points.1. Retrieving - practice retrieving what you have learnt.2. Spacing - leave space between your practice sessions.3. Interleaving - learn different things, don't get stuck on one topic.4. Elaboration - find new meaning in what you have learnt.5. Generation - try to solve a problem before checking the answer.6. Reflection - think about what you have learnt, ask yourself questions.7. Calibration - make clear distinction between what you know and don't know.8. Mnemonic devices - use memory palaces to retrieve what you have learnt.Some other points that I really liked: Making learning more difficult makes it stick. We learn more by testing than re-reading. The elements that shape our intellectual abilities lie to a surprising extent within our own control. Genes play a role only up to an extent. “It’s not just what you know, but how you practice what you know that determines how well the learning serves you later.”"

13,0674729013,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7277191-nathan-moore,5,"I've read some great books on learning and skill development this year. I've been looking for a book on the subject of learning with a special emphasis on memory and long term retention and this book fit the bill. I read it after reading the Talent Code, which focuses on developing fine motor skills and I've also recently read Outliers which argues that mastery comes from long hours (about 10,000) of focused practice.In Make it Stick, Brown and others argue that most of the study habits of Americans give only a false impression of learning. Cramming and re-reading are forms of mass practice that feel good but only give short term gains. The authors argue instead that learning should be focused on recall, spaced repetition, and interleaved with other subjects. You must allow a little forgetting to occur between study sessions.If you want the major take away from this book... just study with flashcards and space it out.This book was crucial for me because learning, especially in memory-dependent subjects, has always been labored for me. Deep down, I've always just blamed it on my genes or IQ. Now I feel like I can honestly learn and master anything which is an incredibly exciting sense of empowerment. I was a little disappointed with the last chapter of the book. During the whole book the authors kept promising they would end the book with specific study tips geared for students, life-long learners, and teachers. As a life-long learner I was extremely disappointed when the study tip I got was geared entirely around a case study for an actor memorizing lines for a play. Not really what I think of when I think of lifelong learners.Nonetheless, this was an incredibly motivating book. If only I could focus and not want to learn everything!"
14,0674729013,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4798629-samantha,5,"A superbly wonderful guide if you want to learn better in a more efficient manner. Mainly, it talks about how you need to slow down and digest the information, think and comprehend the material every so often, but most importantly, you need to quiz yourself in order to better remember the subject matter. Memory retrieval and interleaved learning is what will make you succeed, among other techniques.For example, a typical student would read the required text and pen highlight the important ideas. Then he/she will go back and reread the text until they have it “memorized” but this leads to a false sense of security that you are “expert in the material”. The material may exist in your short-term memory but it will not stay long-term. Instead what you should do is that as you read/study, you should stop every so often and think about what you read. Summarize it to yourself in your own words or visualize it in a way that will help you remember. An example the book gave is how a particular medical student needed to learn how “dopamine is released from the ventral tegmental area”. This student didn’t just passively read and highlight these words, instead he dug deeper into the material, identified where this was located in the brain, studied images of it and how it worked (thus creating a mental visual aid) and then he later quizzed himself on it. Quizzing yourself is key, not just at that moment, but you need to quiz yourself a day later, then a couple of days later, then perhaps a week later, then maybe a month later, and so on, it’s up to you to find the right memory retrieval spacing that you are comfortable with. Studies in the book have shown that when instructors/professors included weekly comprehensive low-stakes quizzes instead of just the typical midterm and final only, student retention and attendance improved drastically.Interleaved learning is how you can practice at something, but it must be spaced out, mixed in with other concepts, and varied to produce better mastery over the long-term. However, this method will require more effort and it feels that learning is slower, but you reap the rewards later. An example that the book gave was a study involving a college baseball team over a six-week period. All players were highly-experienced but agreed to take on extra batting practice twice a week. The team was then divided into two batting groups. The first group practiced different kinds of pitches in a linear method – they first mastered hitting fast pitches and when they felt comfortable with that, they moved on to mastering how to hit curve balls, and when they mastered that, they moved on to changeup pitches. The second group, however, learned in a varied manner - the pitcher threw curveballs, fastballs, and changeups in random succession and at first, this frustrated the second group greatly but over time, they learned how to read the pitch and how to respond to it. When the two groups were assessed after the study, it was found that the second group was better at hitting the ball. How this could apply to your learning is that maybe it would be better to vary it – for example, if you’re studying for the GMATs, perhaps you should do sentence correction, math, critical reasoning, data sufficiency, and reading comprehension problems simultaneously instead of doing practice problems in one category at a time.Reading this book has been immensely helpful and I can’t wait to try out other very important tips that the authors recommended. "
15,0674729013,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6036930-alex-linschoten,4,"In 'Make it Stick', the authors explain how to study, how to learn things for long-term retention, and how to tweak the school experience to encourage retention. The authors strive to make examples practical and applicable. Spaced-repetition software is never mentioned in the book -- in fact technology really isn't the focus -- but it's possible to read it as a love letter to Anki. (This would have been five stars but for it being slightly too long.)Some key things I learnt:- testing recall helps cement memories- pure repetition (either rereading something or repeating a concept out loud multiple times) doesn't work, and could even harm you by giving a false sense of confidence/familiarity with the material.- apparently some of the research also shows that a delay in the feedback (i.e. you don't get to find out how you did on the test at the exact same time as taking the test) is preferable to immediate feedback, even w/r/t types of skills (motor skills e.g.) that you'd think would reward immediate feedback.- tests don't have to be digitally produced- production tests (i.e. you have to supply the answer out of thin air) offer greater benefits than multiple-choice tests, but even multiple choice testing offers benefits when compared with no testing.- the ideal situation is one in which you are 'reaching' in some way -- i.e. the test should be hard. If the test is easy, it's probably not delivering that much benefit.- difficult tests (where you have to 'reach' further) help cement memories better than easy tests.- interleaved testing is better than massed testing -- which is to say that instead of siloing all your biology tests together, doing them, then moving on to physics, then moving on to French (for example), you should really mix it all up so that you are switching context. It will be harder and much more frustrating, but the research suggests you'll emerge in the long-term with a much more flexible grasp of the materials.- building scaffolding and mental maps is important for learning -- without the basic scaffolding of a subject, it's hard to hang new concepts and to expand your knowledge.Again, not all of this was new to me, and it won't be to many readers, but this was a useful reminder. I shall be tweaking my learning regimen accordingly."
16,0674729013,http://goodreads.com/user/show/93922358-james,4,"This book was fairly easy to read, and seemed to be organized in a way that followed its teachings (i.e. it would refer back to earlier chapters frequently, mimicking spaced repetition).It could be that I had too much prior knowledge coming into this book, but I didn't feel like I learned very many new things, and some explanations could have been shortened to make the book more concise.Overall though, this book has some really useful information and is worth diving into as a general overview of teaching/learning science."
17,0674729013,http://goodreads.com/user/show/26853283-matthew,5,"This is an absolutely fantastic and essential book, and I would recommend it to anyone who considers themselves to be a lifelong learner or wants to become one. Like the title indicates, this is a book about the science of how we learn, what are the best strategies to learn effectively and what methods can we use to improve cognition/intelligence. In addition to that, this book provides up-to-date research on similar and related topics in cognitive psychology and neuroscience, specifically, mindset, cognitive biases, intelligence, and neural plasticity. However, I am going to specifically focus on learning strategies and ways to improve cognition/intelligence because I think that is what most people here will find useful. If anyone is interested in one of the topics and you don’t think I covered it in enough detail and are interested in it, I will write about it further.Common learning and study strategies and why they are ineffectiveMost students and learners study by reviewing notes and highlights, re-reading text, and doing this all in one big burst, otherwise known as cramming/massed practice. I know that is what I did in high school and college and, until recently, have just read, highlighted and commented in the margins of the non-fiction books that I have read. Does this sound like you? Well, that sort of learning/study strategy is ineffective.Why is this ineffective? Because simply being exposed to the material again does not actually make the material ‘stick’ in your mind. Going over the material in a cram session might allow you to pass the test, but the problem is, is that all of that information will just be stored in your working memory. You are not creating long-term memories because to create a long-term memory, it needs to be deeply encoded by understanding the underlying principle, making connections to prior knowledge, and/or that information be deeply personal. Essentially, performance in the moment is not an indicator of durable learning. Remembering and reciting information weeks after is. Reviewing and cramming can’t help you with that.The most important component, however, is retrieval. Retrieval strengthens and consolidates this deep-encoding process. You can also identify areas that you struggle with, make adjustments to your learning, and, through repeated testing, make the information ‘stick’.Why do most of us use such ineffective learning strategies? Shouldn’t we be good judges of our learning? Well, we should, but we arent. We delude ourselves into thinking that we are learning when we are really not (learning meaning it ‘sticking’ in our brains). We are masters of self-deception. The first self-deception when it comes to learning is that we mistake the ease and fluency with which we comprehend a text with learning. So with looking over notes and highlights and re-reading texts, we get more practice reading that material, and thus be able to comprehend it more, but we are not consolidating the information and taking steps to actually recall it when we need it. This was illustrated by a number of studies and experiments, but I will just briefly summarize a few. People actually learned more when the font’s text was slightly blurry. Crazy huh? But it makes sense if you realize that they had to concentrate a lot more reading the text and were less likely to confuse fluency with learning. The other studies have to do with the best learning strategies kicking the common ‘review and cram’ learning strategies butt.Well, then what are these awesome learning strategies?The first one is testing. Yes, testing is the best learning strategy, and if you take one thing from this post, then you should understand that testing yourself is vastly superior to cram and review as a learning strategy. In fact, that is precisely why I am writing this post. This is a form of testing, and I definitely want this information to ‘stick’ with me. Well, then why does it work? You just need to go back a few paragraphs above to realize why it is better. review and cram uses working memory. Working memory, however, is temporary, and we forget about 70% of what we read and hear very quickly, the other 30% we will lose more slowly, but we will still lose it. Therefore, you can think of learning as interrupting the forgetting process. Testing yourself does this because you are not taking that knowledge from your working memory. You are taking it from your long-term memory, and the process retrieving this information from your long-term memory results in that learning being consolidated in that long-term memory and you actually being able to recall and recite that knowledge.How should I test myselfThe most effective way to test yourself is spaced-repetition testing. What is that? Well, it means test yourself before you read or learn something (this has been shown to increase learning in studies), test yourself after your learn something, and then continually test yourself if it is something that you want to ‘stick’ in your brain. That repeated testing after the fact is the most important part. Studies indicate that testing once helped learning, but repeated testing at spaced intervals yielded significant improvements in learning retention. I think this is best illustrated in a study in a middle school where a researcher tested the students in the beginning of class and at the end on some of the material. Come final test time, the students remembered that tested material a lot more than the non-tested material. And this experiment did not even use testing at spaced-intervals, which studies indicate is by far the most effective. Remember, we are masters of self-deception, so do not stop testing something you want to learn because you ‘think’ you ‘learned’ it. You can increase the time you go back and test yourself with that material, but never stop testing yourself.How should I Test myselfAnything works. Flashcards, multiple choice tests, essays, reflections etc, but the simple rule is that the more cognitive effort you put into the test the better the results, so an essay, teaching, or a discussion will be better than flashcards. Feedback is also essential. You need to know what you are struggling with so that you can change up your learning process.Test to understand the underlying principle, the rule, the theme, etc of what you are learning. This is essential because this creates a foundation of knowledge that you will be able to add new relevant learning to. Without this foundation, you will not know whether or not any new learning you do is relevant or necessary to that body of knowledge.InterleavingWhat is interleaving? Well, this test has informed me that I need to do a bit more learning on this process. However, my understanding is that your learning will improve if you ‘interleave’ two+ related subjects into your learning. This means that focused repetitive practice is not as effective, that ‘burning’ some knowledge or skill into your brain until you ‘get’ it, is not effective. Two helpful examples that the book provided is that a company found it more beneficial to train employees in a new procedure by hopping from process 1 to 3 to 5 to 8, etc, rather than making sure the employee really understands 1 before going on to 2. Why? Well, this does not ‘feel’ effective to us, but it helps better understand the underlying principle of things and helps us distinguish and make connections. A good example is batting practice. The book discusses a study where they had a college baseball team take 2 extra batting sessions a week for like 6 weeks (or something). The control group continued with their normal batting practice of 15 fastballs, 15 curveballs and 15 changeups. While the study group had no idea what pitch was going to be thrown at them. The study group struggled at first, but at the end of the study, they improved their batting average significantly. Why? because they were interleaving the pitches instead of doing a focused mass practice and they were studying how they play. Even though they struggled at first, they were improving their ability to distinguish pitches. This is pretty significant considering that these were already very good hitters.practice how you play and vary it upTest in a manner in the way you are going to actually use the knowledge. As for variability, the book gives an example of drill stations on a hockey rink. That is not effective because a hockey player is just learning how to do a touch-pass on that specific area on the rink in that specific context. Vary it up.how do I improve cognition/intelligence?First off, what is the difference between learning and cognition/intelligence? Basically, the learning strategies will be tied to the domain of what you are learning. You will learn and remember that domain very well, but it doesnt increase your natural ability to learn other things faster. You will simply know the best ways to learn. Well, what actions do result in a cognition multiplayer? For adults, there are three scientifically supported ones (babies and little kids have a lot more)MindsetThis is by far the next most important component of learning. if you don’t want to do every strategy, then you should at least do testing and mindset. Well, what is it? Basically, this revolves around the research of Carol Dweck who wanted to find out why some people give up when they are confronted with failure while others persevere and overcome that failure. Her findings (extensively studied) is that it all comes down to mindset.Well, what characterizes the people who take failure badly? They see failure as an indication of their innate ability. They think failure means that they are stupid, not intelligent and do not have any hope of overcoming that failure. Their mindset is ‘fixed’. They also see the purpose of learning to be achievement, not actual learning. Why? Well, since they see success and failure as an indication of their fixed ability and intelligence, then learning is simply a way to show the world how smart they are. What does this result in? A fear of failure. Students who are successful with this mindset do not take risks. And if they are confronted with a hard problem that they do not know how to do, they give up and provide some sort of excuse. They are trying to protect their identity as intelligent. Their main priority isnt to learn, because taking risks and putting forth effort is essential to learning. It is even worse for students who have experienced repeated failure. They internalize a feeling of learned helplessness and simply give up. They think they are stupid and so what is the point? They don’t even try. I will admit that I had a fixed mindset for quite a while. ‘Luckily’, I was ‘successful’ one, but the negative impacts of this mindset definitely impacted my life in a negative way.How about people who handle failure well? They see learning determined by effort, not by intelligence. Therefore, when they experience difficulty or failure, they view it as an opportunity to learn. This is the proper way to view failure because failure provides you with valuable information. It is one of the main reasons why testing is so effective as a learning strategy. Moreover, because they see learning as determined by effort, they are also willing to take a lot more risks in their learning and persevere through failure.I am sure a few of you are thinking, is mindset actually backed up by ‘hard’ science or is it just a way to trick the mind. In fact, it is! Besides the loads and loads of studies that Dweck has done, neuroscience also backs it up thanks to neuroplasticity. Our brain changes based on our actions, which means that the power to increase our ability is largely within our own control. Intelligence isnt fixed, but does increase when you put forth cognitive effort.Deliberate Practice Increasing our ability being largely in our own hands is also born out by this. Deliberate practice is how you gain mastery in a certain domain. It is goal oriented, mostly solitary, and its purpose is to constantly exceed your past performance. To obtain mastery takes an incredible amount of time and really disproves the notion of ‘they are simply a natural’. No, they achieved mastery through long hours of deliberate practice. The takeaway is that anyone can achieve mastery in a specific domain if they have the time and focus because what determines mastery is not innate ability, but the quantity and quality of practice. I am sure innate ability helps some, but the point is you can master a domain with just average abilities and deliberate practice, but you certainly can’t master it with natural abilities but no deliberate practice.Memory CuesI first should point out that memory cues are a method to organize knowledge that is already learned. You won’t learn anything from using these cues, and you won’t understand the underlying principle or theme of a topic without learning and mastering that first. So remembering a bunch of names and dates and thinking you know history is just stupid, because you dont.So what is the point of memory cues? Well, it is to organize everything that you have learned and attached cues to what you have learned so you can immediately recall it. The most famous and extensive memory cue system would probably be the memory palace. Basically, it ties what you want to remember to mental images (the more shocking and out there the better) and ‘hangs’ them in an imagined physical location. When you want to recall something, you just mentally walk through that location and the images you placed in that location will trigger what you were trying to remember. Why does it work? Well, we are far better at remembering images than basically anything else. This takes advantage of that fact. "
18,0674729013,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4440796-cristina,5,"Excerpts:Retrieval practice—recalling facts or concepts or events from memory—is a more effective learning strategy than review by rereading. Flashcards are a simple example. Retrieval strengthens the memory and interrupts forgetting. A single, simple quiz after reading a text or hearing a lecture produces better learning and remembering than rereading the text or reviewing lecture notes. While the brain is not a muscle that gets stronger with exercise, the neural pathways that make up a body of learning do get stronger, when the memory is retrieved and the learning is practiced. Periodic practice arrests forgetting, strengthens retrieval routes, and is essential for hanging onto the knowledge you want to gain.When you space out practice at a task and get a little rusty between sessions, or you interleave the practice of two or more subjects, retrieval is harder and feels less productive, but the effort produces longer lasting learning and enables more versatile application of it in later settings.Trying to solve a problem before being taught the solution leads to better learning, even when errors are made in the attempt.In neurosurgery (and, arguably, in all aspects of life from the moment you leave the womb), there’s an essential kind of learning that comes from reflection on personal experience. Ebersold described it this way:A lot of times something would come up in surgery that I had difficulty with, and then I’d go home that night thinking about what happened and what could I do, for example, to improve the way a suturing went. How can I take a bigger bite with my needle, or a smaller bite, or should the stitches be closer together? What if I modified it this way or that way? Then the next day back, I’d try that and see if it worked better. Or even if it wasn’t the next day, at least I’ve thought through this, and in so doing I’ve not only revisited things that I learned from lectures or from watching others performing surgery but also I’ve complemented that by adding something of my own to it that I missed during the teaching process.Do students resist testing as a tool for learning? Students do generally dislike the idea of tests, and it’s not hard to see why, in particular in the case of high-stakes tests like midterms and finals, where the score comes with significant consequences. Yet in all studies of testing that reported students’ attitudes, the students who were tested frequently rated their classes more favorably at the end of the semester than those tested less frequently. Those who were frequently tested reached the end of the semester on top of the material and did not need to cram for exams.How does taking a test affect subsequent studying? After a test, students spend more time restudying the material they missed, and they learn more from it than do their peers who restudy the material without having been tested. Students whose study strategies emphasize rereading but not self-testing show overconfidence in their mastery. Students who have been quizzed have a double advantage over those who have not: a more accurate sense of what they know and don’t know, and the strengthening of learning that accrues from retrieval practice.Why is spaced practice more effective than massed practice? It appears that embedding new learning in long-term memory requires a process of consolidation, in which memory traces (the brain’s representations of the new learning) are strengthened, given meaning, and connected to prior knowledge—a process that unfolds over hours and may take several days. Rapid-fire practice leans on short-term memory. Durable learning, however, requires time for mental rehearsal and the other processes of consolidation. Beware of the familiarity trap: the feeling that you know something and no longer need to practice it. This familiarity can hurt you during self-quizzing if you take shortcuts. Doug Larsen says, “You have to be disciplined to say, ‘All right, I’m going to make myself recall all of this and if I don’t, what did I miss, how did I not know that?’ Whereas if you have an instructor-generated test or quiz, suddenly you have to do it, there’s an expectation, you can’t cheat, you can’t take mental shortcuts around it, you simply have to do that.”The process of learning something often starts out feeling disorganized and unwieldy; the most important aspects are not always salient. Consolidation helps organize and solidify learning, and, notably, so does retrieval after a lapse of some time, because the act of retrieving a memory from long-term storage can both strengthen the memory traces and at the same time make them modifiable again, enabling them, for example, to connect to more recent learning. This process is called reconsolidation. This is how retrieval practice modifies and strengthens learning.When you change from a PC to a Mac, or from one Windows platform to another, you have to do enormous forgetting in order to learn the architecture of the new system and become adept at manipulating it so readily that your attention can focus on doing your work and not on working the machine. Jump school training provides another example: After their military service, many paratroopers take an interest in smoke jumping. Smokejumpers use different airplanes, different equipment, and different jump protocols. Having trained at the army’s jump school is cited as a distinct disadvantage for smoke jumping, because you have to unlearn one set of procedures that you have practiced to the point of reflex and replace them with another. Psychologists have uncovered a curious inverse relationship between the ease of retrieval practice and the power of that practice to entrench learning: the easier knowledge or a skill is for you to retrieve, the less your retrieval practice will benefit your retention of it. Conversely, the more effort you have to expend to retrieve knowledge or skill, the more the practice of retrieval will entrench it.Clearly, impediments that you cannot overcome are not desirable. Outlining a lesson in a sequence different from the one in the textbook is not a desirable difficulty for learners who lack the reading skills or language fluency required to hold a train of thought long enough to reconcile the discrepancy. If your textbook is written in Lithuanian and you don’t know the language, this hardly represents a desirable difficulty. To be desirable, a difficulty must be something learners can overcome through increased effort.We strive to fit the events of our lives into a cohesive story that accounts for our circumstances, the things that befall us, and the choices we make. Each of us has a different narrative that has many threads woven into it from our shared culture and experience of being human, as well as many distinct threads that explain the singular events of one’s personal past. All these experiences influence what comes to mind in a current situation and the narrative through which you make sense of it: Why nobody in my family attended college until me. Why my father never made a fortune in business. Why I’d never want to work in a corporation, or, maybe, Why I would never want to work for myself. We gravitate to the narratives that best explain our emotions. In this way, narrative and memory become one. The memories we organize meaningfully become those that are better remembered. Narrative provides not only meaning but also amental framework for imbuing future experiences and information with meaning, in effect shaping new memories to fit our established constructs of the world and ourselves. No reader, when asked to account for the choices made under pressure by a novel’s protagonist, can keep her own life experience from shading her explanation of what must have been going on in the character’s interior world.Don’t make the mistake of dropping material from your testing regime once you’ve gotten it correct a couple of times. If it’s important, it needs to be practiced, and practiced again. And don’t put stock in momentary gains that result from massed practice. Space your testing, vary your practice, keep the long view.Another environmental factor that shapes IQ is socioeconomic status and the increased stimulation and nurturing that are more generally available in families who have more resources and education. On average, children from affluent families test higher for IQ than children from impoverished families, and children from impoverished families who are adopted into affluent families score higher on IQ tests than those who are not, regardless of whether the birth parents were of high or low socioeconomic status.Deliberate practice usually isn’t enjoyable, and for most learners it requires a coach or trainer who can help identify areas of performance that need to be improved, help focus attention on specific aspects, and provide feedback to keep perception and judgment accurate. The effort and persistence of deliberate practice remodel the brain and physiology to accommodate higher performance, but achieving expertise in any field is particular to the field. It does not confer some kind of advantage or head start toward gaining expertise in another domain."
19,0674729013,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1608811-david,5,"Of the books I've read about learning, this is my favorite. This review comes right on the back of reading and reviewing How We Learn by Benedict Carey which was published in the same year! I got a lot out of that book, but thought it had some flaws. This book covers more variety and still manages to avoid the criticisms I had with Carey's book.I feel like I've already written extensively about many of the main concepts in previous book reviews. This book covered a ton of additional material. Here were some of my personal highlights:Chapter 3, in a section called ""Developing Discrimination Skills"", two studies were mentioned. One was about identifying artists' work and the other was about identifying birds. To summarize: it was found that having a fair amount of memorized knowledge led to a better conceptual understanding of the subject. This is something Barbara Oakley has said in her books and the Learning How to Learn MOOC. But I could never really make the connection. Public school left me with a strong distaste for memorization as a substitute to conceptual learning.But as it happened, this insight couldn't have come at a better time for me. No kidding, at the moment I read that section, I was also in the middle of a week of teaching myself how to solve the Rubik's Cube. I had resisted my natural impulses to learn the solving ""intuitively"" and was forcing myself to memorize a series of algorithms. I couldn't be happier with how that worked out. Once the movements were well memorized, I found that it was vastly easier to follow what my hands were doing and understand how the cube was being transformed.Without having memorized the movements, trying to understand an 8-step algorithm for the conceptual whole of the puzzle cube would have been an extremely difficult feat. Not impossible, but it would have taken more time and effort than I would likely have been willing to give it. A week later, I can easily solve the cube in layers using a beginner's method. But far more valuable, the insight I've gained about the relationship between memorization to aid conceptual understanding can be applied to anything!I was also pleased to see that the section on ""spaced repetition"" included mention of the Leitner Box method. I've been using my own Leitner system with index cards and a simplified calendar (""on the Xth of the month, do Box 2"", etc.) for two months now and I'm loving it. I'm sure I'll move to a computer-based system like the Mnemosyne Project eventually. But for now, the paper cards give me far more flexibility in my topsy-turvy kid-driven schedule.It was also great to see the famous Dunning-Kruger study about our inability to see our own incompetence, Daniel Kahneman's concept of automatic ""fast"" thinking vs. ""slow"" cognition (which he calls ""Systems 1 and 2"" for fuck's sake - I did not enjoy his book, even though it contained some good stuff), and Carol Dweck's performance vs. learning and growth vs. fixed mindsets. It seems that just about all of the foundational stuff for our modern understanding of the learning brain is covered in this book!Here's a really fun anecdote I can't believe I'd never heard of before: Mark Twain made a physical memory palace to help his kids learn the English monarchies. Together, they staked out 817 feet for 817 years, making a physical, walk-able timeline on his farm. Then they made visual mnemonics for each reign along the path. It's told in Twain's usual humor and I absolutely love the idea of making a memory palace in the yard. I hope I can remember that idea for when my kids need to memorize some things for school!I also enjoyed the complete scientific dismantling of the snake oil known as ""learning styles"" (auditory, visual, touch, etc.), a concept I believe has done far more harm than good. Read what they have to say and see what you think.The low point in the book, for me, was the final chapter. It is an attempt to summarize all of the material with a focus on practical tips split into categories for: 1) students, 2) teachers, 3) people, and 4) businesses. While I found the summary largely redundant and perhaps even a little annoying, I was pleasantly surprised that even this final chapter contained new anecdotes, making it worth reading. For example, anyone who sees somebody with amazing cognitive abilities and thinks ""oh, they were just born talented"" seriously needs to read the section about stage actor Nathaniel Fuller. His process is simply incredible. It's thorough, comprehensive, and clearly a lot of work.Which brings me to what contrasts this book from How We Learn by Benedict Carey. His book attempts to seduce the reader into thinking everything is easy. This book does the opposite: it explains why learning is hard and why that's a good thing.I don't want to speak ill of fellow reviewers, but I can't not mention this: apparently people are skipping to the last chapter of this book and just reading the summary. You're doing yourself a huge disservice. The last chapter is no substitute for the body of this book. If you want to save time, read everything but the last chapter! For fuck's sake, people, this is a book about learning, about spaced repetition, about interleaving. That's what the. Fucking. Book. Is. About.Sorry about that. I just...I mean...seriously?My final note: the Notes section in this book is really great. Most entries are quite long and contain lots of additional information. They're also perfectly indexed by page number, making it incredibly easy to find a note!"
20,0674729013,http://goodreads.com/user/show/111566858-greta,5,"The most essential book for all students to read in order to improve their studying!This book is based on cognitive psychology. Study techniques and their effects on our cognition are described in detail while several studies proof the increased performance of students. I particularly like how the author considered the experience of students when applying those concept as well, helping to understand that studying is widely misunderstood and our own intuition most often misleading.This research explains the 3 key study strategies of effective learning:1. RetrievingWe learn best if we don‘t just passively consume information, but retrieve memories from our brain in order to strengthen neurological connections, so that we are able to make connections to prior knowledge and build the foundation for later remeberance. To put it in simple words: We have to quizz ourselves on the material we studied. A single, simple test after reading a text or hearing a lecture facilitates better transfer of knowledge to new contexts and problems. It improves ones ability to retain and retrieve material that is related but not tested. Rereading the text or reviewing lecture notes, which are the most used techniques by students, prove to be highly ineffective. Furthermore simply rereading notes is responsible for bad metacognition, because we didn’t just fail to actually learn the information, but we are also under the wrong impression that we did, which is why students fail to put enough effort and attention to those subjects they didn‘t understand yet.2. Spaced repetionThe retrieval has to be repeated again and again in spaced out sessions so that the recall requires cognitive effort rather than becoming mindless recitation. This concept also known as spaced repetition is needed, to break the forgetting curve and initiate the transformation from short- to longterm memory. Rather than becoming a mindless recitation, the retrieval requires some cognitive effort, which makes it a slow but lasting process. New learning is labile: its meaning is not fully formed and therefore is easily altered. In consolidation, the brain reorganizes and stabilizes the memory traces.3. Interleaving.In order to build conceptual understanding and gain the ability of abstraction we have to practice a variety of problems interleaved. Rather than studying in blocks, only being confronted with one problem and subject at a time, we highly benefit from study sessions that alter between different topics and strategies. People who learn to extract the key ideas from new material and organize them into a mental model and connect that model to prior knowledge show an advantage in learning complex mastery. Mastery requires both the possession of ready knowledge and the conceptual understanding of how to use it. Learning gained through the less challenging, massed form of practice is encoded in a simpler or comparatively impoverished representation than the learning gained from the varied and more challenging practice which demands more brain power and encodes the learning in a more flexible representation that can be applied more broadly.This book offers concrete advice and guidelines for student and teachers in particular on productive learning. "
21,0674729013,http://goodreads.com/user/show/73783-taka,4,"Good!The first part is a gold mine of cognitive psychology wisdom, then it sort of tapers off toward the end (at least for me). The book covers what science has to tell us about learning in general and it is good. And it is owing to this book that I'm resuming my old practice of writing book reviews (retrieval & elaboration) to better retain what I read.Some concepts that will prove particularly useful in my own learning and teaching include: 1) Desirable difficulty: how the right amount of difficulty and thus exertion of effort etches whatever you're trying to learn deeper into your long-term memory (e.g. trying really, really hard to remember a word, say). A massively applicable example is having students try to solve a question before teaching them how to solve it.2) Interleaving/variable practice (contra ""massed practice""): how, even when learning the basics, it is desirable to mix things up and go to another topic/skillset BEFORE you get a hang of it, and then come back. The reason is that it is more difficult: you have to try hard to remember the topic/skill, driving it deep into your long-term memory. Massed practice—i.e. cramming or practicing the same swing over and over again—*does* improve your skill, but the effect is short-lasting.3) Retrieval practice and the stunning effectiveness of frequent quizzing (at the beginning and end of a lesson, for example) to forestall forgetting. Application: frequently quizzing yourself when you're reading something you need to understand/memorize.4) Spacing out practice. This goes back to the principle of desirable difficulty: once you let some forgetting to set in, it becomes harder to retrieve/execute whatever you learned, and thus leads to better learning.Other takeaways include the illusion of knowing (we don't know what we don't know until we quiz ourselves); the importance of trying to infer a rule underlying whatever topic you'r learning; and elaboration (trying to explain something in your own words and connect it to what you already know).Because of this book, I've introduced frequent quizzing into my teaching, begun to interleave practice more often, and started to engage in elaboration (such as by writing this review).I wonder if the notion of variable practice makes reading multiple books at the same time a better learning strategy than reading them serially (a method I usually prefer). I've tried it before, but I *just* didn't like it. But the book reassures us that the students didn't like interleaving practice either, so I suppose I should stick it out for a little while.Overall, a must-read for any serious learner/educator."
22,0674729013,http://goodreads.com/user/show/54230541-hiba,5,"This is an excellent book for everyone- not just teachers and educators. This book challenges our perceptions of how to learn and how it is often counterintuitive to how we think we best learn. I found this book frustrating at times as it jumped between ideas- however, that in itself is one way this book practices what it preaches. I found myself inspired to approach learning and teaching differently. I was often lost in my own ideas of how I can apply what I’ve learned from this book to my own practice. The purpose of learning more meaningfully is emphasised throughout the book and illustrated with applicable examples of how the methods discussed work. Lots of food for thought which was nicely summarised in the last chapter of the book. "
23,0674729013,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7258380-dan-graser,5,"Having recently read James Lang's book, ""Small Teaching,"" I noticed that a lot of its most salient concepts and interesting ideas were being cited back to this wonderful book from Brown, Roediger, and McDaniel. As such I was curious if it seemed as significant and intellectually rigorous as Lang's citations made it seem. I must say that it certainly is and is among the most potent books on learning I have ever read. Perhaps the most singular feature of this work is the seamless way the authors thoroughly proceed from demystifying the learning process, clearing away many of the traditional but false notions of learning, to a genuinely thorough conclusion as to how to apply the methods of learning that are backed by current empirical data to your life as a student, teacher, lifelong learner, and trainer. The final two chapters offer a wealth of suggestions in these areas starting with the penultimate chapter on helpful mnemonic devices and how they work. Another favorite chapter of mine deals with the myriad of pseudo-intellectual, non-empirical talk that circulates in education about different learning styles. Backed up with extensive data, the authors make a very strong case for how to incorporate a variety of approaches to supplement and augment your ability to learn outside of your own preconceived style, generating greater depth of comprehension and greater ability to recall. The self-awareness to understand your learning style is very basic, developing strategies to challenge this effectively is the hallmark of a great independent learner. I could go on about the revolutionary concepts about retrieval, practice, embracing difficulties, and their wonderful focus on K. Anders Ericsson's notion of, ""deliberate practice,"" but I will close by merely saying this is perhaps the most broadly applicable and profoundly useful book on the current understanding of learning and how to use this knowledge effectively in many roles throughout our lives.

The research that has gone into bringing out the principles and truths found in this book is commendable and gives much weight to their arguments. What they propose flies in the face of much of what goes around in public education today (student-centered learning). What they say helps make knowledge stick isn't a special recipe we haven't seen before. It's just unfortunate that we desperately need to hear it since the borage of unsupported messages from others has led many to drift away.One important note that the author's mention, but I don't think it was done well enough. Before a student can start working on getting the parts into long-term memory, they need to understand the parts in relation to the whole. They touched on this important aspect of learning, but I feel it could get lost in the 3 essential ingredients that review in the last chapter. Learning is so much harder when the parts are not understood in relation to the whole."

It's not just for pupils, but companies or marketing people can benefit these ideas the same. This book also provides some useful tips for lifelong learners like me (a programmer) to help to improve in our career.

33,0674729013,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6007859-pete-wung,5,"A friend recommended that I dive into this book since I was hoping to learn about the latest theories on learning and cognition; one reason for my search is to be a better coach with volleyball athletes, but as it turns out, this book is helping me become a better college professor.The authors devoted the opening chapter to the myths and sacred cows that we carry in our minds about how we learn and how to best create an environment that is suited for teaching. They recount the large number of beliefs that many hold dear as the absolutely truth and then give evidence which debunks them one by one.The central tenet for the book is stated clearly very early in the first chapter: learning needs memory and the ability to recall from the memory; people will need to continue to learn and remember throughout our lives in order to function; and finally learning is an acquired skill, not a natural skill, one that need to be practiced.Very early on in this book, the authors laid out their own beliefs. The first is that learning needs to be effortful in order to be effective, that is, we learn better when learning is difficult. They also believe that people tend to be poor judges when it comes to determining how well we learn a subject; we often overestimate our learning prowess. One of their biggest pet myths is that rereading and massed practices - the perennially preferred studying practice of most people - is the worst and least effective practice habit.What do they believe in? They believe that learning comes from our ability to retrieve knowledge from our memory, and that we need to exercise that memory retrieval constantly in order to makes sure that it is always there for our recall. They believe that the exercise of retrieval and recall needs to be done with built in gaps in timing, i.e. they need to be spaced; they believe in making the repetitions be unpredictable and irregularly spaced in time, i.e. interleaved. They believe that before being shown how to resolve a problem, the learner needs to wade into the problem without any clue as to how to solve the problem. They believe that searching for and discovering the underlying reasons for a piece of knowledge is much more important that just being able to perform a skill repetitively, although they do acknowledge the importance of being able to repeat a task procedurally. Although the ideas and methods that is covered in this book is not all completely new to me, the presentation and organization is quite interesting. They can cite a great number of studies in the scientific literature that effectively and sufficiently support their arguments against the stated myths while citing enough studies which also amply support their arguments. The most interesting part of the book came to me after I had read it from cover to cover and was sitting down to review what I had learned. What the authors cleverly did is to use the very desired practices that they are espousing in structuring the book. They spaced the same descriptions of the desired practice repeatedly through the text, they interleaved certain arguments in all the chapters, they gave the reader time and room to discern the underlying principles, and they motivated the reader to elaborate on what they had learned to themselves, at least I did.I am relatively certain that this was deliberate. Indeed, I followed the rut that they had called out in their recitation of bad learning habits and strategies as I was reading, rereading, and taking massive amounts of notes in order forcefully lever the ideas into my head. Little did I know that the authors had, by the nature of how the book is structured, created an opportunity for the reader to practice what they had preached.As I stepped through my memories of the time that I was reading this book, along with a couple of other books on how to best learn, I unintentionally spaced and interleaved my learning from this book because I was switching between books, a practice that I had picked up as a matter of habit as my learning habit throughout my life. The real question is then whether this tactic was successful: did it accomplish the goals in the way that the authors had intended? I can’t speak for the longevity memory retention of the lesson from the book, but I can say that I did spend a lot of time thinking and understanding the underlying principles. I will be able to speak to the longevity of my learning with their preferred methods when someone asks me about the book in a few years, but as of now, I had worked long and hard on learning from this book."

40,0674729013,http://goodreads.com/user/show/12392091-michael,4,"This book is about how we (don't) learn. The authors are academics, and they back up their often counter-intuitive assertions with empirical data. A few of their insights stuck out as particularly important:(1) Test yourself. Our metacognitive skills aren't great: often, when we think we're learning, we're not; and when we think we're struggling, not picking anything up, we're in fact developing durable understanding. This disconnect causes us to favor study strategies that fail to produce results, but which feel good, like re-reading, or going over our notes; in contrast, those strategies with ""desirable difficulties,"" like testing recall using flashcards (which also helps you realize what you don't actually know), teaching someone else the material, summarizing it in your own words, reflecting ex-post about what you did right/wrong, relating the concept to another aspect of your life/discipline, making mnemonics, are often frustrating, yet improve understanding considerably. These are active techniques that make your brain work, which means you're forming neural connections that you wouldn't by just re-reading the text; the latter will develop your fluency with the text, but won't help you when you're confronted with an unfamiliar application of what you're learning (you'll be stymied by higher-level analytical or theoretical questions, too). Another proven active technique (for before) is trying to guess the answer (or, e.g., main argument) before you know it; even if you get it wrong, so long as you learn the right answer, the latter is more likely to be retained in your head than if you hadn't attempted to solve it. The attempt crystallizes what you don't know, essentially carving out a space for the new knowledge. (2) Change things up, and space out your practice. If you're learning a set of new skills, do NOT do rote practice of them one-by-one; instead, ""interleave"" the different sets. This way, you'll be consciously developing each skill, while subconsciously strengthening a higher-level skill, that of appreciating the differences in technique among the different skills, and learning when to use one as opposed to the other. Again, there are excellent experiments to support this way of doing things: one really simple one (there are complicated/complex ones, too) involved having one group of students shoot balls into a basket 3 feet away, and other group do so at a basket that alternated between 2 and 4 feet away. The students were then ""tested"" on shooting the ball at a 3-feet-away basket, and the students in the latter group dominated. Same goes for learning how to calculate the area of different geometric figures, identifying different painters by their artwork, etc. In mixing up the substance, staggering the timing also improves results.(3) You can make yourself smarter. Hat tip to Carol Dweck and her  Mindset: the authors here borrow heavily from it, but rightfully so: her message reinforces (1) and (2). If you're deliberate about your choice of study strategies, and exert sufficient effort, you can learn, a lot. What Dweck's research adds is that if you believe that hard work will improve your outcome (on whatever), it will. She had demonstrated this through a whole bunch of research, but a simple, early experiment involved essentially giving two sets of kids a test, telling one it was an intelligence test, and another it was something like a test of skill, that they could learn how to do better on; the students took the test twice, and the latter group improved their scores, while the former didn't. This experiment has been expanded a whole bunch of times, e.g., students told they can get better (e.g., they're told [accurately] their brains can literally change when they learn, by forming more neural connections) undertake more challenging tasks than other students, because they're not afraid to fail: failure no longer shows they're not smart enough; instead, it's an opportunity to learn and get smarter.Highly recommend this surprisingly brisk (for an academically-inclined book) read for anyone curious about teaching, training, or learning."

42,0674729013,http://goodreads.com/user/show/33202839-dominique,5,"Highly RecommendedAs an undergraduate student, my study skills were a bit weak and it took time to adjust after being out of touch with education for five years. After some time, I had come to the realization that having an undergraduate degree was not enough. When looking back, I had determined that my study skills needed improvement and I started looking around for books that could help me improve on them. So far, I have read: Learning How to Learn: How to Succeed in School Without Spending All Your Time Studying; A Guide for Kids and Teens (Took the Coursera Course on the topic), Teach Yourself How to Learn: Strategies You Can Use to Ace Any Course at Any Level and I have just finished Make It Stick: The Science of Successful Learning. I also have the intention of reading Benedict Carey’s book How We Learn: The Surprising Truth About When, Where, and Why It Happens.I really appreciated the cognitive psychology approach to this book along with the more academic narrative (I’m sure the storyteller and author Peter C. Brown helped tone down the narrative for the average reader) As stated at the beginning of the book, the authors used research that took ten years to compile to help structure the story. Using real case examples to help the reader make sense of the information, the authors use the information from the research on cognitive psychology along with other sources to inform the reader of how to become a better learner.They mention the importance of interleaving study materials, using memory retrieval, mnemonics, calibration, the importance of becoming a “high-structure learner,” among other forms of learning techniques. They also discuss the study techniques that you should not be using such as re-reading material as a form of study, excessive highlighting, cramming and other bad study habits.After reading this book, I feel assured that I have the techniques that are needed to become a successful graduate student.On a side note, I read reviews on the Goodreads website and elsewhere stating that the narrative is repetitive and that the reviewers recommend skipping to chapter 8. I strongly disagree with this approach. In order to learn and master material, repetition is required and is the point of the authors writing the book as they did.----------------------------------Dictionary/Reference Review Word Count: 37Grammatical Error Count: 2"
43,0674729013,http://goodreads.com/user/show/991644-mark-bao,4,"Worth reading for everyone who wants to learn better and understand the key ideas that educational psych has found about learning. When I started reading this book back in July last year, the key concepts behind it (detailed in the first half of the book) had a huge impact on how I approached learning. The key idea behind it is that learning, conceptually and neurologically, should be effortful. When you experience difficulty recalling some piece of knowledge, that difficulty is a signal that memory is being reconstructed and reconsolidated to make that piece of knowledge stronger and more connected. Counter-intuitively, we have to seek effort when learning, which is (by definition) hard to do, but ultimately rewarding, and we have to avoid illusions of knowing, which come from re-reading and such. (Short summary of how to do this the end of the review.)Excellent stuff, all backed by apparently strong research in educational psych. The middle of the book fell mostly flat, talking about a hodgepodge of topics and anecdotes on mental models and growth mindset and learning styles and deliberate learning that didn't go very deep, and was generally just OK. It ends with a summary of prescriptions for students, teachers, and trainers, which is pretty useful as a summary, and has a few stories of interesting folks who have applied these ideas.All in all, a solid book about learning that isn't perfect, but a very good lead-in to other books that might go deeper, and the effortful learning model is very useful. Pretty great resources for teachers, as well, for how to incorporate these ideas in the classroom. I use many of these ideas in my learning strategy at college, and it's been fruitful.—Key things I learned: The core idea for eliciting effort is the testing effect: that testing and quizzing are useful because they elicit retrieval, which strengthens the neural pathways for some bit of knowledge. Combine this with spaced practice, interleaved with other subjects, and attempting to answer questions before you find the answer, and you get a pretty solid foundation for learning. Frequent testing not only leads to individuals remembering things better, but also leads them to have a good sense of what they do know and don't know and a read on their progress, which is just as important. The effects of this are further increased with a spaced repetition strategy, because when you space concepts and interleave them with other concepts, you become better at discriminating what sort of problem-solving techniques you can use for different kinds of problems.We also have to engage in the process of generation, in which we generate answers for questions without getting the actual answers first, since this lays the groundwork for better understanding of that piece of knowledge. Just getting the answer, or re-reading a textbook, gives the illusion of knowing, the knew-it-all-along effect, knowledge that fails to manifest during testing."

I finished filled with new ideas about how I can teach my students more effectively. As a learner, I have new strategies to actually gain useful knowledge instead of having content go 'in one ear and out the other'.Very approachable and comprehensive. Definitely recommend to anyone interested in learning or teaching.For me, here are some of the key concepts in the book.* quizzing* desirable difficulties* generation* interleaving* spaced repetition* growth mindset"
45,0674729013,http://goodreads.com/user/show/28532028-kair-k-sper,4,"This is a solid book about learning and specifically about knowledge retention. Although anyone can benefit from the contents of this book, it seems to be more geared towards people who regularly find themselves in classroom environments, either as teachers or as students. This is the main reason why the book loses a star - I found the constant references to schools and teaching methods more than slightly irritating. I also wasn’t a big fan of the narrator (I listened to the Audible version).The points made and backed up by research in this book, however, were surprisingly unfamiliar to me. Several times a wtf-how-am-I-hearing-about-this-only-now popped over my head ensued by flashbacks to all the nights and days wasted to unproductive studying (as it now turns out). Unfortunately I’m pretty certain that 95% of the teachers I’ve interacted with over my lifetime would have a similar reaction.Some of these new takeaways for me were:- repetition yields poor results, especially when it’s done over a short period of time.- learning to retrieve knowledge is as important as the knowledge itself, a couple of things that help with that are visualization, making connections with previous knowledge, adding emotion (making it personal).- it’s better to switch between topics than to hammer one until seeming proficiency (this is especially difficult for me as I’ve been doing it the latter way pretty much forever).- the harder it is to learn, the more you will retain. For example it’s uncomfortable to explain a new concept in your own words and much easier to use the same language it was taught in. But it'll stick much more when you do.- questions are one of the best ways to keep things you need to remember fresh in your head. The book makes a good case for regularly using flashcards, not only in school, but throughout one’s life.One thing that this book didn’t change through - I still think mnemonics sucks."
46,0674729013,http://goodreads.com/user/show/241232-john-mundy,5,"*apologies for perfunctory review, mostly this is for my later review.This was an excellent book. Loads of anecdotes, yet it was connected to research. It explained to me why I did much better in general remembering things I studied in high school textbooks better than my college readings.The key points to me were the importance of self quizzing versus re-reading. Interleaving different kinds of tasks for example practicing throwing bean bags at something closer and further than the contest distance will actually improve your skills for the contest than throwing at the contest distance. Similarly in mental problems practicing on a wide set of problems and revisiting improves your skills much more than just drilling yourself on the same type of problem over and over again.Spaced recall is vitally important such as happens with flash cards or software programs like Mnemosyne or Anki. It works much better than cramming and that was my own experience as well.They also recommend against spending time re-reading to learn materials, it is much better to spend that time creating questions for yourself about the material and the Feynman Method attempting to rewrite in your own words the concepts and information.Much of this could be applied to the classroom. Short low stake quizzes at the end of class over what was covered in that session and in previous sessions improved recall and understanding dramatically by the end of the year compared to classes that didn't do that.There was also a chapter on memory palaces and memory contests that was interesting, but seemed less useful to me. But perhaps that is because I have never attempted to create one.I can't say enough good things about this book, I wish I had used its methods while I was reading it so I could recall the details better."
47,0674729013,http://goodreads.com/user/show/731907-andrea-patrick,5,"This is one of the most useful books I've ever read. I've been studying wrong, and you probably have, too. Remember all the stuff they used to teach you, like take notes while reading by writing down chapter headings and highlighting vocabulary? Sure, do it once, but if you really want to learn you need to make use of techniques that are backed by research. Learn them with this book. Like me, you're probably falling into the familiarity trap, where the more you re-read something, the more you feel like you know it, and then bang, you get a C on your first test in grad school. A C. Me! A C! I don't get Cs! Even my blood type is A+!Anyway, this book taught me to read differently, asking questions about the text as I go, and to interleave my learning with a different subject, to learn it better. It helped me see that practice tests can be really helpful, especially for the answers you get wrong, which shows you what you need to go back and study, of course, but also because the harder you have to work to retrieve something from your memory, the more it will stick. Best part? It taught me that when learning is hard, and a struggle, it's probably most effective. It's okay to have a hard time learning something, and it's okay to get answers wrong. I can't recommend this book enough, for people who are trying to learn something new, students and grad students, teachers, and anyone interested in the science of learning."
48,0674729013,http://goodreads.com/user/show/27986103-mike,5,"I initially started reading this book because my son - who had a copy - thought it might be of interest in relation to a book on memorization that I was thinking of writing. Make it Stickis about a lot more than memorization: it's a way of rethinking how we learn, and of course, learning involves remembering things, often until they become part of us. The authors tell us at the beginning that they'll keep coming back to certain concepts so that even as readers we'll grasp them and know what they are by the time the book is finished. Of course they do far more than this, but they do it by continually circling around those same points, until we've learned by the time the book is finished...almost without having noticed. I recommend this book to anyone who's a student - it will transform the way you learn. (And that's not hype; it's been proven in a large number of cases and different situations). I recommend it to teachers: it will turn around the results you get in your classroom. And it's of value in all walks of life, because we're all continually learning things and trying to keep them in our heads. This book gives you the means to overcome the failures we so often feel when trying to do something new. In fact failure is usually only part of the learning process: it's not an inability to achieve. This is a great book. "
49,0674729013,http://goodreads.com/user/show/55678885-jeff,5,"An important book about learning including practical, and sometimes counter-intuitive advice. I've tested out some of the techniques and they really do work. In summary, while repetition is the most commonly used technique to learn, it is one of the least effective. Retrieval is the key to learning. Writing this review a few days after listening to the audiobook is a form of retrieval that will make it much more likely that I've internalized the concepts of this book. Techniques:-Retrieval: practice retrieving what you learned, quiz yourself-Spacing: space out between retrieval sessions and vary the space, for example next day, 2 days later, 4 days later, a week later-Interleaving: learn different concepts / work on different problems and alternate. It's more difficult, you will better learn as a result-Elaboration: find other meanings, extrapolate on what you're learning-Generation: try to answer the question/solve problem before looking at the answer (resist the urge to look at the answer at the back of the book for guidance, this prevents learning)-Reflection: combine retrieval and elaboration by asking yourself questions-Calibration-Mnemonic devices: build memory palaces (read unlimited memory for techniques)"
50,0674729013,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7365047-cindy,5,"Make It Stick has become an ah-ha book for how I teach my students. From a casual reading of it late last spring, I realized that this informed study method combined with understanding of brain architecture and workings could revolutionize how my middle school aged, dyslexic students study. My administrator was willing to go out on a limb with me, and Make It Stick has turned into the basis of an elective for middle schoolers at my school called ""Academic Coaching."" Each week I teach a new layer of knowledge about how memory and brains work, along with a new study technique. We use the students' classwork from other subjects as the practice fodder for our new study methods, making the class a two-for-one. The students not only have improved their grades, but the Make It Stick methods have changed their attitude toward studying and relieved stress because they now have specific tools and strategies for each situation. This book is pure academic gold, and I cannot recommend it highly enough. I continue to reread and mark my copy of the book so my students and I don't miss a single nugget of wisdom from its pages."
51,0674729013,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7195192-enzo-altamiranda,5,"I don't know if I'm the only one, but every one in a while I come by a book that I believe to be so fundamental in its teachings, that one of my thoughts is that kids in school should be exposed to its contents. What is this essential knowledge that I'm talking about? Nothing more and nothing less than learning how properly use the most important tool we have at our disposal, our brains. Make it stick does just what its title suggests. It exposes the reader with a wide range of learning techniques and heuristics that are optimal according to the latest research. Also, it talks about techniques commonly regarded as effective, which in fact don't perform so well. For example, they nominate re-reading texts as having three strikes, it's boring, it's time-consuming and it's not as optimal as plain recalling from memory. I truly believe any student will greatly benefit from going through the book."
52,0674729013,http://goodreads.com/user/show/27632089-chau-nguyen,5,"The book was written by applying the rules of learning the authors set out from the start (retrieval practice, spaced repetition, mixed & interleave practice, etc.) so it was really easy to understand and follow through. I was exposed to the different methods of learning listed in the book before picking it up, but it was nice nonetheless to learn a bit more about the empirical research that went behind these most effective learning methods. That being said, there are sections I found quite repetitive and as a result, boring, which I understand serve the purpose of retrieval and spaced repetition and could be helpful for those who read this book over a course of several days instead of reading it all in one sitting. Aside from that, this was a nice read. There’s some advice regarding practical application of the concepts presented in chapter 8 for students, life-long learners, teachers and people at work generally, which could be useful to some."
53,0674729013,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3239706-gordon,5,"This is a great book for people of all ages. The bottom line is that by following tried and tested techniques anyone can improve their learning and retention of knowledge. Discipline, effort, persistence and attitude matter — and with a growth mindset anyone can improve both one's memory and intelligence. The trio of Brown, Roedinger and McDaniel lay out simple principles with great examples and anecdotes of how these principles have been employed by real people to change the way they focus on study, learning, recall and application of knowledge. Key concepts include effortful learning, retrieval, spaced & varied practice, consolidation, generation, and reflection. These and other memory tools (e.g. mnemonics, memory palaces) are thoroughly explained that we can all use in our every day lives "
54,0674729013,http://goodreads.com/user/show/65978670-tiago-faleiro,5,"Quite a good book. It explains the common methods of studying and their errors, providing evidence-based guidelines on how to best optimize your time to make sure to understand and remember the material.From the importance of retrieval practice, variation and difficulty, the author goes into each subject in surprising detail. Also touches on a few myths like the illusion of knowledge from re-reading and learning styles.I personally found the anecdotes a little bit tedious and over-used, but useful nevertheless to make his point. An incredibly valuable resource for anyone learning and studying. It's mind-boggling how much misinformation there is and most students will spend hundreds and thousands of hours studying ineffectively. The principles underlined here should be taught in every school."
55,0674729013,http://goodreads.com/user/show/23916723-daniel-aguilar,5,"Very nice book for anyone interested in improving learning. Provides a simple set of principles (based on scientific studies and trials) on how to make learning more efficient and productive. In essence, the basic argument is that learning depends of reshaping brain connectome, therefore it implies effort, therefore simple rereading and cramming is useless. He proposes a more active approach to learning, such as:- Frequent testing and self assessing- Spacing study sessions- Interleaving with other subjects- Reflection on implications- Generation and elaboration of ideas- Becoming conscious (and avoiding or minimizing) cognitive biasIt also provides many examples and interviews with successful students and researchers."
56,0674729013,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1330080-beckbunch,5,"This definitely reinforced what I already knew about my own study methods......re-reading alone doesn't really help me. I need to test myself. I was intrigued by the classes in the book who went from a mid-term and final exam format to one with numerous ""low stakes"" quizzes. The students did far better remembering and grasping concepts across the board. The frequent testing helped them cement those things in their minds. Familiarity through re-reading alone wouldn't accomplish that. I also will take from this book that we need to ""begin to forget"". We need make things hard for ourselves and when it's harder for us to remember something, and we do remember it, those facts don't as easily leave us."
57,0674729013,http://goodreads.com/user/show/26940100-amol,5,"This book ought to be required reading for every student, especially at the undergraduate and graduate levels. The authors distill principles from education and psychology research into practical lessons on how we ought to learn/study, and why. Even if you consider yourself a good student and a quick learner, you're sure to find a few pearls here on what you could be doing better (e.g., not cramming for tests, not re-reading the textbook over and over). It's a very easy read, but if you want the ""Sparknotes"" version, borrow it from the library and skip ahead to Chapter 8. My only critique is that it gets a lite repetitive after Ch. 4 .. but 1-4 are compelling enough to change the way you learn."
58,0674729013,http://goodreads.com/user/show/21979165-agne,5,"My favourite book on learning so far. Full references and extra reading at the end. I actually finished this (audio) some time ago, but I am still taking notes. I liked the scientific and well-structured approach. The myth-busting is effective and the studies cited are solid enough. And really, the main value is that the changes suggested are easily applicable to any style of teaching, even if it happens to be quite conservative in nature. For others, it is a good reminder of how to take full advantage of how our brains seem to work. “One of the most striking research findings is the power of active retrieval—testing—to strengthen memory, and that the more effortful the retrieval, the stronger the benefit.”"
59,0674729013,http://goodreads.com/user/show/19139193-samuel-boyle,5,"This book is the product of ten cognitive psychology professors working for a long time with a large grant to apply cognitive science to learning and memory. Although people have greatly different ""learning styles"" (e.g. dyslexic people become proficient at using peripheral vision), research shows that there are a few principles which should not be changed. These techniques work for everyone.An evidenced based approach to learning is necessary because intuition can be misleading. Rereading a text, for example, creates the illusion of mastery. The reader becomes fluent in the text but not in the subject and the memories created will fade in a few days.  "
