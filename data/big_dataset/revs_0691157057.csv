I found this book very interesting but also very repetitive. After the fourth or fifth description of a possible cloning method, only to have it explained yet again why it wouldn't work for a mammoth, I was ready to commission Bill Bryson to write a cloning book for me.There were a lot of interesting concepts, like back-breeding, that I'd never heard of. Apparently scientists in Europe have been back-breeding cows to produce something very much like an aurochs for decades. Could the same process be used to create something mammoth-ish from Asian elephants?The book painstakingly chronicles the trials and tribulations of retrieving intact-ish DNA from frozen mammoth carcasses. Apparently dogs will gnaw bits off of a mammoth carcass once you get it out of the ground.While de-extincting mammoths was the title feature, other species were covered, like the passenger pigeon, the dodo, and the woolly rhinoceros. I found it really interesting that mammoths survived well into human history and scientists still aren't sure why they went extinct in the first place. There was also some speculation that re-introducing mammoths or mammoth-infused Asian elephants to Siberia could turn the tundra into a grassland in just a few seasons. Interesting things to ponder.The bottom line is the book covered some interesting topics but could have been more interestingly written. Three out of five stars."
1,0691157057,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9246169-wanda,4,"How to clone a mammoth? Well, you can’t yet. So this is not an instruction manual. Cloning requires a living somatic (body) cell from a creature and a living egg from the same or a very closely related species. Mammoths are not currently living creatures, therefore, there will be no cloning of mammoths. Cue relief for all the terrified folks out there.This was a very interesting read, it covered a lot of ground—not just scientific issues, but the moral & ethical issues surrounding the subject too. I found it to be quite balanced—not overly enthusiastic about cloning but not scared to death of the prospect either.The most interesting things I learned?1. Birds cannot be cloned. But there are other ways that they can be genetically modified, as the chicken farming industry has discovered.2. The closest living relative to the mammoth is the Indian elephant3. There is a Pleistocene Park in Siberia and the animals in it are certainly changing the vegetation (in a good way, if you think the tundra should be greener & more lush)4. The only DNA you get out of animals trapped in amber is fungal DNA (sorry Jurassic Park).5. Working with ancient DNA is very difficult because it is so easily contaminated and there is modern DNA just hanging in the air, waiting to contaminate everything!6. The most likely scenario is to splice mammoth genes into the elephant genome and produce a mammoth-like animal which could play the same ecological role as the ancient animal did.The author points out quite clearly that bringing back exactly one mammoth would be a bad idea. They, like other elephant species, were very social animals and having a lone individual would be needlessly cruel. Also, any mammoth would have to be raised by elephants and would necessarily be influenced by that upbringing. Its behaviour is unlikely to be genuine mammoth behaviour. Both extant elephant species are endangered, so using females of these species to gestate mammoth babies is probably not a good idea—they need to be producing more baby elephants, not indulging our desires to resurrect an extinct animal (and with a gestation period of almost 2 years, they are already very slow-reproducing animals).A very interesting read, especially as I went to the movie Jurassic World on the weekend (the SeaWorld like scene with the Mosasaur is awesome and I finally see why my online women friends are enthusiastic about Chris Pratt). Plus, I heard on the radio this morning that cattle geneticists are considering splicing genes to make white Black Angus cattle, which would theoretically be less heat-stressed in this climate-changed world we inhabit. Because I had just finished this book, I actually knew a little something about the process that was being described! "
2,0691157057,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2958674-nikki,2,"The topic contained within How to Clone a Mammoth greatly interests me and this is one of numerous books I've read on ancient DNA. Overall I felt as though Shapiro's writing style was not terribly enjoyable or clearly put forth at times. The book could have been much shorter, especially if all of the repetitive material was removed. Why Shapiro insisted on repeating some things nearly or exactly verbatim numerous times is beyond me because they were never the potentially difficult to understand aspects of ancient DNA. I also felt as though Shapiro attempted to be entertaining with some of her stories but they always fell flat. In addition, Shapiro broke up stories or explanations to interject with other material that could have easily been moved elsewhere to have a smoother transition between stories/topics. Unfortunately I really think Shapiro could have benefited by an editor or a better one because the topic is interesting and she is knowledgeable. P.S. Elephant DNA sequencing really needs to become a priority considering how decimated by poaching the populations are becoming. I did appreciate Shapiro noting that taking elephant eggs and/or impregnating an elephant in order to birth a pseudo Mammoth was a bad idea considering troubles they are already facing.  Disclosure: ARC received from Netgalley & publisher in exchange for an honest review. (They may regret this.) Any and all quotes were taken from an advanced edition subject to change in the final edition. "
3,0691157057,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1702050-fox,4,"Last year I received  Resurrection Science as an ARC from Netgalley and eagerly devoured it. This book was released around the same time, but I was unable to get my hands on it until the local library carried it. I'm quite happy that I was patient enough to get it, as the book was an incredibly rewarding read. Resurrection Science focused primarily upon the ethical side of de-extinction. It went into the various types of extinction, their causes, and whether or not bringing them back in an abbreviated fashion - forever in captivity, unable to be reintroduced - is that fair?  How to Clone a Mammoth touched upon these aspects briefly, but failed to really address those aspects of de-extinction in a satisfactory way. Ultimately, however, that is all right. It addressed other aspects of de-extinction quite beautifully. How to Clone a Mammoth concerns itself with the scientific and practical aspects of the process. The author,  Beth Shapiro, is intimately involved with Revive & Restore - one of the small number of groups championing de-extinction as a way to revive lost ecosystems and aid in encouraging biodiversity where it has been lost. She goes into detail about the importance of de-extinction on that front, and in turn, how the public often views it differently.The book is a good work of lay-science, perhaps a bit more sophisticated than  Bill Bryson's work in  A Short History of Nearly Everything but nothing that should put a more casual reader off. She covers the more complex science well, but focuses mainly upon dispelling myths and practical solutions to the problems that may arise.Personally, being deeply interested in de-extinction and believing in it as a possible solution to some environmental problems, I loved the work. While I do see its capacity for causing potential issues, I ultimately think it will be good - particularly when it comes to places like Pleistocene Park. I hope to see many more books tackling these issues in the near future, and look forward to eventual headlines trumpeting the return of the mammoth. Even if it's simply, in truth, only an elephant with some mammoth genes. :)"
4,0691157057,http://goodreads.com/user/show/223837-nicky,4,"For a title which sounds like a how-to book, this book spends an awful amount of time pointing out the ways in which cloning a mammoth is not possible. A lot of science is stuff I was well aware of, but it’s presented engagingly and clearly, so it was still an enjoyable read. It’s not purely about mammoths, although they are one of the main species considered: after all, they’re thought to have played a significant part in the sustainability of the tundra they inhabited. A lot of the book concerns cases like that: cases where reintroducing an animal to an ecosystem might bring it back into balance.Despite science fiction’s hopes, cloning an extinct animal is still pretty far off — but it does depend on the methods you use. Shapiro uses a fairly broad definition of cloning, discussing back breeding as well: the process by which a current species is selectively bred to restore features of an ancestral or related species.There’s a lot of interesting stuff here, including an explanation of why you can’t clone birds in the same way as Dolly the sheep was cloned. Fascinating stuff, and well presented. And if it’s a bit of a killjoy to know that mammoths aren’t so easily cloned, I think the interest of the science and discussed ethical issues still makes it worth it.Originally posted here."
5,0691157057,http://goodreads.com/user/show/28230750-adam,4,"De-extinction is an idea that will become ""a reframing of possibilities as momentous as landing humans on the moon was.""This, I believe, is why people like me are so captivated by the idea of de-extinction. Not because it is a means to turn back the clock and somehow right our ancestors' wrongs, but because de-extinction uses awesome, exciting, cutting-edge technology to take a giant step forward. De-extinction is a process that allows us to actively create a future that is really better than today, not just one that is less bad than we anticipate.I've been enamoured with pleistocene rewilding for some time now. It's such a beautiful dream. You don't even have to resurrect extinct species to start, just restore similar megafauna to the empty spots in an ecological niche. Shapiro's description of a new New Mexico is sublime: donkeys, wild horses, asian elephants and tortoises reintroduced to help restore the landscape, with packs of lions and cheetahs keeping their numbers in check. This, after all, is what North America looked like before humans showed up, and I think we have a duty to restore such a vision. You wouldn't even have to hurt the endangered populations of Africa and Asia to make it happen: the author points out you'll find enough animals just by closing North American zoos.And that's before you even start cloning extinct species. The author gives a thorough overview of the challenges being faced by those trying to bring back mammoths and passenger pigeons: finding frozen mammoths, mapping and editing the genome, creating a clone (or adapting to the impossibility of such in birds), helping it adapt to its new environment and socializing it, dealing with antiquated and scaremongering GMO laws. There's also plenty of justification for doing so: a large enough herd in Siberia's Pleistocene Park might help regulate the permafrost, keeping all that methane in the ground (though we really would need to get cracking). I admit some of the hard science went over my head. I'm still not entirely sure how the CRISPR/CAS9 genome editing tool works. And epigenetics, for that matter, still confuses me. But what an idea! The advances made in ancient DNA labs and genome engineering in general are also well documented: glow-in-the-dark chickens and ducks siring chickens and so on.De-extinction will, of course, be risky. We don't know and cannot predict every outcome of resurrecting the past. The conservation success stories of the present day prove, however, that taking risks can be deeply rewarding. Removing every living California condor from the wild was an extraordinarily risky strategy to preserve the species, but one that undoubtedly saved them from extinction. Restoring gray wolf populations to Yellowstone National Park was both risky and, to a degree, unpopular, but the park is now flourishing in a way that it had not been since its establishment in 1872, when wolves and other predators were actively exterminated. Allowing deer, cattle, and other wild animals to take over abandoned land in Europe was touted as both crazy and dangerous, but these reestablished wilderness areas stimulated a widespread shift in attitudes toward wildlife. They inspired new policies aimed at protecting natural spaces and the species that occupy these spaces. How will the world react when the first genetically engineered elephants are strolling casually through Pleistocene Park?I can't wait to find out."
6,0691157057,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7761064-sue-burke,5,"Summary: It might be impossible to clone a mammoth, or, for that matter, to clone any other extinct animal. And it might not be necessary.The author leads the reader through the problems and reasons why it might not be a good idea even to try in some cases. For example, some animals have gone extinct due to changes in their habitats, and unless these habitats have been restored, the resurrected animals would have no place to go. In addition, DNA is fragile and hard to come by for long-extinct species like mammoth.Shapiro also considers the ways to solve some of these problems along with the benefits from de-extinction. If mammoths were reintroduced, they might transform the tundra into rich grasslands. Mammoths would also trample away the snow in winter. Snow acts as insulation from the cold air, so the permafrost would be frozen harder and thus be protected from melting by a warming climate — and permafrost has a storehouse of greenhouse gasses locked up in it. Melting permafrost would be a disaster.But rather than de-extinct species, existing species could be engineered to be so much like them that they can serve the same ecological purpose and even look a lot alike. We can change elephants in a way to bring back something just like a mammoth.Shapiro doesn’t oppose de-extinction, but she knows it’s going to be hard to do and wants readers to understand what’s involved and what the alternatives are. She fulfills her goal to teach and to share her cautious enthusiasm.P.S. I read this book as research for a novel. No spoilers, though."
7,0691157057,http://goodreads.com/user/show/17810287-rachel-kalanadi,3,"I get the sense that de-extinction is so new, it doesn't yet provide enough material for a full length book... but too much for an essay. Awkward. This is most likely due to the unengaging writing style, rather than a lack of actual things to talk about, since other books exist on this topic (or at least this is my guess).This book raises some great questions about the ethics and challenges of de-extinction that I hadn't thought about yet, but became clearly repetitive by the end."
8,0691157057,http://goodreads.com/user/show/74415844-nemo-nemo,4,"FINAL REVIEW How to Clone a Mammoth, by Beth ShapiroWho is Beth Shapiro?Beth Shapiro is literally a genius: at least that is what the administrators of the MacArthur Fellowship, known by some as The Genius Fund believe. Most of us would be pleased with that alone but Beth is resplendent with titles, honors and she is even holds a DPhil from Oxford, the University not the library. She is a Rhodes Scholar and she has worked for some of the premier companies and organisations in the world that include the Wellcome Trust from where she became the Director of the Henry Wellcome Biomolecules Centre. Her speciality is in Molecular Biology and EvolutionBeth is no Dodo but she has analyses its mitrocondrial DNA. She is the author of a plethora of scientific publications. Her Doctoral Thesis citation is: Shapiro, Beth, and A. J. Cooper. Inferring Evolutionary History and Processes Using Ancient DNA (2003). I did try to obtain a copy however it is in a closed stack at Oxford’s store house and is currently unavailable except by request. The Author’s presentation at TEDxI have included here a link to the recent TEDx Conference - DeExtinction for anyone who feels the book might be for them but who still want more information. If you visit the site you will hear directly from Beth Shapiro what she is currently working on when she isn’t writing epic books.You can find the above mentioned site here: https://reviverestore.org/events/tedx... This is the greatest gift that you will ever give to your intellect: no small praise. This book is a distillation of decades of education, rolled up in occasional irreverent humor, and suffused with hard science. No, not the kind you had in grade school where the Biology Master lorded over you because you were more ignorant than he or she. No, Beth Shapiro doesn’t assume any pre knowledge of the subject however she infuses you with facts and her enthusiasm for her subject. I am going to be honest even if you hated science as a child you will still enjoy this book. You will learn the fundamental’s of the science of De-Extinction. The gamut in this text is huge, spanning a myriad of scientific disciplines, over decades of scientific study in the field of re-animation of the extinct – the Lazarus of our time. While this subject is a weighty one, the delivery is not. I would compare it to a fine wine or exquisite champagne. It is full of flavor, heavy on the heady stuff and lingers on long after the taste has disappeared. I struggle to find a comparison here in terms of author’s styles. There have been some who compare Beth Shapiro to a Mary Roach. Whilst I chow down on Mary Roach with her sometimes satirical style of writing. I savor slowly the heady mix of leading new Science, the multitudnal cross over disciplines that are woven together to create a masterpiece of its kind by Beth Cooke. Ever heard of epigenetics? you will here, and you will come away with an appreciation of the enormity of this vast, complicated, ethically challenging subject of re-birthing the dead. Like Bob the builder ‘we can do this’ but Beth asks the question at least twice. Should we? Is it ethical to bring back long dead animals in a world struggling we are informed with scarcity of resources’? What about the risks as well as the rewards? These are not questions that are avoided Beth attempts to hit them head on and in a TEDx conference she expresses her reluctance in some aspects of the potential future issues relating to the cloning of extinct species. The book does not dwell on the negative however its focus is on the how rather than the why. Perhaps we should talk about who the book isn’t for. If you suffer from Post Traumatic Study Dysmorphia (PTSd) then this may not rock your world, or perhaps just maybe it could change you into a science geek. I know that most of you have no current knowledge of Mammon Telophase, but you will if you give this book some attention. I know you could care less if an elephant has a self repairing hymen – yes that is really true! What I hope you take from this review about How to Clone a Mammoth is that ultimately this technology will impact your life. Once Artificial Intelligence (AI), Quantum Computing, and this technology merge our world will never be the same ever again, and this book is your opportunity to beginning just how much this new science will impact you and yours for all their future generations. This is a honey the kids have found the matches situation, only it is honey the kids have found the key to Pandora’s Box and they are about to open it. I cannot express enough to you the importance of this work. If you do not read another book this year decade read this one, and then read all the associated information you can. This isn’t a sudo scientific idea it is absolutely real and time is short. As the apex predator we have impacted the environment and believe that we have contained it, brought it too heel so to speak, but the potential for a ‘monster’ we cannot put back in the box that out performs us or out lives us is a genuine possibility, as unlikely as that may seem to you right now.In Conclusion>In short this book is your opportunity to learn about the recent science of DeExtinctions. The book is written by an expert in the field who guides you through the science in a way that almost anyone can absorb, enjoy and comprehend.Book Related informationThe Lazarus Project https://www.smh.com.au/technology/the..."
9,0691157057,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3488439-daphne,3,"Decent pop-sci book about cloning, but it did get repetitive. I enjoyed reading from a scientist directly involved in the field, but one part really stuck out for me. She mentioned the idea of cloning carrier pigeons would be unpopular because no one wants a billion of them flying around North Eastern America, but she never acknowledges that there is no requisite that there would have to 1 billion for a stable population. It just seemed odd she got hung up for several pages about the massive number of potential cloned carrier pigeons when she several times acknowledged that breeding populations for others would/could be much smaller."
10,0691157057,http://goodreads.com/user/show/18343671-holly-bik,5,"Shapiro knows how to tell story, and I found her mix of anecdotes and science to be very compelling. Even though I'm a researcher who uses genomics, I learnt a lot about the science behind ancient DNA and attempts to engineer species to be ""unextinct"". "
11,0691157057,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11450266-brian,1,"Not enough science and too much preaching and pessimism.I didn't find this book enjoyable to read, the tone of the book made it a total downer.A better title would have been ""We shouldn't and can't clone a Mammoth so stop asking"", but I guess no one would have bought the book."
12,0691157057,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4568480-giuseppe-d,4,"So the book is mostly based on hypotheticals but it's still very interesting because it talks about the subject from a technical point of view in addition to the reasons why we could do it.I also had some myths, that I assumed would be true, completely deconstructed. Here's a few examples.- It turns out that amber is not that great at preserving DNA: there were some supposed results in the 90's about extracting insect DNA from it but it was actually all contamination - there goes Jurassic Park..- Even if you can avoid contamination (it's a big 'if' since DNA is everywhere in the soil), the DNA you recover is never in as good a state as DNA from living cell: what you get is fragments of DNA and you need a close relative to use its genome as a guide in order to reconstruct a plausible ancient genome- You also need a close relative because you'll need to transfer this nucleus into a close enough egg in order to produce an embryo. Also, you need someone to rear the ""de-exctinct"" cub once it's born.- Cloning via somatic nuclear transfer (the method that was used to clone Dolly) is super ineffective and you need thousands of eggs because most attempts usually fail (actually, turns out some scientists have transplanted ovarian tissue from elephants into mice and those are producing elephant eggs).- Also, cloning via somatic nuclear transfer could bring to a mismatch between the nuclear genome and the mitochondrial one.We're probably never going to resurrect a mammoth as it was before becoming extinct but rather something similar. And the method that is going to help is probably by using new gene editing technologies like CRISPR in order to insert fragments of mammoth DNA into the nucleus of elephant cells.But, if anything, this book is very illuminating as to what genetic techniques are available to us today and I really appreciated the candour of the author when talking about their limitations!It's really sad that the author was subject to a lot of hate speech after giving a Ted talk. It demonstrates that, first of all, people don't even listen: she demonstrates over and over that she is very conscious about not hurting living animals and not damaging the ecosystem. Also, the ""playing god"" argument is a bit stale when we think that we, as humans, have been domesticating and breeding both plants and animal species for a very long time, long before we even figured out how heredity worked at all."
13,0691157057,http://goodreads.com/user/show/20239685-bethk,5,"How to Clone a Mammoth: The Science of De-Extinction by Beth Shapiro. Copyright 2015 Princeton University Press. New Jersey. ISBN 978-0-691-15705-4Recommended: 5 Star.I read this book as a pre-release e-book obtained through NetGalley, provided by the publisher.The book's title certainly gets attention because producing living, giant mammals such as mammoths would get a lot of attention. However, quickly the reader is led to having more realistic expectations of what is being done, or can currently or in the foreseeable future be possible to do to re-create extinct species. I personally found the book to be a fascinating read.Of course, tiny improvements in the various sciences or discoveries which make de-extinction more plausible make big headlines. However, closer examination shows that many of these things are not possible with current technology nor with existing scientific knowledge. Possibly they could be. But, headlines of ""Scientists will soon clone a mammoth"" attract much more attention than, ""Scientists breed rats which could live where extinct kangaroo rats did.""Technological and scientific challenges of sequencing ancient DNA were discussed, and, contrary to popular opinion, we have only barely scratched the surface of DNA sequencing of living organisms, including our own and other organisms which are important or detrimental to us. We have a lot more to learn in this regard! Specifically though, the prospect of getting any DNA from long-extinct creatures, such as dinosaurs out of fossils, is not possible. Jurassic Park will forever remain in the realm of science fiction.Certainly, cloning, or genetically-engineering cells to grow into creatures which are identical to other creatures which are extinct is appealing. However, it may not be possible, and even if it is possible, it might not be the most efficient or economical way to get a creature to take up the biological niche that an extinct species did. Genetic engineering is a controversial topic, and plants or animals which were de-extincted in this fashion might be regulated as GMOs. There was a long discussion of this in the book about what these would be, legally: Endangered species, or would they be GMOs - or would they if they were not intended as food? It might be more efficient to use more tried-and-true technologies such as selective breeding or back-breeding to produce varieties of existing animals or plants which would have similar traits, and take the same ecological niche as the extinct species did. For instance, the ecological effects of having a large, elephant-like mammal roaming the northern tundras and sub-Arctic were explored, but if we selectively bred Asian elephants which are most-closely related to mammoths or even African elephants so they could live and stay warm enough in cold climates, might this not have the same effect? Would it matter if they were not actually the same species as the mammoths that dominated these cold regions thousands or tens of thousands of years ago? The author believes not. It also would not have the same sensationalistic popular appeal, and would not attract donors. Indeed, this could be an expensive project.Cloning technology may offer one more tool in the ecologist's toolbox to ensure that recently-extinct species are not gone forever once the last one dies. It may be possible to produce a small number of them. Recreating populations in this manner also has challenges, not the least of which would be that they would need to be bred in captivity for at least some time, then protected once they got out.Much of the book involves ecology. If a species goes extinct, might it cause other species to also go extinct, or might it cause the proliferation of some other species, to the point where they become a pest and cause problems of their own? It also explores how this could cause animal suffering, such as using a smaller animal to gestate a larger one, or harvesting eggs from a female for use in cloning. This will become less of a problem once artificial wombs that can gestate these clones is invented, but it's not here now.What are all of the ecological ramifications of de-extincting various lifeforms? Is it wise? Why did it go extinct to begin with, and why won't that immediately repeat? Certainly, some things, such as smallpox, are best left extinct. Re-extincting other, beneficial creatures may have ecological effects too, and it might take their former environment some time to re-adapt to their presence, just as it did to their absence."
14,0691157057,http://goodreads.com/user/show/19446286-elentarri,4,"How to Clone a Mammoth: The Science of De-Extinction is a book that explains the science behind the de-extinction process and the methodology behind cloning extinct organisms. This is the only book that I have managed to find so far that covers the science of the process and doesn't just discuss all the ethical aspects of this technology. The authorbriefly mentions the ethics, economics, uses and socio-political aspects of de-extinction technology, but this is covered in more detail in the excellent book Resurrection Science: Conservation, De-extinction and the Precarious Future of Wild Things. Resurrection Science and How to Clone a Mammoth compliment each other nicely, and cover the subject in detail up to this point in time.In this book, Shapiro discusses the purpose of de-extinction and the controversy surrounding this new technology. She also discusses the factors involved in selecting a suitable species for de-extinction; how to find a well preserved specimen so that useful ancient DNA can be obtained, why amber is not a good source of ancient DNA; genome recreation and modification; how to create a clone and the challenges that are encountered with this process; making more of the cloned species; setting the de-extinct population free; and finally, if we should do such a thing. The book explains the science very well - providing enough details so the reader knows what is going on, but not providing so many minutiae that the reader becomes lost. The author, however, tends to repeat information but the repetitiveness wasn't too annoying. Shapiro is involved with mammoth and dodo de-extinction research, so this book tends to focus on these creatures. However, exciting research and anecdotes from other scientists is also included.I believe the author has nicely explained her aim in writing this book, namely to provide a road map for de-extinction, beginning with how to decide what species/trait to resurrect, traveling through the circuitous and often confusing path from DNA sequence to living organism, and ending with a discussion about how to manage populations of engineered individuals once they are released into the wild. Shapiro's goal was to explain de-extinction in a way that separates the science form the science-fiction. The author also states that she believes in many cases, de-extinction is scientifically and ethically unjustified. But, she also believes that de-extinction technology has great potential to become an important tool for conserving species and habitats that are currently threatened.I found this book enjoyable to read and managed to learn a few things in the process. The author also leaves the reader with something to think about."
15,0691157057,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8193417-melek,3,"As someone that simply runs away from everything that is related to biology in some way or another, I found How to Clone a Mammoth a very interesting science book. It is simple, fun and very informative at the same time. The only possible negative thing about it is that it could have been shorter, I didn't find every chapter necessary, yet 240 pages are short enough for a book like this, so I can't really complain about it.Updated on 30.06.15: I set the rating as 3/5."
16,0691157057,http://goodreads.com/user/show/28482493-angus-mckeogh,3,Interesting. Certainly learned a good bit that I didn't know. But for whatever reason it's not the most memorable scientific read I've had. Definitely read better books. But I wouldn't skip it either. Pretty good.
17,0691157057,http://goodreads.com/user/show/301240-patty,5,"So, yes, there is indeed an effort on to bring the Woolly Mammoth back from extinction, either through cloning (led by teams from Japan and South Korea) or through editing the genomes of modern-day Asian Elephants (led by a team from Harvard, with celeb-scientist George Church at the helm). Working on another aspect of the project, Sergey Zimov, assisted by his son Nikita, have already established a nature reserve in remote northeastern Siberia to provide a habitat for the potential mammoths – and of course they have named it Pleistocene Park, because there is no way to talk about this topic without a million references to Jurassic Park. The Zimovs have also provided the impetus for this project by arguing that mammoths would churn the soil and trample the snow as they grazed, thus exposing the permafrost to the freezing temperatures of the air in a Siberian winter, and thereby slowing down global warming. Shapiro is herself a scientist, one who specializes in recovering and reading Ancient DNA, and it really shows in this book. She understands the science of cloning, sequencing genomes, editing DNA, epigenetic influence on gene expression, and more, and explains it all in a clear and comprehensible way. She's also the most cynical by far of any of the de-extinction authors I've read; she's skeptical not just of if it's really possible to bring back woolly mammoths, but also if it's a good idea in the first place. She goes deep into many of the arguments against de-extinction and admits that she agrees with many of them. She takes the stance that de-extinction doesn't really ""count"" unless we can progress all the way to releasing a viable population of the species into the wild, and therefore attention deserves to go to species that will most have a beneficial effect of their ecosystems. Despite this somewhat negative view, Shapiro is actually involved in a de-extinction project herself (Revive & Restore's effort to de-extinct the passenger pigeon), and I feel like the practicality this gives her infuses the whole book. She's spent years grappling with the questions of how to do this and why, and there's a solidness, a down-to-earthness, to her answers that other authors just don't have. Highly recommended if you really want to know the ins and outs of the science behind de-extinction."

It is very informative; It provided me with interesting new facts but also gave great explanations of concepts I already knew such as PCR. The book has changed the way I see extinction. So far I have though that we humans are responsible for the extinction of the majority of species. After reading this book I take a biological approach to this issue. Humans are a species which evolution involves the destruction of other species. If we look at this as scientists, humans are merely surviving. Just as any animal, we seek to expand our territories. Sure we are smarter and should know better and protect the lesser species, but our biological nature moves us towards selfishness instead of thinking about animals and plants or the environment. Regardless, if we cause a massive extinction, other species will appear and one day even we will go extinct. This book made me think so much about evolution and how de extinction is incredibly challenging and almost unachievable. I took out a star because bit was too repetitive at times and a lot of chapter 4 felt like very unnecessary info. There are few mistakes that make it look less professional but nothing too significant."

And she has composed a surprisingly complete overview of the technical challenges, impossibilities and ethical concerns associated with replicating extinct species as living entities, be it mammoths, passenger pigeons or Lazarus frogs. Interestingly, she sees the greatest difficulties arising with the reintroduction itself and the uncertainties about the ecological consequences of bringing back de-extincted animals into an ecosystem that does not exist anymore in the state it was when they were last alive. There are so many insuperable difficulties, she argues, that for the moment the only thing we can aim for is to have a cold-tolerant Asian elephant that looks a bit like a mammoth, and has a few mammoth genes, roaming around Pleistocene Park in Siberia. I liked the chapters about Shapiro's own adventures in Siberia and elsewhere the most and it is a pity that she has not started her book with these chapters, which are much more catching than the relatively boring initial chapters. There is also some repetition in the book, as though different chapters were written for different occasions and put together later.

The best that can be done is to create a genetically engineered elephant with some mammoth characteristics.

This book, and Beth Shapiro, are clearly from a very academic background, and although I didn’t mind it for the most part, a lot of the science went over my head.

45,0691157057,http://goodreads.com/user/show/49030977-bethk,4,"I read this book as a pre-release e-book obtained through NetGalley, provided by the publisher.The book's title certainly gets attention because producing living, giant mammals such as mammoths would get a lot of attention. However, quickly the reader is led to having more realistic expectations of what is being done, or can currently or in the foreseeable future be possible to do to re-create extinct species. I personally found the book to be a fascinating read.Of course, tiny improvements in the various sciences or discoveries which make de-extinction more plausible make big headlines. However, closer examination shows that many of these things are not possible with current technology nor with existing scientific knowledge. Possibly they could be. But, headlines of ""Scientists will soon clone a mammoth"" attract much more attention than, ""Scientists breed rats which could live where extinct kangaroo rats did.""Technological and scientific challenges of sequencing ancient DNA were discussed, and, contrary to popular opinion, we have only barely scratched the surface of DNA sequencing of living organisms, including our own and other organisms which are important or detrimental to us. We have a lot more to learn in this regard! Specifically though, the prospect of getting any DNA from long-extinct creatures, such as dinosaurs out of fossils, is not possible. Jurassic Park will forever remain in the realm of science fiction.Certainly, cloning, or genetically-engineering cells to grow into creatures which are identical to other creatures which are extinct is appealing. However, it may not be possible, and even if it is possible, it might not be the most efficient or economical way to get a creature to take up the biological niche that an extinct species did. Genetic engineering is a controversial topic, and plants or animals which were de-extincted in this fashion might be regulated as GMOs. There was a long discussion of this in the book about what these would be, legally: Endangered species, or would they be GMOs - or would they if they were not intended as food? It might be more efficient to use more tried-and-true technologies such as selective breeding or back-breeding to produce varieties of existing animals or plants which would have similar traits, and take the same ecological niche as the extinct species did. For instance, the ecological effects of having a large, elephant-like mammal roaming the northern tundras and sub-Arctic were explored, but if we selectively bred Asian elephants which are most-closely related to mammoths or even African elephants so they could live and stay warm enough in cold climates, might this not have the same effect? Would it matter if they were not actually the same species as the mammoths that dominated these cold regions thousands or tens of thousands of years ago? The author believes not. It also would not have the same sensationalistic popular appeal, and would not attract donors. Indeed, this could be an expensive project.Cloning technology may offer one more tool in the ecologist's toolbox to ensure that recently-extinct species are not gone forever once the last one dies. It may be possible to produce a small number of them. Recreating populations in this manner also has challenges, not the least of which would be that they would need to be bred in captivity for at least some time, then protected once they got out.Much of the book involves ecology. If a species goes extinct, might it cause other species to also go extinct, or might it cause the proliferation of some other species, to the point where they become a pest and cause problems of their own? It also explores how this could cause animal suffering, such as using a smaller animal to gestate a larger one, or harvesting eggs from a female for use in cloning. This will become less of a problem once artificial wombs that can gestate these clones is invented, but it's not here now.What are all of the ecological ramifications of de-extincting various lifeforms? Is it wise? Why did it go extinct to begin with, and why won't that immediately repeat? Certainly, some things, such as smallpox, are best left extinct. Re-extincting other, beneficial creatures may have ecological effects too, and it might take their former environment some time to re-adapt to their presence, just as it did to their absence."
46,0691157057,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5242512-galen-charlton,4,"Review originally posted at Reading Reality.Humanity, of course, has a lot to answer for — and Jurassic Park has set some expectations in the minds of non-scientists that science is unlikely to ever be able to deliver on.What do we have to answer for? We’re just so damn efficient about killing off other species: by hunting them to the last member and by destroying their habitats, we’ve all too often shown that there’s space for us but not them. Want to stroke the fur of a mammoth? Pet an auroch (then run away)? Hear the chatter of a flock of passenger pigeons? You’re out of luck — and so are they.Of course, extinction itself is a normal state of affairs. 99% percent all of species that have ever existed are extinct, and humanity need not accept the blame for the asteroid that killed off the dinosaurs.Jurassic Park was ostensibly about bringing back some dinosaurs — and what could go wrong if you let them reproduce — but it’s not much of a stretch to wonder: if we could restore a dinosaur from a bit of amber… could we recover from our past mistakes? And in doing so, atone for them?As it turns out, amber is rather bad at preserving DNA. No dinosaurs from fossilized tree sap — nor anything else once extinct. Nonetheless, the prospect of de-extinction is compelling.Beth Shapiro’s books grounds this dream in what, at present, seems to be possible — and what is not.Reality Rating A-: Shapiro, who is a professor at UC Santa Cruz and one of the principle investigators at the UCSC Paleogenomics Lab, ably describes how one might go about attempting to restore an extinct species: finding some or part of its genome, finding another species that is a close enough relative to bring a fertilized egg to term, then dealing with the problem of raising the offspring. Along the way, she provides vignettes of her experiences in the field gathering mammoth DNA (and one conclusion I can draw from that: I do not expect that Dr. Shapiro would ever participate in a project to bring an extinct mosquito back).Moreover, Shapiro discusses why one might bring an extinct species back — and argues that trying to do so should be for reasons that go beyond assuaging an inchoate sense of guilt. This passage is key:In my mind, it is this ecological resurrection, and not species resurrection, that is the real value of de-extinction. We should think of de-extinction not in terms of which life form we will bring back, but what ecological interactions we would like to see restored.It doesn’t necessarily do any particular favor for a mammoth (or as Shapiro explains is much more likely, an Asian elephant that has some mammoth genes adapting it to cold conditions) to stride the tundra again all alone — but as part of an effort to restore the subarctic grasslands that the mammoths mere presence help create and maintain, de-extinction efforts can give us the ability to restore ecosystems.Playing God? Perhaps. But after having already disrupted so many of the planet’s ecosystems, we may not have much choice but to muddle along with our technology lest homo sapiens drops out of the 1% that has so far survived. Shapiro makes a compelling argument that de-extinction projects, while neither panaceas nor time machines, belong in our ecological toolkit.The sections of the book that discuss the technical matters of how one might go about recovering ancient DNA and cloning animals seem pretty accessible to anybody who remembers a bit of their high school biology — and unlike Stephen Hawking, Shapiro did not need to worry about each equation in the text halving her readership."
47,0691157057,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4294263-amy-rogers,4,"ScienceThrillers review: Michael Crichton started it with his novel Jurassic Park. The idea that we could resurrect an extinct species using ancient DNA–popularly called “de-extinction”–captured the popular imagination. As techniques for sequencing DNA improved, real-life scientists started to take this idea seriously.But after reading scientist Beth Shapiro’s excellent book on the topic, I now understand that de-extinction isn’t what most people think.In How to Clone a Mammoth: The Science of De-Extinction, Shapiro walks through the steps to de-extinction, in chapters such as “Select a species” and “Reconstruct the genome.” Before reading this book, I thought I basically understood the process: find some ancient DNA; sequence it; put it in some kind of egg; implant in a host mother; birth a baby.It’s so much more complicated than that.Despite the enthusiasm that some people have for bringing back charismatic megafauna like the wooly mammoth (a Russian entrepreneur is already preparing Pleistocene Park, a Siberian habitat where the modern world’s first mammoths can live), this book explains that in one sense, it cannot be done. DNA doesn’t last very long. Even with mammoth specimens well-preserved in ice, and only thousands of years old, the DNA that remains is fragmentary at best. And this is just the first of multiple technical obstacles that seem insurmountable.So why is this brilliant young UC professor dedicated to the science of ancient DNA and de-extinction? Because while we cannot bring back the mammoth (or any other long-lost species), we can bring back, or rather, create, a mammoth-like creature using pieces of the original mammoth’s genome added to an existing relative–the elephant.Why bother, then? Shapiro argues that de-extinction efforts should focus on restoring ecosystems, not individual species. The wooly mammoth, for example, played a crucial role in helping the tundra flourish. Research suggests that the trampling and grazing activity of large herbivores (like mammoths) can convert barren tundra into arctic grassland. Even if we can’t bring back the mammoth, we perhaps can create a cold-tolerant Asian elephant that lives in the tundra and replaces the role in the ecosystem lost when the last mammoth died.This was one of several important messages in this book that kept me thinking for some time after reading. Another takeaway that changed my way of seeing things was Shapiro’s discussion of how very hard it is to take a species from captivity and return it to a wild habitat. The idea that as long as we keep a few animals alive in zoos we will always have the option in the future to restore them to nature is false in most cases.How to Clone a Mammoth is thorough, thought-provoking, interesting, and written for lay people (though a keen interest in biology helps). It explores the science and the ethics of de-extinction, discusses the media’s role in this topic, and describes the author’s adventures in wild places hunting for frozen mammoth bones. Should we invest in de-extinction and try to “bring back” lost species? After reading this book, you’ll be equipped to argue one way or the other.If you’re interested in resurrecting extinct species, you might enjoy the novel The Neanderthal’s Aunt by Gina DeMarco, a funny, touching satire about a young woman scientist whose sister plans to adopt the modern world’s first Neanderthal baby."

I received this book via NetGalley from in exchange for an honest and completely unbiased review.
I want to start noting that I generally dislike the maltreatment of animals and cruelty enacted in laboratories, so this could not be an unbiased review.How to Clone a Mammoth is about cloning and the various problems concerned with the technologies used to clone cells. Shapiro explains these problems in the most base way, only touching on much of the scientific jargon that would confuse the average reader. She also explains that cloning would not return a perfect specimen from the Ice Age as popular belief has led us to imagine. Instead, the creatures developed from cloning would be mammoth-like. These species would act to revive ecosystems by filling in the gaps where interactions between species has gone dormant due to the extinction of one or more animal.Unfortunately, while the conservation of failing ecosystems is a valiant effort, Shapiro goes further by stating that we shouldn’t restrict this technology to de-extintion. In fact. she offers cloning technologies as a method to alter endangered species who lack diversity or cannot adapt to climate change quickly enough. The desire to play with the biology of struggling species is a cold, analytical leap in Shapiro’s logic. It describes the chilling future of this technologies and the lack of morality found in those wielding it.On top of the desire to alter live species, Shapiro theorizes that if new species are created to fill ecological niches there may come a day when our creations may do more damage than good to the ecosystem we are trying to maintain. The shocking conclusion is that we should eradicate the species if it starts to harm the ecosystem only further destroyed Shapiro’s work. The death of living creatures should never be something brazenly thrown around. Although Shapiro highlights that there would have to be careful consideration this matter, and perhaps even a council should be drawn up to purpose such mass slaughters.Shapiro covers back breeding as one method for bringing back the mammoth and outlines the struggle for recreating the auroch, they are creating new technologies to slip “scissors” into a nucleus to snip out the genetic code they don’t want, and plan to use “glue” to paste the new genetic code geneticists have created to make sure the new genetic code is fused. The techniques covered in this book are both cutting edge and leading back to the selective breeding practices to rebirth various animals: the Dodo, the auroch and Passenger Pigeon.I also learned how an egg is made inside a chicken, chickens cannot be cloned, ancient DNA is much trickier than we can imagine, and Asian Elephants just might be the closest relative to the mammoth.Although I abhor Shapiro’s ethical arguments I enjoyed her work. How to Clone a Mammoth was extremely educational for the average reader over a broad range of topics and it attempts to conquer very delicate moral issues. Although sometimes repetitive with ideas, this book is well worth a look for people who know very little about cloning and biology."
49,0691157057,http://goodreads.com/user/show/18293816-bill-leach,4,"An excellent book that examines the many considerations in trying to bring a mammoth back to life. A chapter on the concept of de-extinction of a species is followed by a discussion of the criteria that should determine whether a species is re-created. One issue is the species natural environment: in some cases it no longer exists. Conversely, there is thought that species could contribute to an improved environment. Dr. Sergey Zimov believes that re-introduction of the mammoth to the north would transform the relatively barren tundra of today to richer grasslands.It is difficult to get DNA from fossils as DNA degrades quickly. Moreover, contamination happens very easily. Some DNA was extracted from a 700,000 year old frozen horse fossil found in the Yukon. Frozen mammoth remains of 40,000 years age are frequently found.The cloning of an animal through somatic cell nuclear transfer is accomplished by inserting the target DNA into the egg cell from a similar animal, and letting the egg develop in a surrogate mother. While cloning by nuclear transfer works, it is inefficient in that only a few in a thousand embryos fully develop.Another approach is back breeding where living species are crossed to emphasize characteristics thought to be characteristic of an extinct animal. While back breeding does not rely on genetic manipulation, it requires many generations: 14 years for an elephant. While the final product may look like an extinct animal, back breeding cannot recover genes that have been lost, such as a four gene difference between elephant and mammoth hemoglobin which make it more efficient in cold temperatures.The epigenome, a set of tags that activate / deactivate genes, is controlled by the environment. Efforts to reconstruct epigenomes have been limited. The reconstruction of the epigenome of a Denisovian and a Neanderthal found 2000 differences from a modern human. It is not known how much of what a mammoth was comes from the epigenome versus the genome.George Church is a proponent of editing the elephant genome to install DNA sequences that are known to be different in the mammoth. Good discussion on the techniques useful for genetic editing, including CRISPR. Even if the editing is successful, there are many hurdles in bringing a pregnancy to birth. Mention is made of mismatches between nuclear and mitochondrial DNA.There are many issues in expanding a population of de-extinct animals beyond a single individual. Genetic diversity is likely required for survival. Individuals must learn about food sources, predators, social interaction, and raising offspring. Releasing a population into the wild overcomes the many problems experienced by animals in captivity, but raises the issue of compatibility with the environment.A final chapter summarizes a number of negative aspects of de-extinction including the prospect of reviving dangerous pathogens, the potential for detracting from current conservation efforts, the lack of ecosystems for some species, and others.

Despite what that talking animated DNA strand Mr DNA led us to believe in the original Jurassic Park movie, it turns out that fossilized amber isn't such a great way to preserve ancient genetic material. In fact, ancient DNA is pretty hard to come by, even in comparatively recent extinctions like the mammoth or the dodo.

(Most of us view the word clone as ""making a copy of something"", where in fact this whole process is really driving to resurrect an extinct species.)I will agree with other reviewers that the author does a nice job in making many of the concepts easy to understand, and yet there were a few places where the ease totally fell down and I was left scratching my head. ( I have a background in science which helps, but the average reader might stumble). This is why I gave it 4 stars. As I finished the book I personally felt conflicted. Going into it with an open mind I loved the possibility of recreating an extinct organism. However as I reflected on this, I now think it is a terrible idea. What I do admire however, is the cutting edge work scientists are doing as I think their work will have broad implications in many other human endeavors. "

I like learning things and I learned a lot here.There is quite a lot of chatter about de-extinction – the process of bringing extinct species back to life through some genetic wizardry. Think Jurassic Park with proper science! It sounds far-fetched, and it isn’t imminent, but this book tells you a lot, in a very readable way, about how far-fetched it is. And I guess the answer is ‘Possible in theory, difficult and unproven as yet in practice’.I came across this idea when writing A Message from Martha as the Passenger Pigeon is often regarded as a candidate for such treatment – particularly last year in the centenary of the bird’s extinction, when it was, in relative terms, quite newsworthy. The Passenger Pigeon, therefore, steps and flutters in and out of this book to illustrate some of the challenges.But as always, it’s the mammals that get top billing. How about getting some mammoths back? Wouldn’t that be fun? Well maybe it would, but this is a good lay-person’s guide to what would be involved technically as far as breeding up ‘real’ ‘new’ mammoths.Shapiro writes engagingly and clearly and ranges across genetics, ecology, ethics and politics. I’m not sure I agree with her about everything but I am very glad she wrote this book and set out the information and thoughts so clearly.This review first appeared on Mark Avery's blog http://markavery.info/2015/05/03/sund...

54,0691157057,http://goodreads.com/user/show/372020-jeremy-yoder,5,"From my review for the Awl:But even without the genetic engineering, Pleistocene rewilding is a dramatic reframing of what it means to conserve nature. It’s not just trying to save the living things that are here right now, but trying to restore a world from some time before humans influenced the course of planetary events. Shapiro writes, “De-extinction is a process that allows us to actively create a future that is really better than today, not just one that is less bad than what we anticipate.” Why is a reconstructed Pleistocene “a future that is really better than today?” That remains unclear—except that it is the most distant slice of Earth’s past from which we can obtain the preserved DNA necessary for de-extinction, and during which modern humans were anywhere on the global stage. ... Pleistocene rewilding carries a strong smell of the same nostalgia for a vanished epoch that has young urban professionals trying to re-create the lifestyle of ancient hunter-gatherers in organic grocery stores and exercise studios—a paleo diet for the entire planet."
55,0691157057,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1532739-cary,3,"Really a 3.5.This book has a lot of good information in it. Shapiro is very practical and up front about the current state of the art regarding bringing extinct species back to life. She does not stop there, but also discusses the political aspects as well as the larger practical aspect: what are the larger goals, is there an appropriate environment to which the de-extincted creature be re-introduced (de-unintroduced?).The writing is somewhat uneven and didn't grab me. It's not a page turner. Some things get repeated more than they need be - while on the other hand some more technical aspects or terms are glossed over. If you know or remember some biology, it's not a problem. For example, I'm guessing that most readers would appreciate terms like prokaryotic and eukaryotic being clearly defined, even if one can infer their meanings from context.So, a strong recommendation to anyone with an interest in the topic, particularly because the book is current and keeps things real. Otherwise, you may want to pass on this one."

Why? Three basic reasons:Jurassic Park, a science fiction franchise which made use of the concept of bringing back extinct creatures to the tune of some several billion dollars (and counting with the upcoming release of the fourth film). Other authors as well have used the idea, so while this book isn’t a genre title, its subject matter of “de-extinction” continues to have an impact on the genreIt’s science, it’s Pleis... Read More"

I have had plans for a full back-piece for that tattoo that I won't be getting; it's a mammoth whose tusks would cover most of my right shoulder blade while the trunk would curl up onto my neck. I've had this plan for probably over ten years and I still think it's the best idea for a tattoo ever. 2. I have a secret and (un) healthy obsession with Jean Auel's Clan of the Cave Bear series. I have read the entire series several times and it is the worst and best thing ever. Who doesn't want their own cave lion named Baby? So, yeah, I am completely and utterly biased about this book on the simple fact that there's an orange mammoth on the cover. But besides my fan-boy bias, this was just enough hard-core science to make me think and just enough popular science to be readable. And plus, the author is funny! "
58,0691157057,http://goodreads.com/user/show/71368130-james-horne,5,"How To Clone A Mammoth by Beth Shapiro is an intuitive book on the future of genetic modification. It is an exciting book with many questions regarding if we should or should not be creating ""new species"".The book follows the studies of Beth Shapiro as she explores the steps in the genetic modification process: Choosing A Species, Collect Specimen, Re-create Genome, Get Common Relative Genome, Combine Genomes, Create Animal, Get Genome, Create Another Clone, and Rewilding The Animals.Throughout the book, she constantly reminds the audience of the dangers that come with creating new species. It finishes with her asking if we should let sleeping dogs lie.I would recommend this book to anyone who enjoys the thrill of resurrecting extinct species or is just a fan of genetics. I give this book a 5/5"
59,0691157057,http://goodreads.com/user/show/50873906-chad,4,"Unfortunately, this is not an actual guide to cloning a mammoth. It is, however, a very good overview to all the ways in which scientists are currently working towards bio-engineering diverse species - including extinct species - to repopulate areas, or to hopefully fix the holes that humans punch in an ecosystem.I completely agree with Shapiro's thoughts on fixing systemic problems in nature. I have considered myself a conservationist since a very young age, but I am at odds with those who are strict preservationists. Nature is not a museum, and should not be treated as such. I also believe that humans must take an active role in shaping the natural world - not towards our fancies, but towards its necessities."
