0,1598878735,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1142366-hans,4,"This book is first and foremost a cultural myth-buster. There are so many dangerous collectively held beliefs about human potential and its limits. One of the greatest insults that we can say to someone who is talented is that they came by it naturally. When we label people as naturally talented, or smart it is a back-handed compliment that tries to downplay their efforts while excusing our own laziness. Everyone who is talented or gifted came by it the hard way, through dedicated hard-work. That is the thesis of this book, that according to new neuroscience research the difference between talented and mediocrity is the layers of Myelin wrapped around the neurons in the brain. This increased Myelin allows for increased ""bandwidth"" or speed of firing neurons. The more a neuron is fired the more insulation it demands hence the increased wrapping of myelin. Repetition is how we repeatedly fire those neurons making them faster and faster. This increased speed is what makes talented people look like everything they do is so fluid and easy. The secret to talent is focused practice with the aim of correcting mistakes one at a time. Breaking down a difficult task into its component parts and slowly learning each one until it all comes together. To get started we all need an ignition or trigger that gives us enough forward momentum to start moving in the direction of our desired goal. These triggers can come from anywhere, but once set off it is our job to find ways to keep that fire burning because the destination is a long journey that takes time. Effort, self-discipline and openness to feedback are the critical elements to perfecting our abilities. Failure is a teacher and friend that shouldn't be feared but seen for what it is a way of spotlighting the areas where we could use improvement.This book helped shore up my own belief in human potential and that it rests with the individual not on luck but hard-work. Intelligence has a stronger correlation to self-discipline than IQ scores."

Prodigies like Mozart, Davinci, etc., were only lucky enough to know how to enter that zone deliberately. In other words, they had cracked the talent code. In this review, I will share with you this life-altering secret.What you will learn in this book:-What really is talent, and how it is grown?-How you can drastically speed up acquiring a talent using deep practice-How you can create the motivation that pushes you forward.-A new mindset that literally changes you into believing if it is humanly possible, it is within your reach as well.By far, this is one of the most impactful books I have ever read and it makes an amazing companion to the book: ""Mindset"".For me, before this book, I believed that innate talent has always been a major element of success and extraordinary achievement. From that decisive and brilliant leader who makes accurate snap judgments to those kids who solve the Rubik under 10 seconds, I always used to think, gosh, they’re so lucky to be so talented. But I was wrong, terribly wrong. This is quite limiting and prevents you from even trying.Luckily for me, I stumbled on this amazing book which literally debunks lots of dangerous and self-limiting myths about talent and achievement.What really is talent?What we refer to as talent, as scientists have discovered, involves a neural insulator called myelin and is now considered to be the holy grail of cultivating skills.From the simplest skill, such as flipping a coin, or riding a bike, to complex ones such as programming, proving a mathematical formula, playing the piano, etc., each human skill involves chains of nerve fibers and neural circuits that carry tiny electrical impulses.Simply put, each skill involves traveling of signals through specific circuits of neurons.Myelin critical role is to wrap around those nerve fibers and circuits. Think of it in the way rubber is wrapped around a copper wire.The more myelin is wrapped around those fibers, the faster and stronger those tiny signal travel through the circuits. Hence, you become faster and better at the task.In addition, this myelination and insulation of fibers make you more accurate by preventing the electrical signals from leaking out.But how are these myelins created?If more myelination means becoming faster, better and more accurate, you would definitely want to know how it is created, and how we can influence it.Let’s see how it is created in the first place.Imagine you want to try to swing a bat or play a note. If you do it correctly, your brain responds by wrapping myelin around the involving circuits (the circuits that successfully led to your desired outcome).Each time you repeat the task successfully another thin layer of myelin is added to the involving circuits, making you even faster and better.Although everyone can grow myelin, however, there are certain rules about practicing, that makes its growth much faster (you can learn about the techniques here). And those prodigies that you see (from Michelangelo to Michael Jordan) are following those specific rules while they practice.In fact, success or mediocrity depends most on the way you practice, not the brain already at your disposition.Next, I will cast the light on these rules, and share with you the means of learning super fast.You can read the rest of the review here"
2,1598878735,http://goodreads.com/user/show/117278-simmoril,5,"One of the most often-quoted facts regarding talent, which I first heard in Malcolm Gladwell's ""Outliers"", is that becoming an expert in a given field takes on average about 10,000 hours of deliberate practice. However, that term 'deliberate practice' can seem somewhat vague: what exactly is supposed to happen during those 10,000 hours? Coyle's book is the definitive answer to that question. In his book, Coyle explores this notion of deliberate practice from all angles. To begin, he starts out with what, in my opinion, is the single most important aspect of this book: a medical explanation for what is happening in your brain when you learn. Building upon this foundation, Coyle then walks through the different parts of deep learning, along the way introducing a varied cast of writers, skateboarders, painters, musicians, teachers and football players that help emphasize the important aspects of the process. Through their stories, Coyle also helps drive home the point that these people were not born great, they worked at it. And in the end, there really is no silver bullet: talent takes a great deal of time and effort. But by spending that time putting in the right kind of effort, you can achieve some pretty amazing things.As my book list might reflect, I have a very strong interest in the study of talent, geniuses, and what I like to call meta-learning (learning how to learn), and this book is definitely one of the best books I've read on the subject. Honestly, I wish I could give it six stars, but since I can't I'll settle for encouraging you to put this book at the top of your reading list."
3,1598878735,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5963979-jim-razinha,2,"Coyle asks, ""...why does it take people so long to learn complex tasks?"" Um...because they're complex? Any time someone opens up with how they'll reveal ""revolutionary scientific discoveries"", the best advice is to run away. I didn't take my own advice and stubbornly slogged through this collection of anecdotes about ""hotbeds"" (he loves that term) in which he reaches far, contradicts himself, incredibly co-opts the Tom Sawyer fence whitewashing story to his means (really...guy tosses thousands of years of human psychology for a fad theory), ignores concentrations of ""signals"" that don't fit his model for hotbed generation...Coyle is a sports writer proposing a theory that he masquerades as science, but it's mostly pop-psychology BS. It's sad that this nonsense is published, sadder that people buy into it.Why did I read it? A colleague - psychologist - thought I'd really like the ""fascinating"" book he was listening to on CD. I am continually amazed at the lack of critical thought among PhDs...less so among the soft sciences...even less in the liberal arts, if the dissertations I've read recently are any indication. The logical fallacies in this book are rampant, and the anecdotes too obviously cherry-picked in order to support the pseudo-theory for this to be taken seriously."
4,1598878735,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5857501-emeline,3,"I'm on the fence about this book. The subject matter is riveting, but it's the writing that throw it all off for me. It's too catchy, to commercial. The author has a penchant for grand claims which I don't think sits well when trying to write a book rooted in science. He is passionate, I'll give him that. I always feel I am being actively sold something, and talked down to as if I were a child, his little riddle about myelin production got on my nerves pretty quickly, as did all the endless case scenarios, each more predictable than the next. The tone was a bit too trivial (""here's a comment about this person"", ""here's a little joke"", ""here is my own life experience""!Maybe I'm too fresh out of college, but I was sorely put off by the lack of citations *grins*. They are at the end."
5,1598878735,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6143658-isaac-yuen,3,"I checked this out based on a recommendation from my professor, a lifelong educator who’s deeply immersed in the field of leadership and organizational development. He stated, on no uncertain terms, that this was one of the best reads out there on talent development. Not just talent in one area, ALL talent.The central premise, which is repeated for effect throughout the book, is that “skill is insulation that wraps neural circuits and grows according to certain signals.” That insulation is a substance we learned in high-school biology called myelin. Building myelin allows impulse circuits to fire more precisely, more quickly, and more consistently, all of which contribute to skill improvement. Practice and repetition are crucial to this increase in myelination activity. Instead of focusing on genetic and environmental factors, Coyle proposes that we think of skill development as a muscle and an exercise in building myelin. The book focuses on three crucial elements that allow people to develop their skills and become experts in a wide range of fields, from sports to music and art: Deep Practice  - Repetition is important, but Coyle explores what it means to practice effectively - through focusing both on the small details and the big picture, and by actively utilizing failure as an opportunity to improve. One of the best examples in the book is provided early on, dubbed the Girl Who Did a Month’s Worth of Practice in Six Minutes. Just like a baby taking its first steps and falling, skills are developed much more quickly through doing and failing, attending to mistakes, and trying again. A really good quote in this section from Samuel Beckett: “Try Again. Fail Again. Fail Better.”Ignition  - The fuel necessary for the repetition required for skill development. Coyle scours the world for examples of talent hotbeds and teases out some primal cues that stirs the fires necessary for the commitment necessary towards being world experts. One interesting finding is that effort-based language (eg. you are working hard) is more effective for igniting than intelligence based language (eg. you are really smart) because it speaks to the very core of the learning experience (by building myelin and improving circuits).Master Coaching  - The guidance necessary to cultivate world class talent. Coyle interviews various sports and talent coaches and learns that good coaches generally have a toolset of depth of knowledge, perceptiveness of personalities, directly instructive communication skills, and an innate sense of empathy for their students. Not surprisingly, these qualities of master coaching are also a result of years of practice and myelin building.Overall, the book was a great, quick read. Coyle litters the book with interesting anecdotes while keeping the pacing lean and the content organized. That’s tough to do. I learned a few things that could be beneficial to my own personal development, which is always nice. Some of his findings and statements sound a little too definitive, but it does make for a persuasive piece of writing. If you’re looking for a detailed exploration of the connections between myelination and skill development, this is not the book for you. Otherwise, I highly recommend it."
6,1598878735,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5473158-heather,5,"There is so much to be gained from what this book teaches. This is one of my favorite books so far from 2012.What makes talent? Is is born or made? The theory behind this book is that talent is made. The way this is done is by ""deep practice"". Deep practice isn't just about practicing something over and over again--it is about practicing in a certain system of doing, messing up, and doing over again until you get it right. What I love about this theory is that to be talented you must fail and learn from the failure. Failing is key.In other words the author explains that you have to be good at being bad before having talent. For this to work you have to love to fail, knowing you are actually gaining the entire time. This reminds me of a famous quote by Thomas Edison who, before inventing the lightbulb, failed over 10,000 times. Except Edison's viewpoint wasn't that he failed 10,000 times in the quest for the lightbulb--he instead found 10,000 ways that did not work. This is the premise of the theory of this book. The author points out that those who are truly talented started off as terrible and then became good. What may look like an overnight success is really hours and hours of practice before mastery.The science behind this (your brain and it's mylein proteins that are formed when you actively ""do"" something) will please those who are into logical facts and the myraid of famous stories of famous people from history and life will satisfy history buffs and self development seekers. This book is truly recommended for all to get a glimpse into theory on what talent is really about."
7,1598878735,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4611417-x,5,"The Talent Code is a book about talent and skill, and how they are developed. It explains why we see bursts of talented people, Russian tennis players, Brazilian football players, Italian artists, and others. It is based on a simple but powerful idea once you truly understand it. It's not very different from ""Outliers"" by Malcolm Gladwell, but it is more researched, more accurate, and simply more entertaining than Gladwell's book. Plus, Gladwell ends his book by trying (and failing) to explain why Chinese students are good at math. I think the ideas behind The Talent Code gives the right explanation for this phenomenon (although it's not explicitly mentioned).I loved this book, there's no reason why you won't love it too :)"
8,1598878735,http://goodreads.com/user/show/20940446-dianne,5,"The Talent Code is a fascinating study of success, the success of groups or clusters of people in widely separated parts of the globe and in many different fields of endeavour. Contrary to common thought talent is not born it is gained through deep focused practice. This is the current revelation discovered by Daniel Coyle and other social scientists. What he discovered are talent hot beds. These are specific towns where the winners, the most successful in a skill, are coming from. The myelin which forms around neurons which have performed an activity repeatedly is the magic substance required to achieve excellence. Usually a knowledgeable coach is part of the equation. The concept incorporates the 10,000 hour theory explained in the Outliers taking Glaswell’s study to another level. Intriguing examples are given, among them exceptional novelists, artists, golfers, soccer players and tennis champions. Often the circumstances are ideal for the teaching of the sport, the art or other skill. Such a circumstance might be the artist guilds organized in Italy or the soccer camps in Peru which gives the person the advantage of being in the right place at the right time in the right apprenticeship program with the right teacher doing the right exercises, developing myelin. An important part of learning a skill is breaking the skill down to chunks and learning each chunk absolutely correctly and very slowly. In this way the person learns the internal blueprints of the skill, the shape and rhythm of the interlocking skill circuits. A master coach follows a teaching system of explanation, demonstration, imitation, correction and repetition. Another factor in success is ignition, having a role model preferably from your home town. This seems to be especially true in areas of poverty. A star baseball player or other highly paid athlete will spur on many other hopefuls to also advance to a professional level. The coaches in these hotbeds praised effort rather than complimenting the participant's intelligence. Hard work and slow progress were the keys to success. Something I found interesting was that in Finland a teacher is paid as well as a doctor and is considered of equal importance to society. Finnish students rank far above American students in math, science and reading. Also, wisdom comes with age because the circuits are fully insulated."
9,1598878735,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5870882-sunny,5,"Brilliant book about talent and how to nurture, ignite, coach and essentially spot it in individuals. As the father of 2 little boys who I coach in both boxing and football (sock-her) there were about 5/6 really interesting leadership / coaching techniques that I picked up from the book that I have already started to implement into their training and my own. One of the differentiators of this book was the introduction, into my vernacular at least, of this substance called myelin. Myelin sounds like a wizard from lord of the rings but it’s not. It’s a white substance that grows over the long part of a neuron. Its acts as an insulator. As you grow old this insulator like substance (think of an electricity wire that slowly has its covering worn away so you can see the metal wiring inside) slowly wears away and you can’t function as well. The link with talent that Coyle proffers is that you can almost speed up the growth of this insulation by physically doing stuff again and again. He talks about something called deep practise where you break down the composite parts of any action such as a tennis stroke, the perfect right hand punch, a golf swing, a piano piece, and a dance move. etc and when you have perfected these parts you chunk it all together and execute the holistic action. The book talks about the 10,000 hour rule for world class excellence but says that the exceptionals have done that and used deep practise also. The book also talks about key events that really ignited the imagination of a young child and made him her realise what he she really wanted to be. That could have been a Eureka moment or witnessing a baseball player for example hitting a home run against all odds. The book also talks about some of the master coaches the world has seen and tells some really interesting stories about them. This combination of ignition, master coaching and then deep learning all combine to create talent, Coyle proffers. The book also spoke about some of the best coaches in the world, how futsal was introduced to the UK and the Bronte sisters!Best bits from the book were:•	In one experiment the author tested to see how well kids performed on a musical instrument. The group had all started out at the same time so were starting from the same playing field but the assessor asked them one fundamental question and based on the answer to that the results were incredible. It was discovered that those who had stated and intended to play the instrument for a long time scored higher than those that stated that they were only going to play the instrument for a short period of time. Those that fared better had made the conscious decision that they would become musicians and that was all there was to it. They were going to practise and put all they had into it. •	A clinical psychologist called Michael Eisenstadt also did some research on successful people and found out that some of the most successful had lost a parent very early in their life and the average age was around 14. Here are some individuals who had lost a father, in particular, early in life and the age at which they lost that parent: Caesar 15, Napoleon 15, Washington 11, Jefferson 14, Lenin 15, Hitler 13, Ghandi 15, Stalin 11, Copernicus 10, Emerson 8, Melville 12, and Nietzsche 4. “Losing a parent is a primal cue: you are not safe. You don't have to be a psychologist to appreciate the massive outpouring of energy that can be created by a lack of safety. This signal can alter the child’s relationship to the world, redefine his identity and energize and orient his mind to address the dangers and possibilities of life … such adverse events nurture the development of a personality robust enough to overcome the many obstacles and frustrations standing in the path of achievement”•	“In Finland a teacher is regarded as the social equivalent of a doctor or a lawyer and is compensated accordingly … this is linked to the fact that we really believe we live in an information age, so it is respected to be in such a key information profession as teaching.” As a result Finland has one of the best education standards in the world."
10,1598878735,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2456469-glenda,5,"This is a must-read for teachers, particularly those who believe all students can learn. Daniel Coyle speaks to the value of hard work, appropriate mentors, and effective motivation (which he calls ignition) in developing talent. I particularly like Coyle's acknowledgment that experience and expertise matter. In fact, he claims that it takes one ten years and/or 10,000 hours of ""deep practice"" to become an expert in one's chosen profession or avocation. Take that, Bill Gates. Coyle also pays homage to the best coaches and teachers, whom he says typically have 30-40 years of experience. That's validating in this day of ageism and youth-obsession. Coyle's description of the disciplined and, arguably, regimented KIPP academies reminds me of my own elementary school experience, which surely resembled a typical Catholic school education. I like that Coyle emphasizes the importance of discipline in the details, which promote excellence and discipline in the really important things in life. I just can't say enough good things about this book, which validates so much of what I've believed about education the past thirty years. "
11,1598878735,http://goodreads.com/user/show/155663-david,4,"The thesis of this excellent book is that talent is developed by the right kind of practice. This practice repeatedly fires the correct neurons, which develops the myelin sheaths that surround these neurons; a positive feedback ensues, further strengthening the neuron connections. Brute repetition is not the type of practice that the author recommends; he discusses a ""deep"" practice that breaks down a complex skill into component parts, and repeats the parts until they become perfect and ingrained. The right type of coach can enormously speed up the process, and help one to learn from one's mistakes.The most interesting part of the book are the visits the author makes to so-called ""talent hot-beds"". These are places that where skills are built with extraordinary results, all out of proportion to their size, or the quality of their environment or facilities. Well worth reading!"
12,1598878735,http://goodreads.com/user/show/762235-marcus,3,"I like that Coyle actually went out and visited ""talent hotbeds"" and tried to synthesize ways they practice, motivate and coach rather than just citing other studies and books. I'd never heard of myelin so that was interesting, though his miracle drug description of it is ridiculous.The thirty second takeaway: practice in chunks, breaking up music to measures, bringing sports to a smaller scale--practice in a way that lets you fail and correct often. Stay motivated by taking a genuine interest in the subject, group motivation is also helpful. Coach dynamically by giving short queues. Limit praise and criticism and focus on practical suggestions. Coach efficiently taking every second of practice time into account and coach everything from how socks are put on to how they leave the field."
13,1598878735,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1045774-mehrsa,3,"Totally forgettable and just like every other book in this genre. Coyle is a better writer than most so that's a bonus. I really liked his culture code book, but this one is just a rehash of books I've already read about deliberative practice, grit (eye roll), growth mindset (eye roll), etc."
14,1598878735,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6188366-deb,5,"*Talent de-coded*Now, if this book isn't a display of remarkable talent, I don't know what is!Not only does Daniel Coyle de-code talent, but he uses his own to brilliantly weave the story behind greatness. Clearly, he's honed his writing talent. (And, after reading this book, you'll understand the neurological processes enabling that growth!)The book tells the story of the three components of the talent-code: deep practice, ignition, and master coaching. The protagonist of the talent story is myelin--our brain's insulation that responds to neural firing and wraps skill circuits. It is these tightly wrapped circuits that are the building blocks of talent. The plot of the talent story thickens (literally, from a myelin-perspective) as master coaches combine the forces of deep practice and ignition to grow talent in others.I'm pretty much blown away by this book. (Reading the previous reviews I see I'm not alone in this department!) Ever since I have read it, I've seen endless possibilities on how this unlocked code has the power to unlock human potential in all areas from education, to sports, to therapy, to parenting, and everything in between. _The Talent Code_ is certainly one of those books that has the power to help you maximize your potential--and that of those around you."

18,1598878735,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2382227-rick-davis,3,"The premise of this book is interesting, and I enjoyed learning about myelin. I think that there are some good ideas about techniques for practicing and perfecting skills as well. However, the writing is kind of all over the place. (I can only take so many mixed metaphors.) Also the application in the last couple of chapters and the epilogue shows the tendency to favor skill building as an end in itself in opposition to theory. This sort of results-oriented, pragmatic approach generally rubs me the wrong way. I'd prefer to know *why* I should do something rather than *how* to do it. Both are important of course, but without answering the first question, the second question is pointless. (For example, the author lauds the ability to use these techniques to train girls to be pop-singers rather than classically trained singers, but doesn't consider whether being a pop-singer rather than a classically trained singer is something to aim for. He praises a program that trains shy people to interact better socially without having to talk about their pasts or explore what causes shyness, but he doesn't consider that the self-knowledge of the latter method may be just as valuable as the practical benefit of the former. I was also frustrated by the KIPP program which assumes that college attendance is the be-all, end-all goal of education.)"
19,1598878735,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2550933-konnie,4,"What a fascinating read! Daniel Coyle spent two years visiting talent ""hotbeds,"" like Brazil with it's soccer factory, Russia's tennis training ground, and the Z-Boys in California. He studied the practicing, the coaches, and the environmental factors that contribute to these bundles of genius or greatness. He connects what he finds to the latest research and conclusions about how skills and talent grow at the brain level. His conclusions about growing talent are widely applicable, and the many anecdotes make the book a pleasure to read. What I found in the book makes me want to go learn a new language or instrument! My approach to helping my children practice new skills--even the way I compliment them for their effort is different now.I highly recommend this book to everyone who has children, everyone actively learning new skills (certainly everyone in school), and everyone concerned about keeping previously developed skills. Maybe to anyone concerned about taking care of their brain. I wish someone would create a children's book using this information."
20,1598878735,http://goodreads.com/user/show/85873-aj-nolan,3,"Interesting and fast read. Touches on some of the same studies as other books of this type, and is a bit extroverted biased, but takes an interesting look at the role of myelin in creating talent, i.e. how forming the myelin coating on our neurons, we develop our talents, and thus the oft cited 10,000 hours mark to reach mastery at something - it takes 10,000 hours to fully develop a thick coating of myelin, and the thicker the coating, the faster the synapses fire, and the more ingrained a skill becomes. So, for the information on myelin alone, it is an interesting read. But, due to the variety of examples that Coyle looks at, and the rather slim size of the book, his focus on his examples is necessarily cursory and directed only at one objective, so I take his conclusions with a grain of salt (as I do with all popular market science writing, because that writing doesn't need to acknowledge the peer review process and inquiry of academic writing).

It's a great book that makes you rethink the way we perceive ""naturals"" or people born with ""talent."" I learned so much about ""deep practice"" and the way that's best to encourage kids with our words (""I can tell you're working so hard"" as opposed to ""sounds good""). I really think every parent should read this book. It's not that a person has a knack for something to be good at it. It opens up the world to anyone willing to work hard, paired with internal motivation and a great teacher! "

Ignition (the spark that lights a fire)2. Coaching (starts with motivation + transitions to ""how to do this"")3. Immense repetition and practice.This book is obviously useful for anyone doing any sort of coaching or training of other people, particularly in those competitive fields like tennis, golf, violin, piano, chess and others where a rock-solid understanding of the fundamentals is what matters.In more creative fields, it's less obvious what to do. There is no clear set of fundamentals to be mastered. In a lot of cases (writing an essay, producing a scientific theory, programming), there's not even an obvious sense in which one can be absolutely right. I wish there were more discussion about this -- but I think we just don't understand it well enough.As an aside, the closing of the book heralds the Oakland Raiders' drafting of JaMarcus Russell. What's funny though is that JaMarcus Russell, as prodigiously gifted as he was, ended up one of the biggest QB flops of all time. Turns out there's more to performance than mastery of the fundamentals -- it means nothing if you lack the discipline to attend practice regularly or the drive to learn all you can."
25,1598878735,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7277191-nathan-moore,4,"Coyle's premise is that the notion that people are born with natural talents is a myth. Talents are developed by hard work and deep practice. Coyle argues that the development of skills can be traced to the development of myelin, a wrapping of insulation around our neurons. The thicker the myelin, the more efficient the circuit.“All skills, all language, all music, all movements, are made of living circuits, and all circuits grow according to certain rules.”  (The Talent Code, pg 6)To develop skill operate at the edge of your ability. Make mistakes. Slow down. Correct errors. Try again.Deep practice is the process of repetition, chunking, and 'learning to feel it.' He encourages readers to try to practice in that zone just beyond comfort where mistakes are common and even welcome. While you want to focus on the struggle you must go deeper than that. You need to be deliberate about struggling. The pattern Coyle recommends is:1. Pick a target.2. Reach for it.3. Evaluate the gap between the target and the reach.4. Return to step one.“There is, biologically speaking, no substitute for attentive repetition. Nothing you can do—talking, thinking, reading, imagining—is more effective in building skill than executing the action, firing the impulse down the nerve fiber, fixing errors, honing the circuit.”  The Talent Code, page 87The other two primary factors Coyle argues for are Ignition and Master Coaching. These are helpful concepts, but I'll focus my reflections on what was most helpful for me, Deep Practice.I found Coyle's presentation of this material helpful. Its in the vein of Outliers: The Story of Success and in my opinion a helpful follow-up. While I'm in no position to evaluate Coyle's scientific claims I got the impression that he is far from an expert on myelin and its importance in skill development. Though this is a book written for a popular, non-scientific audience I'd be interested to hear from his critics.What's so helpful about this book is that it removes all excuses for good old fashioned, hard work. You want to get better at something. Just shut up and Practice, deeply. There's really something to be said for that, especially in a world where it seems like nearly everyone around you is incredibly talented in something you are not.My primary criticism of this book is that he focused mainly on skill development. The application of these principles is easily made to learning a any physical ability such as playing a musical instrument or playing a sport. But what about mastering history or chemistry? Most of our professions are a combination of skill and complex interactions with a vast body of information. Perhaps this is beyond the scope of his book, but he left me hungry for more.A good read. I'm going to read Make It Stick: The Science of Successful Learning next."

How would you know which button to push? This, in a nutshell, is the dilemma that the brain faces every day when it needs to learn something new. Coyle uses brain science to decode the processes that need to happen for great skill and expertise to emerge. It all starts with individual nerve fibers and myelin. As we fire and use nerve fibers repeatedly, we wrap the wonderful insulation of myelin around the nerves that need to get used the most. This makes the firing of those neurons faster and more powerful. As we learn a skill, myelin builds up around the requisite nerves and stays there to indicate mastery. As we age, the myelin slowly breaks down and the skills fade away, but there is good news that it can be rebuilt even in old age with the proper efforts. The author visited what he calls talent hotbeds all over the world- in Brazil, Russia, Curacao, and elsewhere to see where some of the most interesting sports surprises emerged from. He details some of the people he met and comes up with a formula for attaining top talent. First- he recommends something he calls deep practice, where you get in the zone between what you can do and what you want to do. Trial and error fine tunes the right actions and myelin builds up as skills build up. His teachers and their hotbeds show how taking in the whole, then chunking the skills into manageable portions gets students on the path to mastery. They repeat these chunks until they feel right, and then move on to the next chunk. Second- he talks about something called ignition, without which people give up before they can get there. The right kind of igniters, which he calls primal cues, can inspire people deep down and light a fire that entire nations can utilize. If you don't care, or don't think something is possible, you don't go through the painstaking trial and error phase. Once you have a vision and a purpose, you have what it takes. Thus talent isn't always about what you're born with. It needs to be inspired and nurtured. Third- the author recommends master coaching, which is easier to say than find. He points out some fantastic coaches who knew what each student needed and gave it to them at just the right time. This chapter is valuable for teachers at all levels. There are plenty of real-world examples, including an entire chapter on the KIPP charter school movement, and lots to think about for both students and would-be teachers.  All in all, a good book on how to become more talented in whatever you choose to pursue."
27,1598878735,http://goodreads.com/user/show/52406617-brad-revell,5,"We all have various definitions and theories on what talent really is. Coyle sees talent as the combination of deep practice, ignition and master coaching; this builds myelin which is the major focus of this book. In most articles or books I have read, the nervous system focuses on the synapse. Think of a synapse as the connection between the nerves and myelin as the insulation around the nerve. The greater the insulation around the nerve the more effective you can fire it and the faster it will travel to complete its task. You can build myelin in all tasks we do whether it is physical or mental. Coyle takes you on a journey on how to build, leverage and maintain myelin with many case studies such as athletes, musicians and business leaders.I was recommended this book by Tony Robbins. Robbins views myelin as one of the greater scientific discoveries of late and is attempting at accelerating the myelin build process in his own body. Knowing what I know about Robbins, this provides significant weight on how important this discovery is for humans. I would have liked to have read more on the science of myelin in this book. Other than that this is a worthwhile book to read!Three key takeaways from the book:1. Skill is myelin insulation that wraps neural circuits and that grows according to certain signals. Written differently: practice makes myelin and myelin makes perfect.2. Future belonging is a primal cue: a simple and direct signal that activates our built-in motivational triggers, funneling our energy and attention toward a goal. If you can leverage primal cues (e.g. future belonging, survival, hunger, thirst etc.) in achieving goals you have a much more likely chance of success. Talent requires deep practice, deep practice requires vast amounts of energy and primal cues trigger massive outpourings of energy.3. In a study, measuring self-discipline is twice as accurate as IQ in predicting a student's grade point average. "
28,1598878735,http://goodreads.com/user/show/67342966-dan-wedin,5,"In this book, in the face of conventional opinion, Daniel Coyle researched, studied and presented how talent isn't inherent and can be cultivated and grown. This gives us all hope and a formula on how to get really good at something, to put it simply. I love the quote below, and how it applies to The Talent Code.“Things are not always what they seem; the first appearance deceives many; the intelligence of a few perceives what has been carefully hidden.”― Phaedrus"
29,1598878735,http://goodreads.com/user/show/13827890-kevin,4,"An eye opener. Greatness is not born, it's grown. Great talents are cultivated in a step by step way. The book teaches you about 'deep practice', the way to help grow myelin, the substance that acts as an insulation around your neuron fibers to make them act like broadband circuits. Myelin coating helps build up your character, your skills and sharpen your talents. The author gives interesting examples to illustrate this point, picking sample personalities from fields of arts, music, soccer, basket ball and other sports, the way how they developed their skill in the respective fields. The book explores and unravels the 'Talent Code', a scientific explanation to great skills.You get enlightened with ideas of teaching how to grow up mechanisms to nurture skills and talents, and you get an excellent understanding about the theory behind applying the right techniques to achieve the objective. An excellent hand book and guide to teachers and students, and obviously parents."
30,1598878735,http://goodreads.com/user/show/81026067-shravan-venkataraman,5,"This is a brilliant book that expands on the 10000 hour rule by quoting real life examples of talent hotbeds in which talents are nurtured and not born by nature. Talent as such, the ones we believe to be innate are probably not really that innate and can be obtained through conscious effort. This is what the author calls Deep Practice. Similar to Deep Work, but this is slightly different. He then goes on to explain the examples of deep practice across several fields from sports to education, and concludes with a bang. More on these lines, you must read ""Mastery"" by George Leonard and ""Mastery"" by Robert Greene. The latter is punchy and effective, the former is a slow burn. Both books are in-depth and much more explanatory of the process it takes towards mastering a particular craft, be it tennis or violin. An amazing read. "

This was both a fascinating and inspiring read. Fascinating, to look back on the ""gifted program"" I was put into in elementary school and the classical music training of my teenage years and see myelin played a role and was harnessed --or not-- in different ways. Inspiring, because with all the Gibson stories my girlhood friends and I wrote, there is apparently no reason why we can't pick up where we left off and become the next Bronte sisters. ;)This would be an excellent read for teachers, parents, or just any ol person working on developing a skillset"
32,1598878735,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3239706-gordon,5,"This is a great book for anyone. If you are a teacher, a professor, or a coach, it is a must. The basic premise is that world class talent is the function of proven steps - ignition (motivation with vision - externally or self-induced), deep practice (slow, deliberate, repetition, error-focused), and master coaching (individualized, information-specific). Suprisingly Dan Coyle proves that skill is physically visible and the result of a natural occurring material called myelin which wraps the neural circuits involved in a particular mental or physical process. The thicker the myelin the more efficient the neural circuitry that supports the execution of a complex skill. A lovely read with infinite applications in education, arts, sports, business and military."
33,1598878735,http://goodreads.com/user/show/17590667-ekaterina-kachalina,2,"The only curious thing that can be found in this book is a weird idea about what good coaching is. Look at this: “The way I look at it, everybody's life is a bowl of whipped cream and shit, and my job is to even things out. If a kid's got a lot of shit in his life, I'm going to stir in some whipped cream. If a kid's life is pure whipped cream, then I'm going to stir in some shit.” So, this is probably a book about not less than the newest incarnation. Oh, and also about zombies — children in the KIPP program, who have to work hard to deserve some desks for their classroom, and whose only dream is not to live a life, but to enter the college. Also, I hope never to hear again the word “myelin”."

The book was referenced in Deep Work as introducing Myelin as a key ingredient for accelerating skills. First of all what is Myelin?The definition of myelin isa mixture of proteins and phospholipids forming a whitish insulating sheath around many nerve fibers, increasing the speed at which impulses are conducted.This is the so called ""white matter"" in the brain where the other part is the neurons. From a purely biological perspective, as more neurons ""fire together"" they get this insulation around the nerve fibers, thereby increasing how fast they can fire together. The brain isn't ""wiring the neurons together"" so much as it's building a highway between them so that they fire faster and more efficiently.The book is broken into 3 parts: deep practice, ignition, and master coachingDeep Practice is analogous to what Cal Newport talks in Deep Work but I think the treatment Coyle has done is lot better. Essentially this is the kind of practice that focuses on deeply thinking about what you are doing and improving. Some of the best trainers and teachers have mastered this technique. The training comes later but the author gives examples of what drives the Brazilians, various russian tennis stars post-Kuornikova, and female South Korean Golfers. It's the ability to practice deeply, focus on improving on errors and doing better. When you're practicing a sport or craft at world class level, you have to watch and improve at every point.Ignition This is key in providing the driving motivator for the group. It could be something explicit like Andruw Jones' homeruns for the Curaçao little league sucess, or something more implicit like why were there so many great top notch artists during a short time in the Renaissance? Hint: they got exposed to tons of other great artists around them, and consequently great arts being created. This provided the fuel for a lot of the artists during this era.Master Coach A good coach that facilitates deep practice is highly important. I like the distinction between the approaches that Coyle points out -- the laconic futsal coach who rarely interrupts a game or a Suzuki technique violin instructor who is constantly adjusting. Skills like soccer, writing, and comedy are flexible-circuit skills, meaning that they require us to grow vast ivy-vine circuits that we can flick through to navigate an ever-changing set of obstacles. Playing violin, golf, gymnastics, and figure skating, on the other hand, are consistent-circuit skills, depending utterly on a solid foundation of technique that enables us to reliably re-create the fundamentals of an ideal performance. This has been interesting to me on my practices of different kinds too. While writing and programming needed a few pointers, I have struggled with activities like Guitar, martial arts, rock climbing without constant training and readjustments. All in all, I think this is a good companion book to books like Peak, Deep Work and helps elucidate a deeper understanding of what drives skill building and how to do it."

Maybe it would help if I choose an activity to improve my abilities.http://www.popularscience.co.uk/revie...Method is most useful for low creativity action, such as sports and music playing.http://www.thesimplerlife.net/2010/05...Coyle identifies three keys to “cracking” the talent code; what he calls deep practice, ignition, and master coaching.Deep Practice: **Slow, chunked practice rather than mindless repetition. Deliberate Practice. Setting specific goals, obtaining immediate feedback and concentrating as much on technique as on outcome.allows myelin to wrap your nerves.first “chunk” up the information. Put in another way, you must take it “one step at a time.” see the entirety, break it up to chunks, and sow it way down. You always need feedback, though. second rule of deep practice is repetition. As you begin to master the individual chunks of a skill, repeating it allows you to build speed and efficiency. Myelin builds and decays. Practice will maintain myelin.Lastly, Coyle says that you must “learn to feel it” if you expect to practice deeply. You can think of this as quality of practice or attention to detail. *It is useless to practice if unnoticed errors are being made.Ignition: Find & identify with a role model or superstar. See that it is possible, like the four minute mile. ""If he can do it, why can't I?""Ignition is the term Coyle uses for the motivation to become a world class talent. To become world class at anything **requires an extremely high level of commitment and passion**. Some sort of ignition is required to get that fire burning. The most interesting type of ignition is what Coyle calls the HSE (Holy Shit Effect). This can best be seen when a trailblazer accomplishes something remarkable on a world stage. For example, South Korean golfer Se Ri Pak won the LPGA Championship in 1998. At that time she was the ONLY South Korean golfer on the LPGA Tour. In 2007 there were 33. The same could be said about Russian tennis players (3 ranked in the top 100 in 1998, 15 in 2007). In each case young people from the champion’s country were ignited by their success. They saw someone who looked like them, talked like them, and was from the same area as them succeed on an extreme level and thought, “Holy shit, that could be me.”Master Coaching: The third component of unlocking talent is the role of coaching. Master coaches are the people behind the scenes that are driving the talent hotbeds around the world. They tend to be older, perceptive, deliver information to their students in short bursts, and even tend to be somewhat theatrical. However, not all master coaches fall into this pattern as a lot of their style depends on what they are coaching. For example, Brazilian soccer coaches are much more quiet than their classical music counterparts. In the end, these master coaches guide their ignited students and teach them how to practice deeply."
45,1598878735,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2704273-drew-johnson,5,"This is a great book for anyone wanting to understand the basic science behind skill development in an easy to follow read. It describes the underlying mechanics of what we typically refer to as muscle memory or automaticity in some fun and interesting case studies of talent development. It covers everything from Russian tennis players, Brazilian soccer players, the Bronte Sisters, to violinists. It also looks at bursts of development in Athens, Florence and London. The basic premise is talent is not born, its grown. Three simple facts: 1) Every human movement or feeling is an electric signal traveling through a chain of neurons—a circuit of fibers. 2) Myelin is the insulation that wraps the nerve fibers which increases signal strength, speed and accuracy 3) The more we fire a particular circuit the more myelin optimizes that circuit and the better our movements and thoughts become. Skill is cellular insulation (myelin) that wraps neural circuits and that grows in response to certain signals. Practicing at the edge of one’s ability—deep practice—is the most effective form of skill development. Making and correcting errors is where we develop most—mistake focused practice. That creates more myelin around the circuit making the response faster, more fluent and automatic. This book debunks the “natural talent/genius” mindset and references some of the same science Gladwell describes in Outliers in discussing the 10,000 hour rule of expertise development. To become and expert requires lengthy practice at the edge of our ability which only occurs if we love what we are practicing. There is some interesting discussion that I think relates to the “natural man” referred to by Mosiah and our ability to develop our spiritual reflexes and instincts—creating myelin around nerve fibers that lead to good behaviors instead of “natural man” behaviors. We don’t have to be animalistic or succumb to basic urges. What triggers deep practice? Some basic Ignition which are typically primal ques. Talent requires deep practice, deep practice requires vast amounts of energy, primal cues (belonging, not being safe) can trigger vast amounts of energy. To develop or coach we need to affirm struggle and work, not affirm intellect or natural talentSelf discipline measures are twice as likely predictors of academic success than IQ As a coach, love is more important than technical skill. Coaches effectiveness is finding the edge of an individual’s capability. Same concept applied to neurosis and other forms of psychological issues. Pay attention to what your children are fascinated by and praise them for their effort. Nerve fibers/circuits=wires connected to synapses"
46,1598878735,http://goodreads.com/user/show/33821838-nina-voelker,4,"I am fascinated by human consciousness and how it determines optimal human experience. I read about it from every perspective, most recently its correlation with genius. Every book I've read challenges the myth that genius is genetic versus cultivated. The Talent Code explores the neuroscience behind world-class practitioners in various fields and provides the strategies that each of us may apply.""The talent code is built on revolutionary scientific discoveries involving a neural insulator called myelin, which some neurologists now consider to be the holy grail of acquiring skill. Here's why. Every human skill, whether it's playing baseball or playing Bach, is created by chains of nerve fibers carrying a tiny electrical impulse—basically, a signal traveling through a circuit. Myelin's vital role is to wrap those nerve fibers the same way that rubber insulation wraps a copper wire, making the signal stronger and faster by preventing the electrical impulses from leaking out. When we fire our circuits in the right way—when we practice swinging that bat or playing that note—our myelin responds by wrapping layers of insulation around that neural circuit, each new layer adding a bit more skill and speed. The thicker the myelin gets, the better it insulates, and the faster and more accurate our movements and thoughts become. Myelin is important for several reasons. It's universal: everyone can grow it, most swiftly during childhood but also throughout life. It's indiscriminate: its growth enables all manner of skills, mental and physical. It's imperceptible: we can't see it or feel it, and we can sense its increase only by its magical-seeming effects. Most of all, however, myelin is important because it provides us with a vivid new model for understanding skill. Skill is a cellular insulation that wraps neural circuits and that grows in response to certain signals. The more time and energy you put into the right kind of practice—the longer you stay in the Clarissa zone, firing the right signals through your circuits—the more skill you get, or, to put it a slightly different way, the more myelin you earn. All skill acquisitions, and therefore all talent hotbeds, operate on the same principles of action, no matter how different they may appear to us."" "

During some of my yoga teacher training, we learned a fair bit about anatomy as well as some very cool neuroscience. This author takes a bit of neuroscience (about myelin wrapping around neural circuits) and then presents stories behind scientific studies. His premise is ""Skill is insulation that wraps neural circuits and grows according to certain signals."" And he breaks it down to three key attributes that must be present: deep practice, ignition, and master coaching.The first attribute is, basically, that practice makes perfect. Yes, the dull, repetitive, deep practice is actually hard-wiring your brain to do an activity better. His explanation of this also reminds me yoga and mediation, particularly when he talks about the idea of the sweet spot. ""That productive, uncomfortable terrain located just beyond our current abilities, where our reach exceeds our grasp."" That is the place we have to learn to feel, to stay, if we want to recognize when we get it right. Later in the book, the author repeats something said by an interview subject. He says that the key to learning a new skill means ""people have to linger in that uncomfortable area, learn to tolerate the anxiety. If you practice, you can get to the level you want."" Next is ignition: a spark that sets you aflame. The author outlines a study showing that talent or ability are NOT innate, that ""[w]hat ignited the progress wasn't any innate skill or gene. It was a small, ephemeral, yet powerful idea: a vision of their ideal future selves, a vision that oriented, energized, and accelerated progress, and that originated in the outside world.""Finally, master coaching: the relationship between the learner--and potential super talent--and her teacher. The author is clear that master coaching is ""more art than science. It exists in the space between two people, in the warm, messy game of language, gesture, and expression."" I would recommend this book to teachers and parents and coaches. An absolutely fascinating read. "
49,1598878735,http://goodreads.com/user/show/13024317-asma,3,"An interesting book that as it's title suggests talks about how talent is created; scientifically speaking how myelin wraps around nerves.Coyle believes that all skills (playing music, playing football, being a genius in math or reading, even being sociable......) are just a set of instructions stored in our brains, and the more they're practiced, the more their respective circuits fire, and that is how those skills become natural to us.The book also explains in simple scientific terms a number of our daily observations: Why practice makes perfect! Why chunk-ing out activities and breaking them to smaller tasks is a good practice! Why making mistakes is important! Why we become wiser as we get older! why we move slower as we age!...etc.I loved the beginning if the book waaay more than towards the end. As the book progressed, the writer started repeating some previously-mentioned ideas, and in some cases he stopped making sense.To be honest most of the book's ideas were supported with interesting success stories, since the writer traveled to more than nine talent hotbeds and got to examine talent firsthand. Those stories held a lot of inspiration, Yes! Yet, I hated the over positive tone of the writer; how he seemed completely SURE and CONFIDENT of everything he concluded, though his ""findings"" were based on research on relatively small samples. Plus there were some minor contradictions here and there.Overall I liked the book, It had more good interesting thoughts, stories and suggested practices than anything else. moreover the flow was excellent; starting with talent, moving back to deep practice, a little back to ignition, then to the source of talent (inspiration and coaching).I started reading this book because I had to write a critical review of the first chapter, which was the most enjoyable, I have to say! (will post my critical review article later)."
50,1598878735,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4595614-carter-richardson,4," Its interesting. The author travels around the world to find talent ""hotspots"". A talent hotpot is a place or time where talent is grown rapidly, this could be triggered by the activity or length of time the activity is being performed. Daniel Coyle traveled to Brazil to find a soccer talent hotspot. He uncovered that there wasn't a specific drill or place where the talent is made, but the usage of a small heavy ball rapidly increases the skill in the player. This is called futsal. Futsal, widely used in South American countries has proven to be the difference-maker. So what could the secret to all the talent producing hot-spots? Its a white substance called myelin. Myelin wraps around the circuits of the brain that send the synapses to the parts of the body, telling the muscles what to do. The more myelin you have the better the circuit is insulated, making the skill that you perform mor precice and as a result, better.  There is also a specific type of practice that you have to perform to get really good at an activity. This special type is called ""deep practice"". Deep practice is doing something that you can barely do to the best of your ability, if you do this type of this practice for a long period of time you will become an expert of sport (this long period of time happens to be 10,000 hours of deep practice). This 10,000 hour rule doesn't really mean anything unless the majority of the practice is deep practice. If you just half-ass practice for 10,000 hours you wont get very far because you aren't challenging yourself to do things that you can't do very well, so you're not getting a lot better.

In the book, the author outlines techniques used by master coaches and teachers, like ""learning in chunks"" while gradually increasing the difficulty while providing positive feedback. Excerpt from Wikipedia on myelin:""Myelin is a dielectric (electrically insulating) material that forms a layer, the myelin sheath, usually around only the axon of a neuron. It is essential for the proper functioning of the nervous system. It is an outgrowth of a type of glial cell. The production of the myelin sheath is called myelination. In humans, the production of myelin begins in the 14th week of fetal development, although little myelin exists in the brain at the time of birth. During infancy, myelination occurs quickly and continues through the adolescent stages of life.""I have read about other brain theory, such as the social influence of Oxytocin in ""The Moral Molecule"" by Paul Zak, and the importance of the 6-layered cerebral cortex in higher function learning through prediction in ""On Intelligence"" by Jeff Hawkins, and ""How the Mind Works"" by Steven Pinker. ""The Talent Code"" adds another spin to the adaptive learning power of the human brain, crediting the plasticity of myelin.The more I read about what we know about the brain, the more I realize we DON'T know. I look forward to keeping abreast of developments in this captivating field. I recommended The Talent Code to anyone interested in learning another angle of how the brain works."

His main premiss is that you must have the passion to practice deeply (slowly, making mistakes and correcting them, being highly disciplined along with perfected execution of your sports movements doing all this for approx. 10,000 hrs to get to the pro level. He reveals many cases where what you'd think would be the case isn't, he speaks about a substance called myelin in our bodies that increases our bodies ability to fire more rapid, the impulses that go to our brain, from the areas of the body that we work with over and over. This he maintains is why those who put out the effort are the ones we call born superstars but they really are just normal people who do the most work.  There are many questions I had about the book that he didn't answer and I don't know if I'd buy it all but it was interesting to read and already I have started to train my daughter this way in basketball, I figure if It's good for professionals its good for anyone who wants to get better. For those wondering if you need specialized knowledge to understand it, you don't!"
53,1598878735,http://goodreads.com/user/show/24673004-david-b,3,"Citing recent discoveries in neuroscience regarding the importance of myelin, Daniel Coyle makes a persuasive case for what many of us already knew: many hours of dedicated practice under the tutelage of a teacher or coach who can individualize instruction allows a student to reach their fullest potential. As a teacher, I appreciate the validation, but Coyle's approach seems a little like utilizing a new branch of mathematics to prove that the Earth is round.Nevertheless, I enjoyed this book and appreciate it for preaching the gospel of hard work. It is almost entirely anecdotal, but at least the anecdotes are interesting. Coyle's style is a bit too breathless and excited, and it is impossible to escape the feeling that one is being sold a bill of goods, but when that bill of goods turns out to be the message ""buckle down and persevere,"" I can't complain too much. Coyle's anecdotes support his thesis best when they are drawn from the world of sports; they are less convincing when they are drawn from the success stories of pop music stars. I'm not sure we all agree that Jessica Simpson represents the epitome of fine vocalization; her superstardom relies at least as much on the production and promotion of her music and the fact that she was blessed with a pretty face. "
54,1598878735,http://goodreads.com/user/show/26150006-elizabeth-elzburg,5,"I think that The Talent Code is a book that should be read by everyone who is a current or aspiring coach/teacher. It's a book full of scientifically backed and field-tested information on the cultivation of skill. Now, if you’re not interested in being able to effectively pass these concepts onto others (aka you’re not a coach/teacher) then this book will also be useful to you, because the science is self-applicable. It's just that it's also extremely useful information for people in those positions.This book walks you through each of the crucial components of the acquisition of skill through the author's journeys around the world as he was finding out these things himself. You join Daniel Coyle as he travels to numerous “talent hotbeds”--places that see enormous levels of skill growth--and talks with the people there, researchers, scientists, and psychologists, to find out exactly what makes the people in these hotbeds so successful. Along the way the answer becomes more and more apparent, and as a reader you start seeing how the concepts apply to your own everyday life, and your own goals and skills. And this is something I encourage--Take notes and connect while you’re reading, so that you can actually apply these findings to your everyday life."
55,1598878735,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3132060-andrea-james,3,"This is a fun and entertaining book and I would have given it more stars had it been more thorough in its unlocking of the secret. There is explanation of myelin, the importance of deliberate practice and the author also gives anecdotal examples of how it has been applied. However the examples were really short snippets that lacked detail in exactly what was done and the steps of how we can apply deliberate practice in a number of areas.It would have been helpful to have a section going through a handful of examples in depth, perhaps one sport, one music and one academic example. The author did mention that there are a host of ways in which deliberate practice is carried out and highlighted the difference between the simplicity of Futsal and the Suzuki method of teaching violin for instance.Maybe I'm just a little frustrated because I am inspired to learn better but I don't have a master coach (can't really afford one right now) and I'm not sure exactly how to get started.If you are looking for a quick, light and interesting read (with perhaps some broad generalisations and cherry-picked examples), then this book is worth a read."
56,1598878735,http://goodreads.com/user/show/33432310-manoj-gubbala,3,"Coyle does a nice job of giving you a formula to developing skill. He shows how many commonly known famous figures followed this formula without even knowing it. He shows you that you really can get yourself to learn anything; that the mind is truly limitless and it all lies within your reach. Your brain is muscle that uses MYELIN, so work it like you do with another part of your body. Myelin is heavily talked about, in fact the first third of the book is dedicated to it. In short, ""skill is insulation that wraps neural circuits (myelin) and grows according to certain signals"". As he emphasizes, baby steps are key and fixing errors on the way is essential. Life is about your mind and body together, so don't just train one of them, but both. Find a motivation/philosophy (Ignition) then add it with deep practice, meaning really thinking and fixing your errors, and then find a coach/mentor to help you. These three things will accelerate your path to obtaining your desired skill or goal. Great book! It gets boring in the middle and at some parts, but power through and you will find a lot of useful information."
57,1598878735,http://goodreads.com/user/show/86215-pat,2,"Daniel Coyle talks about myelin the way Paul Ryan talks about block grants (like someone with an agenda and a tenuous grasp on the mechanism behind what they're selling).For the twenty-ish (?) pages he actually spends talking about the myelination process and how it builds superhighways for specific actions in our brain, the book is interesting and believable. And then he disappears to a soap box and proclaims that every soccer star or pop singer is myelinating their myelination with myelicious myeletivity. It comes off as a guy who read a Wikipedia article about brain science and then sprinkled it throughout an otherwise decent book just to give it an air of scientific authority.It would've been a 3-star book because anything about learning and talent is 5-star content and getting close to a decent description of a key facet gets you a decent score from me. But when the cherry on top of your ode to myelin is a three page run-down on the upside of JaMarcus Russell (consistently ranked as the worst NFL draft bust of all time) you're asking me to write off this book as unsalvageable."
58,1598878735,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4217432-eduardo,4,"Danyel Coyle does an interesting work about deep practice. If you have to spend some time practicing something to really mastered, you need to do it in a specific way. The book is a divide into three parts. The first one is devoted to deeply practiced process and his implications. The second one mentions the power of the ""mindset"" to borrow the now famous concept. Finally, the third part references the coaching process. After all the 10.000 hours buzz, I found Coyle approximation to deep practice, easy to follow and elaborated enough to recommend his lecture. The other part of the book referred to ""ignition"" is not that elaborated. On the other side, all the readers that have been following Dweck work will follow through in an easy way. Later Coyle goes back to different techniques used for the best mentors out there. Given the variety of disciplines, is not really a manual of how to be a good mentor, but definitely set the tone of the qualities that good mentors share. "
59,1598878735,http://goodreads.com/user/show/23224955-rajiv-chopra,4,"All in all, I will call this a very good book. Daniel does downplay the role of talent. While this is indeed very good, there is a danger that people may believe that talent has no role in achieving greatness. People do indeed have a propensity for one field over another. However, the role that deliberate learning has to play is nicely detailed. I like the section on coaching as well. This is very good. What I also liked, were his very honest comments, on his impressions about KIPP. It is a rare author who does this. The sections on myelin are good. However, there were times when I thought that Daniel was a bit obsessed with myelin, and its effects. There is good evidence (maybe because of myelin) to indicate that continued learning into old age is a good way to stay young!I would like to read a second, maybe deeper book, on the subjects of deliberate learning and coaching. This book served as a good introduction."
60,1598878735,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1353076-mike,4,"It has an interesting take on talent, but it basically breaks down into the regular ""practice makes you better"" kind of idea. However, he modifies it to be ""deep practice produces talent.""As far as the writing goes, it's not bad. He gives good illustrations of his points and spells things out fairly clearly. I never felt the writing get dull.I do have two gripes about the book. One is the title - is this playing off of a Dan Brown title to sell more?The other problem is that he ignores the thought that people might have a genetic advantage for certain things. Maybe he's right and everyone build myelin the same way. However, there could be genetics that allow some people to build it faster."
61,1598878735,http://goodreads.com/user/show/811417-tiffany,5,"Every parent, coach, teacher, athlete, and musician (okay, let's just say everybody) should read this book. It debunks the idea of inherent talent, instead laying out evidence in favor of deep practice, ignition, and good coaching when it comes to any sort of talent-based process. It takes Amy Chua's Tiger Mother and gives a specified, humane spin on how to grow cognitive ability. It has totally changed the way I guide my kids through their music practice, schoolwork, athletics and spirituality.It also helps that it's incredibly readable, full of fascinating anecdotes, and impeccably written.

It's exciting to think that we can change our brains by how we spend our time. The book coins words to describe talent and practice that I have now adopted and use in my paradigm.The book also prompted me to give my 14-year-old the option to continue piano or not. He chose not.I'm not sure if that was the right thing to do, but from what I learned in this book, if my son doesn't think he's going to use piano-playing skill in his life he's not going to learn much, no matter how long I force him to practice. The writing was good, the analogies and metaphors exceptionally apt. I would definitely read other books by this author."

Need to be ignited by something (eg. Chinese basketballers by Yao Ming) and coaching is very important (coaches should NOT be treating everyone equally - some people need more praises whilst others need less), simple and to-the-point phrases may be better than empty motivational speeches. Could have done with more examples tho that weren't sports or music focused. Like what about technology? Science? Law?I liked the part where he mentioned getting tested 3x a week is more efficient than revising every day, but tbh my brain is so mushy rn that I can't train it to work hard and think for itself anymore."

It hints at an element of reverse psychology, intensive training, looks at the south korean phenomenon of great golfers in the 00s and then tennis in russia and small music school which spawned Beyonce and Jessica Simpson. Its appears a bit optimistic in its application across cultures and the examples appear hand picked a bit, I would not imagine trying these sorts of training techniques in some circumstances. Ultimately, you are creating drive and motivation to do something that the participant may otherwise lose interest in. I enjoyed the Brazilian soccer example and the Kurosaw (excuse spelling) baseball example. Its something i will continue to refer back to in my career. "
65,1598878735,http://goodreads.com/user/show/16903158-nuno-miguel,5,"Daniel Coyle makes the case for the idea that geniuses are, mostly, grown, not born. It dwells around the fundamental role of myelin in strengthening neural pathways and connections, effectively consolidating knowledge. Myelin production is not an easy nor a quick process, it is demanding, it takes deliberate, focused and repetitive practice in order to be effective. To do this, one needs vast amounts of energy - energy that can be ignited - and, ideally, a master that can provide feedback and pinpoint the exact improvements/corrections that should be applied, accelerating enormously the process.Another work that praises nurture over nature. I like the idea, despite accepting genetic inheritance: yes, potential may be limited, but where exactly is the limit?Recommended!"

No, ""São Paolo"" is not an alternate spelling, it's a misspelling. I feel comfortable stating this unequivocally because I lived there for a considerable number of years, and it's the closest thing to a home town that I have. Also, when he was listing celebrities who lost a parent at an early age, he mentioned Eddie Izzard losing his father...but Izzard lost his mother, not his father (Izzard has mentioned this in his stand-up, as well as in his autobiography).

Any reader who (like me) is in the teaching or coaching field will come away with some new approaches to consider.

(Which, if you know me, is quite extraordinary.) The book’s message (that skill is first and foremost learnable, not something we are born with) changed my outlook on life, and thus changed my life itself. The problem with the book (which at the time I didn’t notice) is its simplistic portrait of skill acquisition and a hyperfocus on myelin as the talent maker.All in all, recommended for someone who doesn’t believe in the message, but preferably after some critical thinking and scepticism books.

In short the only useful advice one can get from the book is ""talent is not born, it is via hardword and passion"" which is a conventional wisdom in any culture.Could have been 5 star if it had just focused solely on the secret or science behind the development of talent and not trying to mix in some self-help elements."

I never felt the writing get dull.I do have two gripes about the book. One is the title - is this playing off of a Dan Brown title to sell more?The other problem is that he ignores the thought that people might have a genetic advantage for certain things.

It takes Amy Chua's Tiger Mother and gives a specified, humane spin on how to grow cognitive ability. It has totally changed the way I guide my kids through their music practice, schoolwork, athletics and spirituality.It also helps that it's incredibly readable, full of fascinating anecdotes, and impeccably written.

The book coins words to describe talent and practice that I have now adopted and use in my paradigm.The book also prompted me to give my 14-year-old the option to continue piano or not. He chose not.I'm not sure if that was the right thing to do, but from what I learned in this book, if my son doesn't think he's going to use piano-playing skill in his life he's not going to learn much, no matter how long I force him to practice.

It takes Amy Chua's Tiger Mother and gives a specified, humane spin on how to grow cognitive ability.

He chose not.I'm not sure if that was the right thing to do, but from what I learned in this book, if my son doesn't think he's going to use piano-playing skill in his life he's not going to learn much, no matter how long I force him to practice.

Any reader who (like me) is in the teaching or coaching field will come away with some new approaches to consider.

(Which, if you know me, is quite extraordinary.) The book’s message (that skill is first and foremost learnable, not something we are born with) changed my outlook on life, and thus changed my life itself. The problem with the book (which at the time I didn’t notice) is its simplistic portrait of skill acquisition and a hyperfocus on myelin as the talent maker.All in all, recommended for someone who doesn’t believe in the message, but preferably after some critical thinking and scepticism books. And do warn them to take the neuroscience of this book with a BIG grain of salt."

In short the only useful advice one can get from the book is ""talent is not born, it is via hardword and passion"" which is a conventional wisdom in any culture.Could have been 5 star if it had just focused solely on the secret or science behind the development of talent and not trying to mix in some self-help elements."

I never felt the writing get dull.I do have two gripes about the book. One is the title - is this playing off of a Dan Brown title to sell more?The other problem is that he ignores the thought that people might have a genetic advantage for certain things.

It debunks the idea of inherent talent, instead laying out evidence in favor of deep practice, ignition, and good coaching when it comes to any sort of talent-based process. It takes Amy Chua's Tiger Mother and gives a specified, humane spin on how to grow cognitive ability. It has totally changed the way I guide my kids through their music practice, schoolwork, athletics and spirituality.It also helps that it's incredibly readable, full of fascinating anecdotes, and impeccably written.

It's exciting to think that we can change our brains by how we spend our time. The book coins words to describe talent and practice that I have now adopted and use in my paradigm.The book also prompted me to give my 14-year-old the option to continue piano or not. He chose not.I'm not sure if that was the right thing to do, but from what I learned in this book, if my son doesn't think he's going to use piano-playing skill in his life he's not going to learn much, no matter how long I force him to practice. The writing was good, the analogies and metaphors exceptionally apt. I would definitely read other books by this author."

Need to be ignited by something (eg. Chinese basketballers by Yao Ming) and coaching is very important (coaches should NOT be treating everyone equally - some people need more praises whilst others need less), simple and to-the-point phrases may be better than empty motivational speeches. Could have done with more examples tho that weren't sports or music focused. Like what about technology? Science? Law?I liked the part where he mentioned getting tested 3x a week is more efficient than revising every day, but tbh my brain is so mushy rn that I can't train it to work hard and think for itself anymore."

Its appears a bit optimistic in its application across cultures and the examples appear hand picked a bit, I would not imagine trying these sorts of training techniques in some circumstances. Ultimately, you are creating drive and motivation to do something that the participant may otherwise lose interest in.

It dwells around the fundamental role of myelin in strengthening neural pathways and connections, effectively consolidating knowledge. Myelin production is not an easy nor a quick process, it is demanding, it takes deliberate, focused and repetitive practice in order to be effective. To do this, one needs vast amounts of energy - energy that can be ignited - and, ideally, a master that can provide feedback and pinpoint the exact improvements/corrections that should be applied, accelerating enormously the process.Another work that praises nurture over nature. I like the idea, despite accepting genetic inheritance: yes, potential may be limited, but where exactly is the limit?Recommended!"

I feel comfortable stating this unequivocally because I lived there for a considerable number of years, and it's the closest thing to a home town that I have.
