1,0142004464,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2436371-dennis-littrell,3,"Trying to elucidate a difficult subjectScience writer Charles Seife, author of the award-wining Zero: The Biography of a Dangerous Idea (2000), begins with two chapters on pre-modern cosmology followed by a chapter on Hubble's discovery of the expansion of the universe using the new 100-inch telescope placed atop Mount Wilson in 1917. Seife sees Hubble's discovery as ""The Second Cosmological Revolution."" In Chapter Four we learn, thanks in part to the Hubble Space Telescope, that the Hubble constant is not so constant after all and is indeed larger today than it was in the past. Conclusion: the universe is not only expanding, but is accelerating in its expansion. Seife calls this ""The Third Cosmological Revolution."" The chapter is subtitled, ""The Universe Amok.""Maybe the universe is indeed running amok, or maybe it's the astrophysicists and cosmologists themselves who are possessed. Too much data too soon may have untoward consequences, especially when one is feeling about in the dark with limited instruments focused on an immensity perhaps beyond human comprehension.First there is the problem of the so-called dark matter. With the curvature of the universe at one, meaning that it will expand forever and eventually after many an eon die a cold and lonely death, there will be no big crunch, no bounce, and no time reversal. This is okay. However, when cosmologists go looking for the correct amount of matter and energy to support this flat curvature they come up a little short. About ninety percent short, in fact. In other words nearly all that there is, is not only invisible to our perception, it is completely mysterious except that it does indeed influence gravitationally the rest of the stuff in the universe. As Seife explains, the stars in a galaxy as they rotate around the galactic center are not moving in concert with Newtonian (or Einsteinian) motion; instead the stars furthest from the center are moving at about the same speed as those near the center, an impossibility.What to do about this? Cosmologists have postulated some ""dark matter"" surrounding galaxies like a halo. With just the right amount of dark matter (again approximately a whopping nine times that observed) the speed of the stars is nicely accounted for. There is another solution: reject Newtonian/Einsteinian dynamics. That (as radical an idea as one would like to entertain) has been tried and, as Seife notes, it has failed. (See p. 100) Furthermore, as Seife observes in ""Darker Still"" (Chapter 7), this invisible stuff cannot be all ordinary (baryonic) matter. It has to be of some ""exotic"" variety that we can't identify.Okay, let's put the dark matter conundrum on hold and look at the next problem: something from nothing. It appears that, due to the uncertainty principle from quantum mechanics, there is no such thing as nothing. That is, matter is probabilistically jumping in and out of existence down near the Planck level in the ""foam"" regardless of how complete the vacuum. Indeed, some theorists have imagined whole universes popping randomly out of...what? It would appear that underneath, beneath, inside of--what?--there is, like an unfelt cauldron beneath our feet or inside the very fabric of space/time, something unimaginably immense and/or unimaginably tiny.This ""zero point energy"" is now being postulated as the source of Einstein's cosmological constant (lambda) that is expanding the universe. Lambda was once thought to be an error; now ""omega sub lambda"" is thought to equal 65% of the matter/energy in the universe. Hello!Seife's book suffers from that familiar plague on the house of popular science writers: trying to explain mathematical ideas without using mathematics, and trying to explain particle physics and quantum mechanics to people who haven't been trained in those sciences. One must rely on analogy and metaphor. Naturally using such devices things can make things even fuzzier than they already are. Also there is some inexactness in Seife's expression employed for what he calls ""the sake of clarity.""Sometimes Seife's metaphors reduce to something close to meaningless, as in his ice cream-flavor-slurping hydrogen atoms from page 179. Such metaphors can send chills down the spine of some scientists, and they can mislead. A slightly different example is his statement that ""the Heisenberg uncertainty principle forces nature to create and destroy...particles that appear out of nowhere...in the deepest vacuum."" (p. 185) Not to disparage the uncertainty principle, but it is ""nature"" that is doing the forcing and not the other way around. Heisenberg's uncertainty principle is a way of explaining to ourselves what is observed (or not observed, as the case may be).At other times Seife leaps from the uncertainty of a strained metaphor to runaway dramatics, as on page 183 where we find this: ""once scientists figure out what lambda really is, they will have unraveled the deepest mystery in physics today...[they will] understand...[what] drove the big bang itself...They will see beyond even the era of the quark-gluon plasma...to a time when the quantum vacuum held the fate of the universe in its grasp.""As for Seife's several attempts at witticism, I will give him a Cheshire cat's smile and applause to extend for the entire half-life of a virtual particle in the foam of space.Okay, okay. Writing science that is both fair to the science and explicable to nonscientists is no easy task. I don't think Seife is as successful here as he was in ""Zero,"" especially because the writing gets a little beclouded in the latter parts of the book but also because I have the sense that Seife is not as comfortable with physics as he is with mathematics. What is clear is just how removed even well-educated and knowledgeable laypersons are from the cutting edge of physics. Still this is an attractive book that added to my knowledge of cosmology. --Dennis Littrell, author of “The World Is Not as We Think It Is”"

3,0142004464,http://goodreads.com/user/show/425441-peter,5,"Very cleanly written investigation into the scientific understanding of the Big Bang (as of 2001), and how the conditions set up by the beginning of the universe also define how the universe will end. While the book is cosmological in scope, the nature of the Big Bang as an infinitely powerful event in an infinitely tiny space, means we get a nice discussion of quantum mechanics as well. I learned quite a lot from this book, and was a great pleasure to read. "
4,0142004464,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11644141-kristen-luppino,5,"I love this book. These days it's a little dated, but I started reading it back right after it came out and have been slowly going through it since then. Seife uses analogies to explain some of the most difficult cosmological concepts. I only hope he does and updated version now that the Higgs boson particle has been indirectly observed, and I am emailing him currently to ask him for so much!"
5,0142004464,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2201886-mike,4,"Really thorough and well-written. If you have little or no exposure to the topic it is a great read. At the publication date it was completely up-to-date, but now 6 years later I long for a sequel! The author ranges far and wide tying together cosmology, astronomy, the ""real world"" and particle physics. Nicely done."
6,0142004464,http://goodreads.com/user/show/18942380-william-schram,4,"Charles Seife has done it again; he wrote a book that both entertains and informs in equal portions. I read his previous book several years ago, but seem to remember enjoying it. I could always check my previous review of Zero assuming I made one in the first place, but I don’t feel like doing that at the moment.So Seife begins at the beginning. Originally, before we had the Big Bang Theory and all of that interesting stuff, we only had guesses and stories from books and legends. We have the story from the book of Genesis, legends and creation myths like where some gods killed a giant and fashioned the universe out of its body. The main point is that we didn’t know, so we made up some stuff about supernatural beings and murder.Eventually, science came out of the dark ages of not knowing things and people formulated theories about the universe itself, with the main difference being that we looked for evidence. So again, Seife talks about the revolutions in Cosmology and how they affected our perceptions of the universe as a whole. As long as people have been around, they have wondered at the stars and our place in the Universe. The main ideas began with Aristotle and Ptolemy. Aristotle thought that there were four elements and that earth was heavy, so the Earth was the center of the Universe. Ptolemy constructed this ridiculously complex system that put the Earth in the center of everything. There were epicycles and retrograde motions and explanations that made the Universe seem like it was made for us.Copernicus came along and ruined all of that with one simple change; he put the Sun at the center and the Earth revolved around it. This is a very counterintuitive idea. It was also not as popular since it didn’t work as well as the Geocentric Model of Ptolemy. Kepler comes along with Brahe’s extensive notes and data logs and says the revolutions aren’t circular but instead describe an ellipse. Galileo made observations of his own too, observations that countered Church doctrine and got him into a heap of trouble with the Pope and the Inquisition. Finally, Newton came around and said how all of this was possible. Gravity was a unifying force that allowed planets to stay their courses. Angels and other weird beings weren’t necessary.This universe that was created was a static, clockwork model that had absolute predictability. From the perturbations of Saturn, we found Uranus and other planetary bodies. It seemed perfect, so perfect that no one bothered questioning the little issues. For example, Mercury’s wobble seemed to suggest another planet that was even closer. Eventually, Einstein came along with his General Theory of Relativity. It describes gravity in the framework of his Special Relativity by saying that the universe is akin to a rubber sheet and massive objects distort that sheet. However, the rabbit hole of equations led Einstein to a stunning discovery; the universe is inherently unstable. It has to either collapse on itself or expand forever. Einstein didn’t like that idea, so he added a fudge factor that he termed the Cosmological Constant. This mysterious energy pushes against the forces of Gravity and makes the universe balanced. Later on, Einstein would call this his greatest blunder.A guy named Hubble found evidence of an expanding universe. Another team found this evidence around the same time, but it’s named after Hubble, so I guess he gets priority. Anyway, Hubble found that galaxies were flying away from us. He did this by observing that the light from those galaxies was Red-Shifted to lower energy. This is where the Big Bang was theorized. In the 1960s we discovered the Cosmic Microwave Background Radiation. This along with the specific ratio of elements in the universe is further proof of the Big Bang. The biggest issue is finding more stuff about the Big Bang. We can tell what happened mere nanoseconds after, but before that it becomes hazy. Why did the Big Bang happen at all? Was there a proverbial button? Ah well.So once scientists found the beginning of the universe, they also sought to find its end. Religion has answers for that too, but it’s mainly stories from a book written during the bronze age and other myths and legends that take on the final end of the universe. We have the Book of Revelation from the Bible and the idea of Ragnarok, the Twilight of the Gods and other stuff. Scientists found that the universe will eventually spread out so far that everything will freeze. If we go by that Robert Frost poem, it will be a death by Ice.So this book was pretty good. I enjoyed it a lot. The images and pictures were charming and the prose was done in a style that was easily accessible."
7,0142004464,http://goodreads.com/user/show/363357-darth,3,"I am hesitant to put a lot of science in the non-fiction category, just because so much of what they do these days feels to me like conjecture / speculation / extrapolation. Too much is published by those with a point to try and prove, and so any minor, infinitesimal piece of datum collected is then constured as definitive proof of whatever theory (crackpot or intact pot - if that is the opposite of crackpot) the author is pushing.I acknowledge that some of this is the nature of science, we are always figuring stuff out and revising earlier (mis)conceptions of the universe we live in - and I am not one who thinks that that fallibility is reason enough to not try and piece things together.But I am the guy who watches pretty closely and knows just when the trolley goes off the tracks, so to speak...All that said this book doesnt cut any new ground, it is just a rehash to bring you up to a general idea of what is going on in the world of physics. It did that pretty well. And it tried fairly hard to be entertaining too."
8,0142004464,http://goodreads.com/user/show/38958313-shubhanjan-das,2,"As a book which gives a scientific historical perspective on development of cosmological thought, this is definitely a good read. However, by almost totally omitting anti matter and the nature of arrow of time, Charles fails to place a holistic definite workable model of the alpha and the omega . You can't even think of alpha / omega of the universe without incorporating the concepts of entropy, thermodynamics,antimatter, and nature of time. May be read by beginners but for seekers of higher truths, may not be worth it."
9,0142004464,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1689188-joshua,4,"Really good book on the nature of that whole universe thing. Very understandable. Lots of math, but explained in a very friendly way. Great idea of uncovering the discoveries layer at a time. Might be a little confusing though as different parts of the book can contradict earlier sections, because it it written from a more enlightened perspective."
10,0142004464,http://goodreads.com/user/show/51577362-john-deltuvia,3,"The amount of speculation in this book, including the repeated use of the phrase ""Physicists believe"", make it more of a religious text than a science text. Many of the ideas presented do not really even reach the hypothesis level, let alone mathematical"
11,0142004464,http://goodreads.com/user/show/54757882-rhett-smith,3,"3 stars because I liked it. But, it is not a casual read about Astronomy. The first 3 chapters are light and the context is historical. But, it quickly jumps into in depth science and theory. Unless you are a astronomy buff, skip."
12,0142004464,http://goodreads.com/user/show/300895-leif-erik,4,"This is a great introduction to the art of cosmology and strangely enough, quantum theory. It's five years old (at this point) and so is somewhat dated, but the history and descriptions of how and why scientists came to view the origin of the universe holds up. "
