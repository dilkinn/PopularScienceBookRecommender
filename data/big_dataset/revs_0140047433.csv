0,0140047433,http://goodreads.com/user/show/14046996-roy-lotz,1,"I’ve been looking forward to reading this book for quite a while—partially because it has gotten such good reviews online, and partially because I like reading essays on biology. But now, after finishing it, I am both confused and disappointed.  With most books, even if I don’t like them, I can still understand and appreciate what the author was trying to achieve. Not with this. The only thing I can think of that could have motivated Lewis Thomas to write this book is sheer egoism. He’s the kind of guy you wouldn’t want to be seated next to at a dinner party. He would talk your ear off, and I bet he laughed at his own jokes too.  (When I try to imagine Lewis Thomas, I picture a paunchy, white-haired fellow with a round, ruddy face. He is in his New England home, furnished with dark oak furniture, dressed in a scarlet robe, sipping coffee and typing his essays. Thomas types in spurts—banging out a few sentences and then pausing to look out his window at his well-kept yard. He always has a smile on his face when he writes, and laughs under his breath every once in a while when he thinks he has been clever. And whenever he is particularly impressed with one of his own sentences, he calls his wife over, who is an expert in feigning enjoyment.) The best part of this book is the writing, but even here I think Thomas is irritating, vexing. He has the annoying habit of sticking in an extra tidbit after every sentence, like this. It is as if he always has something extra to say, an afterthought. After a while I just want him to shut up, be quiet. That he compared his style with Montaigne’s is obnoxious, offensive. Montaigne’s writing is free, easy; Thomas’s style is mannered, affected. Even if Thomas could be excused for being a middling writer, it is hard to excuse his vapid ideas. The real, solid biological information contained in this book could be found in any intro-level biology textbook. But instead of actually explaining this information, Thomas just uses his educational background to pepper his essays with technical terms that a layreader will have to look up. He has no interest in educating the public in his field, but only wishes to be admired for his broad learning. When Thomas strays away from these basic biological facts (which is often), the quality gets even worse. I would be willing to bet that, if Thomas was only slightly less intelligent, he would have ended up being a conspiracy theorist, and might have been given a show on the History Channel chasing aliens. I say this because these essays are filled with pseudo-science. Thomas repeatedly says that the majority of life on Earth is symbiotic, and this is true. But he fails to mention that the majority of these symbiotic relationships are parasitic—which undermines his rosy-eyed portrait of life on this planet, if you ask me. Thomas seems to think that it is a biological mistake when a virus makes its host sick. I have no idea how a doctor could believe this. Most normal symptoms of sickness—sneezing, coughing, runny nose, diarrhea—are ideal ways for a virus to spread. He also includes an essay on ways to train our internal organs, in the same way dogs can be trained. What?! Was he high when he wrote this? Wait a minute. The more I think about it, the more it makes sense. Lewis Thomas was a stoner, which explains why many of these essays have intellectual sophistication comparable to Bill and Ted’s Excellent Adventure. Let me summarize one of his essays, “Living Language”: “Dude, what if, instead of language being a tool for humans, humans were a tool for language. Like, language is totally alive, for real! Woahhhh!” In fact, let me summarize the whole book: “Dude, what if, like, the world was really a cell. Not, like, metaphorically though, like for real. Like, wouldn’t that be trippy? Woaahhhh!” So I’m perplexed by the number of people who find Thomas to be “thought provoking”. I would say he is just about as thought provoking as a conversation with an intoxicated, college-aged biology major. To summarize, I am sincerely confused as to why people like this book. The writing is pompous, and the subject matter alternately frivolous, commonplace, or provably incorrect. Thomas might have made a good science fiction writer, but he is not a good science writer."
1,0140047433,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1524767-poiema,4,"I came across a truly lyrical biology book, a series of essays by Lewis Thomas entitled The Lives of a Cell. Now this is a man who can write about biology in a way that delights. For example, this paragraph on pheromones: "" 'At home, 4 p.m. today', says the female moth, and releases a brief explosion of bombykol, a single molecule of which will tremble the hairs of any male within miles and send him driving upwind in a confusion of ardor. But it is doubtful if he has an awareness of being caught in an aerosol of chemical attractant. On the contrary, he probably finds suddenly that it has become an excellent day, the weather remarkably bracing, the time appropriate for a bit of exercise of the old wings, a brisk turn upwind. En route, traveling the gradient of bombykol, he notes the presence of other males, heading in the same direction, all in a good mood, inclined to race for the sheer sport of it. Then, when he reaches his destination, it may seem to him that most extraordinary of coincidences, the greatest piece of luck: 'Bless my soul, what have we here!'""I love the way this man personifies the moth, don't you? And look how effortless it was to figure out that ""bombykol"" was a powerful pheromone released by a female moth to attract a mate. A curious individual would proceed to find out a little more about this chemical. He might go on to study pheromones in other species and even how/if they effect us as humans.In contrast, a biology textbook would probably say something like this:""Bombykol is a chemical substance called a pheromone. It is released by female silkworms in order to attract a mate. Named after the moth's Latin name Bombyx mori, it was discovered in 1959 by Adolph Butenandt.""Somehow, those words do not give me a taste for further investigation.It's a pleasure to come across a book that makes biology both poetic and thought provoking. This one is a keeper, and has become an integral part of my homeschooled students' high school biology class."
2,0140047433,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5650849-alan,5,"The author invited my wife, the artist Susan Mohl Powers (google her on wikipedia), to exhibit at Sloan Kettering after she did at Squibb International Headquarters in Princeton (and was reviewed in the NYT), but somehow in the early 80's she was developing other forums. I ""taught"" some of these essays, too good for a medical journal (they were often published in newspapers, too, as I recall) and found the prose as good as any contemporary non-fiction I had read,""the high probability that we derived, originally, from a single cell, fertilized in a bolt of lightning as the earth cooled...we still share genes around, and the resemblance of the enzymes of grasses to those of whales is a family resemblance""(5). On mitochondria, he notes, ""in a strict sense they are not ours. They turn out to be little separate creatures, the colonial posterity of migrant prokaryocytes...Mitochondria are stable and responsible lodgers..."" Since I was a pre-med student at an excellent college, I follow this pretty well, but I believe only my nursing students really liked it at the community college when I taught chapters like ""Death in the Open,"" and ""The music of This Sphere."""
3,0140047433,http://goodreads.com/user/show/28165536-selkie-queen,5,"This was an extraordinary find while I was sifting randomly through the dusty boxes of a booksale outlet store. The price tag was shocking as well; it only cost 10 pesos. I enjoy reading anthologies, whether they're short stories in fiction or non-fiction essays. Lewis Thomas' The Lives of a Cell falls in the latter category. The book is composed of 29 of the most succinct but unforgettable essays on subjects not just narrowed down to scientific fields but also about their ongoing connection to more humanistic fields of knowledge and endeavor such as mass communications and music. Thomas' aim is to show readers that everything in Earth is connected even if such connections are microscopic and neglected by the human populous.Recommending this book to a general audience may seem like a strange thing, especially since most people would view this as an academic piece of literature that not everyone can enjoy in passing. True, Thomas's work belongs to classrooms and for students who actively pursue science as a vocation but I believe The Lives of a Cell has accomplished a surprising feat: anyone can enjoy the essays he had composed, and he composed them with such delicacy, craft and mastery, successfully employing a literary voice to deliver his pieces. The result is worth at least a day of your life (and I've finished this while on a bus ride during a field trip). The essays themselves are harmonious; Thomas not only has a great grasp on the fundamentals and implications of biology as a scientific field but also as a philosophy which we can look at nature and man's place in it with a renewed understanding. He definitely has an ear for music while he writes the essays; his sentences are so melodious, often resonating beyond our scholarly comprehension.Here is a sample of his first essay that immediately gripped me by the throat:""We are told that the trouble with Modern Man is that he has been trying to detach himself from nature. He sits in the topmost tiers of polymer, glass, and steel, dangling his pulsing legs, surveying at a distance the writhing life of the planet. In this scenario, Man comes on as a stupendous lethal force, and the earth is pictured as something delicate, like rising bubbles at the surface of a country pond, or flights of fragile birds. But it is illusion to think that there is anything fragile about the life of the earth; surely this is the toughest membrane imaginable in the universe, opaque to probability, impermeable to death. We are the delicate part, transient and vulnerable as cilia. Nor is it a new thing for man to invent an existence that he imagines to be above the rest of life; this has been his most consistent intellectual exertion down the millennia. As illusion, it has never worked out to his satisfaction in the past, any more than it does today. Man is embedded in nature.""There is nothing I could say that could offer you any kind of consolation if you ever pick up this book except that it's a transformative experience you shouldn't miss out on. You can view The Lives of a Cell as a scientist's journal--but don't expect it to be stifling or dreary at all. Thomas' musings and observations are quite whimsical and heartfelt. Trust him while you read his work and he may open your mind with things a lot of us are quick to overlook in our lives.RECOMMENDED: 10/10 *A collection of sublime and compelling examinations on man and nature, written with deftness and childlike curiositySince I don't believe this book is available in print anymore unless in bargain sales, I decided to research it online and was happy to find a PDF copy which you can read HERE

4,0140047433,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8079403-max,5,"A wonderful book, packed with fascinating insights. Lewis is prescient. Most of his ideas feel timelier than when the book was written. Using cell biology as a springboard (fortunately not in too much detail) for his philosophy, Lewis explores what it means to be human and the functioning of society. A central theme is human society as a living cell with its many interdependent structures and functions. Key to this theme is the idea that the nuclei, mitochondria, organelles and other structures within cells were originally independent organisms that formed into one where all prospered even though their original identity was lost. Lewis focuses on the positive, not the competitiveness attributed to Darwin, but how organisms at all levels cooperate to survive. His concepts stand in stark contrast to popular metaphors based on “survival of the fittest”. For example, if nature is used as a model for an economic system, is competitive capitalism the correct interpretation, or would a closer one be a system where we look out for each other. Here in America where socialism is a dirty word, many would not believe nature would stoop so low.Particularly interesting is the notion of human beings as an extension of a universe of information. Many physicists believe that the Universe is itself a computer, that its basic component is simply information, the on or off bits. Somehow these have miraculously arranged themselves so we could be here. The individual also with all his or her sensory and processing capabilities is also a computer in this network.Lewis saw (well before the advent of the Internet) much more in our future. “We are becoming a grid, a circuitry around the earth. If we keep at it, we will become a computer to end all computers, capable of fusing all the thoughts of the world into a syncytium.” I had to look up syncytium - definition, “a mass of cytoplasm within a cell membrane that contains multiple nuclei and is often the result of cellular fusion.” Lewis uses the cell itself as a model for a mass consciousness, the emergent property that would arise from tightly knit global human cooperation. Although some knowledge of biology is helpful, this is primarily a book of philosophy and should be accessible to most readers who want to explore human nature and human potential. Very highly recommended for a rich and rewarding experience. "
5,0140047433,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6914463-alexander-murphy,5,"The lives of a cell is an amazing book, which i believe most people should read, if they can handle it. The reason i say this is because it explores the human vision of the world around us, and the life forms and beings that pass us by in a matter of a lifetime. Thomas explains in a very scientific, and biological style of writing how the world has a major sense of interdependence. It reveals the human nature in all of us, and how we are indeed a social species. However, this book does not focus on just humans, or animals; it stretches from topics of hidden relationships in nature, poetry, microscopic germs, the way and structure of language, music, birth and death, medicinal breakthroughs, and more. The reason i say everyone should read it is because it's really a fascinating combination of biological science, mixed with great literature, and a speculative aspect on humans as a species. However this is also the reason i say ""if you can handle it"". This book is sometimes quite difficult to wrap your mind around, almost as if the author is shoving the whole biological universe into your mind on every page. Many times have i read a chapter over, just wondering if i really understood what exactly i had just read. But if you have the patience to read over, and the mental ability to actually get his studies, then in the end you will be left with a very rewarding piece of literature.One of my favorite quotes from the book is ""Once you have become permanently startled, as I am, by the realization that we are a social species, you tend to keep an eye out for the pieces of evidence that this is, by and large, good for us."" This quote really explains the book, because it is a startling piece of work, and one you wont soon forget. If you have an interest in the world as a whole, how everything is interconnected, and do not mind some heavy scientific reading, then I HIGHLY recommend this book to you. It is fairly short also."
6,0140047433,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2832942-scott,5,"This book, simply, is amazing and wonderful and makes you feel happy, as well as stunned, to be alive. In this collection of essays Lewis Thomas tackles a variety of subjects relating to biology, chemistry, linguistics (as a parallel to biology) and much more. The reader finds out so much about the human body that is not only startling but is basically an existential nightmare. Instead of being a single form we are in fact made up of millions or billions of cells that share no DNA with us and are themselves made up of tinier cells that are grouped together. This fact leads to the idea of the Earth itself being one gigantic jewel of a cell, suspended in solar system.TL/DR: This book rules and even though he dates himself a good bit, I recommend this for anyone with even a passing interest in finding out more of what it is like to be a human being."
7,0140047433,http://goodreads.com/user/show/969308-michelle,5,"A non-fiction book about biology that reads more like fiction. It offers a wonderful, almost poetic scientific perspective on mankind, other species and the Earth as a whole. Although I had to keep a dictionary of scientific terms handy as I read, it was an otherwise very enjoyable read.A quote from the book:""I have been trying to think of the earth as a kind of organism, but it is no go. I cannot think of it this way. It is too big, too complex, with too many working parts lacking visible connections. The other night, driving through a hilly, wooded part of southern New England, I wondered about this. If not like an organism, what is it like, what is it most like? Then, satisfactorily for that moment, it came to me: it is most like a single cell."""
8,0140047433,http://goodreads.com/user/show/329383-dale,3,"This is an odd little book, very slim and breezy to read, even though it drops some serious seven-syllable science words without so much as a nod towards defining them or even contextualizing them. Like The Flight of the Iguana, it's really a collection of essays rather than a single narrative or thematic work, but that aspect is much more obvious in this book. Apparently the book either collects essays from disparate sources, or their original single source didn't care if Thomas frequently recycled his favorite pet ideas - that language is an organic construct built in the same way ants build an anthill, for example. Reading all the essays back-to-back made those repeated motifs seem pretty redundant. Still, the essays were all well-written and made some interesting points (at least the first time each point was made it was interesting). Bonus entertainment value came from the fact that the collection was originally published around 1975. A world crowded with 3 billion people, national health care costs of $90 billion dollars a year ... ahhh, those were the good old days."
9,0140047433,http://goodreads.com/user/show/22306206-neil-r-coulter,4,"I picked up a copy of The Lives of a Cell from a giveaway shelf just a little before encountering Lewis Thomas in William Zinsser's book Writing to Learn. Reading Thomas is a lot of fun. He employs a relaxed, humorous, slightly ironic tone that makes his perspective on life distinctive. I haven't read another book quite like The Lives of a Cell. Though I can see how it led to the genre of ""scientists writing for a popular audience,"" it remains its own kind of book.Both the humor and a general theme of the book are seen in this quote from the start of chapter 3:Viewed from a suitable height, the aggregating clusters of medical scientists in the bright sunlight of the boardwalk at Atlantic City, swarmed there from everywhere for the annual meetings, have the look of assemblages of social insects. (11)In addition to showing Thomas's ironic point of view, this quote is also a theme that connects his sometimes all-over-the-place musings. Thomas wants to look at the smallest level of life and the largest and see interdependence and connection. Considering various organisms, and even the entire planet, in this way is often intriguing.The science content of this book is kept relatively general, and probably some of the specific research Thomas mentions has by now been superseded by more precise (or even contradictory) studies. For me, though, this is not problematic, because the real star is Thomas's writing style, which is one of a kind."
10,0140047433,http://goodreads.com/user/show/36622280-micah-kramer,4,"This book is a collection of essays by the author. I found this book to be a light read and a lot of fun. The author was full of energy and excitement. Over all I found the book to be a challenge to wonder instead of accept and memorize boring ""facts"". It was a refreshing change from my years studying physics where each professor in their turn just told you a bunch of things that ""just are the way it is"" (even when those things were at best theoretical and at worst a philosophical hypothesis), and it frustrated me that no one seemed to be willing to stop and wonder ""are we wrong?"" (Neither the profs who were on auto pilot not the students who only cared about passing the class.) Anyone who stops and considers for a moment will realize yes, we are always wrong about something, which ends up changing everything. Who knows? That's the exciting part and that's what I found most enjoyable about this book."
11,0140047433,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1438068-joyce,5,"What a fabulous gem of a book. This is the sort of professor I loved best, and the sort of writer I love. Here is someone who not only knows their own field, but it happy to see the connections and marvels of other fields. This is someone who lives and breathes the ideas of systems theory without actually articulating those words. The joy and marvel of life and the universe come through with an openness to appreciating it and no need to own or control or dominate, but also no naivety on how humans are. So many things to think about here. I shall go back to reread certain small essays. I know it's a good book when I am constantly interrupting my husband's own reading to say 'Hang on then, I need to read you something....'Having seen some of the other reviews of how awful this book is I will say this - it is a book of essays, of thoughts inspired by science. It is not a book of scientific facts. I am not a biologist by training and I found none of the terms too technical.Also, I suspect that those who love Dawkins and others who view the universe as an empty mechanical beast that can be viewed by reductionist thinking and embrace the (now outmoded) hard Cartesian approach, - yes these folks will HATE this book. But for those who are interested in a different view of the universe, who see it as networks of networks of living systems interacting together and who are fascinated by the observations of someone who has spent a lifetime peeking into these areas or stumbling upon them then you will like this book.I have one other thought - those who embrace the reductionist, mechanistic view of the universe often use nasty snark, scoffing and sneering at alternate views. If you read the history of science, you see that often theories that completely changed the way the universe was understood were often met with similar self-assured contempt. That self-assured contempt is usually a sign the person has forgotten that science is theory and has gotten into a sense of ""this is right and everyone else is stupid"". It is something to think about."
12,0140047433,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7175349-david,5,"My father-in-law just turned me on to Lewis Thomas. The title of this book sounds familiar, as does the author's name, but apparently it was not because I'd read his work before. Happily, he has all of Thomas's books, so I expect that I will end up reading them all. He tells me that Thomas had a column in a medical journal called ""Notes of a Biology Watcher,"" and this book is a collection of some of those columns.Wonderful writing, fascinating and charming. However, this was the seventies, so you may trip over the casual sexism that pops up here and there. It seems unintentional, rather than anti-woman (or anti-feminist). Still, I wish he'd been ahead of the curve on this, as I can't help thinking back to how embattled second-wave feminists were at the time (and perhaps the hideous backlash against progress that we are living through now makes me extra sensitive, so I feel compelled to take note).But the main thing about this work is how well it holds up -- the science has come a fair amount since then (says this non-scientist), yet the observations, insights, speculations, and reflections seem fresh and very thought-provoking despite being more than forty years old. After Tom has read this, we will return my father-in-law's copy, but I plan to look for a used paperback so I can keep it handy whenever I need a bit of thoughtful inspiration in the form of a brief, elegant essay."
13,0140047433,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1333081-nancy,2,"It is with a heavy heart that I report what a drag it was to read this book. I love science, I love essays, I love philosophical wanderings linking the various arts and sciences together in a creative web of understanding. But apparently I do not enjoy Lewis Thomas' version of any of those things.Firstly, the science in the book is terribly dated. Not his fault, but worth mentioning. Secondly, Thomas' tendency to assume opinions as a basis for truth, and begin his extrapolations from that point, makes for a lousy experience, as I spent most of my time reading with one eyebrow raised, skeptical and annoyed. I understand that he's not a scientist, but he is writing about science with no basis in the scientific method, which seems hypocritical. And finally... although some of his language drew me in and allowed me to enjoy the experience of his poetic wanderings, most of it seemed purposeless and at times boring. Quite frankly, I found it difficult to get through certain chapters without falling asleep.I'm giving it two stars instead of one because there were sections that I enjoyed very much, and because I love the idea of the book, if not the execution."
14,0140047433,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8835-john,5,"This is a collection of essays (I think all of Lewis Thomas' books are) that were published in science and medical journals prior to being collected in book format.The essays are each so well written, beautifully phrased and accessible. Each begins by looking at life at the tiny cellular level but reaches beyond the cellular level to encompass life at the fullest level. For his ability to write about science and nature in a intellecutal yet humble and humorous manner appeals immediately. He essays then insightfully reveal human nature. For those qualities alone, this book warrants five stars. To approach science in such a manner at a very early age, I think, would instill a great sense of admiration and accessibility.  "

How would an alien species view us? What exactly is the health industry? Are there parallels to be drawn between what science observes and our socio-political life? An emotional response to road kill and the odd venture in the direction of 'the Gaia Hypothesis' en route.I found it a little dry in places but the entries regarding linguistics and genetics and the communal nature of life were interesting; Organelles within our cells carry DNA that is exclusively theirs, not ours. The same applies to plant cells and tissue. At it's most basic level then, life is communal and I'll never see road kill quite the same way again."

She was my high school sweetheart and the best friend I had ever had. I was devastated and lost, and at the same time responsible for two precious lives. I slept little and in the early morning hours I found Lewis Thomas. His wonderful essays put my life in perspective and helped me to cope with what I perceived as an irreparable loss. I am forever indebted to this wonderful essayist for saving my life and for showing me the continuity and wonder of all life. He was a brilliant thinker and a wonderful prose stylist. I read every essay he ever wrote, but this was my introduction to the thinking and writing of one of the most humane minds I have ever known. "

19,0140047433,http://goodreads.com/user/show/59359-stephen,4,"The good: Lewis Thomas weds his knowledge of biology and medicine with an enjoyable prose style to describe the physical world as a wondrous place worth knowing more about. I feel science writing has a way of sometimes reducing things to formula, when it really should open us up to the idea of re-imagining how we perceive who we are and how the world works. This is a skill that Thomas seems particularly adept at, and one I wish that was more common.The bad: As many of these essays were published separately in journals, there is the inherent problem that they were not originally intended to be in a collection as they were being written. Consequently, in collections of Thomas there are often overly repetitive mentions of certain facts about certain subjects (termites, mitochrondria, etc.) or themes of concern (nuclear war, music, language etc.) that can become a little wearisome if you read the book straight through. Speaking of nuclear war, it is also important to realize the context in which these essays were written. When Thomas describes the life of a planet as a similar to a single living cell it is by no accident that in this same essay he appeals to nuclear powers not to eliminate this unified living creature.

If I'm going to expect my family to read a gift-book, I should read it too, went the thought. The selfish part of this is that I may have given them books I wanted to read anyway (three of them are on a recent Time Magazine list of essential nonfiction, but I like to think I tailored the list to their interests--how my dad relates to Zen and motorcyles, I'm not sure, but it is about fathers and sons, too, I think). Lives of a Cell was enjoyable throughout, especially on the subjects of computers, language, and elephant bones. Lewis Thomas certainly has a New-Yorker-magazine-in-the-mid-century voice: calm fascination.Rest of Family Book Club:Stephen: The Making of a President 1960.CJ: The Lives of a Cell (done).Dad: Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance.Mom: The Happiness Project (20% done).

This book is a collection of essays that discuss biology, language, society, and other issues of naturalism and scientific observation that weave together into a rather unique way of looking at the lives of individuals with respect to the others. When I had finished this book, I was very excited by the new way I looked at the world around me, and eagerly discussed many of its concepts with friends and family. The individual essays sometimes overlap, but overall form an organic whole, which is amusing because one of the core theses of the book is the way in which overlap between individuals in a society tends to form a larger organism."

I understand it's principals and why it makes sense. I don't dispute it's a good idea and theory, but it's still just that. It's mystifying to me that scientists describe the beginning of time as if they were there, as if they have libraries filled with annals of encyclopedic data. The fact is, they weren't there, and the so-called data we do have is speculative at best. I'm just not convinced that all of the science in this book is correct, and it's certainly dated. But, I also can't deny that many of the essays, like, ""Germs"" and ""Information"", were well written and are as relative today as they were in the early 1970's. "

33,0140047433,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11253958-marwa-assem-salama,4,"I never considered myself qualified enough to talk or summarize any scientific book, let alone evaluate it. Especially, if that book has won two national awards like the case here. But lately, I suffered from symptoms of emotional writing overdose; provoked useless memories and lost enthusiasm towards many activities, to the extent that I busted myself envious of a bunch of bastards who were cursing each other on Facebook’s comments section. Somehow I found it a good sign that they still have a healthy will and energy to do so. And since spiritual, religious kind of books hasn’t helped me overcome this miserable situation, I thought probably reading something scientific will do. But as you know, the more you escape from a thing, the more you encounter it. And it is better to know that the author Lewis Thomas was not merely a physician, he was a poet too. That's how, I ended up here reading some of the most sentimental, contemplative essays in science. And guess what? I’m perfectly content!Now forget about the title, this book doesn't give you the usual solid biological facts about the cell and its components, rather it does stimulate your mind to think of yourself and other creatures on this earth as if you were a part in a huge cell. Lewis says:""A good case can be made for our nonexistence as entities. We are not made up, as we had always supposed, of successively enriched packets of our own parts. We are shared, rented, occupied. At the interior of our cells, driving them, providing the oxidative energy that sends us out for the improvement of each shining day, are the mitochondria, and in a strict sense they are not ours. They turn out to be little separate creatures, the colonial posterity of migrant Prokaryocytes, probably primitive bacteria that swam into ancestral precursors of our eukaryotic cells and stayed there. Ever since, they have maintained themselves and their ways, replicating in their own fashion, privately, with their own DNA and RNA quite different from ours. They are as much “symbionts” as the Rhizobial bacteria in the roots of beans. Without them, we would not move a muscle, drum a finger, think a thought. Mitochondria are stable and responsible lodgers, and I choose to trust them. But what of the other little animals, similarly established in my cells, sorting and balancing me, clustering me together? My Centrioles, basal bodies, and probably a good many other more obscure tiny beings at work inside my cells, each with its own special genome, are as foreign, and as essential, as aphids in anthills. My cells are no longer the pure line entities I was raised with; they are ecosystems more complex than Tamaica Bay. I like to think that they work in my interest, that each breath they draw for me, but perhaps it is they who walk through the local park in the early morning, sensing my senses, listening to my music, thinking my thoughts. ""Then he added: ""I have been trying to think of the earth as a kind of organism, but it is no go. I cannot think of it this way. It is too big, too complex, with too many working parts lacking visible connections. The other night, driving through a hilly, wooded part of southern New England, I wondered about this. If not like an organism, what is it like, what is it most like? Then, satisfactorily for that moment, it came to me: it is most like a single cell. ""Lewis was fascinated by the social, overly organized life style of tiny creatures such as ants, bees and termites. “They do everything but watching television ” he said about them with genuine admiration and a little contempt toward what he is called “Our human chauvinism”. And let’s say you may find yourself familiar with a lot of stories about them in this book, especially if you were a huge fan of National Geographic’s episodes or BBC Planet Earth series. That’s wouldn’t prevent you from enjoying these parts though. He says here:""Isolated, paired termites are something else again. As soon as they are removed from the group, and the touching from all sides comes to an end, they become aggressive, standoffish; they begin drinking compulsively, and abstain from touching each other. Sometimes, they even bite off the distal halves of each other's antennae, to eliminate the temptation. Irritably, settling down to make the best of a poor situation, they begin preparations for the laying oh eggs and the taking care of the brood. Meanwhile, the mitochondria in their flight muscles go out of business. The most intensely social animals can only adapt to group behavior. Bees and ants have no option when isolated, except to die. There is really no such creature as a single individual; he has no more life of his own than a cast-off cell marooned from the surface of your skin. ""Now, if I am going to give this book an award for only one essay, it definitely would be this one. I know it is relatively long, but really worth reading. Here it is:""In fact, there are three quite different levels of technology in medicine, so unlike each other as to seem altogether different undertakings. Practitioners of medicine and the analysts will be in trouble if they are not kept separate.  I. First of all, there is a large body of what might be termed ""non-technology,"" impossible to measure in terms of its capacity to alter either the natural course of disease or its eventual outcome. A great deal of money is spent on this. It is valued highly by the professionals as well as the patients. It consists of what is sometimes called ""supportive therapy."" It is what is meant by the phrases ""caring for"" and ""standing by."" It is indispensable. It is not, however, a technology in any real sense, since it does not involve measures directed at the underlying mechanism of disease. It is what physicians used to be engaged in at the bedside of patients with diphtheria, meningitis, poliomyelitis, lobar pneumonia, and all the rest of the infectious diseases that have since come under control. It is what physicians must now do for patients with intractable cancer, severe rheumatoid arthritis, multiple sclerosis, stroke, and advanced cirrhosis. One can think of at least twenty major diseases that require this kind of supportive medical care because of the absence of an effective technology. I would include a large amount of what is called mental disease, and most varieties of cancer, in this category. The cost of this non-technology is very high, and getting higher all the time. It requires not only a great deal of time, but also very hard effort and skill on the part of physicians; only the very best of doctors are good at coping with this kind of defeat. It also involves long periods of hospitalization, lots of nursing, lots of involvement of non- medical professionals in and out of the hospital. It represents, in short, a substantial segment of today's expenditures for health. 2. At the next level up is a kind of technology best termed ""halfway technology."" This represents the kinds of things that must be done after the fact, in efforts to compensate for the incapacitating effects of certain diseases whose course one is unable to do very much about. It is a technology designed to make up for disease, or to postpone death. The outstanding examples in recent years are the transplantation's of hearts, kidneys, livers, and other organs, and the equally spectacular inventions of artificial organs. In the public mind, this kind of technology has come to seem like the equivalent of the high technologies of the physical sciences. The media tend to present each new procedure as though it represented a breakthrough and therapeutic triumph, instead of the makeshift that it really is. In fact, this level of technology is, by its nature, at the same time highly sophisticated and pro- foundry primitive. It is the kind of thing that one must continue to do until there is a genuine understanding of the mechanisms involved in disease. In chronic glomerulonephritis, for example, a much clearer insight will be needed into the events leading to the destruction of glomeruli by the immunologic reactants that now appear to govern this disease, before one will know how to intervene intelligently to prevent the process, or turn it around. But when this level of understanding has been reached, the technology of kidney replacement will not be much needed and should no longer pose the huge problems of logistics, cost, and ethics that it poses today. An extremely complex and costly technology for the management of coronary heart disease has evolved--involving specialized ambulances and hospital units, all kinds of electronic gadgetry, and whole platoons of new professional personnel--to deal with the end results of coronary thrombosis. Almost everything offered today for the treatment of heart disease is at this level of technology, with the transplanted and artificial hearts as ultimate examples. When enough has been learned to know what really goes wrong in heart disease, one ought to be in a position to figure out ways to prevent or reverse the process, and when this happens the current elaborate technology will probably be set to one side.Much of what is done in the treatment of cancer, by surgery, irradiation, and chemotherapy, represent halfway technology, in the sense that these measures are directed at the existence of already established cancer cells, but not at the mechanisms by which cells become neoplastic. It is a characteristic of this kind of technology that it costs an enormous amount of money and requires a continuing expansion of hospital facilities. There is no end to the need for new, highly trained people to run the enterprise. And there is really no way out of this, at the present state of knowledge. If the installation of specialized coronary-care units can result in the extension of life for only a few patients with coronary disease (and there is no question that this technology is effective in a few cases), it seems to me an inevitable fact of life that as many of these as can be will be put together, and as much money as can be found will be spent. I do not see that anyone has much choice in this. The only thing that can move medicine away from this level of technology is new information, and the only imaginable source of this in- formation is research. 3. The third type of technology is the kind that is so effective that it seems to attract the least public notice; it has come to be taken for granted. This is the genuinely decisive technology of modern medicine, exemplified best by modern methods for immunization against diphtheria, pertussis, and the childhood virus diseases, and the contemporary use of antibiotics and chemotherapy for bacterial infections. The capacity to deal effectively with syphilis and tuberculosis represents a milestone in human endeavor, even though full use of this potential has not yet been made. And there are, of course, other examples: the treatment of endocrinologic disorders with appropriate hormones, the prevention of hemolytic disease of the newborn, the treatment and prevention of various nutritional disorders, and perhaps just around the corner the management of Parkinsonism and sickle cell anemia. There are other examples, and everyone will have his favorite candidates for the list, but the truth is that there is nothing like as many as the public has been led to believe. The point to be made about this kind of technology-the real high technology of medicine--is that it comes as the result of a genuine understanding of disease mechanisms, and when it becomes available, it is relatively inexpensive, and relatively easy to deliver. Offhand, I cannot think of any important human disease for which medicine possesses the outright capacity to prevent or cure where the cost of the technology is itself a major problem. The price is never as high as the cost of managing the same diseases during the earlier stages of non-technology or halfway technology. If a case of typhoid fever had to be managed today by the best methods of 1935, it would run to a staggering expense. At, say, around fifty days of hospitalization, requiring the most demanding kind of nursing care, with the obsessive concern for details of diet that characterized the therapy of that time, with daily laboratory monitoring, and, on occasion, surgical intervention for abdominal catastrophe, I should think $10,0000 would be a conservative estimate for the illness, as contrasted with today's cost of a bottle of chloramphenicol and a day or two of fever. The halfway technology that was evolving for poliomyelitis in the early 1950s, just before the emergence of the basic research that made the vaccine possible, provides another illustration of the point. If I were a policy-maker, interested in saving money for health care over the long haul, I would regard it as an act of high prudence to give high priority to a lot more basic research in biologic science. This is the only way to get the full mileage that biology owes to the science of medicine, even though it seems, as used to be said in the days when the phrase still had some meaning, like asking for the moon. ""I can't deny that his talk about death and his criticism of our fear of it as a living creatures, was among the most enjoyable parts in this book. For example, he says : “Animals seem to have an instinct for performing death alone, hidden. Even the largest, most conspicuous ones find ways to conceal themselves in time. If an elephant missteps and dies in an open place, the herd will not leave him there; the others will pick him up and carry the body from place to place, finally putting it down in some inexplicably suitable location. When elephants encounter the skeleton of an elephant out in the open, they methodically take up each of the bones and distribute them, in a ponderous ceremony, over neighboring acres. It is a natural marvel. All of the life of the earth dies, all of the time, in the same volume as the new life that dazzles us each morning, each spring. All we see of this is the odd stump, the fly struggling on the porch floor of the summer house in October, the fragment on the highway. I have lived all my life with an embarrassment of squirrels in my back- yard, they are all over the place, all year long, and I have never seen, anywhere, a dead squirrel.”Then added, saying: “Less than a half century from now, our replacements will have more than doubled the numbers. It is hard to see how we can continue to keep the secret, with such multitudes doing the dying. We will have to give up the notion that death is catastrophe, or detestable, or avoidable, or even strange. We will need to learn more about the cycling of life in the rest of the system, and about our connection to the process. Everything that comes alive seems to be in trade for something that dies, cell for cell. There might be some comfort in the recognition of synchrony, in the formation that we all go down together, in the best of company."""
34,0140047433,http://goodreads.com/user/show/24022721-christian-schwoerke,5,"When I taught high school English in the 80s, I would spend time perusing different essay collections at used book stores, looking for matter my students could read, digest, and discuss, all within an hour. It was during this era that I first encountered Lives of a Cell and Thomas’ later essay collections. Sadly, I can’t recall which, if any, of Thomas’ essays I might’ve used. Prior to re-reading this collection, I recalled one of his essays which I hoped to re-connect with; an essay about the viral aspect of certain verbal phrases, which he had called memes. I was disappointed that this particular essay was not in this, Thomas’ first collection, because I had wanted to appraise his conception/anticipation of these two commonplace internet concepts—virulence and memes. It is because of Thomas’ use of the term meme 30 years ago that I’ve always balked (but remained calm) when contemporary usage presents meme as a union of a verbal expression and image.This re-reading of Lives of a Cell was an enjoyable excursion, both into the past and into the particular vistas Thomas offers of the micro- and macrocosmic, the cell and the world, as similar ecological systems, dependent on their constituent parts to maintain the whole. Written in 1974, only a year after Nixon signed into law the EPA, this book perfectly articulated an ecological perspective that implores a revision of man’s place in and responsibility to the world. By looking at the interactions of small symbionts in the human body, by observation of ant and termite colonies, and from the perspective the earth’s tiny place in the universe, Lewis demonstrates the remarkable fact of our continued existence in the face of Newton’s second law of thermodynamics, that we are entities (closed systems) defying disintegration through incorporation/exploitation of external energies, always seeking means to prolong entropic tendencies. Thomas taps into a sense of wonder that is often exhilarating.Other essays about language as an entity itself, one that evolves and grows, are also interesting for similar reasons, but they almost seem digressions. One thought that occurred to me in reading this collection tied in with a notion science fiction writer R.A. Lafferty introduced to me: that as a species humankind is extraordinary largely because it’s ill-adapted and incompetent to fit neatly into the ecological give and take of the world, and thus has to work around its deficiencies via makeshifts like fire, clothing, tools, etc. As a consequence, humans are in a position to upset the natural symbiosis in the world and can imperil its own existence. Thomas only alludes once or twice to this fact (that we can destroy ourselves and the world), and his message in these essays is more a wonderment at the extraordinary luck that we are conscious to appreciate our extraordinary luck."

(From ""Information."")I'm not sure that this works as a definition of what makes humans different, if you consider the propensity of e.g. dogs to veer off. Nevertheless, it's not a bad description of Thomas's essays, which meander delightfully, not always to a conclusion (his essay ""Living Language"" ends, after a long stream of etymologies, with the question ""Are you still there?""). It is a real pleasure to read such a humane, generous voice, filled with curiosity and wonder (though occasionally righteous indignation), highly rational and yet skeptically conscious of the limits of reason.And he is particularly interesting, in this collection, on the idea of language itself as humanity's purpose, in the way that an anthill is the product of a collective purpose unclear to any single ant--who can't live without its society anyway."

When an essay’s author is as masterful as Lewis Thomas, it can shine like a jewel, glittering with truths small and large. The twenty-nine pieces collected in The Lives of a Cell have a distinguished scientific pedigree, for they first appeared in the New England Journal of Medicine. Dr. Thomas, the biology watcher of the subtitle, was an expert in immunology and microbiology as well as an esteemed medical administrator. Here, he brings literary eloquence to bear on subjects that start under the microscope and then travel around the cosmos on metaphoric flights that celebrate nature’s interconnected, collaborative animation. His brief reflections—each about five pages long—on cells, etymology, and other subjects are rewarding parcels of instruction and delight."

63,0140047433,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11253958-marwa-assem-salama,4,"I never considered myself qualified enough to talk or summarize any scientific book, let alone evaluate it. Especially, if that book has won two national awards like the case here. But lately, I suffered from symptoms of emotional writing overdose; provoked useless memories and lost enthusiasm towards many activities, to the extent that I busted myself envious of a bunch of bastards who were cursing each other on Facebook’s comments section. Somehow I found it a good sign that they still have a healthy will and energy to do so. And since spiritual, religious kind of books hasn’t helped me overcome this miserable situation, I thought probably reading something scientific will do. But as you know, the more you escape from a thing, the more you encounter it. And it is better to know that the author Lewis Thomas was not merely a physician, he was a poet too. That's how, I ended up here reading some of the most sentimental, contemplative essays in science. And guess what? I’m perfectly content!Now forget about the title, this book doesn't give you the usual solid biological facts about the cell and its components, rather it does stimulate your mind to think of yourself and other creatures on this earth as if you were a part in a huge cell. Lewis says:""A good case can be made for our nonexistence as entities. We are not made up, as we had always supposed, of successively enriched packets of our own parts. We are shared, rented, occupied. At the interior of our cells, driving them, providing the oxidative energy that sends us out for the improvement of each shining day, are the mitochondria, and in a strict sense they are not ours. They turn out to be little separate creatures, the colonial posterity of migrant Prokaryocytes, probably primitive bacteria that swam into ancestral precursors of our eukaryotic cells and stayed there. Ever since, they have maintained themselves and their ways, replicating in their own fashion, privately, with their own DNA and RNA quite different from ours. They are as much “symbionts” as the Rhizobial bacteria in the roots of beans. Without them, we would not move a muscle, drum a finger, think a thought. Mitochondria are stable and responsible lodgers, and I choose to trust them. But what of the other little animals, similarly established in my cells, sorting and balancing me, clustering me together? My Centrioles, basal bodies, and probably a good many other more obscure tiny beings at work inside my cells, each with its own special genome, are as foreign, and as essential, as aphids in anthills. My cells are no longer the pure line entities I was raised with; they are ecosystems more complex than Tamaica Bay. I like to think that they work in my interest, that each breath they draw for me, but perhaps it is they who walk through the local park in the early morning, sensing my senses, listening to my music, thinking my thoughts. ""Then he added: ""I have been trying to think of the earth as a kind of organism, but it is no go. I cannot think of it this way. It is too big, too complex, with too many working parts lacking visible connections. The other night, driving through a hilly, wooded part of southern New England, I wondered about this. If not like an organism, what is it like, what is it most like? Then, satisfactorily for that moment, it came to me: it is most like a single cell. ""Lewis was fascinated by the social, overly organized life style of tiny creatures such as ants, bees and termites. “They do everything but watching television ” he said about them with genuine admiration and a little contempt toward what he is called “Our human chauvinism”. And let’s say you may find yourself familiar with a lot of stories about them in this book, especially if you were a huge fan of National Geographic’s episodes or BBC Planet Earth series. That’s wouldn’t prevent you from enjoying these parts though. He says here:""Isolated, paired termites are something else again. As soon as they are removed from the group, and the touching from all sides comes to an end, they become aggressive, standoffish; they begin drinking compulsively, and abstain from touching each other. Sometimes, they even bite off the distal halves of each other's antennae, to eliminate the temptation. Irritably, settling down to make the best of a poor situation, they begin preparations for the laying oh eggs and the taking care of the brood. Meanwhile, the mitochondria in their flight muscles go out of business. The most intensely social animals can only adapt to group behavior. Bees and ants have no option when isolated, except to die. There is really no such creature as a single individual; he has no more life of his own than a cast-off cell marooned from the surface of your skin. ""Now, if I am going to give this book an award for only one essay, it definitely would be this one. I know it is relatively long, but really worth reading. Here it is:""In fact, there are three quite different levels of technology in medicine, so unlike each other as to seem altogether different undertakings. Practitioners of medicine and the analysts will be in trouble if they are not kept separate.  I. First of all, there is a large body of what might be termed ""non-technology,"" impossible to measure in terms of its capacity to alter either the natural course of disease or its eventual outcome. A great deal of money is spent on this. It is valued highly by the professionals as well as the patients. It consists of what is sometimes called ""supportive therapy."" It is what is meant by the phrases ""caring for"" and ""standing by."" It is indispensable. It is not, however, a technology in any real sense, since it does not involve measures directed at the underlying mechanism of disease. It is what physicians used to be engaged in at the bedside of patients with diphtheria, meningitis, poliomyelitis, lobar pneumonia, and all the rest of the infectious diseases that have since come under control. It is what physicians must now do for patients with intractable cancer, severe rheumatoid arthritis, multiple sclerosis, stroke, and advanced cirrhosis. One can think of at least twenty major diseases that require this kind of supportive medical care because of the absence of an effective technology. I would include a large amount of what is called mental disease, and most varieties of cancer, in this category. The cost of this non-technology is very high, and getting higher all the time. It requires not only a great deal of time, but also very hard effort and skill on the part of physicians; only the very best of doctors are good at coping with this kind of defeat. It also involves long periods of hospitalization, lots of nursing, lots of involvement of non- medical professionals in and out of the hospital. It represents, in short, a substantial segment of today's expenditures for health. 2. At the next level up is a kind of technology best termed ""halfway technology."" This represents the kinds of things that must be done after the fact, in efforts to compensate for the incapacitating effects of certain diseases whose course one is unable to do very much about. It is a technology designed to make up for disease, or to postpone death. The outstanding examples in recent years are the transplantation's of hearts, kidneys, livers, and other organs, and the equally spectacular inventions of artificial organs. In the public mind, this kind of technology has come to seem like the equivalent of the high technologies of the physical sciences. The media tend to present each new procedure as though it represented a breakthrough and therapeutic triumph, instead of the makeshift that it really is. In fact, this level of technology is, by its nature, at the same time highly sophisticated and pro- foundry primitive. It is the kind of thing that one must continue to do until there is a genuine understanding of the mechanisms involved in disease. In chronic glomerulonephritis, for example, a much clearer insight will be needed into the events leading to the destruction of glomeruli by the immunologic reactants that now appear to govern this disease, before one will know how to intervene intelligently to prevent the process, or turn it around. But when this level of understanding has been reached, the technology of kidney replacement will not be much needed and should no longer pose the huge problems of logistics, cost, and ethics that it poses today. An extremely complex and costly technology for the management of coronary heart disease has evolved--involving specialized ambulances and hospital units, all kinds of electronic gadgetry, and whole platoons of new professional personnel--to deal with the end results of coronary thrombosis. Almost everything offered today for the treatment of heart disease is at this level of technology, with the transplanted and artificial hearts as ultimate examples. When enough has been learned to know what really goes wrong in heart disease, one ought to be in a position to figure out ways to prevent or reverse the process, and when this happens the current elaborate technology will probably be set to one side.Much of what is done in the treatment of cancer, by surgery, irradiation, and chemotherapy, represent halfway technology, in the sense that these measures are directed at the existence of already established cancer cells, but not at the mechanisms by which cells become neoplastic. It is a characteristic of this kind of technology that it costs an enormous amount of money and requires a continuing expansion of hospital facilities. There is no end to the need for new, highly trained people to run the enterprise. And there is really no way out of this, at the present state of knowledge. If the installation of specialized coronary-care units can result in the extension of life for only a few patients with coronary disease (and there is no question that this technology is effective in a few cases), it seems to me an inevitable fact of life that as many of these as can be will be put together, and as much money as can be found will be spent. I do not see that anyone has much choice in this. The only thing that can move medicine away from this level of technology is new information, and the only imaginable source of this in- formation is research. 3. The third type of technology is the kind that is so effective that it seems to attract the least public notice; it has come to be taken for granted. This is the genuinely decisive technology of modern medicine, exemplified best by modern methods for immunization against diphtheria, pertussis, and the childhood virus diseases, and the contemporary use of antibiotics and chemotherapy for bacterial infections. The capacity to deal effectively with syphilis and tuberculosis represents a milestone in human endeavor, even though full use of this potential has not yet been made. And there are, of course, other examples: the treatment of endocrinologic disorders with appropriate hormones, the prevention of hemolytic disease of the newborn, the treatment and prevention of various nutritional disorders, and perhaps just around the corner the management of Parkinsonism and sickle cell anemia. There are other examples, and everyone will have his favorite candidates for the list, but the truth is that there is nothing like as many as the public has been led to believe. The point to be made about this kind of technology-the real high technology of medicine--is that it comes as the result of a genuine understanding of disease mechanisms, and when it becomes available, it is relatively inexpensive, and relatively easy to deliver. Offhand, I cannot think of any important human disease for which medicine possesses the outright capacity to prevent or cure where the cost of the technology is itself a major problem. The price is never as high as the cost of managing the same diseases during the earlier stages of non-technology or halfway technology. If a case of typhoid fever had to be managed today by the best methods of 1935, it would run to a staggering expense. At, say, around fifty days of hospitalization, requiring the most demanding kind of nursing care, with the obsessive concern for details of diet that characterized the therapy of that time, with daily laboratory monitoring, and, on occasion, surgical intervention for abdominal catastrophe, I should think $10,0000 would be a conservative estimate for the illness, as contrasted with today's cost of a bottle of chloramphenicol and a day or two of fever. The halfway technology that was evolving for poliomyelitis in the early 1950s, just before the emergence of the basic research that made the vaccine possible, provides another illustration of the point. If I were a policy-maker, interested in saving money for health care over the long haul, I would regard it as an act of high prudence to give high priority to a lot more basic research in biologic science. This is the only way to get the full mileage that biology owes to the science of medicine, even though it seems, as used to be said in the days when the phrase still had some meaning, like asking for the moon. ""I can't deny that his talk about death and his criticism of our fear of it as a living creatures, was among the most enjoyable parts in this book. For example, he says : “Animals seem to have an instinct for performing death alone, hidden. Even the largest, most conspicuous ones find ways to conceal themselves in time. If an elephant missteps and dies in an open place, the herd will not leave him there; the others will pick him up and carry the body from place to place, finally putting it down in some inexplicably suitable location. When elephants encounter the skeleton of an elephant out in the open, they methodically take up each of the bones and distribute them, in a ponderous ceremony, over neighboring acres. It is a natural marvel. All of the life of the earth dies, all of the time, in the same volume as the new life that dazzles us each morning, each spring. All we see of this is the odd stump, the fly struggling on the porch floor of the summer house in October, the fragment on the highway. I have lived all my life with an embarrassment of squirrels in my back- yard, they are all over the place, all year long, and I have never seen, anywhere, a dead squirrel.”Then added, saying: “Less than a half century from now, our replacements will have more than doubled the numbers. It is hard to see how we can continue to keep the secret, with such multitudes doing the dying. We will have to give up the notion that death is catastrophe, or detestable, or avoidable, or even strange. We will need to learn more about the cycling of life in the rest of the system, and about our connection to the process. Everything that comes alive seems to be in trade for something that dies, cell for cell. There might be some comfort in the recognition of synchrony, in the formation that we all go down together, in the best of company."""
64,0140047433,http://goodreads.com/user/show/24022721-christian-schwoerke,5,"When I taught high school English in the 80s, I would spend time perusing different essay collections at used book stores, looking for matter my students could read, digest, and discuss, all within an hour. It was during this era that I first encountered Lives of a Cell and Thomas’ later essay collections. Sadly, I can’t recall which, if any, of Thomas’ essays I might’ve used. Prior to re-reading this collection, I recalled one of his essays which I hoped to re-connect with; an essay about the viral aspect of certain verbal phrases, which he had called memes. I was disappointed that this particular essay was not in this, Thomas’ first collection, because I had wanted to appraise his conception/anticipation of these two commonplace internet concepts—virulence and memes. It is because of Thomas’ use of the term meme 30 years ago that I’ve always balked (but remained calm) when contemporary usage presents meme as a union of a verbal expression and image.This re-reading of Lives of a Cell was an enjoyable excursion, both into the past and into the particular vistas Thomas offers of the micro- and macrocosmic, the cell and the world, as similar ecological systems, dependent on their constituent parts to maintain the whole. Written in 1974, only a year after Nixon signed into law the EPA, this book perfectly articulated an ecological perspective that implores a revision of man’s place in and responsibility to the world. By looking at the interactions of small symbionts in the human body, by observation of ant and termite colonies, and from the perspective the earth’s tiny place in the universe, Lewis demonstrates the remarkable fact of our continued existence in the face of Newton’s second law of thermodynamics, that we are entities (closed systems) defying disintegration through incorporation/exploitation of external energies, always seeking means to prolong entropic tendencies. Thomas taps into a sense of wonder that is often exhilarating.Other essays about language as an entity itself, one that evolves and grows, are also interesting for similar reasons, but they almost seem digressions. One thought that occurred to me in reading this collection tied in with a notion science fiction writer R.A. Lafferty introduced to me: that as a species humankind is extraordinary largely because it’s ill-adapted and incompetent to fit neatly into the ecological give and take of the world, and thus has to work around its deficiencies via makeshifts like fire, clothing, tools, etc. As a consequence, humans are in a position to upset the natural symbiosis in the world and can imperil its own existence. Thomas only alludes once or twice to this fact (that we can destroy ourselves and the world), and his message in these essays is more a wonderment at the extraordinary luck that we are conscious to appreciate our extraordinary luck."

(From ""Information."")I'm not sure that this works as a definition of what makes humans different, if you consider the propensity of e.g. dogs to veer off. Nevertheless, it's not a bad description of Thomas's essays, which meander delightfully, not always to a conclusion (his essay ""Living Language"" ends, after a long stream of etymologies, with the question ""Are you still there?""). It is a real pleasure to read such a humane, generous voice, filled with curiosity and wonder (though occasionally righteous indignation), highly rational and yet skeptically conscious of the limits of reason.And he is particularly interesting, in this collection, on the idea of language itself as humanity's purpose, in the way that an anthill is the product of a collective purpose unclear to any single ant--who can't live without its society anyway."

When an essay’s author is as masterful as Lewis Thomas, it can shine like a jewel, glittering with truths small and large. The twenty-nine pieces collected in The Lives of a Cell have a distinguished scientific pedigree, for they first appeared in the New England Journal of Medicine. Dr. Thomas, the biology watcher of the subtitle, was an expert in immunology and microbiology as well as an esteemed medical administrator. Here, he brings literary eloquence to bear on subjects that start under the microscope and then travel around the cosmos on metaphoric flights that celebrate nature’s interconnected, collaborative animation. His brief reflections—each about five pages long—on cells, etymology, and other subjects are rewarding parcels of instruction and delight."

93,0140047433,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11253958-marwa-assem-salama,4,"I never considered myself qualified enough to talk or summarize any scientific book, let alone evaluate it. Especially, if that book has won two national awards like the case here. But lately, I suffered from symptoms of emotional writing overdose; provoked useless memories and lost enthusiasm towards many activities, to the extent that I busted myself envious of a bunch of bastards who were cursing each other on Facebook’s comments section. Somehow I found it a good sign that they still have a healthy will and energy to do so. And since spiritual, religious kind of books hasn’t helped me overcome this miserable situation, I thought probably reading something scientific will do. But as you know, the more you escape from a thing, the more you encounter it. And it is better to know that the author Lewis Thomas was not merely a physician, he was a poet too. That's how, I ended up here reading some of the most sentimental, contemplative essays in science. And guess what? I’m perfectly content!Now forget about the title, this book doesn't give you the usual solid biological facts about the cell and its components, rather it does stimulate your mind to think of yourself and other creatures on this earth as if you were a part in a huge cell. Lewis says:""A good case can be made for our nonexistence as entities. We are not made up, as we had always supposed, of successively enriched packets of our own parts. We are shared, rented, occupied. At the interior of our cells, driving them, providing the oxidative energy that sends us out for the improvement of each shining day, are the mitochondria, and in a strict sense they are not ours. They turn out to be little separate creatures, the colonial posterity of migrant Prokaryocytes, probably primitive bacteria that swam into ancestral precursors of our eukaryotic cells and stayed there. Ever since, they have maintained themselves and their ways, replicating in their own fashion, privately, with their own DNA and RNA quite different from ours. They are as much “symbionts” as the Rhizobial bacteria in the roots of beans. Without them, we would not move a muscle, drum a finger, think a thought. Mitochondria are stable and responsible lodgers, and I choose to trust them. But what of the other little animals, similarly established in my cells, sorting and balancing me, clustering me together? My Centrioles, basal bodies, and probably a good many other more obscure tiny beings at work inside my cells, each with its own special genome, are as foreign, and as essential, as aphids in anthills. My cells are no longer the pure line entities I was raised with; they are ecosystems more complex than Tamaica Bay. I like to think that they work in my interest, that each breath they draw for me, but perhaps it is they who walk through the local park in the early morning, sensing my senses, listening to my music, thinking my thoughts. ""Then he added: ""I have been trying to think of the earth as a kind of organism, but it is no go. I cannot think of it this way. It is too big, too complex, with too many working parts lacking visible connections. The other night, driving through a hilly, wooded part of southern New England, I wondered about this. If not like an organism, what is it like, what is it most like? Then, satisfactorily for that moment, it came to me: it is most like a single cell. ""Lewis was fascinated by the social, overly organized life style of tiny creatures such as ants, bees and termites. “They do everything but watching television ” he said about them with genuine admiration and a little contempt toward what he is called “Our human chauvinism”. And let’s say you may find yourself familiar with a lot of stories about them in this book, especially if you were a huge fan of National Geographic’s episodes or BBC Planet Earth series. That’s wouldn’t prevent you from enjoying these parts though. He says here:""Isolated, paired termites are something else again. As soon as they are removed from the group, and the touching from all sides comes to an end, they become aggressive, standoffish; they begin drinking compulsively, and abstain from touching each other. Sometimes, they even bite off the distal halves of each other's antennae, to eliminate the temptation. Irritably, settling down to make the best of a poor situation, they begin preparations for the laying oh eggs and the taking care of the brood. Meanwhile, the mitochondria in their flight muscles go out of business. The most intensely social animals can only adapt to group behavior. Bees and ants have no option when isolated, except to die. There is really no such creature as a single individual; he has no more life of his own than a cast-off cell marooned from the surface of your skin. ""Now, if I am going to give this book an award for only one essay, it definitely would be this one. I know it is relatively long, but really worth reading. Here it is:""In fact, there are three quite different levels of technology in medicine, so unlike each other as to seem altogether different undertakings. Practitioners of medicine and the analysts will be in trouble if they are not kept separate.  I. First of all, there is a large body of what might be termed ""non-technology,"" impossible to measure in terms of its capacity to alter either the natural course of disease or its eventual outcome. A great deal of money is spent on this. It is valued highly by the professionals as well as the patients. It consists of what is sometimes called ""supportive therapy."" It is what is meant by the phrases ""caring for"" and ""standing by."" It is indispensable. It is not, however, a technology in any real sense, since it does not involve measures directed at the underlying mechanism of disease. It is what physicians used to be engaged in at the bedside of patients with diphtheria, meningitis, poliomyelitis, lobar pneumonia, and all the rest of the infectious diseases that have since come under control. It is what physicians must now do for patients with intractable cancer, severe rheumatoid arthritis, multiple sclerosis, stroke, and advanced cirrhosis. One can think of at least twenty major diseases that require this kind of supportive medical care because of the absence of an effective technology. I would include a large amount of what is called mental disease, and most varieties of cancer, in this category. The cost of this non-technology is very high, and getting higher all the time. It requires not only a great deal of time, but also very hard effort and skill on the part of physicians; only the very best of doctors are good at coping with this kind of defeat. It also involves long periods of hospitalization, lots of nursing, lots of involvement of non- medical professionals in and out of the hospital. It represents, in short, a substantial segment of today's expenditures for health. 2. At the next level up is a kind of technology best termed ""halfway technology."" This represents the kinds of things that must be done after the fact, in efforts to compensate for the incapacitating effects of certain diseases whose course one is unable to do very much about. It is a technology designed to make up for disease, or to postpone death. The outstanding examples in recent years are the transplantation's of hearts, kidneys, livers, and other organs, and the equally spectacular inventions of artificial organs. In the public mind, this kind of technology has come to seem like the equivalent of the high technologies of the physical sciences. The media tend to present each new procedure as though it represented a breakthrough and therapeutic triumph, instead of the makeshift that it really is. In fact, this level of technology is, by its nature, at the same time highly sophisticated and pro- foundry primitive. It is the kind of thing that one must continue to do until there is a genuine understanding of the mechanisms involved in disease. In chronic glomerulonephritis, for example, a much clearer insight will be needed into the events leading to the destruction of glomeruli by the immunologic reactants that now appear to govern this disease, before one will know how to intervene intelligently to prevent the process, or turn it around. But when this level of understanding has been reached, the technology of kidney replacement will not be much needed and should no longer pose the huge problems of logistics, cost, and ethics that it poses today. An extremely complex and costly technology for the management of coronary heart disease has evolved--involving specialized ambulances and hospital units, all kinds of electronic gadgetry, and whole platoons of new professional personnel--to deal with the end results of coronary thrombosis. Almost everything offered today for the treatment of heart disease is at this level of technology, with the transplanted and artificial hearts as ultimate examples. When enough has been learned to know what really goes wrong in heart disease, one ought to be in a position to figure out ways to prevent or reverse the process, and when this happens the current elaborate technology will probably be set to one side.Much of what is done in the treatment of cancer, by surgery, irradiation, and chemotherapy, represent halfway technology, in the sense that these measures are directed at the existence of already established cancer cells, but not at the mechanisms by which cells become neoplastic. It is a characteristic of this kind of technology that it costs an enormous amount of money and requires a continuing expansion of hospital facilities. There is no end to the need for new, highly trained people to run the enterprise. And there is really no way out of this, at the present state of knowledge. If the installation of specialized coronary-care units can result in the extension of life for only a few patients with coronary disease (and there is no question that this technology is effective in a few cases), it seems to me an inevitable fact of life that as many of these as can be will be put together, and as much money as can be found will be spent. I do not see that anyone has much choice in this. The only thing that can move medicine away from this level of technology is new information, and the only imaginable source of this in- formation is research. 3. The third type of technology is the kind that is so effective that it seems to attract the least public notice; it has come to be taken for granted. This is the genuinely decisive technology of modern medicine, exemplified best by modern methods for immunization against diphtheria, pertussis, and the childhood virus diseases, and the contemporary use of antibiotics and chemotherapy for bacterial infections. The capacity to deal effectively with syphilis and tuberculosis represents a milestone in human endeavor, even though full use of this potential has not yet been made. And there are, of course, other examples: the treatment of endocrinologic disorders with appropriate hormones, the prevention of hemolytic disease of the newborn, the treatment and prevention of various nutritional disorders, and perhaps just around the corner the management of Parkinsonism and sickle cell anemia. There are other examples, and everyone will have his favorite candidates for the list, but the truth is that there is nothing like as many as the public has been led to believe. The point to be made about this kind of technology-the real high technology of medicine--is that it comes as the result of a genuine understanding of disease mechanisms, and when it becomes available, it is relatively inexpensive, and relatively easy to deliver. Offhand, I cannot think of any important human disease for which medicine possesses the outright capacity to prevent or cure where the cost of the technology is itself a major problem. The price is never as high as the cost of managing the same diseases during the earlier stages of non-technology or halfway technology. If a case of typhoid fever had to be managed today by the best methods of 1935, it would run to a staggering expense. At, say, around fifty days of hospitalization, requiring the most demanding kind of nursing care, with the obsessive concern for details of diet that characterized the therapy of that time, with daily laboratory monitoring, and, on occasion, surgical intervention for abdominal catastrophe, I should think $10,0000 would be a conservative estimate for the illness, as contrasted with today's cost of a bottle of chloramphenicol and a day or two of fever. The halfway technology that was evolving for poliomyelitis in the early 1950s, just before the emergence of the basic research that made the vaccine possible, provides another illustration of the point. If I were a policy-maker, interested in saving money for health care over the long haul, I would regard it as an act of high prudence to give high priority to a lot more basic research in biologic science. This is the only way to get the full mileage that biology owes to the science of medicine, even though it seems, as used to be said in the days when the phrase still had some meaning, like asking for the moon. ""I can't deny that his talk about death and his criticism of our fear of it as a living creatures, was among the most enjoyable parts in this book. For example, he says : “Animals seem to have an instinct for performing death alone, hidden. Even the largest, most conspicuous ones find ways to conceal themselves in time. If an elephant missteps and dies in an open place, the herd will not leave him there; the others will pick him up and carry the body from place to place, finally putting it down in some inexplicably suitable location. When elephants encounter the skeleton of an elephant out in the open, they methodically take up each of the bones and distribute them, in a ponderous ceremony, over neighboring acres. It is a natural marvel. All of the life of the earth dies, all of the time, in the same volume as the new life that dazzles us each morning, each spring. All we see of this is the odd stump, the fly struggling on the porch floor of the summer house in October, the fragment on the highway. I have lived all my life with an embarrassment of squirrels in my back- yard, they are all over the place, all year long, and I have never seen, anywhere, a dead squirrel.”Then added, saying: “Less than a half century from now, our replacements will have more than doubled the numbers. It is hard to see how we can continue to keep the secret, with such multitudes doing the dying. We will have to give up the notion that death is catastrophe, or detestable, or avoidable, or even strange. We will need to learn more about the cycling of life in the rest of the system, and about our connection to the process. Everything that comes alive seems to be in trade for something that dies, cell for cell. There might be some comfort in the recognition of synchrony, in the formation that we all go down together, in the best of company."""
94,0140047433,http://goodreads.com/user/show/24022721-christian-schwoerke,5,"When I taught high school English in the 80s, I would spend time perusing different essay collections at used book stores, looking for matter my students could read, digest, and discuss, all within an hour. It was during this era that I first encountered Lives of a Cell and Thomas’ later essay collections. Sadly, I can’t recall which, if any, of Thomas’ essays I might’ve used. Prior to re-reading this collection, I recalled one of his essays which I hoped to re-connect with; an essay about the viral aspect of certain verbal phrases, which he had called memes. I was disappointed that this particular essay was not in this, Thomas’ first collection, because I had wanted to appraise his conception/anticipation of these two commonplace internet concepts—virulence and memes. It is because of Thomas’ use of the term meme 30 years ago that I’ve always balked (but remained calm) when contemporary usage presents meme as a union of a verbal expression and image.This re-reading of Lives of a Cell was an enjoyable excursion, both into the past and into the particular vistas Thomas offers of the micro- and macrocosmic, the cell and the world, as similar ecological systems, dependent on their constituent parts to maintain the whole. Written in 1974, only a year after Nixon signed into law the EPA, this book perfectly articulated an ecological perspective that implores a revision of man’s place in and responsibility to the world. By looking at the interactions of small symbionts in the human body, by observation of ant and termite colonies, and from the perspective the earth’s tiny place in the universe, Lewis demonstrates the remarkable fact of our continued existence in the face of Newton’s second law of thermodynamics, that we are entities (closed systems) defying disintegration through incorporation/exploitation of external energies, always seeking means to prolong entropic tendencies. Thomas taps into a sense of wonder that is often exhilarating.Other essays about language as an entity itself, one that evolves and grows, are also interesting for similar reasons, but they almost seem digressions. One thought that occurred to me in reading this collection tied in with a notion science fiction writer R.A. Lafferty introduced to me: that as a species humankind is extraordinary largely because it’s ill-adapted and incompetent to fit neatly into the ecological give and take of the world, and thus has to work around its deficiencies via makeshifts like fire, clothing, tools, etc. As a consequence, humans are in a position to upset the natural symbiosis in the world and can imperil its own existence. Thomas only alludes once or twice to this fact (that we can destroy ourselves and the world), and his message in these essays is more a wonderment at the extraordinary luck that we are conscious to appreciate our extraordinary luck."

(From ""Information."")I'm not sure that this works as a definition of what makes humans different, if you consider the propensity of e.g. dogs to veer off. Nevertheless, it's not a bad description of Thomas's essays, which meander delightfully, not always to a conclusion (his essay ""Living Language"" ends, after a long stream of etymologies, with the question ""Are you still there?""). It is a real pleasure to read such a humane, generous voice, filled with curiosity and wonder (though occasionally righteous indignation), highly rational and yet skeptically conscious of the limits of reason.And he is particularly interesting, in this collection, on the idea of language itself as humanity's purpose, in the way that an anthill is the product of a collective purpose unclear to any single ant--who can't live without its society anyway."

When an essay’s author is as masterful as Lewis Thomas, it can shine like a jewel, glittering with truths small and large. The twenty-nine pieces collected in The Lives of a Cell have a distinguished scientific pedigree, for they first appeared in the New England Journal of Medicine. Dr. Thomas, the biology watcher of the subtitle, was an expert in immunology and microbiology as well as an esteemed medical administrator. Here, he brings literary eloquence to bear on subjects that start under the microscope and then travel around the cosmos on metaphoric flights that celebrate nature’s interconnected, collaborative animation. His brief reflections—each about five pages long—on cells, etymology, and other subjects are rewarding parcels of instruction and delight."

123,0140047433,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11253958-marwa-assem-salama,4,"I never considered myself qualified enough to talk or summarize any scientific book, let alone evaluate it. Especially, if that book has won two national awards like the case here. But lately, I suffered from symptoms of emotional writing overdose; provoked useless memories and lost enthusiasm towards many activities, to the extent that I busted myself envious of a bunch of bastards who were cursing each other on Facebook’s comments section. Somehow I found it a good sign that they still have a healthy will and energy to do so. And since spiritual, religious kind of books hasn’t helped me overcome this miserable situation, I thought probably reading something scientific will do. But as you know, the more you escape from a thing, the more you encounter it. And it is better to know that the author Lewis Thomas was not merely a physician, he was a poet too. That's how, I ended up here reading some of the most sentimental, contemplative essays in science. And guess what? I’m perfectly content!Now forget about the title, this book doesn't give you the usual solid biological facts about the cell and its components, rather it does stimulate your mind to think of yourself and other creatures on this earth as if you were a part in a huge cell. Lewis says:""A good case can be made for our nonexistence as entities. We are not made up, as we had always supposed, of successively enriched packets of our own parts. We are shared, rented, occupied. At the interior of our cells, driving them, providing the oxidative energy that sends us out for the improvement of each shining day, are the mitochondria, and in a strict sense they are not ours. They turn out to be little separate creatures, the colonial posterity of migrant Prokaryocytes, probably primitive bacteria that swam into ancestral precursors of our eukaryotic cells and stayed there. Ever since, they have maintained themselves and their ways, replicating in their own fashion, privately, with their own DNA and RNA quite different from ours. They are as much “symbionts” as the Rhizobial bacteria in the roots of beans. Without them, we would not move a muscle, drum a finger, think a thought. Mitochondria are stable and responsible lodgers, and I choose to trust them. But what of the other little animals, similarly established in my cells, sorting and balancing me, clustering me together? My Centrioles, basal bodies, and probably a good many other more obscure tiny beings at work inside my cells, each with its own special genome, are as foreign, and as essential, as aphids in anthills. My cells are no longer the pure line entities I was raised with; they are ecosystems more complex than Tamaica Bay. I like to think that they work in my interest, that each breath they draw for me, but perhaps it is they who walk through the local park in the early morning, sensing my senses, listening to my music, thinking my thoughts. ""Then he added: ""I have been trying to think of the earth as a kind of organism, but it is no go. I cannot think of it this way. It is too big, too complex, with too many working parts lacking visible connections. The other night, driving through a hilly, wooded part of southern New England, I wondered about this. If not like an organism, what is it like, what is it most like? Then, satisfactorily for that moment, it came to me: it is most like a single cell. ""Lewis was fascinated by the social, overly organized life style of tiny creatures such as ants, bees and termites. “They do everything but watching television ” he said about them with genuine admiration and a little contempt toward what he is called “Our human chauvinism”. And let’s say you may find yourself familiar with a lot of stories about them in this book, especially if you were a huge fan of National Geographic’s episodes or BBC Planet Earth series. That’s wouldn’t prevent you from enjoying these parts though. He says here:""Isolated, paired termites are something else again. As soon as they are removed from the group, and the touching from all sides comes to an end, they become aggressive, standoffish; they begin drinking compulsively, and abstain from touching each other. Sometimes, they even bite off the distal halves of each other's antennae, to eliminate the temptation. Irritably, settling down to make the best of a poor situation, they begin preparations for the laying oh eggs and the taking care of the brood. Meanwhile, the mitochondria in their flight muscles go out of business. The most intensely social animals can only adapt to group behavior. Bees and ants have no option when isolated, except to die. There is really no such creature as a single individual; he has no more life of his own than a cast-off cell marooned from the surface of your skin. ""Now, if I am going to give this book an award for only one essay, it definitely would be this one. I know it is relatively long, but really worth reading. Here it is:""In fact, there are three quite different levels of technology in medicine, so unlike each other as to seem altogether different undertakings. Practitioners of medicine and the analysts will be in trouble if they are not kept separate.  I. First of all, there is a large body of what might be termed ""non-technology,"" impossible to measure in terms of its capacity to alter either the natural course of disease or its eventual outcome. A great deal of money is spent on this. It is valued highly by the professionals as well as the patients. It consists of what is sometimes called ""supportive therapy."" It is what is meant by the phrases ""caring for"" and ""standing by."" It is indispensable. It is not, however, a technology in any real sense, since it does not involve measures directed at the underlying mechanism of disease. It is what physicians used to be engaged in at the bedside of patients with diphtheria, meningitis, poliomyelitis, lobar pneumonia, and all the rest of the infectious diseases that have since come under control. It is what physicians must now do for patients with intractable cancer, severe rheumatoid arthritis, multiple sclerosis, stroke, and advanced cirrhosis. One can think of at least twenty major diseases that require this kind of supportive medical care because of the absence of an effective technology. I would include a large amount of what is called mental disease, and most varieties of cancer, in this category. The cost of this non-technology is very high, and getting higher all the time. It requires not only a great deal of time, but also very hard effort and skill on the part of physicians; only the very best of doctors are good at coping with this kind of defeat. It also involves long periods of hospitalization, lots of nursing, lots of involvement of non- medical professionals in and out of the hospital. It represents, in short, a substantial segment of today's expenditures for health. 2. At the next level up is a kind of technology best termed ""halfway technology."" This represents the kinds of things that must be done after the fact, in efforts to compensate for the incapacitating effects of certain diseases whose course one is unable to do very much about. It is a technology designed to make up for disease, or to postpone death. The outstanding examples in recent years are the transplantation's of hearts, kidneys, livers, and other organs, and the equally spectacular inventions of artificial organs. In the public mind, this kind of technology has come to seem like the equivalent of the high technologies of the physical sciences. The media tend to present each new procedure as though it represented a breakthrough and therapeutic triumph, instead of the makeshift that it really is. In fact, this level of technology is, by its nature, at the same time highly sophisticated and pro- foundry primitive. It is the kind of thing that one must continue to do until there is a genuine understanding of the mechanisms involved in disease. In chronic glomerulonephritis, for example, a much clearer insight will be needed into the events leading to the destruction of glomeruli by the immunologic reactants that now appear to govern this disease, before one will know how to intervene intelligently to prevent the process, or turn it around. But when this level of understanding has been reached, the technology of kidney replacement will not be much needed and should no longer pose the huge problems of logistics, cost, and ethics that it poses today. An extremely complex and costly technology for the management of coronary heart disease has evolved--involving specialized ambulances and hospital units, all kinds of electronic gadgetry, and whole platoons of new professional personnel--to deal with the end results of coronary thrombosis. Almost everything offered today for the treatment of heart disease is at this level of technology, with the transplanted and artificial hearts as ultimate examples. When enough has been learned to know what really goes wrong in heart disease, one ought to be in a position to figure out ways to prevent or reverse the process, and when this happens the current elaborate technology will probably be set to one side.Much of what is done in the treatment of cancer, by surgery, irradiation, and chemotherapy, represent halfway technology, in the sense that these measures are directed at the existence of already established cancer cells, but not at the mechanisms by which cells become neoplastic. It is a characteristic of this kind of technology that it costs an enormous amount of money and requires a continuing expansion of hospital facilities. There is no end to the need for new, highly trained people to run the enterprise. And there is really no way out of this, at the present state of knowledge. If the installation of specialized coronary-care units can result in the extension of life for only a few patients with coronary disease (and there is no question that this technology is effective in a few cases), it seems to me an inevitable fact of life that as many of these as can be will be put together, and as much money as can be found will be spent. I do not see that anyone has much choice in this. The only thing that can move medicine away from this level of technology is new information, and the only imaginable source of this in- formation is research. 3. The third type of technology is the kind that is so effective that it seems to attract the least public notice; it has come to be taken for granted. This is the genuinely decisive technology of modern medicine, exemplified best by modern methods for immunization against diphtheria, pertussis, and the childhood virus diseases, and the contemporary use of antibiotics and chemotherapy for bacterial infections. The capacity to deal effectively with syphilis and tuberculosis represents a milestone in human endeavor, even though full use of this potential has not yet been made. And there are, of course, other examples: the treatment of endocrinologic disorders with appropriate hormones, the prevention of hemolytic disease of the newborn, the treatment and prevention of various nutritional disorders, and perhaps just around the corner the management of Parkinsonism and sickle cell anemia. There are other examples, and everyone will have his favorite candidates for the list, but the truth is that there is nothing like as many as the public has been led to believe. The point to be made about this kind of technology-the real high technology of medicine--is that it comes as the result of a genuine understanding of disease mechanisms, and when it becomes available, it is relatively inexpensive, and relatively easy to deliver. Offhand, I cannot think of any important human disease for which medicine possesses the outright capacity to prevent or cure where the cost of the technology is itself a major problem. The price is never as high as the cost of managing the same diseases during the earlier stages of non-technology or halfway technology. If a case of typhoid fever had to be managed today by the best methods of 1935, it would run to a staggering expense. At, say, around fifty days of hospitalization, requiring the most demanding kind of nursing care, with the obsessive concern for details of diet that characterized the therapy of that time, with daily laboratory monitoring, and, on occasion, surgical intervention for abdominal catastrophe, I should think $10,0000 would be a conservative estimate for the illness, as contrasted with today's cost of a bottle of chloramphenicol and a day or two of fever. The halfway technology that was evolving for poliomyelitis in the early 1950s, just before the emergence of the basic research that made the vaccine possible, provides another illustration of the point. If I were a policy-maker, interested in saving money for health care over the long haul, I would regard it as an act of high prudence to give high priority to a lot more basic research in biologic science. This is the only way to get the full mileage that biology owes to the science of medicine, even though it seems, as used to be said in the days when the phrase still had some meaning, like asking for the moon. ""I can't deny that his talk about death and his criticism of our fear of it as a living creatures, was among the most enjoyable parts in this book. For example, he says : “Animals seem to have an instinct for performing death alone, hidden. Even the largest, most conspicuous ones find ways to conceal themselves in time. If an elephant missteps and dies in an open place, the herd will not leave him there; the others will pick him up and carry the body from place to place, finally putting it down in some inexplicably suitable location. When elephants encounter the skeleton of an elephant out in the open, they methodically take up each of the bones and distribute them, in a ponderous ceremony, over neighboring acres. It is a natural marvel. All of the life of the earth dies, all of the time, in the same volume as the new life that dazzles us each morning, each spring. All we see of this is the odd stump, the fly struggling on the porch floor of the summer house in October, the fragment on the highway. I have lived all my life with an embarrassment of squirrels in my back- yard, they are all over the place, all year long, and I have never seen, anywhere, a dead squirrel.”Then added, saying: “Less than a half century from now, our replacements will have more than doubled the numbers. It is hard to see how we can continue to keep the secret, with such multitudes doing the dying. We will have to give up the notion that death is catastrophe, or detestable, or avoidable, or even strange. We will need to learn more about the cycling of life in the rest of the system, and about our connection to the process. Everything that comes alive seems to be in trade for something that dies, cell for cell. There might be some comfort in the recognition of synchrony, in the formation that we all go down together, in the best of company."""
124,0140047433,http://goodreads.com/user/show/24022721-christian-schwoerke,5,"When I taught high school English in the 80s, I would spend time perusing different essay collections at used book stores, looking for matter my students could read, digest, and discuss, all within an hour. It was during this era that I first encountered Lives of a Cell and Thomas’ later essay collections. Sadly, I can’t recall which, if any, of Thomas’ essays I might’ve used. Prior to re-reading this collection, I recalled one of his essays which I hoped to re-connect with; an essay about the viral aspect of certain verbal phrases, which he had called memes. I was disappointed that this particular essay was not in this, Thomas’ first collection, because I had wanted to appraise his conception/anticipation of these two commonplace internet concepts—virulence and memes. It is because of Thomas’ use of the term meme 30 years ago that I’ve always balked (but remained calm) when contemporary usage presents meme as a union of a verbal expression and image.This re-reading of Lives of a Cell was an enjoyable excursion, both into the past and into the particular vistas Thomas offers of the micro- and macrocosmic, the cell and the world, as similar ecological systems, dependent on their constituent parts to maintain the whole. Written in 1974, only a year after Nixon signed into law the EPA, this book perfectly articulated an ecological perspective that implores a revision of man’s place in and responsibility to the world. By looking at the interactions of small symbionts in the human body, by observation of ant and termite colonies, and from the perspective the earth’s tiny place in the universe, Lewis demonstrates the remarkable fact of our continued existence in the face of Newton’s second law of thermodynamics, that we are entities (closed systems) defying disintegration through incorporation/exploitation of external energies, always seeking means to prolong entropic tendencies. Thomas taps into a sense of wonder that is often exhilarating.Other essays about language as an entity itself, one that evolves and grows, are also interesting for similar reasons, but they almost seem digressions. One thought that occurred to me in reading this collection tied in with a notion science fiction writer R.A. Lafferty introduced to me: that as a species humankind is extraordinary largely because it’s ill-adapted and incompetent to fit neatly into the ecological give and take of the world, and thus has to work around its deficiencies via makeshifts like fire, clothing, tools, etc. As a consequence, humans are in a position to upset the natural symbiosis in the world and can imperil its own existence. Thomas only alludes once or twice to this fact (that we can destroy ourselves and the world), and his message in these essays is more a wonderment at the extraordinary luck that we are conscious to appreciate our extraordinary luck."

(From ""Information."")I'm not sure that this works as a definition of what makes humans different, if you consider the propensity of e.g. dogs to veer off. Nevertheless, it's not a bad description of Thomas's essays, which meander delightfully, not always to a conclusion (his essay ""Living Language"" ends, after a long stream of etymologies, with the question ""Are you still there?""). It is a real pleasure to read such a humane, generous voice, filled with curiosity and wonder (though occasionally righteous indignation), highly rational and yet skeptically conscious of the limits of reason.And he is particularly interesting, in this collection, on the idea of language itself as humanity's purpose, in the way that an anthill is the product of a collective purpose unclear to any single ant--who can't live without its society anyway."

When an essay’s author is as masterful as Lewis Thomas, it can shine like a jewel, glittering with truths small and large. The twenty-nine pieces collected in The Lives of a Cell have a distinguished scientific pedigree, for they first appeared in the New England Journal of Medicine. Dr. Thomas, the biology watcher of the subtitle, was an expert in immunology and microbiology as well as an esteemed medical administrator. Here, he brings literary eloquence to bear on subjects that start under the microscope and then travel around the cosmos on metaphoric flights that celebrate nature’s interconnected, collaborative animation. His brief reflections—each about five pages long—on cells, etymology, and other subjects are rewarding parcels of instruction and delight."

Essentially, he's examining the life of segments, be it cells, bee hives, cities, even words.

153,0140047433,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11253958-marwa-assem-salama,4,"I never considered myself qualified enough to talk or summarize any scientific book, let alone evaluate it. Especially, if that book has won two national awards like the case here. But lately, I suffered from symptoms of emotional writing overdose; provoked useless memories and lost enthusiasm towards many activities, to the extent that I busted myself envious of a bunch of bastards who were cursing each other on Facebook’s comments section. Somehow I found it a good sign that they still have a healthy will and energy to do so. And since spiritual, religious kind of books hasn’t helped me overcome this miserable situation, I thought probably reading something scientific will do. But as you know, the more you escape from a thing, the more you encounter it. And it is better to know that the author Lewis Thomas was not merely a physician, he was a poet too. That's how, I ended up here reading some of the most sentimental, contemplative essays in science. And guess what? I’m perfectly content!Now forget about the title, this book doesn't give you the usual solid biological facts about the cell and its components, rather it does stimulate your mind to think of yourself and other creatures on this earth as if you were a part in a huge cell. Lewis says:""A good case can be made for our nonexistence as entities. We are not made up, as we had always supposed, of successively enriched packets of our own parts. We are shared, rented, occupied. At the interior of our cells, driving them, providing the oxidative energy that sends us out for the improvement of each shining day, are the mitochondria, and in a strict sense they are not ours. They turn out to be little separate creatures, the colonial posterity of migrant Prokaryocytes, probably primitive bacteria that swam into ancestral precursors of our eukaryotic cells and stayed there. Ever since, they have maintained themselves and their ways, replicating in their own fashion, privately, with their own DNA and RNA quite different from ours. They are as much “symbionts” as the Rhizobial bacteria in the roots of beans. Without them, we would not move a muscle, drum a finger, think a thought. Mitochondria are stable and responsible lodgers, and I choose to trust them. But what of the other little animals, similarly established in my cells, sorting and balancing me, clustering me together? My Centrioles, basal bodies, and probably a good many other more obscure tiny beings at work inside my cells, each with its own special genome, are as foreign, and as essential, as aphids in anthills. My cells are no longer the pure line entities I was raised with; they are ecosystems more complex than Tamaica Bay. I like to think that they work in my interest, that each breath they draw for me, but perhaps it is they who walk through the local park in the early morning, sensing my senses, listening to my music, thinking my thoughts. ""Then he added: ""I have been trying to think of the earth as a kind of organism, but it is no go. I cannot think of it this way. It is too big, too complex, with too many working parts lacking visible connections. The other night, driving through a hilly, wooded part of southern New England, I wondered about this. If not like an organism, what is it like, what is it most like? Then, satisfactorily for that moment, it came to me: it is most like a single cell. ""Lewis was fascinated by the social, overly organized life style of tiny creatures such as ants, bees and termites. “They do everything but watching television ” he said about them with genuine admiration and a little contempt toward what he is called “Our human chauvinism”. And let’s say you may find yourself familiar with a lot of stories about them in this book, especially if you were a huge fan of National Geographic’s episodes or BBC Planet Earth series. That’s wouldn’t prevent you from enjoying these parts though. He says here:""Isolated, paired termites are something else again. As soon as they are removed from the group, and the touching from all sides comes to an end, they become aggressive, standoffish; they begin drinking compulsively, and abstain from touching each other. Sometimes, they even bite off the distal halves of each other's antennae, to eliminate the temptation. Irritably, settling down to make the best of a poor situation, they begin preparations for the laying oh eggs and the taking care of the brood. Meanwhile, the mitochondria in their flight muscles go out of business. The most intensely social animals can only adapt to group behavior. Bees and ants have no option when isolated, except to die. There is really no such creature as a single individual; he has no more life of his own than a cast-off cell marooned from the surface of your skin. ""Now, if I am going to give this book an award for only one essay, it definitely would be this one. I know it is relatively long, but really worth reading. Here it is:""In fact, there are three quite different levels of technology in medicine, so unlike each other as to seem altogether different undertakings. Practitioners of medicine and the analysts will be in trouble if they are not kept separate.  I. First of all, there is a large body of what might be termed ""non-technology,"" impossible to measure in terms of its capacity to alter either the natural course of disease or its eventual outcome. A great deal of money is spent on this. It is valued highly by the professionals as well as the patients. It consists of what is sometimes called ""supportive therapy."" It is what is meant by the phrases ""caring for"" and ""standing by."" It is indispensable. It is not, however, a technology in any real sense, since it does not involve measures directed at the underlying mechanism of disease. It is what physicians used to be engaged in at the bedside of patients with diphtheria, meningitis, poliomyelitis, lobar pneumonia, and all the rest of the infectious diseases that have since come under control. It is what physicians must now do for patients with intractable cancer, severe rheumatoid arthritis, multiple sclerosis, stroke, and advanced cirrhosis. One can think of at least twenty major diseases that require this kind of supportive medical care because of the absence of an effective technology. I would include a large amount of what is called mental disease, and most varieties of cancer, in this category. The cost of this non-technology is very high, and getting higher all the time. It requires not only a great deal of time, but also very hard effort and skill on the part of physicians; only the very best of doctors are good at coping with this kind of defeat. It also involves long periods of hospitalization, lots of nursing, lots of involvement of non- medical professionals in and out of the hospital. It represents, in short, a substantial segment of today's expenditures for health. 2. At the next level up is a kind of technology best termed ""halfway technology."" This represents the kinds of things that must be done after the fact, in efforts to compensate for the incapacitating effects of certain diseases whose course one is unable to do very much about. It is a technology designed to make up for disease, or to postpone death. The outstanding examples in recent years are the transplantation's of hearts, kidneys, livers, and other organs, and the equally spectacular inventions of artificial organs. In the public mind, this kind of technology has come to seem like the equivalent of the high technologies of the physical sciences. The media tend to present each new procedure as though it represented a breakthrough and therapeutic triumph, instead of the makeshift that it really is. In fact, this level of technology is, by its nature, at the same time highly sophisticated and pro- foundry primitive. It is the kind of thing that one must continue to do until there is a genuine understanding of the mechanisms involved in disease. In chronic glomerulonephritis, for example, a much clearer insight will be needed into the events leading to the destruction of glomeruli by the immunologic reactants that now appear to govern this disease, before one will know how to intervene intelligently to prevent the process, or turn it around. But when this level of understanding has been reached, the technology of kidney replacement will not be much needed and should no longer pose the huge problems of logistics, cost, and ethics that it poses today. An extremely complex and costly technology for the management of coronary heart disease has evolved--involving specialized ambulances and hospital units, all kinds of electronic gadgetry, and whole platoons of new professional personnel--to deal with the end results of coronary thrombosis. Almost everything offered today for the treatment of heart disease is at this level of technology, with the transplanted and artificial hearts as ultimate examples. When enough has been learned to know what really goes wrong in heart disease, one ought to be in a position to figure out ways to prevent or reverse the process, and when this happens the current elaborate technology will probably be set to one side.Much of what is done in the treatment of cancer, by surgery, irradiation, and chemotherapy, represent halfway technology, in the sense that these measures are directed at the existence of already established cancer cells, but not at the mechanisms by which cells become neoplastic. It is a characteristic of this kind of technology that it costs an enormous amount of money and requires a continuing expansion of hospital facilities. There is no end to the need for new, highly trained people to run the enterprise. And there is really no way out of this, at the present state of knowledge. If the installation of specialized coronary-care units can result in the extension of life for only a few patients with coronary disease (and there is no question that this technology is effective in a few cases), it seems to me an inevitable fact of life that as many of these as can be will be put together, and as much money as can be found will be spent. I do not see that anyone has much choice in this. The only thing that can move medicine away from this level of technology is new information, and the only imaginable source of this in- formation is research. 3. The third type of technology is the kind that is so effective that it seems to attract the least public notice; it has come to be taken for granted. This is the genuinely decisive technology of modern medicine, exemplified best by modern methods for immunization against diphtheria, pertussis, and the childhood virus diseases, and the contemporary use of antibiotics and chemotherapy for bacterial infections. The capacity to deal effectively with syphilis and tuberculosis represents a milestone in human endeavor, even though full use of this potential has not yet been made. And there are, of course, other examples: the treatment of endocrinologic disorders with appropriate hormones, the prevention of hemolytic disease of the newborn, the treatment and prevention of various nutritional disorders, and perhaps just around the corner the management of Parkinsonism and sickle cell anemia. There are other examples, and everyone will have his favorite candidates for the list, but the truth is that there is nothing like as many as the public has been led to believe. The point to be made about this kind of technology-the real high technology of medicine--is that it comes as the result of a genuine understanding of disease mechanisms, and when it becomes available, it is relatively inexpensive, and relatively easy to deliver. Offhand, I cannot think of any important human disease for which medicine possesses the outright capacity to prevent or cure where the cost of the technology is itself a major problem. The price is never as high as the cost of managing the same diseases during the earlier stages of non-technology or halfway technology. If a case of typhoid fever had to be managed today by the best methods of 1935, it would run to a staggering expense. At, say, around fifty days of hospitalization, requiring the most demanding kind of nursing care, with the obsessive concern for details of diet that characterized the therapy of that time, with daily laboratory monitoring, and, on occasion, surgical intervention for abdominal catastrophe, I should think $10,0000 would be a conservative estimate for the illness, as contrasted with today's cost of a bottle of chloramphenicol and a day or two of fever. The halfway technology that was evolving for poliomyelitis in the early 1950s, just before the emergence of the basic research that made the vaccine possible, provides another illustration of the point. If I were a policy-maker, interested in saving money for health care over the long haul, I would regard it as an act of high prudence to give high priority to a lot more basic research in biologic science. This is the only way to get the full mileage that biology owes to the science of medicine, even though it seems, as used to be said in the days when the phrase still had some meaning, like asking for the moon. ""I can't deny that his talk about death and his criticism of our fear of it as a living creatures, was among the most enjoyable parts in this book. For example, he says : “Animals seem to have an instinct for performing death alone, hidden. Even the largest, most conspicuous ones find ways to conceal themselves in time. If an elephant missteps and dies in an open place, the herd will not leave him there; the others will pick him up and carry the body from place to place, finally putting it down in some inexplicably suitable location. When elephants encounter the skeleton of an elephant out in the open, they methodically take up each of the bones and distribute them, in a ponderous ceremony, over neighboring acres. It is a natural marvel. All of the life of the earth dies, all of the time, in the same volume as the new life that dazzles us each morning, each spring. All we see of this is the odd stump, the fly struggling on the porch floor of the summer house in October, the fragment on the highway. I have lived all my life with an embarrassment of squirrels in my back- yard, they are all over the place, all year long, and I have never seen, anywhere, a dead squirrel.”Then added, saying: “Less than a half century from now, our replacements will have more than doubled the numbers. It is hard to see how we can continue to keep the secret, with such multitudes doing the dying. We will have to give up the notion that death is catastrophe, or detestable, or avoidable, or even strange. We will need to learn more about the cycling of life in the rest of the system, and about our connection to the process. Everything that comes alive seems to be in trade for something that dies, cell for cell. There might be some comfort in the recognition of synchrony, in the formation that we all go down together, in the best of company."""
154,0140047433,http://goodreads.com/user/show/24022721-christian-schwoerke,5,"When I taught high school English in the 80s, I would spend time perusing different essay collections at used book stores, looking for matter my students could read, digest, and discuss, all within an hour. It was during this era that I first encountered Lives of a Cell and Thomas’ later essay collections. Sadly, I can’t recall which, if any, of Thomas’ essays I might’ve used. Prior to re-reading this collection, I recalled one of his essays which I hoped to re-connect with; an essay about the viral aspect of certain verbal phrases, which he had called memes. I was disappointed that this particular essay was not in this, Thomas’ first collection, because I had wanted to appraise his conception/anticipation of these two commonplace internet concepts—virulence and memes. It is because of Thomas’ use of the term meme 30 years ago that I’ve always balked (but remained calm) when contemporary usage presents meme as a union of a verbal expression and image.This re-reading of Lives of a Cell was an enjoyable excursion, both into the past and into the particular vistas Thomas offers of the micro- and macrocosmic, the cell and the world, as similar ecological systems, dependent on their constituent parts to maintain the whole. Written in 1974, only a year after Nixon signed into law the EPA, this book perfectly articulated an ecological perspective that implores a revision of man’s place in and responsibility to the world. By looking at the interactions of small symbionts in the human body, by observation of ant and termite colonies, and from the perspective the earth’s tiny place in the universe, Lewis demonstrates the remarkable fact of our continued existence in the face of Newton’s second law of thermodynamics, that we are entities (closed systems) defying disintegration through incorporation/exploitation of external energies, always seeking means to prolong entropic tendencies. Thomas taps into a sense of wonder that is often exhilarating.Other essays about language as an entity itself, one that evolves and grows, are also interesting for similar reasons, but they almost seem digressions. One thought that occurred to me in reading this collection tied in with a notion science fiction writer R.A. Lafferty introduced to me: that as a species humankind is extraordinary largely because it’s ill-adapted and incompetent to fit neatly into the ecological give and take of the world, and thus has to work around its deficiencies via makeshifts like fire, clothing, tools, etc. As a consequence, humans are in a position to upset the natural symbiosis in the world and can imperil its own existence. Thomas only alludes once or twice to this fact (that we can destroy ourselves and the world), and his message in these essays is more a wonderment at the extraordinary luck that we are conscious to appreciate our extraordinary luck."

(From ""Information."")I'm not sure that this works as a definition of what makes humans different, if you consider the propensity of e.g. dogs to veer off. Nevertheless, it's not a bad description of Thomas's essays, which meander delightfully, not always to a conclusion (his essay ""Living Language"" ends, after a long stream of etymologies, with the question ""Are you still there?""). It is a real pleasure to read such a humane, generous voice, filled with curiosity and wonder (though occasionally righteous indignation), highly rational and yet skeptically conscious of the limits of reason.And he is particularly interesting, in this collection, on the idea of language itself as humanity's purpose, in the way that an anthill is the product of a collective purpose unclear to any single ant--who can't live without its society anyway."

When an essay’s author is as masterful as Lewis Thomas, it can shine like a jewel, glittering with truths small and large. The twenty-nine pieces collected in The Lives of a Cell have a distinguished scientific pedigree, for they first appeared in the New England Journal of Medicine. Dr. Thomas, the biology watcher of the subtitle, was an expert in immunology and microbiology as well as an esteemed medical administrator. Here, he brings literary eloquence to bear on subjects that start under the microscope and then travel around the cosmos on metaphoric flights that celebrate nature’s interconnected, collaborative animation. His brief reflections—each about five pages long—on cells, etymology, and other subjects are rewarding parcels of instruction and delight."

183,0140047433,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11253958-marwa-assem-salama,4,"I never considered myself qualified enough to talk or summarize any scientific book, let alone evaluate it. Especially, if that book has won two national awards like the case here. But lately, I suffered from symptoms of emotional writing overdose; provoked useless memories and lost enthusiasm towards many activities, to the extent that I busted myself envious of a bunch of bastards who were cursing each other on Facebook’s comments section. Somehow I found it a good sign that they still have a healthy will and energy to do so. And since spiritual, religious kind of books hasn’t helped me overcome this miserable situation, I thought probably reading something scientific will do. But as you know, the more you escape from a thing, the more you encounter it. And it is better to know that the author Lewis Thomas was not merely a physician, he was a poet too. That's how, I ended up here reading some of the most sentimental, contemplative essays in science. And guess what? I’m perfectly content!Now forget about the title, this book doesn't give you the usual solid biological facts about the cell and its components, rather it does stimulate your mind to think of yourself and other creatures on this earth as if you were a part in a huge cell. Lewis says:""A good case can be made for our nonexistence as entities. We are not made up, as we had always supposed, of successively enriched packets of our own parts. We are shared, rented, occupied. At the interior of our cells, driving them, providing the oxidative energy that sends us out for the improvement of each shining day, are the mitochondria, and in a strict sense they are not ours. They turn out to be little separate creatures, the colonial posterity of migrant Prokaryocytes, probably primitive bacteria that swam into ancestral precursors of our eukaryotic cells and stayed there. Ever since, they have maintained themselves and their ways, replicating in their own fashion, privately, with their own DNA and RNA quite different from ours. They are as much “symbionts” as the Rhizobial bacteria in the roots of beans. Without them, we would not move a muscle, drum a finger, think a thought. Mitochondria are stable and responsible lodgers, and I choose to trust them. But what of the other little animals, similarly established in my cells, sorting and balancing me, clustering me together? My Centrioles, basal bodies, and probably a good many other more obscure tiny beings at work inside my cells, each with its own special genome, are as foreign, and as essential, as aphids in anthills. My cells are no longer the pure line entities I was raised with; they are ecosystems more complex than Tamaica Bay. I like to think that they work in my interest, that each breath they draw for me, but perhaps it is they who walk through the local park in the early morning, sensing my senses, listening to my music, thinking my thoughts. ""Then he added: ""I have been trying to think of the earth as a kind of organism, but it is no go. I cannot think of it this way. It is too big, too complex, with too many working parts lacking visible connections. The other night, driving through a hilly, wooded part of southern New England, I wondered about this. If not like an organism, what is it like, what is it most like? Then, satisfactorily for that moment, it came to me: it is most like a single cell. ""Lewis was fascinated by the social, overly organized life style of tiny creatures such as ants, bees and termites. “They do everything but watching television ” he said about them with genuine admiration and a little contempt toward what he is called “Our human chauvinism”. And let’s say you may find yourself familiar with a lot of stories about them in this book, especially if you were a huge fan of National Geographic’s episodes or BBC Planet Earth series. That’s wouldn’t prevent you from enjoying these parts though. He says here:""Isolated, paired termites are something else again. As soon as they are removed from the group, and the touching from all sides comes to an end, they become aggressive, standoffish; they begin drinking compulsively, and abstain from touching each other. Sometimes, they even bite off the distal halves of each other's antennae, to eliminate the temptation. Irritably, settling down to make the best of a poor situation, they begin preparations for the laying oh eggs and the taking care of the brood. Meanwhile, the mitochondria in their flight muscles go out of business. The most intensely social animals can only adapt to group behavior. Bees and ants have no option when isolated, except to die. There is really no such creature as a single individual; he has no more life of his own than a cast-off cell marooned from the surface of your skin. ""Now, if I am going to give this book an award for only one essay, it definitely would be this one. I know it is relatively long, but really worth reading. Here it is:""In fact, there are three quite different levels of technology in medicine, so unlike each other as to seem altogether different undertakings. Practitioners of medicine and the analysts will be in trouble if they are not kept separate.  I. First of all, there is a large body of what might be termed ""non-technology,"" impossible to measure in terms of its capacity to alter either the natural course of disease or its eventual outcome. A great deal of money is spent on this. It is valued highly by the professionals as well as the patients. It consists of what is sometimes called ""supportive therapy."" It is what is meant by the phrases ""caring for"" and ""standing by."" It is indispensable. It is not, however, a technology in any real sense, since it does not involve measures directed at the underlying mechanism of disease. It is what physicians used to be engaged in at the bedside of patients with diphtheria, meningitis, poliomyelitis, lobar pneumonia, and all the rest of the infectious diseases that have since come under control. It is what physicians must now do for patients with intractable cancer, severe rheumatoid arthritis, multiple sclerosis, stroke, and advanced cirrhosis. One can think of at least twenty major diseases that require this kind of supportive medical care because of the absence of an effective technology. I would include a large amount of what is called mental disease, and most varieties of cancer, in this category. The cost of this non-technology is very high, and getting higher all the time. It requires not only a great deal of time, but also very hard effort and skill on the part of physicians; only the very best of doctors are good at coping with this kind of defeat. It also involves long periods of hospitalization, lots of nursing, lots of involvement of non- medical professionals in and out of the hospital. It represents, in short, a substantial segment of today's expenditures for health. 2. At the next level up is a kind of technology best termed ""halfway technology."" This represents the kinds of things that must be done after the fact, in efforts to compensate for the incapacitating effects of certain diseases whose course one is unable to do very much about. It is a technology designed to make up for disease, or to postpone death. The outstanding examples in recent years are the transplantation's of hearts, kidneys, livers, and other organs, and the equally spectacular inventions of artificial organs. In the public mind, this kind of technology has come to seem like the equivalent of the high technologies of the physical sciences. The media tend to present each new procedure as though it represented a breakthrough and therapeutic triumph, instead of the makeshift that it really is. In fact, this level of technology is, by its nature, at the same time highly sophisticated and pro- foundry primitive. It is the kind of thing that one must continue to do until there is a genuine understanding of the mechanisms involved in disease. In chronic glomerulonephritis, for example, a much clearer insight will be needed into the events leading to the destruction of glomeruli by the immunologic reactants that now appear to govern this disease, before one will know how to intervene intelligently to prevent the process, or turn it around. But when this level of understanding has been reached, the technology of kidney replacement will not be much needed and should no longer pose the huge problems of logistics, cost, and ethics that it poses today. An extremely complex and costly technology for the management of coronary heart disease has evolved--involving specialized ambulances and hospital units, all kinds of electronic gadgetry, and whole platoons of new professional personnel--to deal with the end results of coronary thrombosis. Almost everything offered today for the treatment of heart disease is at this level of technology, with the transplanted and artificial hearts as ultimate examples. When enough has been learned to know what really goes wrong in heart disease, one ought to be in a position to figure out ways to prevent or reverse the process, and when this happens the current elaborate technology will probably be set to one side.Much of what is done in the treatment of cancer, by surgery, irradiation, and chemotherapy, represent halfway technology, in the sense that these measures are directed at the existence of already established cancer cells, but not at the mechanisms by which cells become neoplastic. It is a characteristic of this kind of technology that it costs an enormous amount of money and requires a continuing expansion of hospital facilities. There is no end to the need for new, highly trained people to run the enterprise. And there is really no way out of this, at the present state of knowledge. If the installation of specialized coronary-care units can result in the extension of life for only a few patients with coronary disease (and there is no question that this technology is effective in a few cases), it seems to me an inevitable fact of life that as many of these as can be will be put together, and as much money as can be found will be spent. I do not see that anyone has much choice in this. The only thing that can move medicine away from this level of technology is new information, and the only imaginable source of this in- formation is research. 3. The third type of technology is the kind that is so effective that it seems to attract the least public notice; it has come to be taken for granted. This is the genuinely decisive technology of modern medicine, exemplified best by modern methods for immunization against diphtheria, pertussis, and the childhood virus diseases, and the contemporary use of antibiotics and chemotherapy for bacterial infections. The capacity to deal effectively with syphilis and tuberculosis represents a milestone in human endeavor, even though full use of this potential has not yet been made. And there are, of course, other examples: the treatment of endocrinologic disorders with appropriate hormones, the prevention of hemolytic disease of the newborn, the treatment and prevention of various nutritional disorders, and perhaps just around the corner the management of Parkinsonism and sickle cell anemia. There are other examples, and everyone will have his favorite candidates for the list, but the truth is that there is nothing like as many as the public has been led to believe. The point to be made about this kind of technology-the real high technology of medicine--is that it comes as the result of a genuine understanding of disease mechanisms, and when it becomes available, it is relatively inexpensive, and relatively easy to deliver. Offhand, I cannot think of any important human disease for which medicine possesses the outright capacity to prevent or cure where the cost of the technology is itself a major problem. The price is never as high as the cost of managing the same diseases during the earlier stages of non-technology or halfway technology. If a case of typhoid fever had to be managed today by the best methods of 1935, it would run to a staggering expense. At, say, around fifty days of hospitalization, requiring the most demanding kind of nursing care, with the obsessive concern for details of diet that characterized the therapy of that time, with daily laboratory monitoring, and, on occasion, surgical intervention for abdominal catastrophe, I should think $10,0000 would be a conservative estimate for the illness, as contrasted with today's cost of a bottle of chloramphenicol and a day or two of fever. The halfway technology that was evolving for poliomyelitis in the early 1950s, just before the emergence of the basic research that made the vaccine possible, provides another illustration of the point. If I were a policy-maker, interested in saving money for health care over the long haul, I would regard it as an act of high prudence to give high priority to a lot more basic research in biologic science. This is the only way to get the full mileage that biology owes to the science of medicine, even though it seems, as used to be said in the days when the phrase still had some meaning, like asking for the moon. ""I can't deny that his talk about death and his criticism of our fear of it as a living creatures, was among the most enjoyable parts in this book. For example, he says : “Animals seem to have an instinct for performing death alone, hidden. Even the largest, most conspicuous ones find ways to conceal themselves in time. If an elephant missteps and dies in an open place, the herd will not leave him there; the others will pick him up and carry the body from place to place, finally putting it down in some inexplicably suitable location. When elephants encounter the skeleton of an elephant out in the open, they methodically take up each of the bones and distribute them, in a ponderous ceremony, over neighboring acres. It is a natural marvel. All of the life of the earth dies, all of the time, in the same volume as the new life that dazzles us each morning, each spring. All we see of this is the odd stump, the fly struggling on the porch floor of the summer house in October, the fragment on the highway. I have lived all my life with an embarrassment of squirrels in my back- yard, they are all over the place, all year long, and I have never seen, anywhere, a dead squirrel.”Then added, saying: “Less than a half century from now, our replacements will have more than doubled the numbers. It is hard to see how we can continue to keep the secret, with such multitudes doing the dying. We will have to give up the notion that death is catastrophe, or detestable, or avoidable, or even strange. We will need to learn more about the cycling of life in the rest of the system, and about our connection to the process. Everything that comes alive seems to be in trade for something that dies, cell for cell. There might be some comfort in the recognition of synchrony, in the formation that we all go down together, in the best of company."""
184,0140047433,http://goodreads.com/user/show/24022721-christian-schwoerke,5,"When I taught high school English in the 80s, I would spend time perusing different essay collections at used book stores, looking for matter my students could read, digest, and discuss, all within an hour. It was during this era that I first encountered Lives of a Cell and Thomas’ later essay collections. Sadly, I can’t recall which, if any, of Thomas’ essays I might’ve used. Prior to re-reading this collection, I recalled one of his essays which I hoped to re-connect with; an essay about the viral aspect of certain verbal phrases, which he had called memes. I was disappointed that this particular essay was not in this, Thomas’ first collection, because I had wanted to appraise his conception/anticipation of these two commonplace internet concepts—virulence and memes. It is because of Thomas’ use of the term meme 30 years ago that I’ve always balked (but remained calm) when contemporary usage presents meme as a union of a verbal expression and image.This re-reading of Lives of a Cell was an enjoyable excursion, both into the past and into the particular vistas Thomas offers of the micro- and macrocosmic, the cell and the world, as similar ecological systems, dependent on their constituent parts to maintain the whole. Written in 1974, only a year after Nixon signed into law the EPA, this book perfectly articulated an ecological perspective that implores a revision of man’s place in and responsibility to the world. By looking at the interactions of small symbionts in the human body, by observation of ant and termite colonies, and from the perspective the earth’s tiny place in the universe, Lewis demonstrates the remarkable fact of our continued existence in the face of Newton’s second law of thermodynamics, that we are entities (closed systems) defying disintegration through incorporation/exploitation of external energies, always seeking means to prolong entropic tendencies. Thomas taps into a sense of wonder that is often exhilarating.Other essays about language as an entity itself, one that evolves and grows, are also interesting for similar reasons, but they almost seem digressions. One thought that occurred to me in reading this collection tied in with a notion science fiction writer R.A. Lafferty introduced to me: that as a species humankind is extraordinary largely because it’s ill-adapted and incompetent to fit neatly into the ecological give and take of the world, and thus has to work around its deficiencies via makeshifts like fire, clothing, tools, etc. As a consequence, humans are in a position to upset the natural symbiosis in the world and can imperil its own existence. Thomas only alludes once or twice to this fact (that we can destroy ourselves and the world), and his message in these essays is more a wonderment at the extraordinary luck that we are conscious to appreciate our extraordinary luck."

(From ""Information."")I'm not sure that this works as a definition of what makes humans different, if you consider the propensity of e.g. dogs to veer off. Nevertheless, it's not a bad description of Thomas's essays, which meander delightfully, not always to a conclusion (his essay ""Living Language"" ends, after a long stream of etymologies, with the question ""Are you still there?""). It is a real pleasure to read such a humane, generous voice, filled with curiosity and wonder (though occasionally righteous indignation), highly rational and yet skeptically conscious of the limits of reason.And he is particularly interesting, in this collection, on the idea of language itself as humanity's purpose, in the way that an anthill is the product of a collective purpose unclear to any single ant--who can't live without its society anyway."

When an essay’s author is as masterful as Lewis Thomas, it can shine like a jewel, glittering with truths small and large. The twenty-nine pieces collected in The Lives of a Cell have a distinguished scientific pedigree, for they first appeared in the New England Journal of Medicine. Dr. Thomas, the biology watcher of the subtitle, was an expert in immunology and microbiology as well as an esteemed medical administrator. Here, he brings literary eloquence to bear on subjects that start under the microscope and then travel around the cosmos on metaphoric flights that celebrate nature’s interconnected, collaborative animation. His brief reflections—each about five pages long—on cells, etymology, and other subjects are rewarding parcels of instruction and delight."

Essentially, he's examining the life of segments, be it cells, bee hives, cities, even words.

213,0140047433,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11253958-marwa-assem-salama,4,"I never considered myself qualified enough to talk or summarize any scientific book, let alone evaluate it. Especially, if that book has won two national awards like the case here. But lately, I suffered from symptoms of emotional writing overdose; provoked useless memories and lost enthusiasm towards many activities, to the extent that I busted myself envious of a bunch of bastards who were cursing each other on Facebook’s comments section. Somehow I found it a good sign that they still have a healthy will and energy to do so. And since spiritual, religious kind of books hasn’t helped me overcome this miserable situation, I thought probably reading something scientific will do. But as you know, the more you escape from a thing, the more you encounter it. And it is better to know that the author Lewis Thomas was not merely a physician, he was a poet too. That's how, I ended up here reading some of the most sentimental, contemplative essays in science. And guess what? I’m perfectly content!Now forget about the title, this book doesn't give you the usual solid biological facts about the cell and its components, rather it does stimulate your mind to think of yourself and other creatures on this earth as if you were a part in a huge cell. Lewis says:""A good case can be made for our nonexistence as entities. We are not made up, as we had always supposed, of successively enriched packets of our own parts. We are shared, rented, occupied. At the interior of our cells, driving them, providing the oxidative energy that sends us out for the improvement of each shining day, are the mitochondria, and in a strict sense they are not ours. They turn out to be little separate creatures, the colonial posterity of migrant Prokaryocytes, probably primitive bacteria that swam into ancestral precursors of our eukaryotic cells and stayed there. Ever since, they have maintained themselves and their ways, replicating in their own fashion, privately, with their own DNA and RNA quite different from ours. They are as much “symbionts” as the Rhizobial bacteria in the roots of beans. Without them, we would not move a muscle, drum a finger, think a thought. Mitochondria are stable and responsible lodgers, and I choose to trust them. But what of the other little animals, similarly established in my cells, sorting and balancing me, clustering me together? My Centrioles, basal bodies, and probably a good many other more obscure tiny beings at work inside my cells, each with its own special genome, are as foreign, and as essential, as aphids in anthills. My cells are no longer the pure line entities I was raised with; they are ecosystems more complex than Tamaica Bay. I like to think that they work in my interest, that each breath they draw for me, but perhaps it is they who walk through the local park in the early morning, sensing my senses, listening to my music, thinking my thoughts. ""Then he added: ""I have been trying to think of the earth as a kind of organism, but it is no go. I cannot think of it this way. It is too big, too complex, with too many working parts lacking visible connections. The other night, driving through a hilly, wooded part of southern New England, I wondered about this. If not like an organism, what is it like, what is it most like? Then, satisfactorily for that moment, it came to me: it is most like a single cell. ""Lewis was fascinated by the social, overly organized life style of tiny creatures such as ants, bees and termites. “They do everything but watching television ” he said about them with genuine admiration and a little contempt toward what he is called “Our human chauvinism”. And let’s say you may find yourself familiar with a lot of stories about them in this book, especially if you were a huge fan of National Geographic’s episodes or BBC Planet Earth series. That’s wouldn’t prevent you from enjoying these parts though. He says here:""Isolated, paired termites are something else again. As soon as they are removed from the group, and the touching from all sides comes to an end, they become aggressive, standoffish; they begin drinking compulsively, and abstain from touching each other. Sometimes, they even bite off the distal halves of each other's antennae, to eliminate the temptation. Irritably, settling down to make the best of a poor situation, they begin preparations for the laying oh eggs and the taking care of the brood. Meanwhile, the mitochondria in their flight muscles go out of business. The most intensely social animals can only adapt to group behavior. Bees and ants have no option when isolated, except to die. There is really no such creature as a single individual; he has no more life of his own than a cast-off cell marooned from the surface of your skin. ""Now, if I am going to give this book an award for only one essay, it definitely would be this one. I know it is relatively long, but really worth reading. Here it is:""In fact, there are three quite different levels of technology in medicine, so unlike each other as to seem altogether different undertakings. Practitioners of medicine and the analysts will be in trouble if they are not kept separate.  I. First of all, there is a large body of what might be termed ""non-technology,"" impossible to measure in terms of its capacity to alter either the natural course of disease or its eventual outcome. A great deal of money is spent on this. It is valued highly by the professionals as well as the patients. It consists of what is sometimes called ""supportive therapy."" It is what is meant by the phrases ""caring for"" and ""standing by."" It is indispensable. It is not, however, a technology in any real sense, since it does not involve measures directed at the underlying mechanism of disease. It is what physicians used to be engaged in at the bedside of patients with diphtheria, meningitis, poliomyelitis, lobar pneumonia, and all the rest of the infectious diseases that have since come under control. It is what physicians must now do for patients with intractable cancer, severe rheumatoid arthritis, multiple sclerosis, stroke, and advanced cirrhosis. One can think of at least twenty major diseases that require this kind of supportive medical care because of the absence of an effective technology. I would include a large amount of what is called mental disease, and most varieties of cancer, in this category. The cost of this non-technology is very high, and getting higher all the time. It requires not only a great deal of time, but also very hard effort and skill on the part of physicians; only the very best of doctors are good at coping with this kind of defeat. It also involves long periods of hospitalization, lots of nursing, lots of involvement of non- medical professionals in and out of the hospital. It represents, in short, a substantial segment of today's expenditures for health. 2. At the next level up is a kind of technology best termed ""halfway technology."" This represents the kinds of things that must be done after the fact, in efforts to compensate for the incapacitating effects of certain diseases whose course one is unable to do very much about. It is a technology designed to make up for disease, or to postpone death. The outstanding examples in recent years are the transplantation's of hearts, kidneys, livers, and other organs, and the equally spectacular inventions of artificial organs. In the public mind, this kind of technology has come to seem like the equivalent of the high technologies of the physical sciences. The media tend to present each new procedure as though it represented a breakthrough and therapeutic triumph, instead of the makeshift that it really is. In fact, this level of technology is, by its nature, at the same time highly sophisticated and pro- foundry primitive. It is the kind of thing that one must continue to do until there is a genuine understanding of the mechanisms involved in disease. In chronic glomerulonephritis, for example, a much clearer insight will be needed into the events leading to the destruction of glomeruli by the immunologic reactants that now appear to govern this disease, before one will know how to intervene intelligently to prevent the process, or turn it around. But when this level of understanding has been reached, the technology of kidney replacement will not be much needed and should no longer pose the huge problems of logistics, cost, and ethics that it poses today. An extremely complex and costly technology for the management of coronary heart disease has evolved--involving specialized ambulances and hospital units, all kinds of electronic gadgetry, and whole platoons of new professional personnel--to deal with the end results of coronary thrombosis. Almost everything offered today for the treatment of heart disease is at this level of technology, with the transplanted and artificial hearts as ultimate examples. When enough has been learned to know what really goes wrong in heart disease, one ought to be in a position to figure out ways to prevent or reverse the process, and when this happens the current elaborate technology will probably be set to one side.Much of what is done in the treatment of cancer, by surgery, irradiation, and chemotherapy, represent halfway technology, in the sense that these measures are directed at the existence of already established cancer cells, but not at the mechanisms by which cells become neoplastic. It is a characteristic of this kind of technology that it costs an enormous amount of money and requires a continuing expansion of hospital facilities. There is no end to the need for new, highly trained people to run the enterprise. And there is really no way out of this, at the present state of knowledge. If the installation of specialized coronary-care units can result in the extension of life for only a few patients with coronary disease (and there is no question that this technology is effective in a few cases), it seems to me an inevitable fact of life that as many of these as can be will be put together, and as much money as can be found will be spent. I do not see that anyone has much choice in this. The only thing that can move medicine away from this level of technology is new information, and the only imaginable source of this in- formation is research. 3. The third type of technology is the kind that is so effective that it seems to attract the least public notice; it has come to be taken for granted. This is the genuinely decisive technology of modern medicine, exemplified best by modern methods for immunization against diphtheria, pertussis, and the childhood virus diseases, and the contemporary use of antibiotics and chemotherapy for bacterial infections. The capacity to deal effectively with syphilis and tuberculosis represents a milestone in human endeavor, even though full use of this potential has not yet been made. And there are, of course, other examples: the treatment of endocrinologic disorders with appropriate hormones, the prevention of hemolytic disease of the newborn, the treatment and prevention of various nutritional disorders, and perhaps just around the corner the management of Parkinsonism and sickle cell anemia. There are other examples, and everyone will have his favorite candidates for the list, but the truth is that there is nothing like as many as the public has been led to believe. The point to be made about this kind of technology-the real high technology of medicine--is that it comes as the result of a genuine understanding of disease mechanisms, and when it becomes available, it is relatively inexpensive, and relatively easy to deliver. Offhand, I cannot think of any important human disease for which medicine possesses the outright capacity to prevent or cure where the cost of the technology is itself a major problem. The price is never as high as the cost of managing the same diseases during the earlier stages of non-technology or halfway technology. If a case of typhoid fever had to be managed today by the best methods of 1935, it would run to a staggering expense. At, say, around fifty days of hospitalization, requiring the most demanding kind of nursing care, with the obsessive concern for details of diet that characterized the therapy of that time, with daily laboratory monitoring, and, on occasion, surgical intervention for abdominal catastrophe, I should think $10,0000 would be a conservative estimate for the illness, as contrasted with today's cost of a bottle of chloramphenicol and a day or two of fever. The halfway technology that was evolving for poliomyelitis in the early 1950s, just before the emergence of the basic research that made the vaccine possible, provides another illustration of the point. If I were a policy-maker, interested in saving money for health care over the long haul, I would regard it as an act of high prudence to give high priority to a lot more basic research in biologic science. This is the only way to get the full mileage that biology owes to the science of medicine, even though it seems, as used to be said in the days when the phrase still had some meaning, like asking for the moon. ""I can't deny that his talk about death and his criticism of our fear of it as a living creatures, was among the most enjoyable parts in this book. For example, he says : “Animals seem to have an instinct for performing death alone, hidden. Even the largest, most conspicuous ones find ways to conceal themselves in time. If an elephant missteps and dies in an open place, the herd will not leave him there; the others will pick him up and carry the body from place to place, finally putting it down in some inexplicably suitable location. When elephants encounter the skeleton of an elephant out in the open, they methodically take up each of the bones and distribute them, in a ponderous ceremony, over neighboring acres. It is a natural marvel. All of the life of the earth dies, all of the time, in the same volume as the new life that dazzles us each morning, each spring. All we see of this is the odd stump, the fly struggling on the porch floor of the summer house in October, the fragment on the highway. I have lived all my life with an embarrassment of squirrels in my back- yard, they are all over the place, all year long, and I have never seen, anywhere, a dead squirrel.”Then added, saying: “Less than a half century from now, our replacements will have more than doubled the numbers. It is hard to see how we can continue to keep the secret, with such multitudes doing the dying. We will have to give up the notion that death is catastrophe, or detestable, or avoidable, or even strange. We will need to learn more about the cycling of life in the rest of the system, and about our connection to the process. Everything that comes alive seems to be in trade for something that dies, cell for cell. There might be some comfort in the recognition of synchrony, in the formation that we all go down together, in the best of company."""
214,0140047433,http://goodreads.com/user/show/24022721-christian-schwoerke,5,"When I taught high school English in the 80s, I would spend time perusing different essay collections at used book stores, looking for matter my students could read, digest, and discuss, all within an hour. It was during this era that I first encountered Lives of a Cell and Thomas’ later essay collections. Sadly, I can’t recall which, if any, of Thomas’ essays I might’ve used. Prior to re-reading this collection, I recalled one of his essays which I hoped to re-connect with; an essay about the viral aspect of certain verbal phrases, which he had called memes. I was disappointed that this particular essay was not in this, Thomas’ first collection, because I had wanted to appraise his conception/anticipation of these two commonplace internet concepts—virulence and memes. It is because of Thomas’ use of the term meme 30 years ago that I’ve always balked (but remained calm) when contemporary usage presents meme as a union of a verbal expression and image.This re-reading of Lives of a Cell was an enjoyable excursion, both into the past and into the particular vistas Thomas offers of the micro- and macrocosmic, the cell and the world, as similar ecological systems, dependent on their constituent parts to maintain the whole. Written in 1974, only a year after Nixon signed into law the EPA, this book perfectly articulated an ecological perspective that implores a revision of man’s place in and responsibility to the world. By looking at the interactions of small symbionts in the human body, by observation of ant and termite colonies, and from the perspective the earth’s tiny place in the universe, Lewis demonstrates the remarkable fact of our continued existence in the face of Newton’s second law of thermodynamics, that we are entities (closed systems) defying disintegration through incorporation/exploitation of external energies, always seeking means to prolong entropic tendencies. Thomas taps into a sense of wonder that is often exhilarating.Other essays about language as an entity itself, one that evolves and grows, are also interesting for similar reasons, but they almost seem digressions. One thought that occurred to me in reading this collection tied in with a notion science fiction writer R.A. Lafferty introduced to me: that as a species humankind is extraordinary largely because it’s ill-adapted and incompetent to fit neatly into the ecological give and take of the world, and thus has to work around its deficiencies via makeshifts like fire, clothing, tools, etc. As a consequence, humans are in a position to upset the natural symbiosis in the world and can imperil its own existence. Thomas only alludes once or twice to this fact (that we can destroy ourselves and the world), and his message in these essays is more a wonderment at the extraordinary luck that we are conscious to appreciate our extraordinary luck."

(From ""Information."")I'm not sure that this works as a definition of what makes humans different, if you consider the propensity of e.g. dogs to veer off. Nevertheless, it's not a bad description of Thomas's essays, which meander delightfully, not always to a conclusion (his essay ""Living Language"" ends, after a long stream of etymologies, with the question ""Are you still there?""). It is a real pleasure to read such a humane, generous voice, filled with curiosity and wonder (though occasionally righteous indignation), highly rational and yet skeptically conscious of the limits of reason.And he is particularly interesting, in this collection, on the idea of language itself as humanity's purpose, in the way that an anthill is the product of a collective purpose unclear to any single ant--who can't live without its society anyway."

When an essay’s author is as masterful as Lewis Thomas, it can shine like a jewel, glittering with truths small and large. The twenty-nine pieces collected in The Lives of a Cell have a distinguished scientific pedigree, for they first appeared in the New England Journal of Medicine. Dr. Thomas, the biology watcher of the subtitle, was an expert in immunology and microbiology as well as an esteemed medical administrator. Here, he brings literary eloquence to bear on subjects that start under the microscope and then travel around the cosmos on metaphoric flights that celebrate nature’s interconnected, collaborative animation. His brief reflections—each about five pages long—on cells, etymology, and other subjects are rewarding parcels of instruction and delight."

Essentially, he's examining the life of segments, be it cells, bee hives, cities, even words.

But lately, I suffered from symptoms of emotional writing overdose; provoked useless memories and lost enthusiasm towards many activities, to the extent that I busted myself envious of a bunch of bastards who were cursing each other on Facebook’s comments section. Somehow I found it a good sign that they still have a healthy will and energy to do so. And since spiritual, religious kind of books hasn’t helped me overcome this miserable situation, I thought probably reading something scientific will do. But as you know, the more you escape from a thing, the more you encounter it. And it is better to know that the author Lewis Thomas was not merely a physician, he was a poet too. That's how, I ended up here reading some of the most sentimental, contemplative essays in science. And guess what? I’m perfectly content!Now forget about the title, this book doesn't give you the usual solid biological facts about the cell and its components, rather it does stimulate your mind to think of yourself and other creatures on this earth as if you were a part in a huge cell. Lewis says:""A good case can be made for our nonexistence as entities. We are not made up, as we had always supposed, of successively enriched packets of our own parts. We are shared, rented, occupied. At the interior of our cells, driving them, providing the oxidative energy that sends us out for the improvement of each shining day, are the mitochondria, and in a strict sense they are not ours. They turn out to be little separate creatures, the colonial posterity of migrant Prokaryocytes, probably primitive bacteria that swam into ancestral precursors of our eukaryotic cells and stayed there. Ever since, they have maintained themselves and their ways, replicating in their own fashion, privately, with their own DNA and RNA quite different from ours. They are as much “symbionts” as the Rhizobial bacteria in the roots of beans. Without them, we would not move a muscle, drum a finger, think a thought. Mitochondria are stable and responsible lodgers, and I choose to trust them. But what of the other little animals, similarly established in my cells, sorting and balancing me, clustering me together? My Centrioles, basal bodies, and probably a good many other more obscure tiny beings at work inside my cells, each with its own special genome, are as foreign, and as essential, as aphids in anthills. My cells are no longer the pure line entities I was raised with; they are ecosystems more complex than Tamaica Bay. I like to think that they work in my interest, that each breath they draw for me, but perhaps it is they who walk through the local park in the early morning, sensing my senses, listening to my music, thinking my thoughts. ""Then he added: ""I have been trying to think of the earth as a kind of organism, but it is no go. I cannot think of it this way. It is too big, too complex, with too many working parts lacking visible connections. The other night, driving through a hilly, wooded part of southern New England, I wondered about this. If not like an organism, what is it like, what is it most like? Then, satisfactorily for that moment, it came to me: it is most like a single cell. ""Lewis was fascinated by the social, overly organized life style of tiny creatures such as ants, bees and termites. “They do everything but watching television ” he said about them with genuine admiration and a little contempt toward what he is called “Our human chauvinism”. And let’s say you may find yourself familiar with a lot of stories about them in this book, especially if you were a huge fan of National Geographic’s episodes or BBC Planet Earth series. That’s wouldn’t prevent you from enjoying these parts though. He says here:""Isolated, paired termites are something else again. As soon as they are removed from the group, and the touching from all sides comes to an end, they become aggressive, standoffish; they begin drinking compulsively, and abstain from touching each other. Sometimes, they even bite off the distal halves of each other's antennae, to eliminate the temptation. Irritably, settling down to make the best of a poor situation, they begin preparations for the laying oh eggs and the taking care of the brood. Meanwhile, the mitochondria in their flight muscles go out of business. The most intensely social animals can only adapt to group behavior. Bees and ants have no option when isolated, except to die. There is really no such creature as a single individual; he has no more life of his own than a cast-off cell marooned from the surface of your skin. ""Now, if I am going to give this book an award for only one essay, it definitely would be this one. I know it is relatively long, but really worth reading. Here it is:""In fact, there are three quite different levels of technology in medicine, so unlike each other as to seem altogether different undertakings. Practitioners of medicine and the analysts will be in trouble if they are not kept separate.  I. First of all, there is a large body of what might be termed ""non-technology,"" impossible to measure in terms of its capacity to alter either the natural course of disease or its eventual outcome. A great deal of money is spent on this. It is valued highly by the professionals as well as the patients. It consists of what is sometimes called ""supportive therapy."" It is what is meant by the phrases ""caring for"" and ""standing by."" It is indispensable. It is not, however, a technology in any real sense, since it does not involve measures directed at the underlying mechanism of disease. It is what physicians used to be engaged in at the bedside of patients with diphtheria, meningitis, poliomyelitis, lobar pneumonia, and all the rest of the infectious diseases that have since come under control. It is what physicians must now do for patients with intractable cancer, severe rheumatoid arthritis, multiple sclerosis, stroke, and advanced cirrhosis. One can think of at least twenty major diseases that require this kind of supportive medical care because of the absence of an effective technology. I would include a large amount of what is called mental disease, and most varieties of cancer, in this category. The cost of this non-technology is very high, and getting higher all the time. It requires not only a great deal of time, but also very hard effort and skill on the part of physicians; only the very best of doctors are good at coping with this kind of defeat. It also involves long periods of hospitalization, lots of nursing, lots of involvement of non- medical professionals in and out of the hospital. It represents, in short, a substantial segment of today's expenditures for health. 2. At the next level up is a kind of technology best termed ""halfway technology."" This represents the kinds of things that must be done after the fact, in efforts to compensate for the incapacitating effects of certain diseases whose course one is unable to do very much about. It is a technology designed to make up for disease, or to postpone death. The outstanding examples in recent years are the transplantation's of hearts, kidneys, livers, and other organs, and the equally spectacular inventions of artificial organs. In the public mind, this kind of technology has come to seem like the equivalent of the high technologies of the physical sciences. The media tend to present each new procedure as though it represented a breakthrough and therapeutic triumph, instead of the makeshift that it really is. In fact, this level of technology is, by its nature, at the same time highly sophisticated and pro- foundry primitive. It is the kind of thing that one must continue to do until there is a genuine understanding of the mechanisms involved in disease. In chronic glomerulonephritis, for example, a much clearer insight will be needed into the events leading to the destruction of glomeruli by the immunologic reactants that now appear to govern this disease, before one will know how to intervene intelligently to prevent the process, or turn it around. But when this level of understanding has been reached, the technology of kidney replacement will not be much needed and should no longer pose the huge problems of logistics, cost, and ethics that it poses today. An extremely complex and costly technology for the management of coronary heart disease has evolved--involving specialized ambulances and hospital units, all kinds of electronic gadgetry, and whole platoons of new professional personnel--to deal with the end results of coronary thrombosis. Almost everything offered today for the treatment of heart disease is at this level of technology, with the transplanted and artificial hearts as ultimate examples. When enough has been learned to know what really goes wrong in heart disease, one ought to be in a position to figure out ways to prevent or reverse the process, and when this happens the current elaborate technology will probably be set to one side.Much of what is done in the treatment of cancer, by surgery, irradiation, and chemotherapy, represent halfway technology, in the sense that these measures are directed at the existence of already established cancer cells, but not at the mechanisms by which cells become neoplastic. It is a characteristic of this kind of technology that it costs an enormous amount of money and requires a continuing expansion of hospital facilities. There is no end to the need for new, highly trained people to run the enterprise. And there is really no way out of this, at the present state of knowledge. If the installation of specialized coronary-care units can result in the extension of life for only a few patients with coronary disease (and there is no question that this technology is effective in a few cases), it seems to me an inevitable fact of life that as many of these as can be will be put together, and as much money as can be found will be spent. I do not see that anyone has much choice in this. The only thing that can move medicine away from this level of technology is new information, and the only imaginable source of this in- formation is research. 3. The third type of technology is the kind that is so effective that it seems to attract the least public notice; it has come to be taken for granted. This is the genuinely decisive technology of modern medicine, exemplified best by modern methods for immunization against diphtheria, pertussis, and the childhood virus diseases, and the contemporary use of antibiotics and chemotherapy for bacterial infections. The capacity to deal effectively with syphilis and tuberculosis represents a milestone in human endeavor, even though full use of this potential has not yet been made. And there are, of course, other examples: the treatment of endocrinologic disorders with appropriate hormones, the prevention of hemolytic disease of the newborn, the treatment and prevention of various nutritional disorders, and perhaps just around the corner the management of Parkinsonism and sickle cell anemia. There are other examples, and everyone will have his favorite candidates for the list, but the truth is that there is nothing like as many as the public has been led to believe. The point to be made about this kind of technology-the real high technology of medicine--is that it comes as the result of a genuine understanding of disease mechanisms, and when it becomes available, it is relatively inexpensive, and relatively easy to deliver. Offhand, I cannot think of any important human disease for which medicine possesses the outright capacity to prevent or cure where the cost of the technology is itself a major problem. The price is never as high as the cost of managing the same diseases during the earlier stages of non-technology or halfway technology. If a case of typhoid fever had to be managed today by the best methods of 1935, it would run to a staggering expense. At, say, around fifty days of hospitalization, requiring the most demanding kind of nursing care, with the obsessive concern for details of diet that characterized the therapy of that time, with daily laboratory monitoring, and, on occasion, surgical intervention for abdominal catastrophe, I should think $10,0000 would be a conservative estimate for the illness, as contrasted with today's cost of a bottle of chloramphenicol and a day or two of fever. The halfway technology that was evolving for poliomyelitis in the early 1950s, just before the emergence of the basic research that made the vaccine possible, provides another illustration of the point. If I were a policy-maker, interested in saving money for health care over the long haul, I would regard it as an act of high prudence to give high priority to a lot more basic research in biologic science. This is the only way to get the full mileage that biology owes to the science of medicine, even though it seems, as used to be said in the days when the phrase still had some meaning, like asking for the moon. ""I can't deny that his talk about death and his criticism of our fear of it as a living creatures, was among the most enjoyable parts in this book. For example, he says : “Animals seem to have an instinct for performing death alone, hidden. Even the largest, most conspicuous ones find ways to conceal themselves in time. If an elephant missteps and dies in an open place, the herd will not leave him there; the others will pick him up and carry the body from place to place, finally putting it down in some inexplicably suitable location. When elephants encounter the skeleton of an elephant out in the open, they methodically take up each of the bones and distribute them, in a ponderous ceremony, over neighboring acres. It is a natural marvel. All of the life of the earth dies, all of the time, in the same volume as the new life that dazzles us each morning, each spring. All we see of this is the odd stump, the fly struggling on the porch floor of the summer house in October, the fragment on the highway. I have lived all my life with an embarrassment of squirrels in my back- yard, they are all over the place, all year long, and I have never seen, anywhere, a dead squirrel.”Then added, saying: “Less than a half century from now, our replacements will have more than doubled the numbers. It is hard to see how we can continue to keep the secret, with such multitudes doing the dying. We will have to give up the notion that death is catastrophe, or detestable, or avoidable, or even strange. We will need to learn more about the cycling of life in the rest of the system, and about our connection to the process. Everything that comes alive seems to be in trade for something that dies, cell for cell. There might be some comfort in the recognition of synchrony, in the formation that we all go down together, in the best of company."""
244,0140047433,http://goodreads.com/user/show/24022721-christian-schwoerke,5,"When I taught high school English in the 80s, I would spend time perusing different essay collections at used book stores, looking for matter my students could read, digest, and discuss, all within an hour. It was during this era that I first encountered Lives of a Cell and Thomas’ later essay collections. Sadly, I can’t recall which, if any, of Thomas’ essays I might’ve used. Prior to re-reading this collection, I recalled one of his essays which I hoped to re-connect with; an essay about the viral aspect of certain verbal phrases, which he had called memes. I was disappointed that this particular essay was not in this, Thomas’ first collection, because I had wanted to appraise his conception/anticipation of these two commonplace internet concepts—virulence and memes. It is because of Thomas’ use of the term meme 30 years ago that I’ve always balked (but remained calm) when contemporary usage presents meme as a union of a verbal expression and image.This re-reading of Lives of a Cell was an enjoyable excursion, both into the past and into the particular vistas Thomas offers of the micro- and macrocosmic, the cell and the world, as similar ecological systems, dependent on their constituent parts to maintain the whole. Written in 1974, only a year after Nixon signed into law the EPA, this book perfectly articulated an ecological perspective that implores a revision of man’s place in and responsibility to the world. By looking at the interactions of small symbionts in the human body, by observation of ant and termite colonies, and from the perspective the earth’s tiny place in the universe, Lewis demonstrates the remarkable fact of our continued existence in the face of Newton’s second law of thermodynamics, that we are entities (closed systems) defying disintegration through incorporation/exploitation of external energies, always seeking means to prolong entropic tendencies. Thomas taps into a sense of wonder that is often exhilarating.Other essays about language as an entity itself, one that evolves and grows, are also interesting for similar reasons, but they almost seem digressions. One thought that occurred to me in reading this collection tied in with a notion science fiction writer R.A. Lafferty introduced to me: that as a species humankind is extraordinary largely because it’s ill-adapted and incompetent to fit neatly into the ecological give and take of the world, and thus has to work around its deficiencies via makeshifts like fire, clothing, tools, etc. As a consequence, humans are in a position to upset the natural symbiosis in the world and can imperil its own existence. Thomas only alludes once or twice to this fact (that we can destroy ourselves and the world), and his message in these essays is more a wonderment at the extraordinary luck that we are conscious to appreciate our extraordinary luck."

(From ""Information."")I'm not sure that this works as a definition of what makes humans different, if you consider the propensity of e.g. dogs to veer off. Nevertheless, it's not a bad description of Thomas's essays, which meander delightfully, not always to a conclusion (his essay ""Living Language"" ends, after a long stream of etymologies, with the question ""Are you still there?""). It is a real pleasure to read such a humane, generous voice, filled with curiosity and wonder (though occasionally righteous indignation), highly rational and yet skeptically conscious of the limits of reason.And he is particularly interesting, in this collection, on the idea of language itself as humanity's purpose, in the way that an anthill is the product of a collective purpose unclear to any single ant--who can't live without its society anyway."

When an essay’s author is as masterful as Lewis Thomas, it can shine like a jewel, glittering with truths small and large. The twenty-nine pieces collected in The Lives of a Cell have a distinguished scientific pedigree, for they first appeared in the New England Journal of Medicine. Dr. Thomas, the biology watcher of the subtitle, was an expert in immunology and microbiology as well as an esteemed medical administrator. Here, he brings literary eloquence to bear on subjects that start under the microscope and then travel around the cosmos on metaphoric flights that celebrate nature’s interconnected, collaborative animation. His brief reflections—each about five pages long—on cells, etymology, and other subjects are rewarding parcels of instruction and delight."

Essentially, he's examining the life of segments, be it cells, bee hives, cities, even words.

I’m perfectly content!Now forget about the title, this book doesn't give you the usual solid biological facts about the cell and its components, rather it does stimulate your mind to think of yourself and other creatures on this earth as if you were a part in a huge cell. Lewis says:""A good case can be made for our nonexistence as entities. We are not made up, as we had always supposed, of successively enriched packets of our own parts. We are shared, rented, occupied. At the interior of our cells, driving them, providing the oxidative energy that sends us out for the improvement of each shining day, are the mitochondria, and in a strict sense they are not ours. They turn out to be little separate creatures, the colonial posterity of migrant Prokaryocytes, probably primitive bacteria that swam into ancestral precursors of our eukaryotic cells and stayed there. Ever since, they have maintained themselves and their ways, replicating in their own fashion, privately, with their own DNA and RNA quite different from ours. They are as much “symbionts” as the Rhizobial bacteria in the roots of beans. Without them, we would not move a muscle, drum a finger, think a thought. Mitochondria are stable and responsible lodgers, and I choose to trust them. But what of the other little animals, similarly established in my cells, sorting and balancing me, clustering me together? My Centrioles, basal bodies, and probably a good many other more obscure tiny beings at work inside my cells, each with its own special genome, are as foreign, and as essential, as aphids in anthills. My cells are no longer the pure line entities I was raised with; they are ecosystems more complex than Tamaica Bay. I like to think that they work in my interest, that each breath they draw for me, but perhaps it is they who walk through the local park in the early morning, sensing my senses, listening to my music, thinking my thoughts. ""Then he added: ""I have been trying to think of the earth as a kind of organism, but it is no go. I cannot think of it this way. It is too big, too complex, with too many working parts lacking visible connections. The other night, driving through a hilly, wooded part of southern New England, I wondered about this. If not like an organism, what is it like, what is it most like? Then, satisfactorily for that moment, it came to me: it is most like a single cell. ""Lewis was fascinated by the social, overly organized life style of tiny creatures such as ants, bees and termites. “They do everything but watching television ” he said about them with genuine admiration and a little contempt toward what he is called “Our human chauvinism”. And let’s say you may find yourself familiar with a lot of stories about them in this book, especially if you were a huge fan of National Geographic’s episodes or BBC Planet Earth series. That’s wouldn’t prevent you from enjoying these parts though. He says here:""Isolated, paired termites are something else again. As soon as they are removed from the group, and the touching from all sides comes to an end, they become aggressive, standoffish; they begin drinking compulsively, and abstain from touching each other. Sometimes, they even bite off the distal halves of each other's antennae, to eliminate the temptation. Irritably, settling down to make the best of a poor situation, they begin preparations for the laying oh eggs and the taking care of the brood. Meanwhile, the mitochondria in their flight muscles go out of business. The most intensely social animals can only adapt to group behavior. Bees and ants have no option when isolated, except to die. There is really no such creature as a single individual; he has no more life of his own than a cast-off cell marooned from the surface of your skin. ""Now, if I am going to give this book an award for only one essay, it definitely would be this one. I know it is relatively long, but really worth reading. Here it is:""In fact, there are three quite different levels of technology in medicine, so unlike each other as to seem altogether different undertakings. Practitioners of medicine and the analysts will be in trouble if they are not kept separate.  I. First of all, there is a large body of what might be termed ""non-technology,"" impossible to measure in terms of its capacity to alter either the natural course of disease or its eventual outcome. A great deal of money is spent on this. It is valued highly by the professionals as well as the patients. It consists of what is sometimes called ""supportive therapy."" It is what is meant by the phrases ""caring for"" and ""standing by."" It is indispensable. It is not, however, a technology in any real sense, since it does not involve measures directed at the underlying mechanism of disease. It is what physicians used to be engaged in at the bedside of patients with diphtheria, meningitis, poliomyelitis, lobar pneumonia, and all the rest of the infectious diseases that have since come under control. It is what physicians must now do for patients with intractable cancer, severe rheumatoid arthritis, multiple sclerosis, stroke, and advanced cirrhosis. One can think of at least twenty major diseases that require this kind of supportive medical care because of the absence of an effective technology. I would include a large amount of what is called mental disease, and most varieties of cancer, in this category. The cost of this non-technology is very high, and getting higher all the time. It requires not only a great deal of time, but also very hard effort and skill on the part of physicians; only the very best of doctors are good at coping with this kind of defeat. It also involves long periods of hospitalization, lots of nursing, lots of involvement of non- medical professionals in and out of the hospital. It represents, in short, a substantial segment of today's expenditures for health. 2. At the next level up is a kind of technology best termed ""halfway technology."" This represents the kinds of things that must be done after the fact, in efforts to compensate for the incapacitating effects of certain diseases whose course one is unable to do very much about. It is a technology designed to make up for disease, or to postpone death. The outstanding examples in recent years are the transplantation's of hearts, kidneys, livers, and other organs, and the equally spectacular inventions of artificial organs. In the public mind, this kind of technology has come to seem like the equivalent of the high technologies of the physical sciences. The media tend to present each new procedure as though it represented a breakthrough and therapeutic triumph, instead of the makeshift that it really is. In fact, this level of technology is, by its nature, at the same time highly sophisticated and pro- foundry primitive. It is the kind of thing that one must continue to do until there is a genuine understanding of the mechanisms involved in disease. In chronic glomerulonephritis, for example, a much clearer insight will be needed into the events leading to the destruction of glomeruli by the immunologic reactants that now appear to govern this disease, before one will know how to intervene intelligently to prevent the process, or turn it around. But when this level of understanding has been reached, the technology of kidney replacement will not be much needed and should no longer pose the huge problems of logistics, cost, and ethics that it poses today. An extremely complex and costly technology for the management of coronary heart disease has evolved--involving specialized ambulances and hospital units, all kinds of electronic gadgetry, and whole platoons of new professional personnel--to deal with the end results of coronary thrombosis. Almost everything offered today for the treatment of heart disease is at this level of technology, with the transplanted and artificial hearts as ultimate examples. When enough has been learned to know what really goes wrong in heart disease, one ought to be in a position to figure out ways to prevent or reverse the process, and when this happens the current elaborate technology will probably be set to one side.Much of what is done in the treatment of cancer, by surgery, irradiation, and chemotherapy, represent halfway technology, in the sense that these measures are directed at the existence of already established cancer cells, but not at the mechanisms by which cells become neoplastic. It is a characteristic of this kind of technology that it costs an enormous amount of money and requires a continuing expansion of hospital facilities. There is no end to the need for new, highly trained people to run the enterprise. And there is really no way out of this, at the present state of knowledge. If the installation of specialized coronary-care units can result in the extension of life for only a few patients with coronary disease (and there is no question that this technology is effective in a few cases), it seems to me an inevitable fact of life that as many of these as can be will be put together, and as much money as can be found will be spent. I do not see that anyone has much choice in this. The only thing that can move medicine away from this level of technology is new information, and the only imaginable source of this in- formation is research. 3. The third type of technology is the kind that is so effective that it seems to attract the least public notice; it has come to be taken for granted. This is the genuinely decisive technology of modern medicine, exemplified best by modern methods for immunization against diphtheria, pertussis, and the childhood virus diseases, and the contemporary use of antibiotics and chemotherapy for bacterial infections. The capacity to deal effectively with syphilis and tuberculosis represents a milestone in human endeavor, even though full use of this potential has not yet been made. And there are, of course, other examples: the treatment of endocrinologic disorders with appropriate hormones, the prevention of hemolytic disease of the newborn, the treatment and prevention of various nutritional disorders, and perhaps just around the corner the management of Parkinsonism and sickle cell anemia. There are other examples, and everyone will have his favorite candidates for the list, but the truth is that there is nothing like as many as the public has been led to believe. The point to be made about this kind of technology-the real high technology of medicine--is that it comes as the result of a genuine understanding of disease mechanisms, and when it becomes available, it is relatively inexpensive, and relatively easy to deliver. Offhand, I cannot think of any important human disease for which medicine possesses the outright capacity to prevent or cure where the cost of the technology is itself a major problem. The price is never as high as the cost of managing the same diseases during the earlier stages of non-technology or halfway technology. If a case of typhoid fever had to be managed today by the best methods of 1935, it would run to a staggering expense. At, say, around fifty days of hospitalization, requiring the most demanding kind of nursing care, with the obsessive concern for details of diet that characterized the therapy of that time, with daily laboratory monitoring, and, on occasion, surgical intervention for abdominal catastrophe, I should think $10,0000 would be a conservative estimate for the illness, as contrasted with today's cost of a bottle of chloramphenicol and a day or two of fever. The halfway technology that was evolving for poliomyelitis in the early 1950s, just before the emergence of the basic research that made the vaccine possible, provides another illustration of the point. If I were a policy-maker, interested in saving money for health care over the long haul, I would regard it as an act of high prudence to give high priority to a lot more basic research in biologic science. This is the only way to get the full mileage that biology owes to the science of medicine, even though it seems, as used to be said in the days when the phrase still had some meaning, like asking for the moon. ""I can't deny that his talk about death and his criticism of our fear of it as a living creatures, was among the most enjoyable parts in this book. For example, he says : “Animals seem to have an instinct for performing death alone, hidden. Even the largest, most conspicuous ones find ways to conceal themselves in time. If an elephant missteps and dies in an open place, the herd will not leave him there; the others will pick him up and carry the body from place to place, finally putting it down in some inexplicably suitable location. When elephants encounter the skeleton of an elephant out in the open, they methodically take up each of the bones and distribute them, in a ponderous ceremony, over neighboring acres. It is a natural marvel. All of the life of the earth dies, all of the time, in the same volume as the new life that dazzles us each morning, each spring. All we see of this is the odd stump, the fly struggling on the porch floor of the summer house in October, the fragment on the highway. I have lived all my life with an embarrassment of squirrels in my back- yard, they are all over the place, all year long, and I have never seen, anywhere, a dead squirrel.”Then added, saying: “Less than a half century from now, our replacements will have more than doubled the numbers. It is hard to see how we can continue to keep the secret, with such multitudes doing the dying. We will have to give up the notion that death is catastrophe, or detestable, or avoidable, or even strange. We will need to learn more about the cycling of life in the rest of the system, and about our connection to the process. Everything that comes alive seems to be in trade for something that dies, cell for cell. There might be some comfort in the recognition of synchrony, in the formation that we all go down together, in the best of company."""
274,0140047433,http://goodreads.com/user/show/24022721-christian-schwoerke,5,"When I taught high school English in the 80s, I would spend time perusing different essay collections at used book stores, looking for matter my students could read, digest, and discuss, all within an hour. It was during this era that I first encountered Lives of a Cell and Thomas’ later essay collections. Sadly, I can’t recall which, if any, of Thomas’ essays I might’ve used. Prior to re-reading this collection, I recalled one of his essays which I hoped to re-connect with; an essay about the viral aspect of certain verbal phrases, which he had called memes. I was disappointed that this particular essay was not in this, Thomas’ first collection, because I had wanted to appraise his conception/anticipation of these two commonplace internet concepts—virulence and memes. It is because of Thomas’ use of the term meme 30 years ago that I’ve always balked (but remained calm) when contemporary usage presents meme as a union of a verbal expression and image.This re-reading of Lives of a Cell was an enjoyable excursion, both into the past and into the particular vistas Thomas offers of the micro- and macrocosmic, the cell and the world, as similar ecological systems, dependent on their constituent parts to maintain the whole. Written in 1974, only a year after Nixon signed into law the EPA, this book perfectly articulated an ecological perspective that implores a revision of man’s place in and responsibility to the world. By looking at the interactions of small symbionts in the human body, by observation of ant and termite colonies, and from the perspective the earth’s tiny place in the universe, Lewis demonstrates the remarkable fact of our continued existence in the face of Newton’s second law of thermodynamics, that we are entities (closed systems) defying disintegration through incorporation/exploitation of external energies, always seeking means to prolong entropic tendencies. Thomas taps into a sense of wonder that is often exhilarating.Other essays about language as an entity itself, one that evolves and grows, are also interesting for similar reasons, but they almost seem digressions. One thought that occurred to me in reading this collection tied in with a notion science fiction writer R.A. Lafferty introduced to me: that as a species humankind is extraordinary largely because it’s ill-adapted and incompetent to fit neatly into the ecological give and take of the world, and thus has to work around its deficiencies via makeshifts like fire, clothing, tools, etc. As a consequence, humans are in a position to upset the natural symbiosis in the world and can imperil its own existence. Thomas only alludes once or twice to this fact (that we can destroy ourselves and the world), and his message in these essays is more a wonderment at the extraordinary luck that we are conscious to appreciate our extraordinary luck."

(From ""Information."")I'm not sure that this works as a definition of what makes humans different, if you consider the propensity of e.g. dogs to veer off. Nevertheless, it's not a bad description of Thomas's essays, which meander delightfully, not always to a conclusion (his essay ""Living Language"" ends, after a long stream of etymologies, with the question ""Are you still there?""). It is a real pleasure to read such a humane, generous voice, filled with curiosity and wonder (though occasionally righteous indignation), highly rational and yet skeptically conscious of the limits of reason.And he is particularly interesting, in this collection, on the idea of language itself as humanity's purpose, in the way that an anthill is the product of a collective purpose unclear to any single ant--who can't live without its society anyway."

When an essay’s author is as masterful as Lewis Thomas, it can shine like a jewel, glittering with truths small and large. The twenty-nine pieces collected in The Lives of a Cell have a distinguished scientific pedigree, for they first appeared in the New England Journal of Medicine. Dr. Thomas, the biology watcher of the subtitle, was an expert in immunology and microbiology as well as an esteemed medical administrator. Here, he brings literary eloquence to bear on subjects that start under the microscope and then travel around the cosmos on metaphoric flights that celebrate nature’s interconnected, collaborative animation. His brief reflections—each about five pages long—on cells, etymology, and other subjects are rewarding parcels of instruction and delight."

Essentially, he's examining the life of segments, be it cells, bee hives, cities, even words.
