Addressing key topics in largely qualitative terms without formal mathematics, the six selections discuss atoms in motion, basic physics, the relation of physics to other sciences, conservation of energy, the theory of gravitation, and quantum behavior.تاریخ نخستین خوانش: ماه نوامبر سال 2009 میلادی عنوان: شش قطعهٔ آسان؛ نویسنده: ریچارد فاینمن؛ مترجم محمدرضا بهاری؛ تهران، هرمس، 1387، در نه، 198ص؛ مصور؛ شابک 9789643635558؛ موضوع نوشتارهای علمی از دانشمندان امریکایی - مبانی فیزیک به روایت ریچارد فاینمن - سده 20متصور غلط و رایجی هست که علم مقوله ‌ای است فاقد جنبه‌ های شخصی، بی‌طرف و کاملاً واقع‌نگر اسن؛ فعالیت‌های انسانی‌ِ دیگر، بیشترشان متأثر از روندهای رایج، خواسته ها و اشخاص‌ هستند؛ اما فرض بر آن است که علم محدود به قواعد و روش‌های پذیرفته‌ شده و مقید به آزمون‌های بسیار دقیق‌ است؛ مهم نتایج هستند؛ نه کسانی که آنها را به دست می‌آورندعلم هم همچون همه‌ ی تلاش‌های انسان فعالیتی است انگیخته‌ ی آدمیزاد و به همین مناسبت تابع مد و هوس است؛ در این مورد آنچه مُد را تعیین می‌کند، بیش از آنکه موضوع بحث باشد، جهان‌ بینی دانشمندان است؛ هر دورانی به شیوه‌ ی ویژه ی خود با مسائل علمی رودررو می‌شود، و این رویکرد معمولاً پس از آن برگزیده می‌شود، که شخصیت‌های علمی‌ِ پیشگام، و با نفوذ، دستور کار را تعیین، و بهترین روش‌های رسیدن به نتیجه را شرح کرده‌ اند؛ گاهی دانشمندان آنقدر پرآوازه می‌شوند، که توجه‌ همگی مردمان را هم جلب می‌کنند، و اگر از موهبت استعداد شگرف هم بهره‌ مند باشند، ممکن است نماد تمامی جامعه‌ ی علمی شوند؛ ریچارد فاینمن، همچون نیوتون، و آینشتین، نماد فیزیک آخرین دهه‌ های سده ی بیستم میلادی شدند، و ایشان نخستین آمریکایی‌ ست، که به این جایگاه رسیده اند؛ نقل از متن پشت جلد: ...؛ اما مهم‌ترین کشف در کل نجوم این است که ستاره‌ ها هم از همان نوع اتم‌هایی که در زمین داریم درست شده‌ اند؛ وای که در هر جمله‌ ی این داستان مختصر چقدر مطلب هست...؛ شاعران گفته‌ اند که علم، زیبایی ستاره‌ ها را ضایع می‌کند، چون‌که آن‌ها را صرفاً کُره‌ هایی از اتم‌ها و مولکول‌های گاز می‌داند...؛ امّا من هم می‌توانم ستاره‌ ها را در آسمان شبِ کویر ببینم و شکوه و زیبایی‌شان را حس کنم...؛ شیفته و مبهوت این چرخ فلک، با چشم‌های کوچکم می‌توانم نورهایی به قدمت یک میلیون سال را هم ببینم؛ چه نقش و نگار عظیم و پر ابهتی است اینکه خود من هم جزئی از آنم. آنچه تنم را ساخته، شاید روزگاری شراره‌ ای بوده باشد که از ستاره‌ ی فراموش شده‌ ای بیرون زده است؛ یا می‌توانم این چرخِ فلک را با چشم‌ بزرگ تلسکوپ پالومار تماشا کنم و ببینم که ستاره‌ ها دارند از همدیگر، از نقطه‌ ی آغازی که شاید زمانی سرچشمه‌ ی همه‌گی‌شان بوده‌ است، دور می‌شوند؛ این نقش چگونه است، معنی این حرکت‌ها چیست؟ جست‌وجو برای فهمیدن این چیزها گمان نمی‌کنم لطمه‌ ای به رمز و راز و زیباییِ این چرخ فلک بزند؛ راستی شاعران امروزی چرا حرفی از این چیزها نمی‌زنند؟ چه‌ جور مردمانی هستند این شاعران که اگر ژوپیتر خدایی در هیئتِ انسان باشد چه شعرها که برایش نمی‌سرایند اما اگر در قالبِ کره‌ ی عظیم چرخانی از متان و آمونیاک باشد سکوت می‌کنند؛ پایان نقل از متن پشت جلد کتاب ا. شربیانی"
1,0465023924,http://goodreads.com/user/show/639407-tulpesh-patel,4,"There is not much more to be said about Richard Feynman’s impact on physics or science communication; the man is as bona-fide legend and as close to being a worshipable God as scientists can have. Six Easy Pieces is a collection of the ‘easiest’ six chapters from Richard Feynman’s most-celebrated text book The Feynman Lectures on Physics. The ‘easy’ in the title, is, like our sense of time, all relative. The lectures, delivered in the early 60’s, were aimed at “the most intelligent in the class [freshman and sophomore physics students at Caltech, one of the most prestigious institutions in the world] and to make sure, if possible, that even the most intelligent student was unable to encompass everything…” We, as the general reader, are more like the ‘secondary’ audience for the lectures, who for Feyman at the time were the students “for whom the extra fireworks are merely disquieting and who cannot be expected to learn the material in the lecture at all”. Such was Feynman’s power of exposition, however, you can follow the science, each chapter getting progressively more complicated and abstract, without ever feeling like you’re being left behind.The first three chapters, on Atoms in Motion, Basic Physics, and the Relation of Physics to Other Sciences, were so good I read them twice. Their broad remit means they touch on lots of different things, with one astonishing idea thrown in after the other. Mind-body dualism from a physicists perspective: “When an animal learns something, it can do something different than it could before, and its brain cells must have changed too, if it is made out of atoms. In what way is it different?”The final three chapters, on the Conservation of Energy, the Theory of Gravitation and Quantum behaviour are a little heavier, but no less interesting. There’s the occasional formula, which immediately starts the eyes glazing over, but, to the lay reader, they serve to remind you just how much of the book is mathematics translated into wonderful, approachable prose. I’ve read about things like Heisenberg’s Uncertainty Principle or the “double-slit” experiment, which showed that at the quantum level particles behave both waves and particles, many times before, but is actually the first time that I really *got it*. For that, I cannot recommend the book enough. For those looking for more pop-physics in a similar vein, I can really recommend Why Does E=MC2 by Brian Cox and Jeff Forshaw, Quantum by Manjit Kumar and Black Holes, Worm Holes and Time Machines by Jim Al-Khalili. Having now read Six Easy Pieces, I can see the obvious influence of Feynman on the not just their content but their delivery and style.There are also three prefaces to the edition of the book I read. Paul Davies’ introduction and David Goldstein’s special preface set the backdrop to the book and the lectures. The most interesting preface is the one written by Feynman himself for the original edition, in which he talks about how he set about piecing the course together, who it was aimed at and why, and how ultimately he felt that he had let his students down in some way. It shows just how much thought he put into the lectures and just how much he cared about educating his students. In some way, as someone enjoys teaching and talking about science, I learnt a lot from these few pages as I did from the rest of the book. Its 50 years since The Feynman Lectures on Physics were published. Our understanding of the universe, and particularly quantum mechanics, has moved on in leaps and bounds but at no point did Six Easy Pieces feel like it was out of date because Feynman’s timeless ways of explaining complicated physics in uncomplicated ways. "
2,0465023924,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1655438-courtney-lindwall,3,"Note to reader: I am not within Feynman's target demographic...So if anyone is familiar with Feynman's ""claim to fame,"" it's basically the idea that he's the most brilliant Physicis teacher of the 20th century and his lectures are ingenius in both their presentation and method. Now, I'm not the most science-inclined person out there. I've never taken even a preliminary physics course (and these lectures were intended for his intro Caltech class, so...). But I'm also not dumb as a rock, either. With that said, I didn't understand much of this book. I could follow along vaguely and in general terms. But could I explain to someone else what gravitational energy is now? Definitely not. In fact, I can barely remember the different topics in the book now because of how little I actually retained about them.For people who think this is going to be a magical book that will teach what were once almost mysteriously complicated ideas with wonderful simplicity - think again. You would never become truly knowledgeable on any of these topics with only this small of an overview. But, if you are scientifically inclined, it might at least be interesting and prompt you to take your learning further. It does get more technical than I thought it would. Although nowhere near as technical as the topics actually go.All in all, I didn't really enjoy it. Which is why it's 3 stars. But I could see its merit for Physics students and it did bring to light various big questions about science in general, which is why it didn't get 2 or 1. "

"
4,0465023924,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3742957-brent,4,Contains the best explanation for the uncertainty principle I have come across. Still trying to wrap my mind around quantum mechanics though.
5,0465023924,http://goodreads.com/user/show/14129090-laoonatic,5,"I think that, when reading this book, you have to be familiar with physics and maths. There are a lot of books claiming to be for the neophytes in physics/maths/astrology etc. but, truth be told, there is little to be learned when in that position. Which is why people shouldn't consider this book as being no good just because they haven't reached the paradise of enlightment which was promised to them. Such a thing isn't possible. Not from a single book, as far as I know, and anyway, not from this one. I've been studying both maths and physics for quite some time, but in the manner of a poorly prepared educational system, meaning the focus was more on solving problems and ingesting pages of theory and less on really understanding them. And Feynman's lessons really shed some light on the mess in my head. I can't claim I thoroughly understood everything in this book, but I surely enjoyed Feynman's way of following gradually to smaller scales what happens in an apparently simple process, until he reaches the ""core"" of it.Also, you can't ignore his way of being even poetic at times, which is really why this book won my heart. I have a weakness for science being romanticized. And all ovations go to Richard Feynman for doing this so tactfully."
6,0465023924,http://goodreads.com/user/show/53036232-rebecca,3,"so this book (if you were at all interested) is a collection of the six 'most basic' lectures delivered by richard feynman when he taught caltech 1st year physics undergrads in the early 1960s. feynman is famously an excellent communicator and very good at explaining physics-y things and coming up with analogies. honestly though, i was a little disappointed.admittedly, i thought the chapter on quantum behaviour (6) was *fantastic*, and probably the best and most thorough explanation i've come across. the maths was a little elusive and unexplained, but that didn't bother me too much as i'm sure i'll learn about it in time & it's not necessary to understand what's going on. but i would definitely recommend this chapter (which you can read online for free - http://www.feynmanlectures.caltech.ed...) to anyone to wants to understand quantum behaviour. + i did also enjoy the first two chapters in the book as well, which were on atoms in motion and basic physics.the rest of the book, however, was quite meh. the chapter on the relationship between physics and other sciences (3) was often very vague and seemed to be stating the obvious a lot of the time, although i did find it quite interesting in places (for instance the section on geology and biology, even if the latter seemed to drag on a bit). chapter (4) which was on conservation of energy was pretty confusing sometimes and otherwise pretty unmemorable.so, pretty hit and miss... 2.5 stars? "
7,0465023924,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11233506-christopher,4,A really lucid introduction to physics—lecture style. 
8,0465023924,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2105523-bob-nichols,3,"In these lectures, Feynman is very good at explaining some basic concepts for those fairly new to physics. For field theory, he uses the analogy of waves in a pool to show how motion in one place affects motion in a distant place. He says that matter goes straight unless acted upon by an external force, but we don't know why; that the earth is pulled toward the sun, as opposed to the earth moving around the sun; and that atoms are always in motion (""jigglings and wigglings of atoms"") and that such movement increases with the application of heat. Feynman stimulates some interesting issues and questions. Under the principle of conservation of energy, the overall amount of energy remains constant; only re-arrangement of energy/atoms occurs. Feynman states that in joining together, atoms ""like certain particular partners, certain particular directions, and so on."" In this way he explains why atom combinations (attraction) take particular forms and resist being something other than such forms. This 'integrity' at the quantum level suggests a 'social' context where atoms interact with each other for particular 'reasons' and that an 'inner character' lies at the heart of quantum physics, as opposed to randomness. Feynman also writes that atoms ""want"" and that ""It is the job of physics to analyze why each one wants what it wants."" ""Want"" is an interesting choice of words. He defines inertia by saying that ""If something is moving, with nothing touching it and completely undisturbed, it will go on forever, coasting at a uniform speed in a straight line. (Why does it keep on coasting? We do not know, but that is the way it is.)"" Does the reference to ""coasting"" mean that a body is passively carried along in space? If so, carried by what, and what is space? Feynman says we don't really know what energy is, but does it involve a 'power' differential where matter and energy move to states of equilibrium? If this is so, then is this one way that gravity (differences in mass and distance) might have a parallel at the quantum level (weight of atoms as they combine or recombine)? Feynman writes that ""all planets push and pull each other."" If ""pull"" is attraction of bodies to each other, it's not clear what push means. For that matter, it's also not clear how ""push and pull"" relate to Einstein's spacetime curvature (oddly, Feynman discusses Einstein's relativity only briefly). Regarding push-pull (attraction-resistance) Feynman makes some suggestive comments when he states that ""the force of electricity between two charged objects looks just like the law of gravitation...."" In describing the earth's movement around the sun, Feynman says that the earth impinges ""on more particles which are coming from its forward side than from its hind side."" Does this mean that the earth ""bunches up space"" (""particles"") as it moves through its orbit and is this related to the earth's gravity? Elsewhere, Feynman states that ""the earth can be understood to be round merely because everything attracts everything else and so it has attracted itself together as far as it can!"" Gravity is not some (mystical) force at the center of the earth, but a pulling of matter and energy inward, against itself, toward the center. While this is all fun stuff to think about, these Feynman lectures do not enlighten much a lay person's understanding of the uncertainty principle, annhilation and antimatter, and absolute time. His last lecture on quantum behavior is particularly difficult. Feynman is at his best discussing the role of doubt and uncertainty in science. When he differs with the theories of the past or of his contemporaries, he seems respectful enough, saying that they are not wrong, but ""a little wrong"" or ""incomplete."" His footnote at the bottom of p. 59 directly challenges those who say wonder and awe are the province of poetry and religion, not science. He also blends life and non-life together when he says that ""'Everything is made of atoms....there is nothing that living things do that cannot be understood from the point of view that they are made of atoms acting according to the laws of physics.'"" This is Feynman at his best, and a good challenge for those attempting to put philosophy on a solid materialistic foundation.  "
9,0465023924,http://goodreads.com/user/show/61033954-m-r,4,"Great book. Feynman is as enigmatic as usual and his descriptions are vivid and inspiring. He begins discussing atoms and shows us how we can understand the world around us using the simple concept of 'jiggling' atoms. I found this to be a profound and exiting way of understanding how things truly work, for example, why does tea cool down when we blow on it? Well, we cause some of the atoms (well molecules in reality) of the tea to get so excited and jiggly that they break away from the liquid and fly off into the air. The more jiggly they are to start with, the more likely they are to break off, thus the tea gets less jiggly and jigglyness is equivalent to heat. Hence the tea gets cooler. The sections on conversational energy, Gravitation and Quantum mechanics are a little basic but interesting nonetheless (after all these are the easy pieces)! "
10,0465023924,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2309246-cassandra-kay-silva,5,I think it is very rare for someone to be not only brilliant but also a wonderful teacher. Feynman has a very clear and direct style of imparting information. I just love it. Not quite as good as his autobiographical one but still very good. 
11,0465023924,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5413456-gina,3,"Apparently these are the 6 ""easiest to understand"" (despite the inclusion of quantum mechanics!"") of the Feynman lectures. Some of them flit too much from one thing to another; I'm sure they were interesting as lectures but they are not the ideal way to read about a topic. However, the way Feynman explains certain concrete idea is really interesting; in particular the chapter on quantum mechanics is good and easy to follow. I'm on the fence as to whether to read the full set of lectures."
12,0465023924,http://goodreads.com/user/show/21177142-roger,4,"In the early 1960s the renown physicist, Richard Feynman, delivered introductory courses on physics to first and second year undergraduate students at Caltech, in the USA. His lectures were very popular at the time and whilst aimed at undergraduates, it wasn't uncommon for graduate physics students to infiltrate his classes; the one thing Feynman could be assured of was a full house each time he came to teach this course. The lectures, after some editing, were published in three large volumes. To provide a flavour of the overall series, this book extracts just six from the collection and, as the title of this book suggests, these are regarded as being six of the easier ones to understand. They're entitled ""Atoms in motion"", ""Basic physics, ""The relation of physics to other sciences"", ""Conservation of energy"", ""The theory of gravitation"" and ""Quantum behaviour"". (There is a companion volume published under the title ""Six not-so-easy pieces"" but I've not attempted to read that.) I was attracted to this book not so much by the subject matter, but more by my interest in Feynman himself. He has a solid reputation for being an inspirational teacher and I was keen to see how he managed to achieve this. I was expecting him to take a different strategy from the norm and I wasn't disappointed. To illustrate what I mean, in his lecture on the atom he didn't follow the conventional approach of describing the structure of atoms and building up from there, yet by the end of the talk his students would have heard a physicist's explanation of why blowing on a bowl of soup cools it down. His approach to teaching was so different to what is usually done.Understandably, given the date of the lectures, there have been major developments in physics, and science in general, since the lectures were first presented. For instance, the talk on nuclear physics is very out of date because the make-up of protons and neutrons was not understand at that time to the extent that it is now. Likewise, the lecture covering the links between physics and biology pre-dates the discovery of the genetic code. Therefore, it is pointless reading this book to gain an understanding of the latest theories. Nevertheless, not everything has changed in 50 years and some lectures are as relevant today as they were then. For example, the lecture on the conservation of energy was wonderfully presented, especially the section on potential energy where Feynman used illustrated examples to explain the conservation of potential energy in reversible machines. On the other hand, I felt he made heavy weather of his account of the two slit experiment in his lecture on quantum mechanics and I've read much better explanations elsewhere. To a marked extent Feynman did over complicate much of his material but this is to expected since his stated intention was to teach to slightly beyond the level of the brightest students in each class; of course, whether or not this was the best strategy is open to debate.Overall, this book of six ""easy"" lectures provides remarkable insight into Feynman's style of teaching. He comes across as someone who knew his subject matter inside out, who had boundless energy and complete self-confidence, and who wanted to stretch the minds of his students."
13,0465023924,http://goodreads.com/user/show/896694-mark,2,"If you have heard about the ""weirdness"" of quantum mechanics but don't know what the hype is all about, look no further than chapter six of this book. In chapter six, with his usual down-to-earth approach, Feynman describes one of the most famous experiments in physics (the double-slit experiment) and what it tells us about the way fundamental particles behave. He compares the behavior of ""lumps"" to the behavior of ""waves"" before moving on to the behavior of electrons... and the outcome might surprise you (it surprised early 20th-century physicists, too). This is a classic lesson in quantum mechanics taught by one of the classic teachers of physics. And there's no math required.I only gave this book two stars because the other five lectures in this book aren't overly memorable and come nowhere near to being Feynman's greatest lessons. But chapter six alone makes this book worth picking up, especially if you want an introduction to wave-particle duality, the uncertainty principle, and the conundrum of quantum measurement that is accessible to the layperson but that also demands that you stretch your mind. It's a brief introduction that cuts to the essence of what is going on and, while giving you a decent grounding, will leave you ready to dig deeper and learn more."
14,0465023924,http://goodreads.com/user/show/104304660-elsie,1,"The thing that bothers me about this is that physics sounds interesting in a book like this but I did my high school physics and first year physics at university and the core of it, the thing you had to learn and understand want the fascinating results and conclusions, it was the collection of vast amounts of data and then the math. The formulas, the statistical analysis, the endless calculation. It's math (maths?). It's all math. And math is beautiful sometimes but it's also a huge amount of grunt learning. I could have recited everything in this book and completely failed every exam in first year university physics if I did. I didn't fail though. Instead I learn how to use the formulas and solve problem questions. That's how you pass. Maybe I'm just bitter but none of this was part of my first year physics 😜"
15,0465023924,http://goodreads.com/user/show/27195238-menglong-youk,5,"4.5/5 starsI picked up this book several months ago and then dropped it despite nearly finishing it due to the complexity of the last chapter: Quantum Behavior. This by no means implies that the book is difficult as a whole.I thoroughly enjoyed the first three chapters: Atoms in Motion, Basic Physics, and the Relations of Physics to Other Sciences. The method he chose to explain the concepts in these chapters was elegant and easy to understand. He compared our understanding the law of physics to watching a game of chess played by the gods (not personal gods) and we humans as observers knowing nothing about the chess rules. However, I have difficulty with understanding quantum mechanics when he started involving mathematic equation, which I particularly have no formal education. I might as well come back to this chapter once I have a better understanding of mathematics.Overall, I would recommend ""Six Easy Pieces"" to anyone who is interested in science, physics especially, to check it out. You might have already known the concepts, but you'll be amazed by his styles."
16,0465023924,http://goodreads.com/user/show/156533-rob,4,"Almost five-stars. For someone like me (i.e., a layperson that has no background in physics whatsoever), this is a great introduction to the mysterious world of physics—it is humorous and accessible and makes an effort to be ""approximately accurate"" about everything (while calling itself out on things that are simplified for the sake of the example or else ""unknown or unknowable""). However, to be ""approximately accurate about everything"" means a bunch of math and other fancy-pants equations that look like this:|ĥ₁ + ĥ₂|² = |ĥ₁|² + |ĥ₂|² + 2|ĥ₁||ĥ₂| cos δ...which despite my best efforts remain cloaked in physics' mysterious shroud.""Easy Pieces"", these are not.However, Feynman explains the subject matter well—and certainly better than most other folks that have tried to write this sort of thing.I'm adding him to my short list of heroes."
17,0465023924,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1664750-connie-kuntz,5,"This book is truly mind-opening and I am convinced that Feynman was one enlightened dude. As I read the book, I felt myself opening up to the concept of atoms, amalgamations, energy, astronomy, gravity, light years, colliders and quantum physics. There was humor, history and simplified experiments in the book, too, which gave the field of Physics an ""inviting"" feeling, rather than a snooty one. The first five chapters were wonderful, but I struggled quite a bit with Chapter 6. To be clear: I still have no grasp on these difficult theories and concepts but now I feel like I have a genuine appreciation for the science and a new way of looking at our world. I learned something that is diffiuclt for me to articulate but I will try: I learned that Physics truly welcomes the connection between past and present, quantum leaps and forward thoughts, the galaxy and a glass of wine, a spiritual presence and Dennis the Menace and much, much more. "
18,0465023924,http://goodreads.com/user/show/22224713-john-gribbin,4,"One of the biggest influences on my scientific career, and later my career as a populariser of science, was the multi-volume Feynman Lectures on Physics which appeared in the early 1960s. This epitome of that masterwork really does offer an easy guide to what physics, and science in general, is all about. Feynman explores the most fundamental scientific theories that all intelligent people should be aware of – the structure and behaviour of atoms, quantum mechanics and gravity. These are the fundamentals that ought to be as well known as Shakespeare, Mozart and Picasso. The material is essentially a transcript of Feynman lecturing (you can even get the lectures themselves on a CD to accompany the book), and comes across like a wise friend giving you the inside story on a subject he loves."
19,0465023924,http://goodreads.com/user/show/567005-colleen,3,"Previously, I had read Richard Feynman's ""What Do You Care What They Think"" & absolutely loved it! It goes without saying that Richard Feynman, a Nobel Prize winner in Physics, is beyond brilliant....but I said it anyway. I enjoy his writing & his joy of discovery in all things scientific. If I'd had a Physics professor like him maybe I would've understood it or had more interest in physical sciences. That said, I found this book very interesting and informative but the formulas & concepts were sometimes a little foreign to me. He was aiming for the brightest of his CalTech first year Physics students & I think I'm missing a little bit of their experience/education in Physics. I found it illuminating; however, I don't think I could explain what I learned without re-reading some sections. I'll probably read some other books by him because I enjoy his ""joie de vivre"". For me, this was 3.5 stars."
20,0465023924,http://goodreads.com/user/show/69500282-hamid,5,"I love this book. I wonder why I didn't study physics when I was younger. It is so fascinating. Physics is probably the most significant science of all time. It has had its impact already on many fronts. There'd be no transistors or cell phones without physics. If we don't apply Einstein's equations into the satellites we build, our GPS will render useless. Physics also has an intimate relationship with other scientific fields like astronomy, chemistry, biology, etc. I think this book is relatively easy to understand even if you have no background in physics. There are times though you may feel a bit out of your depth, especially as we get into the mystifying realm of quantum mechanics. Be that as it may, it is still a good source of knowledge for the physics majors as well as laypeople. You have to read the book with the caveat that it was written back in the 1960's and so a lot were not known back then. For instance, the strong nuclear force was not discovered yet. hope you enjoy."
21,0465023924,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2201886-mike,4,"I have read several other books by and about Richard Feynman: a man whose brilliance and oddness were well known within the Physics community, but sadly only his eccentricities were known by most of the wider world.This book is not really about Feynman, rather it is six chapters excised out of a two-year course of physics lectures he gave at CalTech in the mid 60s. The publisher created this volume (and a second one that I am just getting into called ""Six Not-So-Easy Pieces"") and a companion audio book in Feynman's own voice about 15 years ago.Although they are not biographical, and I took ""freshman physics"" a while ago, I picked up these two volumes to read how this man attempted to re-invent the teaching of introductory and intermediate physics. The approaches and ""patter"" are definitely Feynman's own. His thinking, humor, and enjoyment of ""natural philosophy"" shine through the pages.Granted the knowledge of cosmology and particle physics contained in this volume are dated (it was 45 years ago, give the guy a break!), but that only adds a patina of warmth to the presentation.The title is correct: there is virtually no math in this volume (except a bit near the end). Nothing that you need to fear: blowing over it will still get you the gist of the point(s).If you have read any of the other books relating Feynman's adventures as a young (20s) man working at Los Alamos, the pick this up and see how the man lived and breathed physics. You'll be happy you did!"
22,0465023924,http://goodreads.com/user/show/13676431,3,"I liked 4 out of the 6 pieces, so technically it should be 3.3 stars. I didn't like some of them probably because I didn't understand them, and to be fair I didn't focus a lot while reading it, it was more of a leisure read. The gravitational piece was beautiful. It explained big complex ideas with simple analogies that made sense, some of the laws he discussed I knew already but after reading the lecture it all clicked and the picture was more clear. I didn't like the conservation of energy or quantum mechanics, which makes sense for quantum mechanics because, well. However I actually studied the conservation of energy and liked it, I was excited to get a new perspective on it and to get deeper intuition but the analogies did not make any sense and it all was just too confusing. Which is why I think rather than a book it would've been better if I just read lectures on the topics that interest me. I still enjoyed the book and I would probably read Feynman again in the future along with my physics courses. "

Hawking and Greene have done much to popularize (and fetishize) physics, but Feynman will help the layperson really start to understand it at its most conceptual, basic form. And if you haven't the ability to sustain fifteen years of advanced mathematics, these lessons can still illuminate the marvels of the ""mechanism.""To be fair, Hawking (astrophysics) and Greene (quantum mechanics) both do a lot for their respective fields as well, but they aren't Feynman.Oh, by the way, I can't perform the most basic algebraic equations. That is so embarassing."

I'm not sure this short book succeeds in achieving that goal. It isn't thorough enough or organized well enough to teach people who haven't already been exposed to physics something useful about the subject. If you have dipped your toes in the fascinating world of physics, however, this is definitely worth reading. This book won't teach you anything new but it'll give you new eyes and a new way of looking at some of the central problems of physics. This is where Feynman really shines; he provides some unique and brilliant insights that sometimes change the way you think about a problem and make you go, Aha! The first three chapters explain what physics really is, what doing physics entails, and how physics relates to the other sciences. In the final three chapters, Feynman gets into real physics and discusses conservation of energy, theory of gravitation, and quantum behavior. In the chapter on the theory of gravity, Feynman provides a historic account of its development from Copernicus to Newton and shows us what particular problem each of them was trying to solve and what their contribution was which is really helpful. The other two chapters are also very interesting. There are some simple equations in there but nothing you wouldn't already have seen elsewhere. Feynman frequently surprises you with his refreshing attitude of saying, ""We don't know why that is"", thereby pointing out the limits of existing (during his time) scientific knowledge. I strongly recommend this book to those with a keen interest in physics, not to learn anything new but to get a Feynman-eye-view of basic physics. Also check out its sister volume, The Six Not-So-Easy Pieces."

The links between cornerstone concepts of physics, chemistry and biology reappeared in a completely different light. The author takes you on an exciting ""understanding tour"" starting with the atomic hypothesis, then placing all basic concepts in both historical and cross-science perspectives to consequently elaborate on the 6 conservations laws (energy, linear momentum, angular momentum, charge, baryons and leptons), gravitational and relativistic discussions to finally serve the quantum behaviour ""explanation"".All packaged in supercilious (100% deservedly!) wrapping of Feynman's unique style.That book should replace (or at least accompany) all first-year school physics lectures!"

Even though the title of Feynman’s book is Six Easy Pieces, it wasn’t easy in a dumbed down sort of way.

40,0465023924,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8524944-ioannis-savvas,5,"Ο Richard Feynman (1918-1988) είναι ένας από τους μεγαλύτερους θεωρητικούς φυσικούς του 20ου αιώνα. Καθηγητής στο Cornell, δούλεψε μαζί με το Hans Bethe στο Los Alamos. Το 1965 βραβεύθηκε με το βραβείο Nobel για τη δουλειά του στη θεωρία της κβαντομηχανικής.Το Six Easy Pieces είναι μια συλλογή διαλλέξεων στους φοιτητές του. Ο Feynman διακρινόταν για την ικανότητά του να εξηγεί πολύπλοκα θέματα φυσικής με απλό τρόπο, χρησιμοποιώντας παραδείγματα από την καθημερινότητα. Το βιβλίο είναι απολαυστικό και διαβάζεται πολύ εύκολα.Το δυνατότερο σημείο του βιβλίο από το δεύτερο κεφάλαιο (Basic Physics):What do we mean by “understanding” something? We can imagine that this complicated array of moving things which constitutes “the world” is something like a great chess game being played by the gods, and we are observers of the game. We do not know what the rules of the game are; all we are allowed to do is to watch the playing. Of course, if we watch long enough, we may eventually catch on to a few of the rules. The rules of the game are what we mean by fundamental physics. Even if we knew every rule, however, we might not be able to understand why a particular move is made in the game, merely because it is too complicated and our minds are limited. If you play chess you must know that it is easy to learn all the rules, and yet it is often very hard to select the best move or to understand why a player moves as he does. So it is in nature, only much more so; but we may be able at least to find all the rules. Actually, we do not have all the rules now. (Every once in a while something like castling is going on that we still do not understand.) Aside from not knowing all of the rules, what we really can explain in terms of those rules is very limited, because almost all situations are so enormously complicated that we cannot follow the plays of the game using the rules, much less tell what is going to happen next. We must, therefore, limit ourselves to the more basic question of the rules of the game. If we know the rules, we consider that we “understand” the world.How can we tell whether the rules which we “guess” at are really right if we cannot analyze the game very well? There are, roughly speaking, three ways. First, there may be situations where nature has arranged, or we arrange nature, to be simple and to have so few parts that we can predict exactly what will happen, and thus we can check how our rules work. (In one corner of the board there may be only a few chess pieces at work, and that we figure out exactly.)A second good way to check rules is in terms of less specific rules derived from them. For example, the rule on the move of a bishop on a chessboard is that it moves only on the diagonal. One can deduce, no matter how many moves may be made, that a certain bishop will always be on a red square. So, without being able to follow the details, we can always check our idea about the bishop’s motion by finding out whether it is always on a red square. Of course it will be, for a long time, until all of a sudden we find that it is on a black square (what happened of course, is that in the meantime it was captured, another pawn crossed for queening, and it turned into a bishop on a black square). That is the way it is in physics. For a long time we will have a rule that works excellently in an overall way, even when we cannot follow the details, and then some time we may discover a new rule. From the point of view of basic physics, the most interesting phenomena are of course in the new places, the places where the rules do not work -not the places where they do work! That is the way in which we discover new rules.The third way to tell whether our ideas are right is relatively crude but probably the most powerful of them all. That is, by rough approximation. While we may not be able to tell why Alekhine moves this particular piece, perhaps we can roughly understand that he is gathering his pieces around the king to protect it, more or less, since that is the sensible thing to do in the circumstances. In the same way, we can often understand nature, more or less, without being able to see what every little piece is doing, in terms of our understanding of the game."

While the title says ""easy"" - it is keeping in mind that these were lectures for the best and brightest at Caltech...so yes, while they are not overly complex, they are also not designed for the novice either. Five of the lectures cover concepts in classical physics (energy, gravitation etc) and the role of physics in society. However, it is the final chapter on quantum which is the gold mine in this book (especially regarding the Uncertainty Principle).I am a massive Feynman fan and he is widely notes as one of the best (and most engaging) physics teachers of the 20th century and while this book was good and definitely worth picking up, I am not sure whether I would call it great as some of the magic of Feynman just didn't translate as well as I was hoping to the written page. Well worth the read."
43,0465023924,http://goodreads.com/user/show/46917424-rami,5,"The way that Feynman goes by explaining the topics of this book reminded me of Stephen Hawking's books about the universe. I did enjoy the analogies the author uses to explain some principles that are not always easy to grasp, particularly about our our knowledge of the laws discussed.I found myself discovering new ideas and seeing things from a new perspective even after several years in engineering, having already read and studies most of the content of this book before, but never from this angle.Would definitely recommend it as an entry point to people who want more insight into modern day physics."
44,0465023924,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1094533-mary-overton,0,"Lectures from a series given at Caltech in the early 60s - intended for freshmen, to stimulate their interest in physics. Special Preface: ""Through the distant veil of memory, many of the students and faculty attending the lectures have said that having two years of physics with Feynman was the experience of a lifetime. But that's not how it seemed at the time. Many of the students dreaded the class, and as the course wore on, attendance by the registered students started dropping alarmingly. But at the same time, more and more faculty and graduate students started attending. The room stayed full, and Feynman may never have known he was losing some of his intended audience."" pp. xxii-xxiii""'Quantum mechanics' is the description of the behavior of matter in all its details and, in particular, of the happenings on an atomic scale. Things on a very small scale behave like nothing that you have any direct experience about. They do not behave like waves, they do not behave like particles, they do not behave like clouds, or billiard balls, or weights on springs, or like anything that you have ever seen."" pg. 116""Because atomic behavior is so unlike ordinary experience, it is very difficult to get used to and it appears peculiar and mysterious to everyone, both to the novice and to the experienced physicist. Even the experts do not understand it the way they would like to, and it is perfectly reasonable that they should not, because all of direct, human experience and of human intuition applies to large objects. We know how large objects will act, but things on a small scale just do not act that way. So we have to learn about them in a sort of abstract or imaginative fashion and not by connection with our direct experience."" pg. 117 ""We would like to emphasize a very important difference between classical and quantum mechanics....We can only predict the odds!.... We do not know how to predict what would happen in a given circumstance, and we believe now that it is impossible, that the only thing that can be predicted is the probability of different events."" pg. 135"
45,0465023924,http://goodreads.com/user/show/30489708-alcatraz-dey,4,"This book is a brilliant way to broaden your knowledge of the key concepts of physics. Adapted from the undergraduate lectures delivered by Richard Feynman during his professorship at Caltech, the narrative is very talkative and easy to digest.Feynman himself contributed well to physics, receiving (jointly) the Nobel Prize for Physics in 1965 for his work in quantum electrodynamics, developing pictorial representations of quantum interactions (now known as Feynman diagrams) and pioneering the field of quantum computing. He was a keen populariser of physics in his lifetime, and his legacy of books and lectures still remains.The six chapters included in this book, taken from Volumes I and III of the Feynman Lectures on Physics, are: Atoms in Motion, Basic Physics, The Relation of Physics to Other Sciences, Conservation of Energy, The Theory of Gravitation and Quantum Behaviour.Each chapter is full of coherent descriptions of the concepts at hand, using everyday analogies and clear diagrams to illustrate exactly how things work. Key experiments in the progression of modern physics are also included, their purpose and true significance explained. The simplicity and clarity in which the material in this book is delivered certainly sets it apart from others of similar genre – especially with its achievable thickness of merely 1cm.Receiving positive critical acclaim from major publications, Six Easy Pieces has become renowned as a work that serves two purposes – to explain important concepts to non-physicsts, and to give an insight into Feynman and his mannerisms. “With Feynman as a guide, you cant help wondering why everyone is not turning to science” – the Guardian.If you are considering studying physics at A-level or university, I would strongly recommend this book as it expands on what you already know and takes it a step further. Furthermore, hearing familiar concepts in a different style to normal is a very refreshing experience. If you have an interest in finding more out about the universe around you without much background knowledge, Six Easy Pieces is certainly a worthy and rewarding introduction to some important concepts."
46,0465023924,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1671310-hayley,4,"This book is an introduction to the most basic ideas of physics, and part of its sophistication is that it hints at how deep the...rabbit hole...is, without requiring readers to have enough expertise to really go down it.It was readable but challenging for me - someone with a bachelor's in biology and no great adeptitude for physics or math. My one complaint is that author Richard Feynmann could work a little harder to help lay readers understand how his verbal descriptions of physics translate into the equations he provides. Sometimes it was clear and other times I was left wondering about some squiggly mathematical symbol I don't remember, or why something has to be squared... One thing that comes across very well: Some physical properties of the universe - the subatomic particles/waves dealt with by quantum physics - seem to, by their very nature, do things we can't pin down and predict precisely, but rather, we can only understand them in terms of the ODDS of what will happen. And if people try to precisely document certain tiny activities - like finding the probabilities of where electrons will go - the observers change the pattern just by trying to document it. In a couple of ways, uncertainty seems to be part of the root of reality. After reading this, I feel like I have much more of an intuitive basis for reading more about physics. I also have more intuition, after reading this book, about where math-based theory and experimentation complement each other in physics. That said, ask me what I read, and I'll probably stumble."
47,0465023924,http://goodreads.com/user/show/15875470-molly-ison,5,"Possibly the most important part of this book is in the preface, when Feynman discusses the problems of physics pedagogy. These actually are easy pieces - if you have had high school level physics, the concepts should be immediately familiar. While Feynman presents them in a way that is fairly labeled brilliant, there are many physics teachers and professors who could give you an excellent understanding of the same material (and it's not too hard to find some online). The real issue here is the link between ability to solve problems and ability to understand concepts. When I took physics, I solved a lot of mathematical equations that involved different forces - a block moves up a hill and there's gravity, friction, the slope of the hill, the mass of the block, etc... One can be very good at recognizing the right formulas and plugging in the right numbers and still have no real idea about what's happening on a conceptual level. On the other hand, when Feynman actually delivered these lectures to a hall full of freshmen, despite having recitation sections, they did not do outstandingly well in being able to solve examination problems, and Feynman admits so himself. However, graduate students and other faculty members sat in on these lectures and valued them highly. So I would say that this is probably a book not for those who have never had exposure to physics, but for those who have a problem solving level understanding (or did at some point) and want to solidify for themselves what those problems are actually about. "
48,0465023924,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1436673-tom,4,"I've had this book on the shelf for some time, meaning to read it to refresh my memory of physics classes taken long ago. It was a quick enjoyable read that explained things I've already learned in a new and refreshing way, (even though these lectures were given almost fifty years ago.) I was especially impressed with the first two chapters. With some minor modifications, these two lectures could be used to explain atomic theory to elementary students. This is quite an accomplishment considering that the targeted audience is Cal Tech undergraduates! Feynman often said something like (and I'm paraphrasing here) ""It all goes back to the Double Slit experiment.) I truly believe that a person who becomes aware of this experiment and what it ""means"" can never really look at the world the same way again. As well versed as Feynman was with the intricacies of the paradoxes that permeate the Double Slit, I was sort of disappointed with his explanation of it. I think the chapter on it in ""The Dancing Wu Li Masters"" explains it better and does a better job of conveying the awesome mystery of it. Of course, Gary Zhukov had the advantage of writing his book after Alain Aspect had run his experiment (1964) related to Bell's Theorem, confirming that the Universe we inhabit is truly, deeply, weirdly mysterious. Still, I didn't think Feynman conveyed that very well in this book, but really that wasn't his purpose here, so I'm giving it four stars."
49,0465023924,http://goodreads.com/user/show/116652-punk,2,"Non-fiction. This book contains six chapters from Feynman's Lectures on Physics, which were transcribed from actual lectures he gave at Caltech during 1961-1964. It made me feel dumb. Well, not entirely, I did okay with the chemistry, biology, and astronomy aspects of it, as I have background in those areas, and I was all right with the quantum mechanics stuff because that requires more imagination than math, but I've never taken a physics course, so all the nonsense with pulleys totally shot over my head. All the weights and wedges and three 1 lb balls being lifted three feet by one 1 lb ball -- that I would have to see in order to understand, fig 4.2 just didn't cut it for me, but even when I had no clue what he was talking about, Feynman was a steady, calming voice, rational and grounded. He wasn't afraid to admit science might be wrong about something, or that there are still mysteries science can't answer. He was hailed a great scientist, but he was a great teacher as well, someone who loved his field of study, and even these lectures, trapped between the pages of a book, make that clear.Two stars for Feynman's laid back approach to some complicated concepts, but, like shooting one particle through a gap in a wall, it was hit and miss."
50,0465023924,http://goodreads.com/user/show/336491-laura,2,"I may be one of the few scientists who is not a Feynman fan. He admits that his approach is to teach to the very brightest students, hoping that the others manage to catch something along the way. But, when you remember the man taught at CalTech--where basically every student is pretty darned smart, his approach seems a bit arrogant. He also claims that he had no opportunity during the lecture series to gain feedback from students--that this came only at the end of the course. Astonishing that such an obviously bright individual can't think of some way to gauge student learning along the way... perhaps by asking the students? Administering a quiz or otherwise collecting some data?I realize this was a different time in university science education, where expectations were much different, but the fact that we haven't made a lot of strides in science ed on the post-secondary level increases my distaste for the old school approach.I will confess his explanations are interesting, if you're already familiar with the material. I just couldn't get past feeling sorry for the poor souls who found themselves learning physics for the first time with this approach."

A charming genius without the snooty air of formalism is a role model I can follow. And here in this book is the start to understanding a Feynman way of mind. These 6 essays are adapted from Feynman's Lectures on basic physics back in the 1960's. I wish I had discovered these essays before college, because they really would have made physics easy and interesting to learn before I took 2 semesters of crazy med-school fueled classes. Covering topics like the basics of science, atomic motion, law of the conservation of energy, gravitation, and even quantum mechanics. Feynman also has a unique style which is matter of fact and personable, but just has the slightest hint of poetry. A really fantastic read for the beginner scientist or the physicist who just wants a return to physical wonder. I've already put the full lectures on my to-read list."
52,0465023924,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4333246-lauren,5,"Feynman never ceases to amaze me with his genuine ability to take a complicated subject (or concept) and make it accessible to the masses. After reading his book of short stories, I've been perpetually intrigues by Feynman, his interests, accomplishments, and thought process. These six lectures provide a window into the mind that helped inspire many future physicists and their subsequent breakthroughs. It inspired me to think more carefully about the mundane things we take for granted; I found myself thinking about the structure of an element, how it fits together to create molecules, and are the true building blocks for everything in the Universe. My favorite subjects were the generalities of atoms, the interaction of physics with all other sciences, and gravitational forces as they relate to our solar system, galaxy and universe.

In that sense I did get inspired here and there. But this book reads just like what it is: transcripts of live lectures, therefore in my opinion it just doesn't makes too good a book on introductory physics without the brilliant personality of the lecturer and his spontaneous notes on board or any other in-class demonstration. I found those detailed descriptions of the imagined experiments especially difficult to follow even though I already know the materials. So I think one should still learn physics formally and systematically, and can read this book as supplementary material just to see how it can be explained differently from the textbook."

The departments for both at my school were fairly challenging and I wasn’t particularly good at them and so I shied away for fear they would hurt my GPA.As it turns out, no one has ever asked to see my GPA and I would have been better off taking the classes, getting Cs and learning a lot. Hindsight is 20/20 I suppose.Anywho, I have made it a goal to go back and study more math and physics on my own time and Six Easy Pieces was the consensus recommendation for where to start.Coming in at a slim 150 pages, Six Easy Pieces is a Physics 101 class in a breezy book.

I'm not sure if that's because the book is a series of freshman physics lectures Feynman gave (and I've taken a year of college physics) and because it seemed too simple; or because he seemed to bounce around between really simple concepts (what is an atom? what is light?) and really difficult ones, including formulas and calculations I'd never seen and didn't understand. I wouldn't recommened it to someone new to physics or someone well-acquainted; it would be too difficult for the former and too simple for the latter. "

70,0465023924,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8524944-ioannis-savvas,5,"Ο Richard Feynman (1918-1988) είναι ένας από τους μεγαλύτερους θεωρητικούς φυσικούς του 20ου αιώνα. Καθηγητής στο Cornell, δούλεψε μαζί με το Hans Bethe στο Los Alamos. Το 1965 βραβεύθηκε με το βραβείο Nobel για τη δουλειά του στη θεωρία της κβαντομηχανικής.Το Six Easy Pieces είναι μια συλλογή διαλλέξεων στους φοιτητές του. Ο Feynman διακρινόταν για την ικανότητά του να εξηγεί πολύπλοκα θέματα φυσικής με απλό τρόπο, χρησιμοποιώντας παραδείγματα από την καθημερινότητα. Το βιβλίο είναι απολαυστικό και διαβάζεται πολύ εύκολα.Το δυνατότερο σημείο του βιβλίο από το δεύτερο κεφάλαιο (Basic Physics):What do we mean by “understanding” something? We can imagine that this complicated array of moving things which constitutes “the world” is something like a great chess game being played by the gods, and we are observers of the game. We do not know what the rules of the game are; all we are allowed to do is to watch the playing. Of course, if we watch long enough, we may eventually catch on to a few of the rules. The rules of the game are what we mean by fundamental physics. Even if we knew every rule, however, we might not be able to understand why a particular move is made in the game, merely because it is too complicated and our minds are limited. If you play chess you must know that it is easy to learn all the rules, and yet it is often very hard to select the best move or to understand why a player moves as he does. So it is in nature, only much more so; but we may be able at least to find all the rules. Actually, we do not have all the rules now. (Every once in a while something like castling is going on that we still do not understand.) Aside from not knowing all of the rules, what we really can explain in terms of those rules is very limited, because almost all situations are so enormously complicated that we cannot follow the plays of the game using the rules, much less tell what is going to happen next. We must, therefore, limit ourselves to the more basic question of the rules of the game. If we know the rules, we consider that we “understand” the world.How can we tell whether the rules which we “guess” at are really right if we cannot analyze the game very well? There are, roughly speaking, three ways. First, there may be situations where nature has arranged, or we arrange nature, to be simple and to have so few parts that we can predict exactly what will happen, and thus we can check how our rules work. (In one corner of the board there may be only a few chess pieces at work, and that we figure out exactly.)A second good way to check rules is in terms of less specific rules derived from them. For example, the rule on the move of a bishop on a chessboard is that it moves only on the diagonal. One can deduce, no matter how many moves may be made, that a certain bishop will always be on a red square. So, without being able to follow the details, we can always check our idea about the bishop’s motion by finding out whether it is always on a red square. Of course it will be, for a long time, until all of a sudden we find that it is on a black square (what happened of course, is that in the meantime it was captured, another pawn crossed for queening, and it turned into a bishop on a black square). That is the way it is in physics. For a long time we will have a rule that works excellently in an overall way, even when we cannot follow the details, and then some time we may discover a new rule. From the point of view of basic physics, the most interesting phenomena are of course in the new places, the places where the rules do not work -not the places where they do work! That is the way in which we discover new rules.The third way to tell whether our ideas are right is relatively crude but probably the most powerful of them all. That is, by rough approximation. While we may not be able to tell why Alekhine moves this particular piece, perhaps we can roughly understand that he is gathering his pieces around the king to protect it, more or less, since that is the sensible thing to do in the circumstances. In the same way, we can often understand nature, more or less, without being able to see what every little piece is doing, in terms of our understanding of the game."

72,0465023924,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10486977-themadhatter,4,"This book contains a transcript of a subset (six) lectures from a series that Feynman delivered in the 1960s. While the title says ""easy"" - it is keeping in mind that these were lectures for the best and brightest at Caltech...so yes, while they are not overly complex, they are also not designed for the novice either. Five of the lectures cover concepts in classical physics (energy, gravitation etc) and the role of physics in society. However, it is the final chapter on quantum which is the gold mine in this book (especially regarding the Uncertainty Principle).I am a massive Feynman fan and he is widely notes as one of the best (and most engaging) physics teachers of the 20th century and while this book was good and definitely worth picking up, I am not sure whether I would call it great as some of the magic of Feynman just didn't translate as well as I was hoping to the written page. Well worth the read."
73,0465023924,http://goodreads.com/user/show/46917424-rami,5,"The way that Feynman goes by explaining the topics of this book reminded me of Stephen Hawking's books about the universe. I did enjoy the analogies the author uses to explain some principles that are not always easy to grasp, particularly about our our knowledge of the laws discussed.I found myself discovering new ideas and seeing things from a new perspective even after several years in engineering, having already read and studies most of the content of this book before, but never from this angle.Would definitely recommend it as an entry point to people who want more insight into modern day physics."
74,0465023924,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1094533-mary-overton,0,"Lectures from a series given at Caltech in the early 60s - intended for freshmen, to stimulate their interest in physics. Special Preface: ""Through the distant veil of memory, many of the students and faculty attending the lectures have said that having two years of physics with Feynman was the experience of a lifetime. But that's not how it seemed at the time. Many of the students dreaded the class, and as the course wore on, attendance by the registered students started dropping alarmingly. But at the same time, more and more faculty and graduate students started attending. The room stayed full, and Feynman may never have known he was losing some of his intended audience."" pp. xxii-xxiii""'Quantum mechanics' is the description of the behavior of matter in all its details and, in particular, of the happenings on an atomic scale. Things on a very small scale behave like nothing that you have any direct experience about. They do not behave like waves, they do not behave like particles, they do not behave like clouds, or billiard balls, or weights on springs, or like anything that you have ever seen."" pg. 116""Because atomic behavior is so unlike ordinary experience, it is very difficult to get used to and it appears peculiar and mysterious to everyone, both to the novice and to the experienced physicist. Even the experts do not understand it the way they would like to, and it is perfectly reasonable that they should not, because all of direct, human experience and of human intuition applies to large objects. We know how large objects will act, but things on a small scale just do not act that way. So we have to learn about them in a sort of abstract or imaginative fashion and not by connection with our direct experience."" pg. 117 ""We would like to emphasize a very important difference between classical and quantum mechanics....We can only predict the odds!.... We do not know how to predict what would happen in a given circumstance, and we believe now that it is impossible, that the only thing that can be predicted is the probability of different events."" pg. 135"
75,0465023924,http://goodreads.com/user/show/30489708-alcatraz-dey,4,"This book is a brilliant way to broaden your knowledge of the key concepts of physics. Adapted from the undergraduate lectures delivered by Richard Feynman during his professorship at Caltech, the narrative is very talkative and easy to digest.Feynman himself contributed well to physics, receiving (jointly) the Nobel Prize for Physics in 1965 for his work in quantum electrodynamics, developing pictorial representations of quantum interactions (now known as Feynman diagrams) and pioneering the field of quantum computing. He was a keen populariser of physics in his lifetime, and his legacy of books and lectures still remains.The six chapters included in this book, taken from Volumes I and III of the Feynman Lectures on Physics, are: Atoms in Motion, Basic Physics, The Relation of Physics to Other Sciences, Conservation of Energy, The Theory of Gravitation and Quantum Behaviour.Each chapter is full of coherent descriptions of the concepts at hand, using everyday analogies and clear diagrams to illustrate exactly how things work. Key experiments in the progression of modern physics are also included, their purpose and true significance explained. The simplicity and clarity in which the material in this book is delivered certainly sets it apart from others of similar genre – especially with its achievable thickness of merely 1cm.Receiving positive critical acclaim from major publications, Six Easy Pieces has become renowned as a work that serves two purposes – to explain important concepts to non-physicsts, and to give an insight into Feynman and his mannerisms. “With Feynman as a guide, you cant help wondering why everyone is not turning to science” – the Guardian.If you are considering studying physics at A-level or university, I would strongly recommend this book as it expands on what you already know and takes it a step further. Furthermore, hearing familiar concepts in a different style to normal is a very refreshing experience. If you have an interest in finding more out about the universe around you without much background knowledge, Six Easy Pieces is certainly a worthy and rewarding introduction to some important concepts."
76,0465023924,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1671310-hayley,4,"This book is an introduction to the most basic ideas of physics, and part of its sophistication is that it hints at how deep the...rabbit hole...is, without requiring readers to have enough expertise to really go down it.It was readable but challenging for me - someone with a bachelor's in biology and no great adeptitude for physics or math. My one complaint is that author Richard Feynmann could work a little harder to help lay readers understand how his verbal descriptions of physics translate into the equations he provides. Sometimes it was clear and other times I was left wondering about some squiggly mathematical symbol I don't remember, or why something has to be squared... One thing that comes across very well: Some physical properties of the universe - the subatomic particles/waves dealt with by quantum physics - seem to, by their very nature, do things we can't pin down and predict precisely, but rather, we can only understand them in terms of the ODDS of what will happen. And if people try to precisely document certain tiny activities - like finding the probabilities of where electrons will go - the observers change the pattern just by trying to document it. In a couple of ways, uncertainty seems to be part of the root of reality. After reading this, I feel like I have much more of an intuitive basis for reading more about physics. I also have more intuition, after reading this book, about where math-based theory and experimentation complement each other in physics. That said, ask me what I read, and I'll probably stumble."
77,0465023924,http://goodreads.com/user/show/15875470-molly-ison,5,"Possibly the most important part of this book is in the preface, when Feynman discusses the problems of physics pedagogy. These actually are easy pieces - if you have had high school level physics, the concepts should be immediately familiar. While Feynman presents them in a way that is fairly labeled brilliant, there are many physics teachers and professors who could give you an excellent understanding of the same material (and it's not too hard to find some online). The real issue here is the link between ability to solve problems and ability to understand concepts. When I took physics, I solved a lot of mathematical equations that involved different forces - a block moves up a hill and there's gravity, friction, the slope of the hill, the mass of the block, etc... One can be very good at recognizing the right formulas and plugging in the right numbers and still have no real idea about what's happening on a conceptual level. On the other hand, when Feynman actually delivered these lectures to a hall full of freshmen, despite having recitation sections, they did not do outstandingly well in being able to solve examination problems, and Feynman admits so himself. However, graduate students and other faculty members sat in on these lectures and valued them highly. So I would say that this is probably a book not for those who have never had exposure to physics, but for those who have a problem solving level understanding (or did at some point) and want to solidify for themselves what those problems are actually about. "
78,0465023924,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1436673-tom,4,"I've had this book on the shelf for some time, meaning to read it to refresh my memory of physics classes taken long ago. It was a quick enjoyable read that explained things I've already learned in a new and refreshing way, (even though these lectures were given almost fifty years ago.) I was especially impressed with the first two chapters. With some minor modifications, these two lectures could be used to explain atomic theory to elementary students. This is quite an accomplishment considering that the targeted audience is Cal Tech undergraduates! Feynman often said something like (and I'm paraphrasing here) ""It all goes back to the Double Slit experiment.) I truly believe that a person who becomes aware of this experiment and what it ""means"" can never really look at the world the same way again. As well versed as Feynman was with the intricacies of the paradoxes that permeate the Double Slit, I was sort of disappointed with his explanation of it. I think the chapter on it in ""The Dancing Wu Li Masters"" explains it better and does a better job of conveying the awesome mystery of it. Of course, Gary Zhukov had the advantage of writing his book after Alain Aspect had run his experiment (1964) related to Bell's Theorem, confirming that the Universe we inhabit is truly, deeply, weirdly mysterious. Still, I didn't think Feynman conveyed that very well in this book, but really that wasn't his purpose here, so I'm giving it four stars."
79,0465023924,http://goodreads.com/user/show/116652-punk,2,"Non-fiction. This book contains six chapters from Feynman's Lectures on Physics, which were transcribed from actual lectures he gave at Caltech during 1961-1964. It made me feel dumb. Well, not entirely, I did okay with the chemistry, biology, and astronomy aspects of it, as I have background in those areas, and I was all right with the quantum mechanics stuff because that requires more imagination than math, but I've never taken a physics course, so all the nonsense with pulleys totally shot over my head. All the weights and wedges and three 1 lb balls being lifted three feet by one 1 lb ball -- that I would have to see in order to understand, fig 4.2 just didn't cut it for me, but even when I had no clue what he was talking about, Feynman was a steady, calming voice, rational and grounded. He wasn't afraid to admit science might be wrong about something, or that there are still mysteries science can't answer. He was hailed a great scientist, but he was a great teacher as well, someone who loved his field of study, and even these lectures, trapped between the pages of a book, make that clear.Two stars for Feynman's laid back approach to some complicated concepts, but, like shooting one particle through a gap in a wall, it was hit and miss."
80,0465023924,http://goodreads.com/user/show/336491-laura,2,"I may be one of the few scientists who is not a Feynman fan. He admits that his approach is to teach to the very brightest students, hoping that the others manage to catch something along the way. But, when you remember the man taught at CalTech--where basically every student is pretty darned smart, his approach seems a bit arrogant. He also claims that he had no opportunity during the lecture series to gain feedback from students--that this came only at the end of the course. Astonishing that such an obviously bright individual can't think of some way to gauge student learning along the way... perhaps by asking the students? Administering a quiz or otherwise collecting some data?I realize this was a different time in university science education, where expectations were much different, but the fact that we haven't made a lot of strides in science ed on the post-secondary level increases my distaste for the old school approach.I will confess his explanations are interesting, if you're already familiar with the material. I just couldn't get past feeling sorry for the poor souls who found themselves learning physics for the first time with this approach."
81,0465023924,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2446389-upom,5,"Feynman, the debonair physicist of the last generation. Part physicist, part bongo player, part safe cracker, all man. A charming genius without the snooty air of formalism is a role model I can follow. And here in this book is the start to understanding a Feynman way of mind. These 6 essays are adapted from Feynman's Lectures on basic physics back in the 1960's. I wish I had discovered these essays before college, because they really would have made physics easy and interesting to learn before I took 2 semesters of crazy med-school fueled classes. Covering topics like the basics of science, atomic motion, law of the conservation of energy, gravitation, and even quantum mechanics. Feynman also has a unique style which is matter of fact and personable, but just has the slightest hint of poetry. A really fantastic read for the beginner scientist or the physicist who just wants a return to physical wonder. I've already put the full lectures on my to-read list."
82,0465023924,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4333246-lauren,5,"Feynman never ceases to amaze me with his genuine ability to take a complicated subject (or concept) and make it accessible to the masses. After reading his book of short stories, I've been perpetually intrigues by Feynman, his interests, accomplishments, and thought process. These six lectures provide a window into the mind that helped inspire many future physicists and their subsequent breakthroughs. It inspired me to think more carefully about the mundane things we take for granted; I found myself thinking about the structure of an element, how it fits together to create molecules, and are the true building blocks for everything in the Universe. My favorite subjects were the generalities of atoms, the interaction of physics with all other sciences, and gravitational forces as they relate to our solar system, galaxy and universe.

In that sense I did get inspired here and there. But this book reads just like what it is: transcripts of live lectures, therefore in my opinion it just doesn't makes too good a book on introductory physics without the brilliant personality of the lecturer and his spontaneous notes on board or any other in-class demonstration. I found those detailed descriptions of the imagined experiments especially difficult to follow even though I already know the materials. So I think one should still learn physics formally and systematically, and can read this book as supplementary material just to see how it can be explained differently from the textbook."

Hindsight is 20/20 I suppose.Anywho, I have made it a goal to go back and study more math and physics on my own time and Six Easy Pieces was the consensus recommendation for where to start.Coming in at a slim 150 pages, Six Easy Pieces is a Physics 101 class in a breezy book.

I'm not sure if that's because the book is a series of freshman physics lectures Feynman gave (and I've taken a year of college physics) and because it seemed too simple; or because he seemed to bounce around between really simple concepts (what is an atom? what is light?) and really difficult ones, including formulas and calculations I'd never seen and didn't understand. I wouldn't recommened it to someone new to physics or someone well-acquainted; it would be too difficult for the former and too simple for the latter. "

100,0465023924,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8524944-ioannis-savvas,5,"Ο Richard Feynman (1918-1988) είναι ένας από τους μεγαλύτερους θεωρητικούς φυσικούς του 20ου αιώνα. Καθηγητής στο Cornell, δούλεψε μαζί με το Hans Bethe στο Los Alamos. Το 1965 βραβεύθηκε με το βραβείο Nobel για τη δουλειά του στη θεωρία της κβαντομηχανικής.Το Six Easy Pieces είναι μια συλλογή διαλλέξεων στους φοιτητές του. Ο Feynman διακρινόταν για την ικανότητά του να εξηγεί πολύπλοκα θέματα φυσικής με απλό τρόπο, χρησιμοποιώντας παραδείγματα από την καθημερινότητα. Το βιβλίο είναι απολαυστικό και διαβάζεται πολύ εύκολα.Το δυνατότερο σημείο του βιβλίο από το δεύτερο κεφάλαιο (Basic Physics):What do we mean by “understanding” something? We can imagine that this complicated array of moving things which constitutes “the world” is something like a great chess game being played by the gods, and we are observers of the game. We do not know what the rules of the game are; all we are allowed to do is to watch the playing. Of course, if we watch long enough, we may eventually catch on to a few of the rules. The rules of the game are what we mean by fundamental physics. Even if we knew every rule, however, we might not be able to understand why a particular move is made in the game, merely because it is too complicated and our minds are limited. If you play chess you must know that it is easy to learn all the rules, and yet it is often very hard to select the best move or to understand why a player moves as he does. So it is in nature, only much more so; but we may be able at least to find all the rules. Actually, we do not have all the rules now. (Every once in a while something like castling is going on that we still do not understand.) Aside from not knowing all of the rules, what we really can explain in terms of those rules is very limited, because almost all situations are so enormously complicated that we cannot follow the plays of the game using the rules, much less tell what is going to happen next. We must, therefore, limit ourselves to the more basic question of the rules of the game. If we know the rules, we consider that we “understand” the world.How can we tell whether the rules which we “guess” at are really right if we cannot analyze the game very well? There are, roughly speaking, three ways. First, there may be situations where nature has arranged, or we arrange nature, to be simple and to have so few parts that we can predict exactly what will happen, and thus we can check how our rules work. (In one corner of the board there may be only a few chess pieces at work, and that we figure out exactly.)A second good way to check rules is in terms of less specific rules derived from them. For example, the rule on the move of a bishop on a chessboard is that it moves only on the diagonal. One can deduce, no matter how many moves may be made, that a certain bishop will always be on a red square. So, without being able to follow the details, we can always check our idea about the bishop’s motion by finding out whether it is always on a red square. Of course it will be, for a long time, until all of a sudden we find that it is on a black square (what happened of course, is that in the meantime it was captured, another pawn crossed for queening, and it turned into a bishop on a black square). That is the way it is in physics. For a long time we will have a rule that works excellently in an overall way, even when we cannot follow the details, and then some time we may discover a new rule. From the point of view of basic physics, the most interesting phenomena are of course in the new places, the places where the rules do not work -not the places where they do work! That is the way in which we discover new rules.The third way to tell whether our ideas are right is relatively crude but probably the most powerful of them all. That is, by rough approximation. While we may not be able to tell why Alekhine moves this particular piece, perhaps we can roughly understand that he is gathering his pieces around the king to protect it, more or less, since that is the sensible thing to do in the circumstances. In the same way, we can often understand nature, more or less, without being able to see what every little piece is doing, in terms of our understanding of the game."

102,0465023924,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10486977-themadhatter,4,"This book contains a transcript of a subset (six) lectures from a series that Feynman delivered in the 1960s. While the title says ""easy"" - it is keeping in mind that these were lectures for the best and brightest at Caltech...so yes, while they are not overly complex, they are also not designed for the novice either. Five of the lectures cover concepts in classical physics (energy, gravitation etc) and the role of physics in society. However, it is the final chapter on quantum which is the gold mine in this book (especially regarding the Uncertainty Principle).I am a massive Feynman fan and he is widely notes as one of the best (and most engaging) physics teachers of the 20th century and while this book was good and definitely worth picking up, I am not sure whether I would call it great as some of the magic of Feynman just didn't translate as well as I was hoping to the written page. Well worth the read."
103,0465023924,http://goodreads.com/user/show/46917424-rami,5,"The way that Feynman goes by explaining the topics of this book reminded me of Stephen Hawking's books about the universe. I did enjoy the analogies the author uses to explain some principles that are not always easy to grasp, particularly about our our knowledge of the laws discussed.I found myself discovering new ideas and seeing things from a new perspective even after several years in engineering, having already read and studies most of the content of this book before, but never from this angle.Would definitely recommend it as an entry point to people who want more insight into modern day physics."
104,0465023924,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1094533-mary-overton,0,"Lectures from a series given at Caltech in the early 60s - intended for freshmen, to stimulate their interest in physics. Special Preface: ""Through the distant veil of memory, many of the students and faculty attending the lectures have said that having two years of physics with Feynman was the experience of a lifetime. But that's not how it seemed at the time. Many of the students dreaded the class, and as the course wore on, attendance by the registered students started dropping alarmingly. But at the same time, more and more faculty and graduate students started attending. The room stayed full, and Feynman may never have known he was losing some of his intended audience."" pp. xxii-xxiii""'Quantum mechanics' is the description of the behavior of matter in all its details and, in particular, of the happenings on an atomic scale. Things on a very small scale behave like nothing that you have any direct experience about. They do not behave like waves, they do not behave like particles, they do not behave like clouds, or billiard balls, or weights on springs, or like anything that you have ever seen."" pg. 116""Because atomic behavior is so unlike ordinary experience, it is very difficult to get used to and it appears peculiar and mysterious to everyone, both to the novice and to the experienced physicist. Even the experts do not understand it the way they would like to, and it is perfectly reasonable that they should not, because all of direct, human experience and of human intuition applies to large objects. We know how large objects will act, but things on a small scale just do not act that way. So we have to learn about them in a sort of abstract or imaginative fashion and not by connection with our direct experience."" pg. 117 ""We would like to emphasize a very important difference between classical and quantum mechanics....We can only predict the odds!.... We do not know how to predict what would happen in a given circumstance, and we believe now that it is impossible, that the only thing that can be predicted is the probability of different events."" pg. 135"
105,0465023924,http://goodreads.com/user/show/30489708-alcatraz-dey,4,"This book is a brilliant way to broaden your knowledge of the key concepts of physics. Adapted from the undergraduate lectures delivered by Richard Feynman during his professorship at Caltech, the narrative is very talkative and easy to digest.Feynman himself contributed well to physics, receiving (jointly) the Nobel Prize for Physics in 1965 for his work in quantum electrodynamics, developing pictorial representations of quantum interactions (now known as Feynman diagrams) and pioneering the field of quantum computing. He was a keen populariser of physics in his lifetime, and his legacy of books and lectures still remains.The six chapters included in this book, taken from Volumes I and III of the Feynman Lectures on Physics, are: Atoms in Motion, Basic Physics, The Relation of Physics to Other Sciences, Conservation of Energy, The Theory of Gravitation and Quantum Behaviour.Each chapter is full of coherent descriptions of the concepts at hand, using everyday analogies and clear diagrams to illustrate exactly how things work. Key experiments in the progression of modern physics are also included, their purpose and true significance explained. The simplicity and clarity in which the material in this book is delivered certainly sets it apart from others of similar genre – especially with its achievable thickness of merely 1cm.Receiving positive critical acclaim from major publications, Six Easy Pieces has become renowned as a work that serves two purposes – to explain important concepts to non-physicsts, and to give an insight into Feynman and his mannerisms. “With Feynman as a guide, you cant help wondering why everyone is not turning to science” – the Guardian.If you are considering studying physics at A-level or university, I would strongly recommend this book as it expands on what you already know and takes it a step further. Furthermore, hearing familiar concepts in a different style to normal is a very refreshing experience. If you have an interest in finding more out about the universe around you without much background knowledge, Six Easy Pieces is certainly a worthy and rewarding introduction to some important concepts."
106,0465023924,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1671310-hayley,4,"This book is an introduction to the most basic ideas of physics, and part of its sophistication is that it hints at how deep the...rabbit hole...is, without requiring readers to have enough expertise to really go down it.It was readable but challenging for me - someone with a bachelor's in biology and no great adeptitude for physics or math. My one complaint is that author Richard Feynmann could work a little harder to help lay readers understand how his verbal descriptions of physics translate into the equations he provides. Sometimes it was clear and other times I was left wondering about some squiggly mathematical symbol I don't remember, or why something has to be squared... One thing that comes across very well: Some physical properties of the universe - the subatomic particles/waves dealt with by quantum physics - seem to, by their very nature, do things we can't pin down and predict precisely, but rather, we can only understand them in terms of the ODDS of what will happen. And if people try to precisely document certain tiny activities - like finding the probabilities of where electrons will go - the observers change the pattern just by trying to document it. In a couple of ways, uncertainty seems to be part of the root of reality. After reading this, I feel like I have much more of an intuitive basis for reading more about physics. I also have more intuition, after reading this book, about where math-based theory and experimentation complement each other in physics. That said, ask me what I read, and I'll probably stumble."
107,0465023924,http://goodreads.com/user/show/15875470-molly-ison,5,"Possibly the most important part of this book is in the preface, when Feynman discusses the problems of physics pedagogy. These actually are easy pieces - if you have had high school level physics, the concepts should be immediately familiar. While Feynman presents them in a way that is fairly labeled brilliant, there are many physics teachers and professors who could give you an excellent understanding of the same material (and it's not too hard to find some online). The real issue here is the link between ability to solve problems and ability to understand concepts. When I took physics, I solved a lot of mathematical equations that involved different forces - a block moves up a hill and there's gravity, friction, the slope of the hill, the mass of the block, etc... One can be very good at recognizing the right formulas and plugging in the right numbers and still have no real idea about what's happening on a conceptual level. On the other hand, when Feynman actually delivered these lectures to a hall full of freshmen, despite having recitation sections, they did not do outstandingly well in being able to solve examination problems, and Feynman admits so himself. However, graduate students and other faculty members sat in on these lectures and valued them highly. So I would say that this is probably a book not for those who have never had exposure to physics, but for those who have a problem solving level understanding (or did at some point) and want to solidify for themselves what those problems are actually about. "
108,0465023924,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1436673-tom,4,"I've had this book on the shelf for some time, meaning to read it to refresh my memory of physics classes taken long ago. It was a quick enjoyable read that explained things I've already learned in a new and refreshing way, (even though these lectures were given almost fifty years ago.) I was especially impressed with the first two chapters. With some minor modifications, these two lectures could be used to explain atomic theory to elementary students. This is quite an accomplishment considering that the targeted audience is Cal Tech undergraduates! Feynman often said something like (and I'm paraphrasing here) ""It all goes back to the Double Slit experiment.) I truly believe that a person who becomes aware of this experiment and what it ""means"" can never really look at the world the same way again. As well versed as Feynman was with the intricacies of the paradoxes that permeate the Double Slit, I was sort of disappointed with his explanation of it. I think the chapter on it in ""The Dancing Wu Li Masters"" explains it better and does a better job of conveying the awesome mystery of it. Of course, Gary Zhukov had the advantage of writing his book after Alain Aspect had run his experiment (1964) related to Bell's Theorem, confirming that the Universe we inhabit is truly, deeply, weirdly mysterious. Still, I didn't think Feynman conveyed that very well in this book, but really that wasn't his purpose here, so I'm giving it four stars."
109,0465023924,http://goodreads.com/user/show/116652-punk,2,"Non-fiction. This book contains six chapters from Feynman's Lectures on Physics, which were transcribed from actual lectures he gave at Caltech during 1961-1964. It made me feel dumb. Well, not entirely, I did okay with the chemistry, biology, and astronomy aspects of it, as I have background in those areas, and I was all right with the quantum mechanics stuff because that requires more imagination than math, but I've never taken a physics course, so all the nonsense with pulleys totally shot over my head. All the weights and wedges and three 1 lb balls being lifted three feet by one 1 lb ball -- that I would have to see in order to understand, fig 4.2 just didn't cut it for me, but even when I had no clue what he was talking about, Feynman was a steady, calming voice, rational and grounded. He wasn't afraid to admit science might be wrong about something, or that there are still mysteries science can't answer. He was hailed a great scientist, but he was a great teacher as well, someone who loved his field of study, and even these lectures, trapped between the pages of a book, make that clear.Two stars for Feynman's laid back approach to some complicated concepts, but, like shooting one particle through a gap in a wall, it was hit and miss."
110,0465023924,http://goodreads.com/user/show/336491-laura,2,"I may be one of the few scientists who is not a Feynman fan. He admits that his approach is to teach to the very brightest students, hoping that the others manage to catch something along the way. But, when you remember the man taught at CalTech--where basically every student is pretty darned smart, his approach seems a bit arrogant. He also claims that he had no opportunity during the lecture series to gain feedback from students--that this came only at the end of the course. Astonishing that such an obviously bright individual can't think of some way to gauge student learning along the way... perhaps by asking the students? Administering a quiz or otherwise collecting some data?I realize this was a different time in university science education, where expectations were much different, but the fact that we haven't made a lot of strides in science ed on the post-secondary level increases my distaste for the old school approach.I will confess his explanations are interesting, if you're already familiar with the material. I just couldn't get past feeling sorry for the poor souls who found themselves learning physics for the first time with this approach."
111,0465023924,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2446389-upom,5,"Feynman, the debonair physicist of the last generation. Part physicist, part bongo player, part safe cracker, all man. A charming genius without the snooty air of formalism is a role model I can follow. And here in this book is the start to understanding a Feynman way of mind. These 6 essays are adapted from Feynman's Lectures on basic physics back in the 1960's. I wish I had discovered these essays before college, because they really would have made physics easy and interesting to learn before I took 2 semesters of crazy med-school fueled classes. Covering topics like the basics of science, atomic motion, law of the conservation of energy, gravitation, and even quantum mechanics. Feynman also has a unique style which is matter of fact and personable, but just has the slightest hint of poetry. A really fantastic read for the beginner scientist or the physicist who just wants a return to physical wonder. I've already put the full lectures on my to-read list."
112,0465023924,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4333246-lauren,5,"Feynman never ceases to amaze me with his genuine ability to take a complicated subject (or concept) and make it accessible to the masses. After reading his book of short stories, I've been perpetually intrigues by Feynman, his interests, accomplishments, and thought process. These six lectures provide a window into the mind that helped inspire many future physicists and their subsequent breakthroughs. It inspired me to think more carefully about the mundane things we take for granted; I found myself thinking about the structure of an element, how it fits together to create molecules, and are the true building blocks for everything in the Universe. My favorite subjects were the generalities of atoms, the interaction of physics with all other sciences, and gravitational forces as they relate to our solar system, galaxy and universe. If you want a book that will truly keep you on your toes and thinking, pick this one up. "
113,0465023924,http://goodreads.com/user/show/37210284-yiheng-wang,4,"As an educator in STEM discipline, I started to read this book (primarily) hoping to glean some ideas on how to explain the basics of physics to other people in vivid but simple words. In that sense I did get inspired here and there. But this book reads just like what it is: transcripts of live lectures, therefore in my opinion it just doesn't makes too good a book on introductory physics without the brilliant personality of the lecturer and his spontaneous notes on board or any other in-class demonstration. I found those detailed descriptions of the imagined experiments especially difficult to follow even though I already know the materials. So I think one should still learn physics formally and systematically, and can read this book as supplementary material just to see how it can be explained differently from the textbook."
114,0465023924,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6468380-taylor-pearson,4,"One of my major regrets from college was that I didn’t take more math and physics courses. The departments for both at my school were fairly challenging and I wasn’t particularly good at them and so I shied away for fear they would hurt my GPA.As it turns out, no one has ever asked to see my GPA and I would have been better off taking the classes, getting Cs and learning a lot. Hindsight is 20/20 I suppose.Anywho, I have made it a goal to go back and study more math and physics on my own time and Six Easy Pieces was the consensus recommendation for where to start.Coming in at a slim 150 pages, Six Easy Pieces is a Physics 101 class in a breezy book.

I'm not sure if that's because the book is a series of freshman physics lectures Feynman gave (and I've taken a year of college physics) and because it seemed too simple; or because he seemed to bounce around between really simple concepts (what is an atom? what is light?) and really difficult ones, including formulas and calculations I'd never seen and didn't understand. I wouldn't recommened it to someone new to physics or someone well-acquainted; it would be too difficult for the former and too simple for the latter. "

He had a lively mind and spirit that helped him connect to the kids. Hell, he was a kid, just with an oversized brain.

We do not know what the rules of the game are; all we are allowed to do is to watch the playing. Of course, if we watch long enough, we may eventually catch on to a few of the rules. The rules of the game are what we mean by fundamental physics. Even if we knew every rule, however, we might not be able to understand why a particular move is made in the game, merely because it is too complicated and our minds are limited. If you play chess you must know that it is easy to learn all the rules, and yet it is often very hard to select the best move or to understand why a player moves as he does. So it is in nature, only much more so; but we may be able at least to find all the rules. Actually, we do not have all the rules now. (Every once in a while something like castling is going on that we still do not understand.) Aside from not knowing all of the rules, what we really can explain in terms of those rules is very limited, because almost all situations are so enormously complicated that we cannot follow the plays of the game using the rules, much less tell what is going to happen next. We must, therefore, limit ourselves to the more basic question of the rules of the game. If we know the rules, we consider that we “understand” the world.How can we tell whether the rules which we “guess” at are really right if we cannot analyze the game very well? There are, roughly speaking, three ways. First, there may be situations where nature has arranged, or we arrange nature, to be simple and to have so few parts that we can predict exactly what will happen, and thus we can check how our rules work. (In one corner of the board there may be only a few chess pieces at work, and that we figure out exactly.)A second good way to check rules is in terms of less specific rules derived from them. For example, the rule on the move of a bishop on a chessboard is that it moves only on the diagonal. One can deduce, no matter how many moves may be made, that a certain bishop will always be on a red square. So, without being able to follow the details, we can always check our idea about the bishop’s motion by finding out whether it is always on a red square. Of course it will be, for a long time, until all of a sudden we find that it is on a black square (what happened of course, is that in the meantime it was captured, another pawn crossed for queening, and it turned into a bishop on a black square). That is the way it is in physics. For a long time we will have a rule that works excellently in an overall way, even when we cannot follow the details, and then some time we may discover a new rule. From the point of view of basic physics, the most interesting phenomena are of course in the new places, the places where the rules do not work -not the places where they do work! That is the way in which we discover new rules.The third way to tell whether our ideas are right is relatively crude but probably the most powerful of them all. That is, by rough approximation. While we may not be able to tell why Alekhine moves this particular piece, perhaps we can roughly understand that he is gathering his pieces around the king to protect it, more or less, since that is the sensible thing to do in the circumstances. In the same way, we can often understand nature, more or less, without being able to see what every little piece is doing, in terms of our understanding of the game."

While the title says ""easy"" - it is keeping in mind that these were lectures for the best and brightest at Caltech...so yes, while they are not overly complex, they are also not designed for the novice either. Five of the lectures cover concepts in classical physics (energy, gravitation etc) and the role of physics in society. However, it is the final chapter on quantum which is the gold mine in this book (especially regarding the Uncertainty Principle).I am a massive Feynman fan and he is widely notes as one of the best (and most engaging) physics teachers of the 20th century and while this book was good and definitely worth picking up, I am not sure whether I would call it great as some of the magic of Feynman just didn't translate as well as I was hoping to the written page. Well worth the read."
133,0465023924,http://goodreads.com/user/show/46917424-rami,5,"The way that Feynman goes by explaining the topics of this book reminded me of Stephen Hawking's books about the universe. I did enjoy the analogies the author uses to explain some principles that are not always easy to grasp, particularly about our our knowledge of the laws discussed.I found myself discovering new ideas and seeing things from a new perspective even after several years in engineering, having already read and studies most of the content of this book before, but never from this angle.Would definitely recommend it as an entry point to people who want more insight into modern day physics."
134,0465023924,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1094533-mary-overton,0,"Lectures from a series given at Caltech in the early 60s - intended for freshmen, to stimulate their interest in physics. Special Preface: ""Through the distant veil of memory, many of the students and faculty attending the lectures have said that having two years of physics with Feynman was the experience of a lifetime. But that's not how it seemed at the time. Many of the students dreaded the class, and as the course wore on, attendance by the registered students started dropping alarmingly. But at the same time, more and more faculty and graduate students started attending. The room stayed full, and Feynman may never have known he was losing some of his intended audience."" pp. xxii-xxiii""'Quantum mechanics' is the description of the behavior of matter in all its details and, in particular, of the happenings on an atomic scale. Things on a very small scale behave like nothing that you have any direct experience about. They do not behave like waves, they do not behave like particles, they do not behave like clouds, or billiard balls, or weights on springs, or like anything that you have ever seen."" pg. 116""Because atomic behavior is so unlike ordinary experience, it is very difficult to get used to and it appears peculiar and mysterious to everyone, both to the novice and to the experienced physicist. Even the experts do not understand it the way they would like to, and it is perfectly reasonable that they should not, because all of direct, human experience and of human intuition applies to large objects. We know how large objects will act, but things on a small scale just do not act that way. So we have to learn about them in a sort of abstract or imaginative fashion and not by connection with our direct experience."" pg. 117 ""We would like to emphasize a very important difference between classical and quantum mechanics....We can only predict the odds!.... We do not know how to predict what would happen in a given circumstance, and we believe now that it is impossible, that the only thing that can be predicted is the probability of different events."" pg. 135"
135,0465023924,http://goodreads.com/user/show/30489708-alcatraz-dey,4,"This book is a brilliant way to broaden your knowledge of the key concepts of physics. Adapted from the undergraduate lectures delivered by Richard Feynman during his professorship at Caltech, the narrative is very talkative and easy to digest.Feynman himself contributed well to physics, receiving (jointly) the Nobel Prize for Physics in 1965 for his work in quantum electrodynamics, developing pictorial representations of quantum interactions (now known as Feynman diagrams) and pioneering the field of quantum computing. He was a keen populariser of physics in his lifetime, and his legacy of books and lectures still remains.The six chapters included in this book, taken from Volumes I and III of the Feynman Lectures on Physics, are: Atoms in Motion, Basic Physics, The Relation of Physics to Other Sciences, Conservation of Energy, The Theory of Gravitation and Quantum Behaviour.Each chapter is full of coherent descriptions of the concepts at hand, using everyday analogies and clear diagrams to illustrate exactly how things work. Key experiments in the progression of modern physics are also included, their purpose and true significance explained. The simplicity and clarity in which the material in this book is delivered certainly sets it apart from others of similar genre – especially with its achievable thickness of merely 1cm.Receiving positive critical acclaim from major publications, Six Easy Pieces has become renowned as a work that serves two purposes – to explain important concepts to non-physicsts, and to give an insight into Feynman and his mannerisms. “With Feynman as a guide, you cant help wondering why everyone is not turning to science” – the Guardian.If you are considering studying physics at A-level or university, I would strongly recommend this book as it expands on what you already know and takes it a step further. Furthermore, hearing familiar concepts in a different style to normal is a very refreshing experience. If you have an interest in finding more out about the universe around you without much background knowledge, Six Easy Pieces is certainly a worthy and rewarding introduction to some important concepts."
136,0465023924,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1671310-hayley,4,"This book is an introduction to the most basic ideas of physics, and part of its sophistication is that it hints at how deep the...rabbit hole...is, without requiring readers to have enough expertise to really go down it.It was readable but challenging for me - someone with a bachelor's in biology and no great adeptitude for physics or math. My one complaint is that author Richard Feynmann could work a little harder to help lay readers understand how his verbal descriptions of physics translate into the equations he provides. Sometimes it was clear and other times I was left wondering about some squiggly mathematical symbol I don't remember, or why something has to be squared... One thing that comes across very well: Some physical properties of the universe - the subatomic particles/waves dealt with by quantum physics - seem to, by their very nature, do things we can't pin down and predict precisely, but rather, we can only understand them in terms of the ODDS of what will happen. And if people try to precisely document certain tiny activities - like finding the probabilities of where electrons will go - the observers change the pattern just by trying to document it. In a couple of ways, uncertainty seems to be part of the root of reality. After reading this, I feel like I have much more of an intuitive basis for reading more about physics. I also have more intuition, after reading this book, about where math-based theory and experimentation complement each other in physics. That said, ask me what I read, and I'll probably stumble."
137,0465023924,http://goodreads.com/user/show/15875470-molly-ison,5,"Possibly the most important part of this book is in the preface, when Feynman discusses the problems of physics pedagogy. These actually are easy pieces - if you have had high school level physics, the concepts should be immediately familiar. While Feynman presents them in a way that is fairly labeled brilliant, there are many physics teachers and professors who could give you an excellent understanding of the same material (and it's not too hard to find some online). The real issue here is the link between ability to solve problems and ability to understand concepts. When I took physics, I solved a lot of mathematical equations that involved different forces - a block moves up a hill and there's gravity, friction, the slope of the hill, the mass of the block, etc... One can be very good at recognizing the right formulas and plugging in the right numbers and still have no real idea about what's happening on a conceptual level. On the other hand, when Feynman actually delivered these lectures to a hall full of freshmen, despite having recitation sections, they did not do outstandingly well in being able to solve examination problems, and Feynman admits so himself. However, graduate students and other faculty members sat in on these lectures and valued them highly. So I would say that this is probably a book not for those who have never had exposure to physics, but for those who have a problem solving level understanding (or did at some point) and want to solidify for themselves what those problems are actually about. "
138,0465023924,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1436673-tom,4,"I've had this book on the shelf for some time, meaning to read it to refresh my memory of physics classes taken long ago. It was a quick enjoyable read that explained things I've already learned in a new and refreshing way, (even though these lectures were given almost fifty years ago.) I was especially impressed with the first two chapters. With some minor modifications, these two lectures could be used to explain atomic theory to elementary students. This is quite an accomplishment considering that the targeted audience is Cal Tech undergraduates! Feynman often said something like (and I'm paraphrasing here) ""It all goes back to the Double Slit experiment.) I truly believe that a person who becomes aware of this experiment and what it ""means"" can never really look at the world the same way again. As well versed as Feynman was with the intricacies of the paradoxes that permeate the Double Slit, I was sort of disappointed with his explanation of it. I think the chapter on it in ""The Dancing Wu Li Masters"" explains it better and does a better job of conveying the awesome mystery of it. Of course, Gary Zhukov had the advantage of writing his book after Alain Aspect had run his experiment (1964) related to Bell's Theorem, confirming that the Universe we inhabit is truly, deeply, weirdly mysterious. Still, I didn't think Feynman conveyed that very well in this book, but really that wasn't his purpose here, so I'm giving it four stars."
139,0465023924,http://goodreads.com/user/show/116652-punk,2,"Non-fiction. This book contains six chapters from Feynman's Lectures on Physics, which were transcribed from actual lectures he gave at Caltech during 1961-1964. It made me feel dumb. Well, not entirely, I did okay with the chemistry, biology, and astronomy aspects of it, as I have background in those areas, and I was all right with the quantum mechanics stuff because that requires more imagination than math, but I've never taken a physics course, so all the nonsense with pulleys totally shot over my head. All the weights and wedges and three 1 lb balls being lifted three feet by one 1 lb ball -- that I would have to see in order to understand, fig 4.2 just didn't cut it for me, but even when I had no clue what he was talking about, Feynman was a steady, calming voice, rational and grounded. He wasn't afraid to admit science might be wrong about something, or that there are still mysteries science can't answer. He was hailed a great scientist, but he was a great teacher as well, someone who loved his field of study, and even these lectures, trapped between the pages of a book, make that clear.Two stars for Feynman's laid back approach to some complicated concepts, but, like shooting one particle through a gap in a wall, it was hit and miss."
140,0465023924,http://goodreads.com/user/show/336491-laura,2,"I may be one of the few scientists who is not a Feynman fan. He admits that his approach is to teach to the very brightest students, hoping that the others manage to catch something along the way. But, when you remember the man taught at CalTech--where basically every student is pretty darned smart, his approach seems a bit arrogant. He also claims that he had no opportunity during the lecture series to gain feedback from students--that this came only at the end of the course. Astonishing that such an obviously bright individual can't think of some way to gauge student learning along the way... perhaps by asking the students? Administering a quiz or otherwise collecting some data?I realize this was a different time in university science education, where expectations were much different, but the fact that we haven't made a lot of strides in science ed on the post-secondary level increases my distaste for the old school approach.I will confess his explanations are interesting, if you're already familiar with the material. I just couldn't get past feeling sorry for the poor souls who found themselves learning physics for the first time with this approach."
141,0465023924,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2446389-upom,5,"Feynman, the debonair physicist of the last generation. Part physicist, part bongo player, part safe cracker, all man. A charming genius without the snooty air of formalism is a role model I can follow. And here in this book is the start to understanding a Feynman way of mind. These 6 essays are adapted from Feynman's Lectures on basic physics back in the 1960's. I wish I had discovered these essays before college, because they really would have made physics easy and interesting to learn before I took 2 semesters of crazy med-school fueled classes. Covering topics like the basics of science, atomic motion, law of the conservation of energy, gravitation, and even quantum mechanics. Feynman also has a unique style which is matter of fact and personable, but just has the slightest hint of poetry. A really fantastic read for the beginner scientist or the physicist who just wants a return to physical wonder. I've already put the full lectures on my to-read list."
142,0465023924,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4333246-lauren,5,"Feynman never ceases to amaze me with his genuine ability to take a complicated subject (or concept) and make it accessible to the masses. After reading his book of short stories, I've been perpetually intrigues by Feynman, his interests, accomplishments, and thought process. These six lectures provide a window into the mind that helped inspire many future physicists and their subsequent breakthroughs. It inspired me to think more carefully about the mundane things we take for granted; I found myself thinking about the structure of an element, how it fits together to create molecules, and are the true building blocks for everything in the Universe. My favorite subjects were the generalities of atoms, the interaction of physics with all other sciences, and gravitational forces as they relate to our solar system, galaxy and universe.

In that sense I did get inspired here and there. But this book reads just like what it is: transcripts of live lectures, therefore in my opinion it just doesn't makes too good a book on introductory physics without the brilliant personality of the lecturer and his spontaneous notes on board or any other in-class demonstration. I found those detailed descriptions of the imagined experiments especially difficult to follow even though I already know the materials. So I think one should still learn physics formally and systematically, and can read this book as supplementary material just to see how it can be explained differently from the textbook."

Hindsight is 20/20 I suppose.Anywho, I have made it a goal to go back and study more math and physics on my own time and Six Easy Pieces was the consensus recommendation for where to start.Coming in at a slim 150 pages, Six Easy Pieces is a Physics 101 class in a breezy book.

I'm not sure if that's because the book is a series of freshman physics lectures Feynman gave (and I've taken a year of college physics) and because it seemed too simple; or because he seemed to bounce around between really simple concepts (what is an atom? what is light?) and really difficult ones, including formulas and calculations I'd never seen and didn't understand. I wouldn't recommened it to someone new to physics or someone well-acquainted; it would be too difficult for the former and too simple for the latter. "

Adapted from the undergraduate lectures delivered by Richard Feynman during his professorship at Caltech, the narrative is very talkative and easy to digest.Feynman himself contributed well to physics, receiving (jointly) the Nobel Prize for Physics in 1965 for his work in quantum electrodynamics, developing pictorial representations of quantum interactions (now known as Feynman diagrams) and pioneering the field of quantum computing. He was a keen populariser of physics in his lifetime, and his legacy of books and lectures still remains.The six chapters included in this book, taken from Volumes I and III of the Feynman Lectures on Physics, are: Atoms in Motion, Basic Physics, The Relation of Physics to Other Sciences, Conservation of Energy, The Theory of Gravitation and Quantum Behaviour.Each chapter is full of coherent descriptions of the concepts at hand, using everyday analogies and clear diagrams to illustrate exactly how things work. Key experiments in the progression of modern physics are also included, their purpose and true significance explained. The simplicity and clarity in which the material in this book is delivered certainly sets it apart from others of similar genre – especially with its achievable thickness of merely 1cm.Receiving positive critical acclaim from major publications, Six Easy Pieces has become renowned as a work that serves two purposes – to explain important concepts to non-physicsts, and to give an insight into Feynman and his mannerisms. “With Feynman as a guide, you cant help wondering why everyone is not turning to science” – the Guardian.If you are considering studying physics at A-level or university, I would strongly recommend this book as it expands on what you already know and takes it a step further. Furthermore, hearing familiar concepts in a different style to normal is a very refreshing experience. If you have an interest in finding more out about the universe around you without much background knowledge, Six Easy Pieces is certainly a worthy and rewarding introduction to some important concepts."
166,0465023924,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1671310-hayley,4,"This book is an introduction to the most basic ideas of physics, and part of its sophistication is that it hints at how deep the...rabbit hole...is, without requiring readers to have enough expertise to really go down it.It was readable but challenging for me - someone with a bachelor's in biology and no great adeptitude for physics or math. My one complaint is that author Richard Feynmann could work a little harder to help lay readers understand how his verbal descriptions of physics translate into the equations he provides. Sometimes it was clear and other times I was left wondering about some squiggly mathematical symbol I don't remember, or why something has to be squared... One thing that comes across very well: Some physical properties of the universe - the subatomic particles/waves dealt with by quantum physics - seem to, by their very nature, do things we can't pin down and predict precisely, but rather, we can only understand them in terms of the ODDS of what will happen. And if people try to precisely document certain tiny activities - like finding the probabilities of where electrons will go - the observers change the pattern just by trying to document it. In a couple of ways, uncertainty seems to be part of the root of reality. After reading this, I feel like I have much more of an intuitive basis for reading more about physics. I also have more intuition, after reading this book, about where math-based theory and experimentation complement each other in physics. That said, ask me what I read, and I'll probably stumble."
167,0465023924,http://goodreads.com/user/show/15875470-molly-ison,5,"Possibly the most important part of this book is in the preface, when Feynman discusses the problems of physics pedagogy. These actually are easy pieces - if you have had high school level physics, the concepts should be immediately familiar. While Feynman presents them in a way that is fairly labeled brilliant, there are many physics teachers and professors who could give you an excellent understanding of the same material (and it's not too hard to find some online). The real issue here is the link between ability to solve problems and ability to understand concepts. When I took physics, I solved a lot of mathematical equations that involved different forces - a block moves up a hill and there's gravity, friction, the slope of the hill, the mass of the block, etc... One can be very good at recognizing the right formulas and plugging in the right numbers and still have no real idea about what's happening on a conceptual level. On the other hand, when Feynman actually delivered these lectures to a hall full of freshmen, despite having recitation sections, they did not do outstandingly well in being able to solve examination problems, and Feynman admits so himself. However, graduate students and other faculty members sat in on these lectures and valued them highly. So I would say that this is probably a book not for those who have never had exposure to physics, but for those who have a problem solving level understanding (or did at some point) and want to solidify for themselves what those problems are actually about. "
168,0465023924,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1436673-tom,4,"I've had this book on the shelf for some time, meaning to read it to refresh my memory of physics classes taken long ago. It was a quick enjoyable read that explained things I've already learned in a new and refreshing way, (even though these lectures were given almost fifty years ago.) I was especially impressed with the first two chapters. With some minor modifications, these two lectures could be used to explain atomic theory to elementary students. This is quite an accomplishment considering that the targeted audience is Cal Tech undergraduates! Feynman often said something like (and I'm paraphrasing here) ""It all goes back to the Double Slit experiment.) I truly believe that a person who becomes aware of this experiment and what it ""means"" can never really look at the world the same way again. As well versed as Feynman was with the intricacies of the paradoxes that permeate the Double Slit, I was sort of disappointed with his explanation of it. I think the chapter on it in ""The Dancing Wu Li Masters"" explains it better and does a better job of conveying the awesome mystery of it. Of course, Gary Zhukov had the advantage of writing his book after Alain Aspect had run his experiment (1964) related to Bell's Theorem, confirming that the Universe we inhabit is truly, deeply, weirdly mysterious. Still, I didn't think Feynman conveyed that very well in this book, but really that wasn't his purpose here, so I'm giving it four stars."
169,0465023924,http://goodreads.com/user/show/116652-punk,2,"Non-fiction. This book contains six chapters from Feynman's Lectures on Physics, which were transcribed from actual lectures he gave at Caltech during 1961-1964. It made me feel dumb. Well, not entirely, I did okay with the chemistry, biology, and astronomy aspects of it, as I have background in those areas, and I was all right with the quantum mechanics stuff because that requires more imagination than math, but I've never taken a physics course, so all the nonsense with pulleys totally shot over my head. All the weights and wedges and three 1 lb balls being lifted three feet by one 1 lb ball -- that I would have to see in order to understand, fig 4.2 just didn't cut it for me, but even when I had no clue what he was talking about, Feynman was a steady, calming voice, rational and grounded. He wasn't afraid to admit science might be wrong about something, or that there are still mysteries science can't answer. He was hailed a great scientist, but he was a great teacher as well, someone who loved his field of study, and even these lectures, trapped between the pages of a book, make that clear.Two stars for Feynman's laid back approach to some complicated concepts, but, like shooting one particle through a gap in a wall, it was hit and miss."
170,0465023924,http://goodreads.com/user/show/336491-laura,2,"I may be one of the few scientists who is not a Feynman fan. He admits that his approach is to teach to the very brightest students, hoping that the others manage to catch something along the way. But, when you remember the man taught at CalTech--where basically every student is pretty darned smart, his approach seems a bit arrogant. He also claims that he had no opportunity during the lecture series to gain feedback from students--that this came only at the end of the course. Astonishing that such an obviously bright individual can't think of some way to gauge student learning along the way... perhaps by asking the students? Administering a quiz or otherwise collecting some data?I realize this was a different time in university science education, where expectations were much different, but the fact that we haven't made a lot of strides in science ed on the post-secondary level increases my distaste for the old school approach.I will confess his explanations are interesting, if you're already familiar with the material. I just couldn't get past feeling sorry for the poor souls who found themselves learning physics for the first time with this approach."

A charming genius without the snooty air of formalism is a role model I can follow. And here in this book is the start to understanding a Feynman way of mind. These 6 essays are adapted from Feynman's Lectures on basic physics back in the 1960's. I wish I had discovered these essays before college, because they really would have made physics easy and interesting to learn before I took 2 semesters of crazy med-school fueled classes. Covering topics like the basics of science, atomic motion, law of the conservation of energy, gravitation, and even quantum mechanics. Feynman also has a unique style which is matter of fact and personable, but just has the slightest hint of poetry. A really fantastic read for the beginner scientist or the physicist who just wants a return to physical wonder. I've already put the full lectures on my to-read list."
172,0465023924,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4333246-lauren,5,"Feynman never ceases to amaze me with his genuine ability to take a complicated subject (or concept) and make it accessible to the masses. After reading his book of short stories, I've been perpetually intrigues by Feynman, his interests, accomplishments, and thought process. These six lectures provide a window into the mind that helped inspire many future physicists and their subsequent breakthroughs. It inspired me to think more carefully about the mundane things we take for granted; I found myself thinking about the structure of an element, how it fits together to create molecules, and are the true building blocks for everything in the Universe. My favorite subjects were the generalities of atoms, the interaction of physics with all other sciences, and gravitational forces as they relate to our solar system, galaxy and universe.

In that sense I did get inspired here and there. But this book reads just like what it is: transcripts of live lectures, therefore in my opinion it just doesn't makes too good a book on introductory physics without the brilliant personality of the lecturer and his spontaneous notes on board or any other in-class demonstration. I found those detailed descriptions of the imagined experiments especially difficult to follow even though I already know the materials. So I think one should still learn physics formally and systematically, and can read this book as supplementary material just to see how it can be explained differently from the textbook."

Hindsight is 20/20 I suppose.Anywho, I have made it a goal to go back and study more math and physics on my own time and Six Easy Pieces was the consensus recommendation for where to start.Coming in at a slim 150 pages, Six Easy Pieces is a Physics 101 class in a breezy book.

I'm not sure if that's because the book is a series of freshman physics lectures Feynman gave (and I've taken a year of college physics) and because it seemed too simple; or because he seemed to bounce around between really simple concepts (what is an atom? what is light?) and really difficult ones, including formulas and calculations I'd never seen and didn't understand. I wouldn't recommened it to someone new to physics or someone well-acquainted; it would be too difficult for the former and too simple for the latter. "

190,0465023924,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8524944-ioannis-savvas,5,"Ο Richard Feynman (1918-1988) είναι ένας από τους μεγαλύτερους θεωρητικούς φυσικούς του 20ου αιώνα. Καθηγητής στο Cornell, δούλεψε μαζί με το Hans Bethe στο Los Alamos. Το 1965 βραβεύθηκε με το βραβείο Nobel για τη δουλειά του στη θεωρία της κβαντομηχανικής.Το Six Easy Pieces είναι μια συλλογή διαλλέξεων στους φοιτητές του. Ο Feynman διακρινόταν για την ικανότητά του να εξηγεί πολύπλοκα θέματα φυσικής με απλό τρόπο, χρησιμοποιώντας παραδείγματα από την καθημερινότητα. Το βιβλίο είναι απολαυστικό και διαβάζεται πολύ εύκολα.Το δυνατότερο σημείο του βιβλίο από το δεύτερο κεφάλαιο (Basic Physics):What do we mean by “understanding” something? We can imagine that this complicated array of moving things which constitutes “the world” is something like a great chess game being played by the gods, and we are observers of the game. We do not know what the rules of the game are; all we are allowed to do is to watch the playing. Of course, if we watch long enough, we may eventually catch on to a few of the rules. The rules of the game are what we mean by fundamental physics. Even if we knew every rule, however, we might not be able to understand why a particular move is made in the game, merely because it is too complicated and our minds are limited. If you play chess you must know that it is easy to learn all the rules, and yet it is often very hard to select the best move or to understand why a player moves as he does. So it is in nature, only much more so; but we may be able at least to find all the rules. Actually, we do not have all the rules now. (Every once in a while something like castling is going on that we still do not understand.) Aside from not knowing all of the rules, what we really can explain in terms of those rules is very limited, because almost all situations are so enormously complicated that we cannot follow the plays of the game using the rules, much less tell what is going to happen next. We must, therefore, limit ourselves to the more basic question of the rules of the game. If we know the rules, we consider that we “understand” the world.How can we tell whether the rules which we “guess” at are really right if we cannot analyze the game very well? There are, roughly speaking, three ways. First, there may be situations where nature has arranged, or we arrange nature, to be simple and to have so few parts that we can predict exactly what will happen, and thus we can check how our rules work. (In one corner of the board there may be only a few chess pieces at work, and that we figure out exactly.)A second good way to check rules is in terms of less specific rules derived from them. For example, the rule on the move of a bishop on a chessboard is that it moves only on the diagonal. One can deduce, no matter how many moves may be made, that a certain bishop will always be on a red square. So, without being able to follow the details, we can always check our idea about the bishop’s motion by finding out whether it is always on a red square. Of course it will be, for a long time, until all of a sudden we find that it is on a black square (what happened of course, is that in the meantime it was captured, another pawn crossed for queening, and it turned into a bishop on a black square). That is the way it is in physics. For a long time we will have a rule that works excellently in an overall way, even when we cannot follow the details, and then some time we may discover a new rule. From the point of view of basic physics, the most interesting phenomena are of course in the new places, the places where the rules do not work -not the places where they do work! That is the way in which we discover new rules.The third way to tell whether our ideas are right is relatively crude but probably the most powerful of them all. That is, by rough approximation. While we may not be able to tell why Alekhine moves this particular piece, perhaps we can roughly understand that he is gathering his pieces around the king to protect it, more or less, since that is the sensible thing to do in the circumstances. In the same way, we can often understand nature, more or less, without being able to see what every little piece is doing, in terms of our understanding of the game."

My one complaint is that author Richard Feynmann could work a little harder to help lay readers understand how his verbal descriptions of physics translate into the equations he provides. Sometimes it was clear and other times I was left wondering about some squiggly mathematical symbol I don't remember, or why something has to be squared... One thing that comes across very well: Some physical properties of the universe - the subatomic particles/waves dealt with by quantum physics - seem to, by their very nature, do things we can't pin down and predict precisely, but rather, we can only understand them in terms of the ODDS of what will happen. And if people try to precisely document certain tiny activities - like finding the probabilities of where electrons will go - the observers change the pattern just by trying to document it. In a couple of ways, uncertainty seems to be part of the root of reality. After reading this, I feel like I have much more of an intuitive basis for reading more about physics. I also have more intuition, after reading this book, about where math-based theory and experimentation complement each other in physics. That said, ask me what I read, and I'll probably stumble."
197,0465023924,http://goodreads.com/user/show/15875470-molly-ison,5,"Possibly the most important part of this book is in the preface, when Feynman discusses the problems of physics pedagogy. These actually are easy pieces - if you have had high school level physics, the concepts should be immediately familiar. While Feynman presents them in a way that is fairly labeled brilliant, there are many physics teachers and professors who could give you an excellent understanding of the same material (and it's not too hard to find some online). The real issue here is the link between ability to solve problems and ability to understand concepts. When I took physics, I solved a lot of mathematical equations that involved different forces - a block moves up a hill and there's gravity, friction, the slope of the hill, the mass of the block, etc... One can be very good at recognizing the right formulas and plugging in the right numbers and still have no real idea about what's happening on a conceptual level. On the other hand, when Feynman actually delivered these lectures to a hall full of freshmen, despite having recitation sections, they did not do outstandingly well in being able to solve examination problems, and Feynman admits so himself. However, graduate students and other faculty members sat in on these lectures and valued them highly. So I would say that this is probably a book not for those who have never had exposure to physics, but for those who have a problem solving level understanding (or did at some point) and want to solidify for themselves what those problems are actually about. "
198,0465023924,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1436673-tom,4,"I've had this book on the shelf for some time, meaning to read it to refresh my memory of physics classes taken long ago. It was a quick enjoyable read that explained things I've already learned in a new and refreshing way, (even though these lectures were given almost fifty years ago.) I was especially impressed with the first two chapters. With some minor modifications, these two lectures could be used to explain atomic theory to elementary students. This is quite an accomplishment considering that the targeted audience is Cal Tech undergraduates! Feynman often said something like (and I'm paraphrasing here) ""It all goes back to the Double Slit experiment.) I truly believe that a person who becomes aware of this experiment and what it ""means"" can never really look at the world the same way again. As well versed as Feynman was with the intricacies of the paradoxes that permeate the Double Slit, I was sort of disappointed with his explanation of it. I think the chapter on it in ""The Dancing Wu Li Masters"" explains it better and does a better job of conveying the awesome mystery of it. Of course, Gary Zhukov had the advantage of writing his book after Alain Aspect had run his experiment (1964) related to Bell's Theorem, confirming that the Universe we inhabit is truly, deeply, weirdly mysterious. Still, I didn't think Feynman conveyed that very well in this book, but really that wasn't his purpose here, so I'm giving it four stars."
199,0465023924,http://goodreads.com/user/show/116652-punk,2,"Non-fiction. This book contains six chapters from Feynman's Lectures on Physics, which were transcribed from actual lectures he gave at Caltech during 1961-1964. It made me feel dumb. Well, not entirely, I did okay with the chemistry, biology, and astronomy aspects of it, as I have background in those areas, and I was all right with the quantum mechanics stuff because that requires more imagination than math, but I've never taken a physics course, so all the nonsense with pulleys totally shot over my head. All the weights and wedges and three 1 lb balls being lifted three feet by one 1 lb ball -- that I would have to see in order to understand, fig 4.2 just didn't cut it for me, but even when I had no clue what he was talking about, Feynman was a steady, calming voice, rational and grounded. He wasn't afraid to admit science might be wrong about something, or that there are still mysteries science can't answer. He was hailed a great scientist, but he was a great teacher as well, someone who loved his field of study, and even these lectures, trapped between the pages of a book, make that clear.Two stars for Feynman's laid back approach to some complicated concepts, but, like shooting one particle through a gap in a wall, it was hit and miss."
200,0465023924,http://goodreads.com/user/show/336491-laura,2,"I may be one of the few scientists who is not a Feynman fan. He admits that his approach is to teach to the very brightest students, hoping that the others manage to catch something along the way. But, when you remember the man taught at CalTech--where basically every student is pretty darned smart, his approach seems a bit arrogant. He also claims that he had no opportunity during the lecture series to gain feedback from students--that this came only at the end of the course. Astonishing that such an obviously bright individual can't think of some way to gauge student learning along the way... perhaps by asking the students? Administering a quiz or otherwise collecting some data?I realize this was a different time in university science education, where expectations were much different, but the fact that we haven't made a lot of strides in science ed on the post-secondary level increases my distaste for the old school approach.I will confess his explanations are interesting, if you're already familiar with the material. I just couldn't get past feeling sorry for the poor souls who found themselves learning physics for the first time with this approach."
201,0465023924,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2446389-upom,5,"Feynman, the debonair physicist of the last generation. Part physicist, part bongo player, part safe cracker, all man. A charming genius without the snooty air of formalism is a role model I can follow. And here in this book is the start to understanding a Feynman way of mind. These 6 essays are adapted from Feynman's Lectures on basic physics back in the 1960's. I wish I had discovered these essays before college, because they really would have made physics easy and interesting to learn before I took 2 semesters of crazy med-school fueled classes. Covering topics like the basics of science, atomic motion, law of the conservation of energy, gravitation, and even quantum mechanics. Feynman also has a unique style which is matter of fact and personable, but just has the slightest hint of poetry. A really fantastic read for the beginner scientist or the physicist who just wants a return to physical wonder. I've already put the full lectures on my to-read list."
202,0465023924,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4333246-lauren,5,"Feynman never ceases to amaze me with his genuine ability to take a complicated subject (or concept) and make it accessible to the masses. After reading his book of short stories, I've been perpetually intrigues by Feynman, his interests, accomplishments, and thought process. These six lectures provide a window into the mind that helped inspire many future physicists and their subsequent breakthroughs. It inspired me to think more carefully about the mundane things we take for granted; I found myself thinking about the structure of an element, how it fits together to create molecules, and are the true building blocks for everything in the Universe. My favorite subjects were the generalities of atoms, the interaction of physics with all other sciences, and gravitational forces as they relate to our solar system, galaxy and universe. If you want a book that will truly keep you on your toes and thinking, pick this one up. "
203,0465023924,http://goodreads.com/user/show/37210284-yiheng-wang,4,"As an educator in STEM discipline, I started to read this book (primarily) hoping to glean some ideas on how to explain the basics of physics to other people in vivid but simple words. In that sense I did get inspired here and there. But this book reads just like what it is: transcripts of live lectures, therefore in my opinion it just doesn't makes too good a book on introductory physics without the brilliant personality of the lecturer and his spontaneous notes on board or any other in-class demonstration. I found those detailed descriptions of the imagined experiments especially difficult to follow even though I already know the materials. So I think one should still learn physics formally and systematically, and can read this book as supplementary material just to see how it can be explained differently from the textbook."

The departments for both at my school were fairly challenging and I wasn’t particularly good at them and so I shied away for fear they would hurt my GPA.As it turns out, no one has ever asked to see my GPA and I would have been better off taking the classes, getting Cs and learning a lot. Hindsight is 20/20 I suppose.Anywho, I have made it a goal to go back and study more math and physics on my own time and Six Easy Pieces was the consensus recommendation for where to start.Coming in at a slim 150 pages, Six Easy Pieces is a Physics 101 class in a breezy book.

I'm not sure if that's because the book is a series of freshman physics lectures Feynman gave (and I've taken a year of college physics) and because it seemed too simple; or because he seemed to bounce around between really simple concepts (what is an atom? what is light?) and really difficult ones, including formulas and calculations I'd never seen and didn't understand. I wouldn't recommened it to someone new to physics or someone well-acquainted; it would be too difficult for the former and too simple for the latter. "

220,0465023924,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8524944-ioannis-savvas,5,"Ο Richard Feynman (1918-1988) είναι ένας από τους μεγαλύτερους θεωρητικούς φυσικούς του 20ου αιώνα. Καθηγητής στο Cornell, δούλεψε μαζί με το Hans Bethe στο Los Alamos. Το 1965 βραβεύθηκε με το βραβείο Nobel για τη δουλειά του στη θεωρία της κβαντομηχανικής.Το Six Easy Pieces είναι μια συλλογή διαλλέξεων στους φοιτητές του. Ο Feynman διακρινόταν για την ικανότητά του να εξηγεί πολύπλοκα θέματα φυσικής με απλό τρόπο, χρησιμοποιώντας παραδείγματα από την καθημερινότητα. Το βιβλίο είναι απολαυστικό και διαβάζεται πολύ εύκολα.Το δυνατότερο σημείο του βιβλίο από το δεύτερο κεφάλαιο (Basic Physics):What do we mean by “understanding” something? We can imagine that this complicated array of moving things which constitutes “the world” is something like a great chess game being played by the gods, and we are observers of the game. We do not know what the rules of the game are; all we are allowed to do is to watch the playing. Of course, if we watch long enough, we may eventually catch on to a few of the rules. The rules of the game are what we mean by fundamental physics. Even if we knew every rule, however, we might not be able to understand why a particular move is made in the game, merely because it is too complicated and our minds are limited. If you play chess you must know that it is easy to learn all the rules, and yet it is often very hard to select the best move or to understand why a player moves as he does. So it is in nature, only much more so; but we may be able at least to find all the rules. Actually, we do not have all the rules now. (Every once in a while something like castling is going on that we still do not understand.) Aside from not knowing all of the rules, what we really can explain in terms of those rules is very limited, because almost all situations are so enormously complicated that we cannot follow the plays of the game using the rules, much less tell what is going to happen next. We must, therefore, limit ourselves to the more basic question of the rules of the game. If we know the rules, we consider that we “understand” the world.How can we tell whether the rules which we “guess” at are really right if we cannot analyze the game very well? There are, roughly speaking, three ways. First, there may be situations where nature has arranged, or we arrange nature, to be simple and to have so few parts that we can predict exactly what will happen, and thus we can check how our rules work. (In one corner of the board there may be only a few chess pieces at work, and that we figure out exactly.)A second good way to check rules is in terms of less specific rules derived from them. For example, the rule on the move of a bishop on a chessboard is that it moves only on the diagonal. One can deduce, no matter how many moves may be made, that a certain bishop will always be on a red square. So, without being able to follow the details, we can always check our idea about the bishop’s motion by finding out whether it is always on a red square. Of course it will be, for a long time, until all of a sudden we find that it is on a black square (what happened of course, is that in the meantime it was captured, another pawn crossed for queening, and it turned into a bishop on a black square). That is the way it is in physics. For a long time we will have a rule that works excellently in an overall way, even when we cannot follow the details, and then some time we may discover a new rule. From the point of view of basic physics, the most interesting phenomena are of course in the new places, the places where the rules do not work -not the places where they do work! That is the way in which we discover new rules.The third way to tell whether our ideas are right is relatively crude but probably the most powerful of them all. That is, by rough approximation. While we may not be able to tell why Alekhine moves this particular piece, perhaps we can roughly understand that he is gathering his pieces around the king to protect it, more or less, since that is the sensible thing to do in the circumstances. In the same way, we can often understand nature, more or less, without being able to see what every little piece is doing, in terms of our understanding of the game."

While the title says ""easy"" - it is keeping in mind that these were lectures for the best and brightest at Caltech...so yes, while they are not overly complex, they are also not designed for the novice either. Five of the lectures cover concepts in classical physics (energy, gravitation etc) and the role of physics in society. However, it is the final chapter on quantum which is the gold mine in this book (especially regarding the Uncertainty Principle).I am a massive Feynman fan and he is widely notes as one of the best (and most engaging) physics teachers of the 20th century and while this book was good and definitely worth picking up, I am not sure whether I would call it great as some of the magic of Feynman just didn't translate as well as I was hoping to the written page.

Special Preface: ""Through the distant veil of memory, many of the students and faculty attending the lectures have said that having two years of physics with Feynman was the experience of a lifetime. But that's not how it seemed at the time. Many of the students dreaded the class, and as the course wore on, attendance by the registered students started dropping alarmingly. But at the same time, more and more faculty and graduate students started attending. The room stayed full, and Feynman may never have known he was losing some of his intended audience."" pp. xxii-xxiii""'Quantum mechanics' is the description of the behavior of matter in all its details and, in particular, of the happenings on an atomic scale. Things on a very small scale behave like nothing that you have any direct experience about. They do not behave like waves, they do not behave like particles, they do not behave like clouds, or billiard balls, or weights on springs, or like anything that you have ever seen."" pg. 116""Because atomic behavior is so unlike ordinary experience, it is very difficult to get used to and it appears peculiar and mysterious to everyone, both to the novice and to the experienced physicist. Even the experts do not understand it the way they would like to, and it is perfectly reasonable that they should not, because all of direct, human experience and of human intuition applies to large objects. We know how large objects will act, but things on a small scale just do not act that way. So we have to learn about them in a sort of abstract or imaginative fashion and not by connection with our direct experience."" pg. 117 ""We would like to emphasize a very important difference between classical and quantum mechanics....We can only predict the odds!.... We do not know how to predict what would happen in a given circumstance, and we believe now that it is impossible, that the only thing that can be predicted is the probability of different events."" pg. 135"

On the other hand, when Feynman actually delivered these lectures to a hall full of freshmen, despite having recitation sections, they did not do outstandingly well in being able to solve examination problems, and Feynman admits so himself. However, graduate students and other faculty members sat in on these lectures and valued them highly. So I would say that this is probably a book not for those who have never had exposure to physics, but for those who have a problem solving level understanding (or did at some point) and want to solidify for themselves what those problems are actually about. "
228,0465023924,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1436673-tom,4,"I've had this book on the shelf for some time, meaning to read it to refresh my memory of physics classes taken long ago. It was a quick enjoyable read that explained things I've already learned in a new and refreshing way, (even though these lectures were given almost fifty years ago.) I was especially impressed with the first two chapters. With some minor modifications, these two lectures could be used to explain atomic theory to elementary students. This is quite an accomplishment considering that the targeted audience is Cal Tech undergraduates! Feynman often said something like (and I'm paraphrasing here) ""It all goes back to the Double Slit experiment.) I truly believe that a person who becomes aware of this experiment and what it ""means"" can never really look at the world the same way again. As well versed as Feynman was with the intricacies of the paradoxes that permeate the Double Slit, I was sort of disappointed with his explanation of it. I think the chapter on it in ""The Dancing Wu Li Masters"" explains it better and does a better job of conveying the awesome mystery of it. Of course, Gary Zhukov had the advantage of writing his book after Alain Aspect had run his experiment (1964) related to Bell's Theorem, confirming that the Universe we inhabit is truly, deeply, weirdly mysterious. Still, I didn't think Feynman conveyed that very well in this book, but really that wasn't his purpose here, so I'm giving it four stars."

This book contains six chapters from Feynman's Lectures on Physics, which were transcribed from actual lectures he gave at Caltech during 1961-1964. It made me feel dumb. Well, not entirely, I did okay with the chemistry, biology, and astronomy aspects of it, as I have background in those areas, and I was all right with the quantum mechanics stuff because that requires more imagination than math, but I've never taken a physics course, so all the nonsense with pulleys totally shot over my head. All the weights and wedges and three 1 lb balls being lifted three feet by one 1 lb ball -- that I would have to see in order to understand, fig 4.2 just didn't cut it for me, but even when I had no clue what he was talking about, Feynman was a steady, calming voice, rational and grounded. He wasn't afraid to admit science might be wrong about something, or that there are still mysteries science can't answer. He was hailed a great scientist, but he was a great teacher as well, someone who loved his field of study, and even these lectures, trapped between the pages of a book, make that clear.Two stars for Feynman's laid back approach to some complicated concepts, but, like shooting one particle through a gap in a wall, it was hit and miss."

He admits that his approach is to teach to the very brightest students, hoping that the others manage to catch something along the way. But, when you remember the man taught at CalTech--where basically every student is pretty darned smart, his approach seems a bit arrogant. He also claims that he had no opportunity during the lecture series to gain feedback from students--that this came only at the end of the course. Astonishing that such an obviously bright individual can't think of some way to gauge student learning along the way... perhaps by asking the students? Administering a quiz or otherwise collecting some data?I realize this was a different time in university science education, where expectations were much different, but the fact that we haven't made a lot of strides in science ed on the post-secondary level increases my distaste for the old school approach.I will confess his explanations are interesting, if you're already familiar with the material. I just couldn't get past feeling sorry for the poor souls who found themselves learning physics for the first time with this approach."

A charming genius without the snooty air of formalism is a role model I can follow. And here in this book is the start to understanding a Feynman way of mind. These 6 essays are adapted from Feynman's Lectures on basic physics back in the 1960's. I wish I had discovered these essays before college, because they really would have made physics easy and interesting to learn before I took 2 semesters of crazy med-school fueled classes. Covering topics like the basics of science, atomic motion, law of the conservation of energy, gravitation, and even quantum mechanics. Feynman also has a unique style which is matter of fact and personable, but just has the slightest hint of poetry. A really fantastic read for the beginner scientist or the physicist who just wants a return to physical wonder. I've already put the full lectures on my to-read list."
232,0465023924,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4333246-lauren,5,"Feynman never ceases to amaze me with his genuine ability to take a complicated subject (or concept) and make it accessible to the masses. After reading his book of short stories, I've been perpetually intrigues by Feynman, his interests, accomplishments, and thought process. These six lectures provide a window into the mind that helped inspire many future physicists and their subsequent breakthroughs. It inspired me to think more carefully about the mundane things we take for granted; I found myself thinking about the structure of an element, how it fits together to create molecules, and are the true building blocks for everything in the Universe. My favorite subjects were the generalities of atoms, the interaction of physics with all other sciences, and gravitational forces as they relate to our solar system, galaxy and universe.

In that sense I did get inspired here and there. But this book reads just like what it is: transcripts of live lectures, therefore in my opinion it just doesn't makes too good a book on introductory physics without the brilliant personality of the lecturer and his spontaneous notes on board or any other in-class demonstration. I found those detailed descriptions of the imagined experiments especially difficult to follow even though I already know the materials. So I think one should still learn physics formally and systematically, and can read this book as supplementary material just to see how it can be explained differently from the textbook."

The departments for both at my school were fairly challenging and I wasn’t particularly good at them and so I shied away for fear they would hurt my GPA.As it turns out, no one has ever asked to see my GPA and I would have been better off taking the classes, getting Cs and learning a lot. Hindsight is 20/20 I suppose.Anywho, I have made it a goal to go back and study more math and physics on my own time and Six Easy Pieces was the consensus recommendation for where to start.Coming in at a slim 150 pages, Six Easy Pieces is a Physics 101 class in a breezy book.

I'm not sure if that's because the book is a series of freshman physics lectures Feynman gave (and I've taken a year of college physics) and because it seemed too simple; or because he seemed to bounce around between really simple concepts (what is an atom? what is light?) and really difficult ones, including formulas and calculations I'd never seen and didn't understand. I wouldn't recommened it to someone new to physics or someone well-acquainted; it would be too difficult for the former and too simple for the latter. "

He had a lively mind and spirit that helped him connect to the kids. Hell, he was a kid, just with an oversized brain.

250,0465023924,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8524944-ioannis-savvas,5,"Ο Richard Feynman (1918-1988) είναι ένας από τους μεγαλύτερους θεωρητικούς φυσικούς του 20ου αιώνα. Καθηγητής στο Cornell, δούλεψε μαζί με το Hans Bethe στο Los Alamos. Το 1965 βραβεύθηκε με το βραβείο Nobel για τη δουλειά του στη θεωρία της κβαντομηχανικής.Το Six Easy Pieces είναι μια συλλογή διαλλέξεων στους φοιτητές του. Ο Feynman διακρινόταν για την ικανότητά του να εξηγεί πολύπλοκα θέματα φυσικής με απλό τρόπο, χρησιμοποιώντας παραδείγματα από την καθημερινότητα. Το βιβλίο είναι απολαυστικό και διαβάζεται πολύ εύκολα.Το δυνατότερο σημείο του βιβλίο από το δεύτερο κεφάλαιο (Basic Physics):What do we mean by “understanding” something? We can imagine that this complicated array of moving things which constitutes “the world” is something like a great chess game being played by the gods, and we are observers of the game. We do not know what the rules of the game are; all we are allowed to do is to watch the playing. Of course, if we watch long enough, we may eventually catch on to a few of the rules. The rules of the game are what we mean by fundamental physics. Even if we knew every rule, however, we might not be able to understand why a particular move is made in the game, merely because it is too complicated and our minds are limited. If you play chess you must know that it is easy to learn all the rules, and yet it is often very hard to select the best move or to understand why a player moves as he does. So it is in nature, only much more so; but we may be able at least to find all the rules. Actually, we do not have all the rules now. (Every once in a while something like castling is going on that we still do not understand.) Aside from not knowing all of the rules, what we really can explain in terms of those rules is very limited, because almost all situations are so enormously complicated that we cannot follow the plays of the game using the rules, much less tell what is going to happen next. We must, therefore, limit ourselves to the more basic question of the rules of the game. If we know the rules, we consider that we “understand” the world.How can we tell whether the rules which we “guess” at are really right if we cannot analyze the game very well? There are, roughly speaking, three ways. First, there may be situations where nature has arranged, or we arrange nature, to be simple and to have so few parts that we can predict exactly what will happen, and thus we can check how our rules work. (In one corner of the board there may be only a few chess pieces at work, and that we figure out exactly.)A second good way to check rules is in terms of less specific rules derived from them. For example, the rule on the move of a bishop on a chessboard is that it moves only on the diagonal. One can deduce, no matter how many moves may be made, that a certain bishop will always be on a red square. So, without being able to follow the details, we can always check our idea about the bishop’s motion by finding out whether it is always on a red square. Of course it will be, for a long time, until all of a sudden we find that it is on a black square (what happened of course, is that in the meantime it was captured, another pawn crossed for queening, and it turned into a bishop on a black square). That is the way it is in physics. For a long time we will have a rule that works excellently in an overall way, even when we cannot follow the details, and then some time we may discover a new rule. From the point of view of basic physics, the most interesting phenomena are of course in the new places, the places where the rules do not work -not the places where they do work! That is the way in which we discover new rules.The third way to tell whether our ideas are right is relatively crude but probably the most powerful of them all. That is, by rough approximation. While we may not be able to tell why Alekhine moves this particular piece, perhaps we can roughly understand that he is gathering his pieces around the king to protect it, more or less, since that is the sensible thing to do in the circumstances. In the same way, we can often understand nature, more or less, without being able to see what every little piece is doing, in terms of our understanding of the game."

While the title says ""easy"" - it is keeping in mind that these were lectures for the best and brightest at Caltech...so yes, while they are not overly complex, they are also not designed for the novice either. Five of the lectures cover concepts in classical physics (energy, gravitation etc) and the role of physics in society. However, it is the final chapter on quantum which is the gold mine in this book (especially regarding the Uncertainty Principle).I am a massive Feynman fan and he is widely notes as one of the best (and most engaging) physics teachers of the 20th century and while this book was good and definitely worth picking up, I am not sure whether I would call it great as some of the magic of Feynman just didn't translate as well as I was hoping to the written page.

Special Preface: ""Through the distant veil of memory, many of the students and faculty attending the lectures have said that having two years of physics with Feynman was the experience of a lifetime. But that's not how it seemed at the time. Many of the students dreaded the class, and as the course wore on, attendance by the registered students started dropping alarmingly. But at the same time, more and more faculty and graduate students started attending. The room stayed full, and Feynman may never have known he was losing some of his intended audience."" pp. xxii-xxiii""'Quantum mechanics' is the description of the behavior of matter in all its details and, in particular, of the happenings on an atomic scale. Things on a very small scale behave like nothing that you have any direct experience about. They do not behave like waves, they do not behave like particles, they do not behave like clouds, or billiard balls, or weights on springs, or like anything that you have ever seen."" pg. 116""Because atomic behavior is so unlike ordinary experience, it is very difficult to get used to and it appears peculiar and mysterious to everyone, both to the novice and to the experienced physicist. Even the experts do not understand it the way they would like to, and it is perfectly reasonable that they should not, because all of direct, human experience and of human intuition applies to large objects. We know how large objects will act, but things on a small scale just do not act that way. So we have to learn about them in a sort of abstract or imaginative fashion and not by connection with our direct experience."" pg. 117 ""We would like to emphasize a very important difference between classical and quantum mechanics....We can only predict the odds!.... We do not know how to predict what would happen in a given circumstance, and we believe now that it is impossible, that the only thing that can be predicted is the probability of different events."" pg. 135"
255,0465023924,http://goodreads.com/user/show/30489708-alcatraz-dey,4,"This book is a brilliant way to broaden your knowledge of the key concepts of physics. Adapted from the undergraduate lectures delivered by Richard Feynman during his professorship at Caltech, the narrative is very talkative and easy to digest.Feynman himself contributed well to physics, receiving (jointly) the Nobel Prize for Physics in 1965 for his work in quantum electrodynamics, developing pictorial representations of quantum interactions (now known as Feynman diagrams) and pioneering the field of quantum computing. He was a keen populariser of physics in his lifetime, and his legacy of books and lectures still remains.The six chapters included in this book, taken from Volumes I and III of the Feynman Lectures on Physics, are: Atoms in Motion, Basic Physics, The Relation of Physics to Other Sciences, Conservation of Energy, The Theory of Gravitation and Quantum Behaviour.Each chapter is full of coherent descriptions of the concepts at hand, using everyday analogies and clear diagrams to illustrate exactly how things work. Key experiments in the progression of modern physics are also included, their purpose and true significance explained. The simplicity and clarity in which the material in this book is delivered certainly sets it apart from others of similar genre – especially with its achievable thickness of merely 1cm.Receiving positive critical acclaim from major publications, Six Easy Pieces has become renowned as a work that serves two purposes – to explain important concepts to non-physicsts, and to give an insight into Feynman and his mannerisms. “With Feynman as a guide, you cant help wondering why everyone is not turning to science” – the Guardian.If you are considering studying physics at A-level or university, I would strongly recommend this book as it expands on what you already know and takes it a step further. Furthermore, hearing familiar concepts in a different style to normal is a very refreshing experience. If you have an interest in finding more out about the universe around you without much background knowledge, Six Easy Pieces is certainly a worthy and rewarding introduction to some important concepts."
256,0465023924,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1671310-hayley,4,"This book is an introduction to the most basic ideas of physics, and part of its sophistication is that it hints at how deep the...rabbit hole...is, without requiring readers to have enough expertise to really go down it.It was readable but challenging for me - someone with a bachelor's in biology and no great adeptitude for physics or math. My one complaint is that author Richard Feynmann could work a little harder to help lay readers understand how his verbal descriptions of physics translate into the equations he provides. Sometimes it was clear and other times I was left wondering about some squiggly mathematical symbol I don't remember, or why something has to be squared... One thing that comes across very well: Some physical properties of the universe - the subatomic particles/waves dealt with by quantum physics - seem to, by their very nature, do things we can't pin down and predict precisely, but rather, we can only understand them in terms of the ODDS of what will happen. And if people try to precisely document certain tiny activities - like finding the probabilities of where electrons will go - the observers change the pattern just by trying to document it. In a couple of ways, uncertainty seems to be part of the root of reality. After reading this, I feel like I have much more of an intuitive basis for reading more about physics. I also have more intuition, after reading this book, about where math-based theory and experimentation complement each other in physics. That said, ask me what I read, and I'll probably stumble."
257,0465023924,http://goodreads.com/user/show/15875470-molly-ison,5,"Possibly the most important part of this book is in the preface, when Feynman discusses the problems of physics pedagogy. These actually are easy pieces - if you have had high school level physics, the concepts should be immediately familiar. While Feynman presents them in a way that is fairly labeled brilliant, there are many physics teachers and professors who could give you an excellent understanding of the same material (and it's not too hard to find some online). The real issue here is the link between ability to solve problems and ability to understand concepts. When I took physics, I solved a lot of mathematical equations that involved different forces - a block moves up a hill and there's gravity, friction, the slope of the hill, the mass of the block, etc... One can be very good at recognizing the right formulas and plugging in the right numbers and still have no real idea about what's happening on a conceptual level. On the other hand, when Feynman actually delivered these lectures to a hall full of freshmen, despite having recitation sections, they did not do outstandingly well in being able to solve examination problems, and Feynman admits so himself. However, graduate students and other faculty members sat in on these lectures and valued them highly. So I would say that this is probably a book not for those who have never had exposure to physics, but for those who have a problem solving level understanding (or did at some point) and want to solidify for themselves what those problems are actually about.

Administering a quiz or otherwise collecting some data?I realize this was a different time in university science education, where expectations were much different, but the fact that we haven't made a lot of strides in science ed on the post-secondary level increases my distaste for the old school approach.I will confess his explanations are interesting, if you're already familiar with the material.

280,0465023924,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8524944-ioannis-savvas,5,"Ο Richard Feynman (1918-1988) είναι ένας από τους μεγαλύτερους θεωρητικούς φυσικούς του 20ου αιώνα. Καθηγητής στο Cornell, δούλεψε μαζί με το Hans Bethe στο Los Alamos. Το 1965 βραβεύθηκε με το βραβείο Nobel για τη δουλειά του στη θεωρία της κβαντομηχανικής.Το Six Easy Pieces είναι μια συλλογή διαλλέξεων στους φοιτητές του. Ο Feynman διακρινόταν για την ικανότητά του να εξηγεί πολύπλοκα θέματα φυσικής με απλό τρόπο, χρησιμοποιώντας παραδείγματα από την καθημερινότητα. Το βιβλίο είναι απολαυστικό και διαβάζεται πολύ εύκολα.Το δυνατότερο σημείο του βιβλίο από το δεύτερο κεφάλαιο (Basic Physics):What do we mean by “understanding” something? We can imagine that this complicated array of moving things which constitutes “the world” is something like a great chess game being played by the gods, and we are observers of the game. We do not know what the rules of the game are; all we are allowed to do is to watch the playing. Of course, if we watch long enough, we may eventually catch on to a few of the rules. The rules of the game are what we mean by fundamental physics. Even if we knew every rule, however, we might not be able to understand why a particular move is made in the game, merely because it is too complicated and our minds are limited. If you play chess you must know that it is easy to learn all the rules, and yet it is often very hard to select the best move or to understand why a player moves as he does. So it is in nature, only much more so; but we may be able at least to find all the rules. Actually, we do not have all the rules now. (Every once in a while something like castling is going on that we still do not understand.) Aside from not knowing all of the rules, what we really can explain in terms of those rules is very limited, because almost all situations are so enormously complicated that we cannot follow the plays of the game using the rules, much less tell what is going to happen next. We must, therefore, limit ourselves to the more basic question of the rules of the game. If we know the rules, we consider that we “understand” the world.How can we tell whether the rules which we “guess” at are really right if we cannot analyze the game very well? There are, roughly speaking, three ways. First, there may be situations where nature has arranged, or we arrange nature, to be simple and to have so few parts that we can predict exactly what will happen, and thus we can check how our rules work. (In one corner of the board there may be only a few chess pieces at work, and that we figure out exactly.)A second good way to check rules is in terms of less specific rules derived from them. For example, the rule on the move of a bishop on a chessboard is that it moves only on the diagonal. One can deduce, no matter how many moves may be made, that a certain bishop will always be on a red square. So, without being able to follow the details, we can always check our idea about the bishop’s motion by finding out whether it is always on a red square. Of course it will be, for a long time, until all of a sudden we find that it is on a black square (what happened of course, is that in the meantime it was captured, another pawn crossed for queening, and it turned into a bishop on a black square). That is the way it is in physics. For a long time we will have a rule that works excellently in an overall way, even when we cannot follow the details, and then some time we may discover a new rule. From the point of view of basic physics, the most interesting phenomena are of course in the new places, the places where the rules do not work -not the places where they do work! That is the way in which we discover new rules.The third way to tell whether our ideas are right is relatively crude but probably the most powerful of them all. That is, by rough approximation. While we may not be able to tell why Alekhine moves this particular piece, perhaps we can roughly understand that he is gathering his pieces around the king to protect it, more or less, since that is the sensible thing to do in the circumstances. In the same way, we can often understand nature, more or less, without being able to see what every little piece is doing, in terms of our understanding of the game."

While the title says ""easy"" - it is keeping in mind that these were lectures for the best and brightest at Caltech...so yes, while they are not overly complex, they are also not designed for the novice either. Five of the lectures cover concepts in classical physics (energy, gravitation etc) and the role of physics in society. However, it is the final chapter on quantum which is the gold mine in this book (especially regarding the Uncertainty Principle).I am a massive Feynman fan and he is widely notes as one of the best (and most engaging) physics teachers of the 20th century and while this book was good and definitely worth picking up, I am not sure whether I would call it great as some of the magic of Feynman just didn't translate as well as I was hoping to the written page. Well worth the read."
283,0465023924,http://goodreads.com/user/show/46917424-rami,5,"The way that Feynman goes by explaining the topics of this book reminded me of Stephen Hawking's books about the universe. I did enjoy the analogies the author uses to explain some principles that are not always easy to grasp, particularly about our our knowledge of the laws discussed.I found myself discovering new ideas and seeing things from a new perspective even after several years in engineering, having already read and studies most of the content of this book before, but never from this angle.Would definitely recommend it as an entry point to people who want more insight into modern day physics."
284,0465023924,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1094533-mary-overton,0,"Lectures from a series given at Caltech in the early 60s - intended for freshmen, to stimulate their interest in physics. Special Preface: ""Through the distant veil of memory, many of the students and faculty attending the lectures have said that having two years of physics with Feynman was the experience of a lifetime. But that's not how it seemed at the time. Many of the students dreaded the class, and as the course wore on, attendance by the registered students started dropping alarmingly. But at the same time, more and more faculty and graduate students started attending. The room stayed full, and Feynman may never have known he was losing some of his intended audience."" pp. xxii-xxiii""'Quantum mechanics' is the description of the behavior of matter in all its details and, in particular, of the happenings on an atomic scale. Things on a very small scale behave like nothing that you have any direct experience about. They do not behave like waves, they do not behave like particles, they do not behave like clouds, or billiard balls, or weights on springs, or like anything that you have ever seen."" pg. 116""Because atomic behavior is so unlike ordinary experience, it is very difficult to get used to and it appears peculiar and mysterious to everyone, both to the novice and to the experienced physicist. Even the experts do not understand it the way they would like to, and it is perfectly reasonable that they should not, because all of direct, human experience and of human intuition applies to large objects. We know how large objects will act, but things on a small scale just do not act that way. So we have to learn about them in a sort of abstract or imaginative fashion and not by connection with our direct experience."" pg. 117 ""We would like to emphasize a very important difference between classical and quantum mechanics....We can only predict the odds!.... We do not know how to predict what would happen in a given circumstance, and we believe now that it is impossible, that the only thing that can be predicted is the probability of different events."" pg. 135"
285,0465023924,http://goodreads.com/user/show/30489708-alcatraz-dey,4,"This book is a brilliant way to broaden your knowledge of the key concepts of physics. Adapted from the undergraduate lectures delivered by Richard Feynman during his professorship at Caltech, the narrative is very talkative and easy to digest.Feynman himself contributed well to physics, receiving (jointly) the Nobel Prize for Physics in 1965 for his work in quantum electrodynamics, developing pictorial representations of quantum interactions (now known as Feynman diagrams) and pioneering the field of quantum computing. He was a keen populariser of physics in his lifetime, and his legacy of books and lectures still remains.The six chapters included in this book, taken from Volumes I and III of the Feynman Lectures on Physics, are: Atoms in Motion, Basic Physics, The Relation of Physics to Other Sciences, Conservation of Energy, The Theory of Gravitation and Quantum Behaviour.Each chapter is full of coherent descriptions of the concepts at hand, using everyday analogies and clear diagrams to illustrate exactly how things work. Key experiments in the progression of modern physics are also included, their purpose and true significance explained. The simplicity and clarity in which the material in this book is delivered certainly sets it apart from others of similar genre – especially with its achievable thickness of merely 1cm.Receiving positive critical acclaim from major publications, Six Easy Pieces has become renowned as a work that serves two purposes – to explain important concepts to non-physicsts, and to give an insight into Feynman and his mannerisms. “With Feynman as a guide, you cant help wondering why everyone is not turning to science” – the Guardian.If you are considering studying physics at A-level or university, I would strongly recommend this book as it expands on what you already know and takes it a step further. Furthermore, hearing familiar concepts in a different style to normal is a very refreshing experience. If you have an interest in finding more out about the universe around you without much background knowledge, Six Easy Pieces is certainly a worthy and rewarding introduction to some important concepts."
286,0465023924,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1671310-hayley,4,"This book is an introduction to the most basic ideas of physics, and part of its sophistication is that it hints at how deep the...rabbit hole...is, without requiring readers to have enough expertise to really go down it.It was readable but challenging for me - someone with a bachelor's in biology and no great adeptitude for physics or math. My one complaint is that author Richard Feynmann could work a little harder to help lay readers understand how his verbal descriptions of physics translate into the equations he provides. Sometimes it was clear and other times I was left wondering about some squiggly mathematical symbol I don't remember, or why something has to be squared... One thing that comes across very well: Some physical properties of the universe - the subatomic particles/waves dealt with by quantum physics - seem to, by their very nature, do things we can't pin down and predict precisely, but rather, we can only understand them in terms of the ODDS of what will happen. And if people try to precisely document certain tiny activities - like finding the probabilities of where electrons will go - the observers change the pattern just by trying to document it. In a couple of ways, uncertainty seems to be part of the root of reality. After reading this, I feel like I have much more of an intuitive basis for reading more about physics. I also have more intuition, after reading this book, about where math-based theory and experimentation complement each other in physics. That said, ask me what I read, and I'll probably stumble."
287,0465023924,http://goodreads.com/user/show/15875470-molly-ison,5,"Possibly the most important part of this book is in the preface, when Feynman discusses the problems of physics pedagogy. These actually are easy pieces - if you have had high school level physics, the concepts should be immediately familiar. While Feynman presents them in a way that is fairly labeled brilliant, there are many physics teachers and professors who could give you an excellent understanding of the same material (and it's not too hard to find some online). The real issue here is the link between ability to solve problems and ability to understand concepts. When I took physics, I solved a lot of mathematical equations that involved different forces - a block moves up a hill and there's gravity, friction, the slope of the hill, the mass of the block, etc... One can be very good at recognizing the right formulas and plugging in the right numbers and still have no real idea about what's happening on a conceptual level. On the other hand, when Feynman actually delivered these lectures to a hall full of freshmen, despite having recitation sections, they did not do outstandingly well in being able to solve examination problems, and Feynman admits so himself. However, graduate students and other faculty members sat in on these lectures and valued them highly. So I would say that this is probably a book not for those who have never had exposure to physics, but for those who have a problem solving level understanding (or did at some point) and want to solidify for themselves what those problems are actually about. "
288,0465023924,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1436673-tom,4,"I've had this book on the shelf for some time, meaning to read it to refresh my memory of physics classes taken long ago. It was a quick enjoyable read that explained things I've already learned in a new and refreshing way, (even though these lectures were given almost fifty years ago.) I was especially impressed with the first two chapters. With some minor modifications, these two lectures could be used to explain atomic theory to elementary students. This is quite an accomplishment considering that the targeted audience is Cal Tech undergraduates! Feynman often said something like (and I'm paraphrasing here) ""It all goes back to the Double Slit experiment.) I truly believe that a person who becomes aware of this experiment and what it ""means"" can never really look at the world the same way again. As well versed as Feynman was with the intricacies of the paradoxes that permeate the Double Slit, I was sort of disappointed with his explanation of it. I think the chapter on it in ""The Dancing Wu Li Masters"" explains it better and does a better job of conveying the awesome mystery of it. Of course, Gary Zhukov had the advantage of writing his book after Alain Aspect had run his experiment (1964) related to Bell's Theorem, confirming that the Universe we inhabit is truly, deeply, weirdly mysterious. Still, I didn't think Feynman conveyed that very well in this book, but really that wasn't his purpose here, so I'm giving it four stars."

This book contains six chapters from Feynman's Lectures on Physics, which were transcribed from actual lectures he gave at Caltech during 1961-1964. It made me feel dumb. Well, not entirely, I did okay with the chemistry, biology, and astronomy aspects of it, as I have background in those areas, and I was all right with the quantum mechanics stuff because that requires more imagination than math, but I've never taken a physics course, so all the nonsense with pulleys totally shot over my head. All the weights and wedges and three 1 lb balls being lifted three feet by one 1 lb ball -- that I would have to see in order to understand, fig 4.2 just didn't cut it for me, but even when I had no clue what he was talking about, Feynman was a steady, calming voice, rational and grounded. He wasn't afraid to admit science might be wrong about something, or that there are still mysteries science can't answer. He was hailed a great scientist, but he was a great teacher as well, someone who loved his field of study, and even these lectures, trapped between the pages of a book, make that clear.Two stars for Feynman's laid back approach to some complicated concepts, but, like shooting one particle through a gap in a wall, it was hit and miss."

He also claims that he had no opportunity during the lecture series to gain feedback from students--that this came only at the end of the course.

Feynman is an astoundingly good teacher, with a real facility for metaphors and analogies that make the subject matter easy to grasp."

I'm not sure if that's because the book is a series of freshman physics lectures Feynman gave (and I've taken a year of college physics) and because it seemed too simple; or because he seemed to bounce around between really simple concepts (what is an atom? what is light?) and really difficult ones, including formulas and calculations I'd never seen and didn't understand. I wouldn't recommened it to someone new to physics or someone well-acquainted; it would be too difficult for the former and too simple for the latter. "

He had a lively mind and spirit that helped him connect to the kids. Hell, he was a kid, just with an oversized brain. He believed that if physics was so great, so cool, so awesome that it should be understandable by the many not the few. Therefore, he tried to teach it in pictures or models rather than math. He failed but, he was one cool, smart dude for thinking this way. Want to see this question explored more? Read my book, Black Body Radiation and the Ultraviolet Catastrophe.

Richard Feynman inspired people around the world with his scientific brilliance, endless curiosity about the world and unorthodox outlook on life. Here he guides the reader through the very basics of physics, including atoms, energy, force, the relation of physics to other sciences, the theory of gravitation and quantum behaviour. Presenting complex ideas in simplified, understandable terms and using illustrations such as shooting bullets, waves on a seashore and even Dennis the Menace's building blocks, Six Easy Pieces gets to the heart of how the world works."

Could even be zero. I'm uncertain about how I feel, truly). Six ""Easy"" Pieces is definitely not as easy as you would expect. The first 3 chapters were outstandingly brilliant and easy to catch. The following two were outstandingly brilliant too, but a bit harder. And then came the quantum mechanics chapter. Which left my head's angular momentum uncertain. :3My recommendation: 10/10 for physics people, 6/10 for laymen."

Many college professors should read Feynman, as they may learn about the performance of teaching. Just because you are intelligent doesn't mean you have to make difficult concepts overly complicated. That is the true genius of Feynman. He was able to take incredibly difficult concepts and explain them in a way that was fun, informative and entertaining. The mark of a true genius and a unique and rare teacher."
