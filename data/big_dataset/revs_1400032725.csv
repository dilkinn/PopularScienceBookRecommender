The author is a master of making a complex subject easy to understand with analogies and simple diagrams. The book is structured as a series of letters to the author’s mother and the author intersperses personal details of her friends and love life. She is constantly shifting residences as she migrates between cities in California and England. (She's at Columbia now.) Her love life is: crazy math/physics chick meets totally unstable male musician. You don't want to live in the apartment next door to them. The book is written with feeling and humor. Fundamentally the work focuses on the state of the universe using an analogy of triangles. Is the universe stable, like a normal triangle drawn on a flat surface? Or is it expanding, symbolized by a bulging triangle drawn on a sphere? Or is it a collapsing universe, symbolized by a triangle drawn on a saddle where the sides of the triangle bow inwards? The geometry also relates to whether or not the universe is finite or infinite. Levin believes it is finite but that view may be an unprovable proposition because it may be finite but too big for us to ever see the end of it. You are here (somewhere): You get the strong sense that people with this kind of mathematical genius are fragile and a bit uncomfortable with their feet touching the world the rest of us live in.photo of the author from hudsonvalleyone.com "
1,1400032725,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4213258-bradley,5,"I thought this little primer on physics was perfectly delightful. I've never seen anyone explain physics in quite this way before, but it was absolutely charming. The biggest points (for me) were on the topology of the universe. Geometry trumps General Relativity. For, as we know, neither General Relativity or Quantum Physics can describe the actual shape of the universe. No predictive power at all.But then, even Einstein said there would have to be yet another comprehensive paradigm shift. I personally like to think that all science will always have to do successive paradigm shifts as if it, too, followed the Marxian axiom. It means there will never be an end to learning, and THAT is something gorgeous to behold. :)ANYWAY, back to this book. Levin's prose takes the highly unusual tack of posing as letters to her mom, being awesomely personal and revealing while also illustrating just how much she loves the science she does. The mix, far from being awkward, turns the whole struggle and acquisition of knowledge into an end that we can all admire greatly. It also makes it REAL in a way I rarely see in these kinds of non-fiction books. Or perhaps it's not all that rare, because I do get a very awesome sense of the people for whom the science is everything, but in her case, I just feel love, sympathy, and shared joy.This is not your standard boilerplate introductory pop-sci text. Rather, it is a personal and gorgeous love-note to the ideas that shine so bright, always asking more questions, demanding more sacrifices, and, in the end, revealing even more of the universe.Totes respect."
2,1400032725,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6638317-jill,5,"In short: Janna Levin explains scientific theory so well that she may have just changed my freakin life. I'm kidding. Kind of. But we'll get there.First Dimension: this is an exceptionally lucid piece of writing. Levin, a cosmologist who here argues for a finite universe, traces the lineage of her theory with remarkable logic & clarity -- remarkable, because for the first time, I sort of understand general relativity. No really guys; this is big. I love reading pop-science, but there are moments when my brain glazes over. I'll tell myself I get the gist and just move on to the next idea. Not so here: anything Levin explained, I actually got. Sometimes it took a couple chapters, but I ended the book with a clear concept of all topics & theories discussed. What the hell.Second Dimension: this is a beautiful piece of writing. Unsurprisingly: A Madman Dreams of Turing Machines, Levin's 'novel' written a few years after this was published, is stunning (and one of my all-time favourite books). Both pieces show emotive intensity in the turns of phrase and juxtapositions; both are rife with an awareness of the aesthetic. Clear, and also sparkling.Third Dimension: this is a literary piece of writing. Near the end of Spots, Levin suggests that art and science are linguistic expressions of the same human essence. Hard to argue that. This is structured as a series of diary entries/letters, covering both personal and theoretical ground. Each entry starts with a short anecdote (sometimes shifted in time for the sake of logical flow) that relates to the concept being discussed. Though this could easily get kinda tired, it doesn't: it lends the less scientifically-minded reader a foothold, and humanizes the entire thing. And that, of course, is key: these big theories only matter if we care, and you can't help but care about Levin's shaky, uncertain journey through distance, relationships, and cosmology. The rest follows. And the last page is one of the best I've read, fiction or otherwise: a literary ending if ever there was one, but so perfectly aligned with the theory of time she'd just wrapped up. Life is an expression of something we can't yet fathom.Fourth Dimension: this is writing that shows process. In that art/science chapter, Levin mentions Turing, then Godel, and connects them in a brief sentence. Knowing what's to come (i.e. Madman, which fictionalized-ly explores the lives of both), HOW TOTALLY FRICKIN COOL. Was that the genesis of the whole thing? Had she already started Book #2 and just dropped a hindsight easter egg? Just a coincidence? Regardless, process and method infuse this book -- logic and progression in theory, from Newton to Einstein to Lee Smolin; coming to terms and conclusions, for Levin. It's obvious, but organic, and it draws attention not only to how we structure our theories, but our thoughts.Fifth Dimension: this is writing that inspires process.There's a thought experiment about fingers and dimensions, here, that I've forced on everyone in the past two days. General gist: if you live & perceive only in two dimensions and were to be shown three-dimensional fingers, you would not have the capacity to see that they are connected at the root (up and down would be as alien to you as a fourth dimension is to us). That does not, however, change that these fingers are connected to something much, much larger: individual expressions of a mammoth being.Without getting into too much detail -- as I copied out a passage from this book, several moments from my past clicked into place. Reading Gravity's Rainbow and the consequent spur towards literary academia. A persistent adolescent obsession with theoretical physics & string theory. Jungian archetypes and my childhood love of mythology & the Golden Thread. Finding my first Steve Erickson, which was actually my second, because perception varies and the observer defines the moment. And all of it coalescing.I don't know enough about quantum mechanics; physics; string theory --- yet. But I know there is something vibrating, deeply and without pause, and the connections are everywhere.Janna Levin, girl, you're pulsing with thousands of them. Anyone who needs some possibility radiated your way: head hers."
3,1400032725,http://goodreads.com/user/show/736354-jesika,5,"My family has a joke that there are three kinds of math: Math, hard math and math that will make you cry. I for one crashed and burned spectacularly on the easy end of hard math. But this doesn’t mean that I don’t want to know about math that will make you cry. Janna Levin is great at taking complex/mind bending mathematics and explain the theory and idea behind it without actually using math. She explains it with passion and intelligence and acknowledgement of her own limitations and the limitations of the field as it stands today (or 2001 when the diary ends). I can’t wait for whatever non-math-that-will-make-you-cry works comes next because I know I can’t read any of her technical papers. "
4,1400032725,http://goodreads.com/user/show/156533-rob,4,"You might have come across Janna Levin's How the Universe Got Its Spots the same way that I did—by seeing it show up in io9's ""20 Science Books Every Scifi Fan (and Writer) Should Read"", or some such similar list of ""must read"" science books. Of Levin's book, io9's Annalee Newitz writes:Levin is a physicist who studies the origins of the universe, and is also a writer whose language is both clear and poetic. Something about cosmology invites poetic meditations, and Levin manages to combine somewhat melancholy explorations of her own place in the universe with complicated physics formulas to create one of the most interesting books you'll ever read.Which is a pretty good characterization for ≈60 words. What's left out of that 60-word characterization is that Levin (like Smolin—who happens to be a good friend of Levin's [1]) waxes elegiac over the scientist's role in the life of science, and science's role in the life of the scientist. [2] Not that How the Universe Got Its Spots is some 200-plus-page dirge of miserable introspection into a scientist's regret—far from it, Levin is engaged and enthusiastic about the science just as often as she is stymied and despondent. What Levin gives us is a highly readable book—half of it personal musings on her at-times-troubled life as a scientist and the other half a layman's-terms explanation of modern cosmological research—a treatise cast as a diary of letters to her mother, and ultimately a book about topology's role in in cosmology, asking one of the most difficult questions facing physics: Is the universe really infinite? or just really big? (And if it isn't infinite: what shape is it?)
AN ASIDE ABOUT OUR COLLECTIVE (OR MAYBE JUST MY PERSONAL) FIXATION ON PHYSICS
It is probably worth noting that no other science is really emblematic of The Whole Big Shebang of Science quite like physics. Maybe we can blame Einstein for that—good ol' Albert Einstein. The Einstein that gets mentioned in every modern book about physics, all of them paying homage to his pivotal role in the discipline. The Einstein whose crazy-haired mustached visage shows up as the icon of science throughout 20th century popular culture. The Einstein that seems infinitely quotable from his writings and instantly relatable from every anecdote ever told about him. The Einstein who was maybe right about almost everything, or almost right about maybe everything, and/but definitely wrong about a few things because of... not quite hubris, but a kind of stubborn younger brother to it. (Making him all the more relatable: see? he's just as fallible as us!)Or maybe we get stuck on physics when we get stuck on science because it's... a (the?) science of everything? Physics: the science that attempts to describe and explain the very very smallest things and thus must be in all other sciences. Physics: the science that attempts to describe and explain the very very largest things and thus must encompass all other sciences. Physics: indistinguishable from math to so many layman, but also equally indistinguishable (to those same layman) from chemistry, thus deriving biology, psychology, engineering.... Physics: the seed for our science fiction fantasies of time travel, of trans-light speeds, wormhole portals, self-organizing and self-aware nanomachines, etc.Yes, indeed: that physics.
END OF ASIDE: A LITTLE MORE ABOUT LEVIN'S BOOK
One thing that separates Levin's book from so many other physics books that I've read is its focus. Feynman, Greene, Hawking, and Smolin—they all give us great books [3] but they're tackling so much—arguably too much. Physics without some dangling sub-discipline of a qualifier is a big subject—perhaps the biggest and broadest subject. The best you could hope for (in most cases) is a halfway decent survey that glosses over the basics of the fundamentals. If you're really ambitious, you could spin this off into a discussion of your chosen specific area; but if you're trying to keep the appeal of your book pretty broad (read: ""accessible to lay-folk"") then you're almost certainly doomed to recounting a bunch of personal anecdotes that shed little (if any) useful light on the subject matter.How do you get around that?Do what Janna Levin did: don't try to cover all of physics, just focus on your area. Even if your area is niche. Especially if your area is niche.Levin still gives us what I've come to think of as ""The Obligatory Digest of Modern Fundamental Physics that You Should Have Learned in College (or Your Fancy High School)""; but she glosses over some stuff covered in other Physics--but-Accessible-for-Laymen books—and this is more than ""just fine"", because every principle of physics that she describes is laser-focused on getting to her point(s) about infinities and about topology and how those fit in with cosmology and (more specifically) how they fit in with her specific questions about cosmology—all of that ""is the universe finite?"" and ""what exactly is the shape of the universe?"" stuff. It is all very endearing because she knows better than to bore her readers with every detail of modern physics—those books are all already out there—and instead she focuses on painting a vivid and fascinating picture of the known universe and asks one of those difficult and/but so-obvious-and-yet-so-arcane questions about that known universe. You cannot help but get swept up in her prose [4]—there is science, but there is also a story.And there's where that star slips off the rating—dropping from a full five to four. Levin is such a great writer, and her own story is so important to the telling of her cosmological tale, and she is so articulate about the science... but I could have used another fifty pages about that same science. I was left with some unanswered questions (e.g., ""Tell me more about your theories on the size/shape of the universe..."") and with that feeling that I was biting my tongue, waiting for the other shoe to drop on string theory (which gets a little lampooned over the whole ""no one knows what the 'M' in 'M-theory' means"" thing, but then also gets an oblique bye on a technicality related to the attractiveness/convenience of having so many dimensions [5]).Nutshell version? Levin brought us a beautiful book about modern cosmology, and about the life of a young scientist; and I recommend it to everyone with even a passing interest in science, and especially as a companion piece to Lee Smolin's 
The Trouble with Physics
.----[1] : Levin's and Smolin's book should be distributed as a box-set. The themes are so close and inform each other so well that you're really missing out if you don't put the messages of both books together.[2] : And the scientist's loved ones.[3] : I'm being generous to Greene though; really only the first third (first half?) of The Elegant Universe is great; the rest is basically navel-gazing. (And Hawking's book borders on that a few times but is also mercifully much shorter than Greene's.)[4] : And that's what it is, too: prose. Maybe she has some secret advantage over other physics writers. Feynman was humorous; Greene is lucid; Hawking is accessible; Smolin is cogent; but only Levin is expressive enough to really have a physics book that also qualifies as having ""prose"".[5] : I'll spare readers of this review yet another of my rantings/ravings about string theory. I'll just recommend Smolin's The Trouble with Physics again. (And sure: go for Greene's The Elegant Universe to get the whole picture; but it is getting harder to convince me that string theorists have their collective shit together enough to deserve continued funding.)"
5,1400032725,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2250921-michael,4,"If the title sounds clever and you're not sure why, it's a play on Rudyard Kipling's tale of ""How the Leopard Got Its Spots."" The answer to that question is mentioned in passing in this book: there is differentiation in the concentration of chemicals bathing the leopard's skin in utero. The universe also has spots, which is to say that there is some lumpiness (although not nearly so much as you would think from your day-to-day experience) in the cosmic stuff still spewing ""away"" (kind of) from the big bang. The question of where the spots came from turns out to be a little trickier for the universe than it is for the leopard. Let's just say that small quantum uncertainties within the first bizarrely small fraction of a second of the universe's existence could have galactic-scale implications a few trillion years down the road, and hope that we sound pretty smart and that there are no follow-up questions.Any follow-up questions? No? Good.The title is actually so clever that it got used even though it doesn't really match the book. Levin isn't especially interested in how the universe got its spots. What she's interested in is how observing the patterns in those spots might allow us, if we were stupendously lucky, to determine the shape of the universe and figure out whether it is finite or infinite, and if the latter how infinite. (Yeah, I know, ""how infinite"" seems a little dodgy. She explains it.) And even if we weren't that lucky, checking out the pattern of spots, particularly in the background microwave radiation that suffuses the cosmos, might at least allow us to weed out some theories and refine others about how this universe we live in works.By ""us,"" I of course mean brainy physics types.By ""background microwave radiation,"" I mean a concept in cosmology that Levin explains over the course of her book. She also explains such scary concepts as relativity -- special and general! -- dimensionality, topology, string theory, and chaos theory. There are probably plenty of books that try to explain these things, but I doubt any of them are as chatty as this one. Levin's book, couched as a series of letters to her mother, mixes and matches the concepts that underlie her work with personal stories about the decline and fall of a relationship, what it's like to commute back and forth between California and England, how she furnishes her new apartment, and the like. It is kind of weird, but if the point was to try to humanize theoretical physics and imply that it can be comprehended by ordinary folks with ordinary problems, it is actually kind of successful. The bits where Levin anguishes over whether she should get a new apartment or not have the added advantage of requiring very little effort, which lets you build up a good reading head of steam and get some momentum going for when she gets back to the point and ponders the implications of whether the universe is flat, positively curved, or negatively curved. Like I say, it's kind of weird, but it's also quite readable.I know just enough about cosmology to know that this book is a bit out of date, but not enough to be able to put my finger on exactly how. But Levin knew when writing it in 2000 that it would have a fairly short shelf-life, and refers several times to the exciting new information that will be flooding in over the next couple of years from new satellite missions. Those new satellites are satellites of the past now, of course, and the flood of data that they provided has been fuel to the brisk growth in our astronomical knowledge in the last decade or so. Did you not know that astronomy was booming? It is! Concept for concept, it has probably been the most productive field of human inquiry over the last fifteen years or so.Prognosis: How the Universe Got Its Spots is a pretty good book! I think everybody should make a good-faith effort to get their head around the basics of relativity and quantum physics, too. It's not like this stuff is particularly new and revolutionary, and it can't hurt to understand how the world works at a very basic level. Plus, it's interesting.But the question at hand is, is Spots the right book for the job? Answer: it's not a bad pick, if you've got a copy available. If not, there are probably others, maybe newer ones, that could also do the trick. If you know of any really good ones, leave a pointer in the comments. The IAT readership craves ever to better understand the physical universe!"
6,1400032725,http://goodreads.com/user/show/41911492-isabelle-leo,4,"This was great! Specialized but illuminating, she explains just what she needs to in order to make her specialty clear. The personal&professional details give an interesting and heartfelt picture of an academic life."
7,1400032725,http://goodreads.com/user/show/22428213-ian-scuffling,5,"This is probably one of the most unique pop-sci books I've ever read—Janna Levin, a cosmologist who theorizes on the topology and geometry of the universe, and who advances the idea that the universe is finite, writes of the science behind relativity (general and special), black holes, string theory, and much more in the format of letters to her mother. The content of these letters vacillate seamlessly between ruminations on her personal life and the histories and backbones of cosmological science in a ruminative and poetic fashion.Levin's skill is especially pronounced in her ability to distill her own severe intellect and clear obsession with these subjects into prose that is clever, literary, profound and also instills the same excitement and energy she has into the layperson reading.While I've had a lot of exposure to these ideas and concepts in other books and in classes I took in college, never has it been so digestible to me as it has been coming from Levin. Especially helpful to my understanding was her section on the shape of the universe and discussing how we can use the metaphor of two dimensions to understand the hypothetical shapes of a finite universe.Can't wait to read her other books—and I can't recommend enough her two hour PBS NOVA special from early 2018 on Black Holes called ""Black Hole Apocalypse."""
8,1400032725,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7915393-simon-mcleish,3,"Originally published on my blog here in October 2002.It is not, generally speaking, usual for modern science books to be concerned with the private lives of their authors, even though it is inevitable that the scientific work that they have done will have been influenced by this. This is a result of the idea that scientific ideas should be valid without any cultural context, but the anecdotes which litter popular science books demonstrate how important some subjectivity is for interesting the reader - few people read textbooks for pleasure. An excellent example is Pais' 'Subtle is the Lord...', which is a biography of Einstein which places equal emphasis on his life story and an explanation of his ideas.How the Universe Got Its Spots is based on a series of letters written by cosmologist Janna Levin to her mother, which seek to explain her work. I don't know how much Levin's mother already knew, but the letters don't presuppose significant amounts of scientific and mathematical education; which makes even writing the letters in the first place quite a brave thing to do; a parent is a far more difficult audience than some unknown reader. The letters also contain details of her personal life over a two year period, a diary of the gradual breakdown of Levin's relationship with musician Warren.Levin's work is in the topology of cosmology, trying to come up with possible descriptions of the large scale shape and structure of the universe. This may be discernible as patterns in such measurements as the COBE map of variations in the cosmic background radiation. The ideas which are introduced to explain this include a fair amount of topology, which is one of the more entertaining branches of mathematics. The explanations of the ideas behind Levin's work are clear and simple (though as someone who has studied topology I might well not be a good judge).It is for the combination of the science and the personal history that readers will pick up How the Universe Got Its Spots, however. The way that the two are put together makes the book reminiscent of a novel which was a bestseller a few years ago, Sophie's World by Jostein Gaardner. That book, though intended to introduce children to philosophy, was enjoyed by large numbers of adults; and if you liked it, you are pretty certain to like this."
9,1400032725,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4763049-holly,3,"(Review from 2011) I have missed reading cosmology! Levin does the obligatory catching-the-reader-up-to-speed that every book on theoretical physics must dutifully accomplish, but she doesn't approach her review in the usual linear way, which was refreshing. So much information here, both history of science and new-ish as of 2000-2002 (dark matter or dark energy not discussed). Maybe Levin is not the most elegant writer of science for non-scientists, but she's not bad, and what she reveals about the itinerant lifestyle of an astrophysicist is really interesting [e.g. pgs 128-30].Although most of the concepts (other than topology) weren't brand-new to me, I found the reading kind of slow going: I read fitfully, not fluidly/fluently. Here's a typical sentence: Just after the Planck time, as it is known, quantum gravity has yielded power to an era that is fairly well explained as a cosmology bound by the dictates of general relativity with some quantum fields living in it. Now none of those terms are terribly difficult if their definitions are understood, but I still stopped to think ""Huh?"" before reading it a second time.I'll assume heavy re-writes to turn this from a purported journal intended for the author's mother to a quirky-but-publishable survey of topology and cosmology. I didn't mind the personal journal-writing bits, though they could have been integrated better (halfway through they seem to begin flowing better; or maybe I just got used to them). "
10,1400032725,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2531665-charlene,3,"When I started this book, I really loved how it was a mashup of the author's personal life and the science she was studying. After a while, I felt almost carsick. Strange reaction, I know. I don't know how else to describe it. I wanted to learn about the science, so badly, and I also wanted to know about her personal life. Somehow, I kept getting a headache when the two were meshed. I am not sure why this happened. After all, I have loved biographies of various scientists-- e.g. Curie, Einstein, Darwin, Newton, Taussig, etc-- where their personal lives are intertwined with their scientific discoveries. But, reading this book, I needed the personal biography to be separate from the science. I would not want my 3 star rating to discourage others from reading this book. The author explains science really well and she has a really interesting life. She does some delicious namedropping -- Ferreira, Smolin, Randall, etc-- which made the biography bits really interesting. I found myself wanting to know even more about what these scientists think about and talk about when no one else is listening but their small group of friends. So many wonderful things in this book, and her writing style is witty and unusual. I am certain other people would not have the same averse reaction to it as I did. "
11,1400032725,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1339246-gendou,2,"This is a very strange book!It's like someone cut pages from a physics text on topology, and glued them into a 13 year old girl's diary.The stuff about topology is interesting, if a bit speculative.Still, the one obvious issue the author avoids is that space is very clearly observed to be negatively curved.It's fun and games to imagine a flat spacetime, but such a thing doesn't exist. Evidence refutes it.This is really an endeavor in mathematical curiosity, not physics.The author seems obsessed with the idea of finite spacetime, and her bias is intellectually off-putting.The ""emo"" love story slice of life narrative is emotionally off-putting.I wanted so much to like this book. She gets one extra star for name dropping Smolin, Silk, and Randall."

14,1400032725,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4186808-d,4,"How the Universe Got Its Spots is either the most unusual science book I've ever read, or the most science-oriented memoir. I found both aspects delightful. Levin, a no-nonsense, for-real, theoretical cosmologist grapples with, among other things, the shape of the universe, her acknowledgedly irrational preference for it to be finite, and a relationship with a bluegrass musician and instrument maker. There's some remarkably lucid writing about some seriously head-scratching topics like joining the boundaries of three-dimensional spaces (the book's genesis was in a series of letters to Levin's mother explaining her work in lay-person-friendly terms). Levin's get-up-to-speed chapters on physics (from Newton, through Einstein, and into the quantum realm) cover ground that may be familiar to most readers with an interest in the topic, but with a unique and refreshing perspective. Carefully selected biographical details offer insights into the personalities of the figures whose work she describes. She evinces a perhaps slightly morbid interest in the frequency of depression and insanity among mathematicians. (A few moments obliquely imply that this interest may not be completely academic.)How the Universe Got Its Spots was one of those books filled with paragraphs that begged to be read aloud to my tolerant wife. I'll limit myself here to just one of my favorite passages:During our month of wandering around the United Kingdom we intended to have fun and failed. Finding our flat was an ordeal and I won't bore you with our tales of misadventure. I can't help but remember the bedsit we found in Brighton as an act of desperation to end our wanderings. Electricity in the bedsit was coin operated. You ran out of coins, you ran out of light. I had always heard of such things in the old world,but in all my travels this was my first coin-op bedsit. I was feeling robust enough to be amused. Warren, on the other hand, sat on the edge of the bed catatonic, staring at the wood chip wallpaper."
15,1400032725,http://goodreads.com/user/show/26188-jafar,2,"This book is in the form of a series of unsent letters by the author to her mother about the shape of the universe. I don’t know why Levin thought this would be a good format for a pop-science book. Every chapter starts with a paragraph or two about her personal life, and then she abruptly goes back to relativity and quantum and topology. It’s all confusing. She shares details about her life that make you think: why are you telling us this stuff in this book? Like: she mentions in passing that she, the eminent theoretical physicist, is married to a high school dropout who follows her from location to location and grant to grant. And then not much more on the subject. Make up your mind, woman. Are you writing your diary or a book on (speculative) physics? Is she trying to tell us that theoretical physicists are human and have ordinary concerns too?This the second book that I’ve read that is specifically about the shape of the universe. The other one (The Poincare Conjecture: In Search of the Shape of the Universe) was a better one in the treatment of the subject. The subject never fails to fascinate me. I’m still trying to visualize what it means for the universe to be finite but bounded – that you can get into a spaceship, travel straight ahead, never stopping and never turning, and eventually you’ll be back where you started! Amazing, isn’t it? It’s like going around on the surface of a globe and coming back to where you started. But here we’re talking about the three-dimensional space. You have to be able to visualize and accept that space is bended in some imaginary fourth dimension. The earth is behind you when your rocket shoots off, you go ahead in straight line, and after many billions of years you’ll see the earth appearing in front of you!"

21,1400032725,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4842743-readingmama,5,"A gifted young cosmologist and contemporary scientist writes an intimate look at the universe in a personal and poetic way! ""We are the product of this universe and I think it can be argued that the entire cosmic code is imprinted in us. Just as our genes carry the memory of our biological ancestors, our logic carries our cosmological ancestry. We are not just imposing anthropocentric notions on a cosmos independent of us. We are progeny of their ability to understand it is an inheritance.” Not that I understood all what she was saying but her theory of the Universe may be finite was deeply moving and persuasive. Einstein’s simplest insights were profound. The simpler the insight, the more profound the conclusion.. Not that she was simple but still here is how she explains in this book. Why do we long for permanence in a universe defined by constant changes? Infinity is a demented concept because it is not a proper number. No matter how big a number, there is always +1, making it bigger. The number of numbers is infinite; however I could never recite the infinite numbers since I only have a finite lifetime! Galileo, Aristotle and Cantor all were besotted with the notion of infinity at some point; then abandoned its pursuit. We must not dismiss infinity just on the basis of the popular opinion alone. No infinity has ever been observed in nature. Nor is infinity tolerated in a scientific theory. Per Einstein, space is a mutable and evolving field. It has a beginning and the end; a star is born then dies. The universe is growing, expanding, and aging. The gravity, matte and energy are ultimately different expressions of the same thing. The fabric of the universe is just a coherent weave from the same threads that make our body. Then how absurd to believe that universe, space, and time could possibly be infinite when all of us are finite?"
22,1400032725,http://goodreads.com/user/show/88194215-lale,4,"The book titled How The Universe Got Its Spots is about a cosmologist named Janna Levin. She is trying the question is the universe infinite or is it just really big? She discusses topics that will help her solve the question and she discusses her own life is changing because of her job and the places that she has moved to. Some topics she talks about are Special Relativity, General Relativity, Topology, Quantum Chance, Quantum Choice, Flatlands and Hyperspace. Each concept is discussed in different chapter and some are explained with diagrams. At the end of the book there is a chapter called The Ultimate Prediction in which she explains how these different concepts will change the outcome of our universe and whether or not it is infinite.My favorite quote from the book is “No matter how big a number you think of, I can add 1 to it and make it that much bigger. The number of numbers is infinite. I could never recite the infinite numbers, since I only have a finite lifetime” (Levin 10)This is my favorite quote because it really makes you stop and think and wonder. I also, like it because it connects the main question is the universe infinite or is it just really big? And connects it to real life and for a minute you think I life in a forever expanding universe but i live a life that doesn't last forever.I would not recommend this book. The reason is that even though it's a really good and interesting book that makes you think I would not recommend this to my classmates because it has a lot of complicated language and scientific words that are not easy to understand. But if you are someone who likes challenging books then it's a good book for you just not for everyone in our age group."

This was the first time I had tried a pop-science book on audio, and was worried it would suffer without diagrams. However, the author is very good at explaining some fairly complicated things with words alone. I had the benefit of having recently been through some of the same material in Lawrence Krauss and Kip Thorn books, and that may have helped me follow along. But, this book does go into some new territory for me. I admit I had to look up Klien bottles. Going into this, I was expecting the focus to be mostly on the topology, but the author gives a pretty comprehensive tour of the history of physics. It was an interesting twist having the information woven in with personal stories and reflections. My only complaint is really with the audio. I never clicked with this narrator's style. The problem may be that I have listened to the real Janna Levin in presentations and interviews, and was aware of the difference in tone and delivery between the two."
24,1400032725,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10432110-becky,3,"I think I heard Janna Levin speak on The Moth or another radio show, and bought her book on a whim, this was at least seven years ago so I don’t really remember. Still, this title, How the Universe Got Its Spots, and the premise (a physicist explaining her musings on the nature of the Universe and discussing her own life in letters to her mother) has had me excited to dive in constantly since then. Unfortunately, after finally prioritizing it this book was overall quite a miss for me. I thought the balance of her life and the physics was unsatisfying, and I wanted more depth in recounting her relationships both to her partner and to her work. Also, it took a long time to get to science that I wasn’t already quite familiar with just from high school astronomy and physics, and I rarely enjoy reading about things I already know. This isn’t Levin’s fault of course, and I think the book would be more enjoyable on the whole to someone who was less familiar with the foundation she spends much time on. When she finally gets to her specific research it was really interesting and I am glad I made my way there even though it was a struggle. THEN she ends the book on a freaking CLIFFHANGER about her PERSONAL LIFE, which was pretty infuriating to me since I spent so much of the book aching for more of the personal life to be integrated into the story"

I particularly enjoyed the structure of the book, which is told through a chronological series of entries over the course of a couple of years. Levin is a talented writer, and I enjoyed the personal side of her diary as much as the scientific side. The observations about her friends, relationships, and living circumstances in the Bay Area and England helped lighten the reading, and served almost as a refresher before diving back into the implications of the theory of relativity, quantum physics, the shape of the universe, the big bang, black holes, string theory, etc. The final entry in the book was from January 2001, though, and I couldn't help but leave the book wondering how Levin's views have evolved since then."

Though not overly technical, this seemed more of a physics book for physicists rather than one completely enjoyable for the layperson unfamiliar at all with the topics of geometric space time. The various descriptions of shapes and how those describe the fabric of the universe was a bit arcane, and then on top the style was very jagged going from one topic to another, as if the author suffered from ADHD. Then there was a lot of personal detail, as apparently it was originally written as letters to a family member. The various boyfriend issues didn’t exactly liven up the book.

40,1400032725,http://goodreads.com/user/show/17995285-yohan,4,"Spoiler Alert! This is a review and summary. They're intertwined in my head. Janna levin is an astrophysicist in her 40’s (guessing by the photos). She studies topology as an effort to understand if the universe is finite. She is also a human. This book covers both of those things in equal measure. Early on in the book, Levin recounts the stories of several famous mathematicians Pythagoras, Cantor, Turing. Their stories were not new to me, but each of them committed suicide. That was a striking detail (not for turing, his repressed homosexuality was old news to me). She offered a few ""prima facie"" theories to explain why these brilliant minds wounded up so sad. ""Maybe its what they knew that made them depressed."", levin said. I'm paraphrasing. she also gives a less-philosophically meaty, albeit more reasonable theory, ""I think they were just lonely."" I liked that, it was juicy. I thought about that for hours. Another thing I learned is that Riemann himself invented non-euclidean geometry. Soo... analytical continuation, real analysis, and now non-euclidean geometry as well? Gee, you're great! Alot of her stories of her personal life is about Warren, her serious boyfriend. Her protrayal of him is slightly fantastical and non-representative. I know specific, small things about him and really not much else. I suppose we're only supposed to know how levin thinks of him and even that has likely been severely redacted. Levin doesn’t strike me as the kind of person who enjoys sharing such intimate details about her personal life. That much is evident by the way she talks about it. Still , a astrophysicist focusing on topology and a musician. The relationship can write itself with poetry. “Wow, what a love story”, someone told me when they asked what I was reading. I nodded strongly. Another part of her personal life is moving around all the time. she was at mit, then in columbia, then in berkeley for part of her post-doc work, and at the time she is writing this book she was in oxford. Honestly, its an impressive set of schools, and given what I know about the field, she must have been at the top of it. But she recounts all the moving as painful and tiring. She grumbles throughout the book about her social life and her love life. The constant moving sounds terrible, I would hate that. The rather low-pay would suck too.Levin goes through a super-condensed version to explain einstein's relativity. If you've read other popular-culture physics stuff (e.g brief history of time) . Specifically , I'm talking about newtonian physics (gravity is a force), relativity (gravity is not a force, but an effect of a curved space time) , the big bang, black holes, and Quantum Mechanics -- then there's nothing new here. Honestly its obligatory, nothing else she talks about will really make sense if you don't have some cursory knowledge of these ideas. Its also an awesome story that I never get bored of. [ a whole bunch of stuff on Topology ] I learned the difference between geometry and topology. geometry has to do with the curves and bends of the shape. topology deals with the overall connectedness of the shape. ""Can you get from one random part of the shape to another? "" is a topological question. As such, tears in the shape are what matters, but stretching it doesnt. She then proceeds to run through some characteristics of manifolds, like non-orientability ( a mobius is non-orientable). Levin’s work seems to revolve around a central point: If we understand where the light is coming from when its reaches an observer, we can use that to understand which of the idealized n-dimensional manifolds mostly closely resembles our universe. If we have the correct manifold, we have everything. We (maybe) can know if our universe is finite or not. the inherent problem with determining the topology of our universe is that we are inside it, so we don’t have an outside perspective on the whole thing to see what shape it makes. For thousands of years, we couldn't notice that the earth is spherical just by walking around it. It's locally flat. The other problem is that it is very very very very big. This is making determining the finite-ness of it very difficult. Levin herself admits this might be a fool's errand. She then says that if it is, she'd rather be a fool. and for me, consider me a fan of foolishness. [the first case of a bad narrator] yeah I'd never had an issue with this. but the narrator really decreased my enjoyment. a) she almost always had a voice that indicated defeat, tiredness, and sadness. I watched a video of levin, she sounds nothing like that. b) her tone of voice would change to a softer tone, without warning or sense. I think these corresponded to breaks in the recording, but they kept throwing me off. I remember hearing the softness and think, ""oh i guess variations in the cmb is sad"". I was hooked on both aspects of it, and it was easy and fun to read/hear. "
41,1400032725,http://goodreads.com/user/show/51397275-junhao,4,"Everyone is taught that the universe is infinite but Levin questions this assumption by posing the alternative: What if the universe is simply really, really big? Just like how people thought that the Earth was flat before it was discovered that its a globe, could it be that the universe is actually finite and that if we travel in a straight line far enough, we would end up where we started?Levin's argument isn't just a hypothetical premise built on nothing; in fact she does suggest a few possible ways of proving her point but they are just impossible to carry out based on current technology. Still, it is an interesting point for us to consider, with deep implications. What if, just what if, the farthest galaxy that we can currently observe with our most advanced telescopes is, in fact, the Milky Way galaxy as it was billions of years ago? @-@Levin's writing style is also unlike those from other beginner's introductions to astrophysics and cosmology as she weaves in aspects of her personal life into the writing and this is generally done well. I guess the substance of her book wouldn't be affected if she stuck to the usual way of writing but her method does make her book stand out from other similar texts.All in all, a recommended read if you are seeking an alternative perspective into the Universe."
42,1400032725,http://goodreads.com/user/show/12127805-jason,5,"I first picked up Janna Levin’s How the Universe Got Its Spots in 2003 at the NASA museum in Florida, coming home from taking our three-year-old son to see family and visiting Disney. It was an impulsive purchase. While I loved watching Carl Sagan’s Nova as a kid and enjoyed my physics classes in high school, I did not have any thoughts about astrophysics, cosmology, black holes, or space in general. In 2003, I was a literature and film geek, a budding videographer, and a stay-at-home dad.Levin’s book scratched an itch I didn’t even know I had, stretched a muscle I didn’t know had cramped up, and opened a door in my mind that had been entirely forgotten behind the clutter that had accumulated over the years.In the 15 years between 2003 and 2018, I had thought of this book often, the science, the story of Levin’s life in 1999 and 2000, and her beautiful prose. I had recommended it to many others, leant it to friends, and eventually loaned it to someone who never returned it. But still it lingered for me. I finally ordered another copy for myself for Christmas this last year and reread it in its entirety.The book is every bit as amazing as I remember it being.It’s structured as a series of letters-slash-diary-entries that Levin addresses to her mother. In them, she fills her mother in on the movement of her life as a young theoretical astrophysicist in academia and gives her a basic overview of the science and work that she is focused on. Her current work (in the book) seeks to determine the shape of our universe or discover the ways that its shape can be discerned. To get there, she walks through the work of the giants on whose shoulders she stands. In the end, the reader gets a quick but substantial summary of the foundational elements and theories of astrophysics. Levin does all of this concisely, clearly, and entertainingly.According to the blurbs on the book’s cover, Levin is a talented scientist. I have to take their word on that. What I can witness for myself is that she is a talented writer. How the Universe Got Its Spots is beautifully written. Whether she’s talking about her personal life or scientific theories, she is warm and insightful, elegant and evocative. There is wonder and excitement in her tone, and a genuine love for her subject, even against the backdrop of the sorrows and strains of her personal life. There were many passages I lingered over and reread for the sheer pleasure of her language and cleverness.The book covers concepts of infinity, theories of gravity, special relativity, general relativity, quantum theory, the big bang, black holes, dimensional theories, topology, and even touches upon string and chaos theories. As an introduction to these topics, this book could not be more ideal, and I would (and have) recommend it to everyone with even a passing interest or idle curiosity.One of the things that makes physics so fascinating is that nearly all their theories feel like metaphors for life, things like every action has an opposite and equal reaction. Levin takes full advantage of this feature by mixing biography and science, moving back and forth between her lived life and the subject of the moment. The two naturally fit together so that the story of these two years in her life coexist comfortably with the 400-year history of modern physics.One of my favorite aspects of the book, as a literary geek, is the way the truth and fiction hold hands like good friends and sometime lovers. Levin makes it clear at several points in the book that the diary entries and letters are being written in hindsight, even though they are written in the present tense. For example, at one point, she is at a conference in Moscow, which she placed in February of 2000. She includes a footnote observing that the conference was actually in October of 1999. She says in that footnote, “Honestly, I’ve gotten the date wrong.” Honestly, I’m lying. But of course it’s the truth too, which is how art works, right? Sometimes you have to tell a fiction to better capture the truth of the experience. This is of course at odds with the demands of science to be rigorously factual and honest. So Levin gets her lies and her honesty, her fiction and her truth to all elevate each other so that science and art become one. And she makes it look effortless the whole while."
43,1400032725,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1057939-liz,4,"If you're interested in scientifically-based philosophical ideas about space and time and, well, everything, and want to go into more depth than the shows you might see on the Science Channel or Discovery Channel, this is worth the read. It explains spacetime, discusses the finiteness (or infiniteness) of the universe, the big bang, light, matter, black holes, and things of that nature. Levin is very honest about everything; she lays it all on the table, tells you when she doesn't fully understand something, and that she is going to explain it as best she can, and you can do with it what you will (like string theory). This book is probably one step up from the ""layperson"" text. At times it was a little dense (the chapters on geometric spaces, for instance), and certain parts were hard to get through, as I felt I wasn't fully grasping what she was trying to describe - I wished she added one or two more lines here and there explaining what certain words or phrases were, a little more clearly. There were a few things she assumed the reader already knows, that she kind of glosses over. But then as I progressed in my reading, I realized that those dense, esoteric sections were a necessary foundation to read through in order to get to the ""juicy"" stuff, and that I understood enough about those things to be able to appreciate the discussion that followedInteresting things that I wished she spent more time on earlier in the book, were revisited later, and I found that I was able to come back to those concepts and properly wrap my mind around them, just from gleaning what I could from those esoteric, dense sections which I thought I wasn't understanding well enough. Like, she would touch upon concept A, and then go on to concepts B, C, and D, which all seemed peripheral to A and were confusing. Then she would come back to concept A, and there would be a moment of clarity when I realized that I needed a touch of B, C, and D (even if I didn't understand them fully) in order to revisit A and now consider it more deeply. The book is told in a narrative that weaves her own life in and out of her studies, and it is quite intimate in that you really get inside Levin's head, to understand what was going on in her life as she was discovering and mulling over these ideas. This all made her discussions very approachable.At times, I had to put the book down because it did freak me out a bit to think about the beginning and the end of the universe. But her personal narrative helped me to keep trudging forward, because if she can manage to live and relate to life knowing what she knows, then I can manage to read about it. Of course, the book only scratches the surface, but is a great starting point for wanting to know more about these theories without reading a completely science-heavy text."
44,1400032725,http://goodreads.com/user/show/25108717-sean-books-beers,3,"This is perhaps one of the more interesting approaches to a book on the universe that I've read and it brings a somewhat personal touch to it. I listened to the audiobook version of this book and some of the analogies are theories are downright fascinating. A coincidence then too that I also finished this book a day after the announcement that gravitational waves had been experimentally discovered and one of the topics in this very book.Overall I enjoyed the book however I'd say it wasn't as engaging as some of the books I've read by authors such as Brian Greene, Michio Kaku, and Stephen Hawking. Another downside of the audiobook version was that the female reader was not pleasing on the ears for me. The book was meant to come across as a mix between personal diary and science book but the reading felt a bit sad and sombre given the tone of the reader's voice. So overall that brought the book down for me.""Black holes can bang against space-time as mallets on a drum and have very characteristic song."" Janna LevinJanna Levin has another book coming out covering the story of LIGO and the gravitational wave project that I'm looking forward to reading. I give her credit because this is a topic that is difficult to convey in a way that is understandable to the reader and in pieces I was even lost. That's likely my limited ability to absorb the information combined with listening to it but overall there were a few things I learned which is important. Overall I'd land between a 2.5 and 3 star rating for this book and perhaps a bit more with a different reader. It's not an ideal entry book into the topic so start with the authors mentioned above before delving into this one although her theories on black holes, cosmic topology, and the pathway she took to finding this field is interesting to someone who might be starting down this pathway in their own scientific career."

Levin is an astrophysicist and author interested in sharing her interest in topics from quantum mechanics to a Theory of Everything.[return][return]In the book How the Universe Got Its Spots, Levin uses a diary/letter style to explain contemporary theoretical physics in a way that is accessible to a layperson like me. She weaves the science through stories from everyday life. Her engaging writing style and excellent examples makes complex topics such as Einstein's theories easier to understand. It's interesting to learn how much we know and how much we still don't know about our universe. Is the universe finite or infinite?

The other reviewer went on to say how much he enjoyed the book however I have to turn away from that path and say that this book was somewhat difficult for me to read.It was tough for me to keep straight her anecdotes and memories that seemed almost drug-induced. The whole time I read the book, I imagined it was narrated by a voice of a shrink trying to hypnotize me.In my status updates I kept referring to Simon Singh's Big Bang: The Origin of the Universe. I will again. How the Universe... is very much like the Big Bang: The Origin of the Universe but more enchanting. I enjoyed reading Singh's simplistic explanations of astrophysics and related science whereas I was frustrated with Levin's portrayal of her research (by the way, I still don't understand topology) superimposed with her troubles settling into a variety of locations.I honestly think I would have rated this book better if I had read it before reading Singh's. But that's not the case, and I have to give this one an ""it was okay"" rating....because it was just that."
47,1400032725,http://goodreads.com/user/show/55711-duc,3,"Tim asked me about the books I'm reading. I mentioned Jana Levin's 'How the Universe got its Spots.' I talked to Jaya about infinity. He was telling us about a Black hole program he saw on NOVA. I tell them about big Infinity and little infinity. Jaya said that down at the mini level, there is just air, void. This theory of negative number and smaller units supports that. Even before these scientific discoveries, the ancient Taoist, Christian, Hindus and others claim the void, emptiness. Particulariy the taoists. I told them that the universe is just a cosmic soup and it is through our sense that we create the world everyday. Jaya made a point to clarify what I was saying, meaning that the theory of negative number and infinite negative numbers. Pythagoras held on to the theory of whole natural numbers. He had a following and they all worship the whole numbers. The notion of negative number was threatening to them. Janna has an analogy about the world as flat and the world as I know it now and comparing our own ignorance to the universe. She thinks that every one is wrong about the universe that we see the universe as flat where as she claims the universe is actually round. 'Don't screw with the universe or it will screw with you."" I told them that Cantor and others went crazy. The universe holds it's secret and if one looks too hard for that secret, one will become insane. "
48,1400032725,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10398948-penny,3,"OK ,,,,, but: I thought it was going to be about cosmology in general. Instead it's almost entirely devoted to how TOPOLOGY helps in the search for:1) reasonable theories concerning the size and shape of the universe2) same for the question of Big Bang vs. alternative ways we might have arrived at where we are now3) ways to best interpret actual & experimental data4) ways to best ask the astronomy and astrophysics establishments for new earth-based, sattelite-based, and spacecraft-dedicated acquisition of new data.Most of the topology was accessible, but over my head. That did not prevent enjoyment of the book. No math was used or required. A random spot-check of small subjects treated in the book turn out to be treated the same way on Wikipedia. So the author is dealing with mainstream theorizing. Example: the universe is either flat, positively curved or negatively curved. Note: as of 2012, the consensus is, with a 5% error rate, that the universe is ""flat"" -- with the notion of ""flat"" as defined by topology.Almost eight years have passed since the publication date. Space vehicles have since gathered some of the data Ms. Janna Levin was hoping would be or could be acquired. So Items #3 and #4 above need to be updated via a revised edition.Strictly as a non-scientist, I'd rate the book 3 out of 5.##"
49,1400032725,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7188699-abhaga,2,"I can understand how the idea of weaving together your personal life and your work into a coherent narrative is seductive as an author. That is what Jenna Levin does in her forst book. Unfortunately, it doesn't work too well. Instead of creating pathos, the personal story feels whiny and ordinary and at times almost pervert in how it discusses the other person in relationship.But leaving aside the personal part, the book talks about some interesting ideas from Topology being applied to cosmology, to understand the shape and size of the universe we live in. The first half of the book builds up to the point where she can starts talking about these ideas. For someone reasonably acquainted with the history of physics and mathematics at the beginning of century, material in the first half is standard fare. After that the material gets into more uncharted territory (for me) and some mind bending ideas(pun intended) come up.What I felt overall that it is a confused book. Writing style of Levin has a very dreamy, wandering, personal feel to it which works better for people already familiar with the topic at hand. But for such a reader, first half of the book doesn't deliver much value. At the end of it, I am happy to have been exposed to many new ideas but felt a much thinner monologue or a longish article would have done just as well."
50,1400032725,http://goodreads.com/user/show/211995-finley,5,"This is officially one of my most favorite books ever. It's written my cosmologist-topologist Janna Levin, who apart from being a good scientist is also a good writer. In this book, she explains special relativity, general relativity, quantum mechanics and topology as it relates to her work and her life. It's written as a series of letters from 2000 and besides being a beautiful and poetic chronicle of exciting physics concepts, it also documents her life and the changes in it as she moves from California to England. She discusses her relationships with her friends and colleagues, and her lover Warren and the book is an eloquent mixture of fascinating science imagery and potent emotional experience. She brings up the histories of many of her favorite scientists and theories, all of which add interesting anecdotes and backdrop to the theories she discusses. Finally, and most importantly to those who know me--this book has got me interested in a form of math: topology. The applications that this area of math has to physics are both fascinating and ridiculously cool. I think the the thing I like most about this book is that it isn't a lecture, but a discourse between the author and her reader. It's really beautiful and everyone should read it."
51,1400032725,http://goodreads.com/user/show/780655-todd,5,"How the Universe Got Its Spots is a quirky and inventive earthly travelogue and journey across the cosmos. Levin introduces the reader with ease to her central thesis – the cosmos, although quite large, may not actually be infinite at all…just really big. How big is big? Therein lays this intriguing and unorthodox question asked by a truly gifted thinker.  Cosmologist Janna Levin started this work as a series of letters to her mother as she wrote about her workaday life as an upcoming scientist and explaining her inquiries into the origins of the Universe. In the end it became a diary of sorts that reminds the reader of an old time travelogue. Romance, jet lag and buying cereal and cleaning supplies at the local grocery seem as important as the issues of geometry, topological algebra and Einstein. This is a fantastic book on the science of the cosmos for everyone. Janna Levin is not only very brilliant, but a great storyteller who can explain the complex cerebral world she inhabits without talking down to the lay person as if they were dumb. If you are looking to increase your science literacy, but find yourself overwhelmed by some of the other popular titles in the field, How the Universe Got Its Spots is a great place to start. "
52,1400032725,http://goodreads.com/user/show/287113-ulf-kastner,4,"I decided to pick this up after having read and enjoyed Levin's second book, A Madman Dreams of Turing Machines. Ostensibly assembled from letters addressed to her mother, the author combines a tutorial of 20th century cosmology, an introduction into topology (the latter being her calling), and a year and a half worth of her personal circumstances, which include frequent relocations from one academic gig to another and glimpses of the various states of her relationship with her musician boyfriend.By the end of the book I learned a fair bit about finite topologies and feel quite compelled to reread Flatland.Most unexpected: the saddest ending to a non-fiction book I've ever come across awaits on the final page. Said epilogue acts like a single paragraph synopsis of what Levin brings to the table: an unlikely union of emotion and hard science. I'm looking forward to more in years to come."
53,1400032725,http://goodreads.com/user/show/918423-david,5,"A long time ago, when I was young, let's say around ten, I used to think about the universe. Why? Because that is all there is. Anyway, I thought any projectile leaving the earth's gravity would go off eternally into space. Not so, thinks Levin. The universe is finite.She argues her case starting with Eistein's ideas about gravity. Then speculates about possible shapes of the universe. I was able to follow her until she arrived at topology and dimensions. In the end, she affirms she can't know for sure and leaves it open for an infinite universe.Although, Levin is an atheist she makes a case for predestination. She thinks if we could live our lives over again, they would be the same. Unfortunately, she doesn't flush out her argument very well The book is a series of letters written to her mother explaining her thinking in layman terms. She also discusses her travels and her boyfriend, Warren, who seems to have acute mental and emotional problems. I think he could have been left out of the book."
54,1400032725,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2315520-kylie,4,Levin does a great job of approaching large theories and ideas in this book while making them understandable to someone with limited knowledge about physics (not that I can claim to understand all of the ones that were discussed). I think she chose a smart sequence of ideas while tying them into the history of the field.The only thing I didn't really care for was kind of how everything came back to her ex in the end. This is a guy who gets a few pages here and there but then his name ends up being the last word in the book. There wasn't enough about their relationship in the book to give him meaning to anyone other than the author so it took away from the bigger concepts that were being explored. I'm not sure why she decided to end the book that way and I'm a little bothered by it because I feel like no male writer would have (I do wonder what role publishers/editor may have had in this choice).
55,1400032725,http://goodreads.com/user/show/549698-nathan,3,"Epistolary pop science, this book's central conceit is that it's written as letters from an astrophysicist to her mother. It talks about the day-to-day life as a scientist, but is primarily exposition about the way the universe works (down to quantum mechanics and uncertainty, up to the lifetime of the universe) so that you'll understand her ideas about the topology of the universe.The science isn't crystal-clear, though I feel as though I understand a little bit more of quantum physics each time I read a popsci book like that. I haven't yet found The Perfect Explanation, and I'm not sure I'm going to be able to make it to the end of this book because (a) I hate skimming things assuming I don't need to learn them, and (b) if I keep struggling and not understanding, my brain will explode."
56,1400032725,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3105024-cynthia,3,"Janna Levin is a delightful story teller, and although I did not exactly follow all of the threads that she wove in the telling, it was fascinating to read the ideas and possibilities that her curiosity about the universe may some day reveal. I was previously stuck in the notion that our universe is infinite, but maybe it is curved and turns in on itself, or is super large that we are unable yet to see into infinity. What would knowing and understanding the shape of the universe reveal? This book was published in 2002. I wonder what we have learned in the past 13 years that may answer some of these questions! It is interesting that theoretical physicists and mathematicians are interested in the nature of free will and determinism. Makes me wish I had a few more IQ points, but joyful still that Janna shares her scientific and personal insights. "
57,1400032725,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1127986-fr-ted,3,"I'd be lying if I claimed to know what this book is about. I am tangentially interested in the origins and nature of the universe. But I don't understand the physics of it. I liked the questions she asks in the book and her sense of humor, but as the book gets deeper into theoretical physics, I am both lost and losing interest. Is the universe infinite or just really big? From my point of view if you start with a claim that you are looking at nature for your clues you have already accepted the universe if finite. Theism accepts the infinite. Levin is at times wrestling with such profound issues but one wonders, what difference does it make for her if their is nothing beyond a finite universe."
58,1400032725,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8404040-cliff-hays,5,"Do you believe that the universe is infinite? In this book Levin gives a compelling argument that may cause you to reexamine that belief. It begins with the question ""Is the Universe Infinite or Just Really Big?"" and launches into a fascinating topological exploration of very large-scale phenomena (particularly the cosmic microwave background). The style, cleverness, and clarity with which she writes is unmatched by most authors today. Reading this will not only cause you to laugh outloud but will also allow your mind to grasp some highly technical and theoretical concepts that when presented in most other texts are largly unintelligible. For anyone who is interested in the workings of the universe at large I highly recommend it. "
59,1400032725,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1305890-kim,3,"I'm a little over halfway done with this book, but am going to put it on hold until I have a vacation. It's not an entertaining read for me, but educational. I've learned some new concepts and gained a better understanding of some I had a little exposure to. There are times I'm pretty confused and have to clarify my understanding with my husband who reads this kind of stuff for fun. Levin does a good job breaking down complex concepts, but once she's introduced something, she expects you to remember it, so I have to look back a lot of remind myself of certain people or theories they introduced. I think this book is good for me, but not necessarily enjoyable. "
