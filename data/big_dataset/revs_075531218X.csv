One has to look at the potential quantity (not quality lol, they nearly killed themselves because of incompetence) of the Soviet biowarfare programhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bioprep...and extrapolate the potential to now and the future to understand the sheer dimension of it. Much of the research has the potential to cure all illnesses, as especially viruses are so mighty tools that they could be genetically engineered brainwashed and used to be good instead of evil, and pharmaceutical companies are at this end of the spectrum, doing the opposite of what secret biological warfare research is trying to achieve. I do think that it´s more possible that the military will find cures earlier, as the budget, especially in a country like China, is circumstantial and the results don´t have to be economic so that all approaches can be tried. As long as it kills better, of course, but a side effect and collateral benefit could be cures we aren´t able to imagine. Of course, it would fall under military secrecy, but there is not much difference to the commercial studies that are as secret as possible too due to industrial espionage. It also sounds better and is easier to explain that a company found a cure than to admit that a cure for cancer was accidentally found while trying to breed an influenza rabies hybrid. General: „Didn´t I tell you to develop killers, not cures? Bad scientist, bad, shame on you wasting our governments´ money for this!“ It´s the huge variety of possible options in producing biological agents that make them even scarier. The intuitively most logical form, an active virus that can be directly released, seems horrible, but is less dangerous as the alternatives that could be used as timebombs. Microbes are pretty tough and they can wait, sleep, get active again, and with biological engineering, in the mix this means that one could produce something that is completely harmless when it´s cold, dry, and dark, but activates when hot, wet, and bright. The possibilities to use this are endless, as it wouldn´t even have to be exactly coordinated, it would be enough to just wait for spring and summer, for the day to come and the sun to shine or for the weather to change and, let´s say, pluvial period to set in. Anthrax was just the beginning. If the agent is unknown and thereby undetectable or a mighty state spreads such agents with the help of foreign intelligence services, special forces and secret agents, there could be thousands and more clusters distributed in neuralgic points of the enemies´ infrastructure until the conditions are perfect and the trade war or real war can begin. It could, of course, be fully automated too, using living agents or by generating the right breeding conditions in small or tiny, miniaturized machines that activate at the same time, breed until trillions of active killers are waiting to be released and open the gates at the same time. Nobody knows how much of this is still fiction and how much real military mind and plan games and simulations, but I do believe in the human creativity to kill as many others as possible and would subjectively say that anything possible in this regard will be done.  How large such facilities might be is another question I keep asking myself, are it just normal labs with secrecy and soldiers around or is it going in the resident evil and horror direction with huge underground hives or prohibited areas where everyone breathing in the wrong direction or taking a picture from miles away gets shot. And, of course, human testing to see how it works and in what dimension it´s done, if it´s right next to the labs or if they take the risk to transport the new creations to the torture chambers of a black site. It could look like this:https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.ph... https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.ph...https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.ph... One just has to look at what has been revealed about disturbing human subject research and I didn´t even mention combining it with breeding Übersoldiers that are resistant to the biological warfare agent that kills everyone and are quicker, smarter, stronger, and much sexier than the average G.I. Joe. I am no biologist or physician and can´t say how useful it is to keep probes of smallpox and other monsters we might be able to exterminate except of probes, and if we would have the ethical obligation to destroy everything. On the one hand, there is the possibility of a terrorist attack or a lab accident (or a scientist going bonkers) killing million, on the other hand, it could be positively used in the future in medicine and life sciences in ways we can´t even imagine. As genetic engineering accelerates, the vicious elements could become angels of longer life and cures instead of death, as they are so mighty that annihilating this potential forever seems questionable. I guess biological warfare programs will definitively be continued in space, be it in habitats, space stations, or on planets with or without atmosphere, as those destinations are just too perfect for such endeavors to not create solarpox. Also a great first contact scenario if it´s as far away from the earth as possible and the first place aliens come to visit, in the style of:Alien: „Is this a secret and highly illegal bioweapon program to exterminate all or just certain parts of your own species with ethnic bioweapons? Are you all space nazis praising eugenics?“We: „No, no, this is a misunderstanding. We do important medical research here to cure…let´s see…damn.“Alien: „Well, keep trying exterminating yourselves, if you aren´t successful, we´ll visit again in a few hundred years if you are mature enough for the galactic community and all the technologies we wanted to bring to help with your evolution.“We: „No, let us explain..“Alien: „Are those probes of extraterrestrial microorganisms you are adding to the deadly mix back there?“We: „We didn´t know it were your probes that…“Alien: „Bye.“Some links dealing with the current pandemic: Animated world maphttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2019%E2...CNN live updateshttps://edition.cnn.com/asia/live-new...John Hopkins CSSE world maphttps://gisanddata.maps.arcgis.com/ap...Youtube statisticshttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qgylp...A wiki walk can be as refreshing to the mind as a walk through nature in this completely overrated real life outside books: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biosafe...https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biologi...https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biosafetyhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Categor...https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biologi...https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_...https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biologi...https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_p...https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History..."
1,075531218X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1526851-will-byrnes,5,"Some say the world will end in fire, some say in ice. I expect the end of the world, the people part of it in any case, is likeliest to be the result of loose pathogens. In Demon in the Freezer, published in 2002, Richard Preston, author of The Hot Zone and The Cobra Event takes a look at two of the top candidates for the job, smallpox and anthrax. Richard Preston - image from NY TimesIn October 2001, a photo-retoucher for the National Enquirer died as a result of a deliberate attack with anthrax. While the CDC was looking in to this, Senator Tom Dashle, among other mostly liberal figures, received mail tainted with the deadly material, and the investigation heated up. Was the USA under attack by Al-Qaeda again so soon after 9/11?Preston follows several of the people involved in the research, documenting such comforting events at the CDC as faulty gloves and a researcher puncturing her super safe blue space suit. More importantly he looks at the eradication of smallpox in nature and the subsequent attempt to eliminate, or at least sharply limit the availibillty of remaining samples of the disease. They were to have been divided between CDC facilities in Georgia and a comparable site in the Soviet Union. A treaty was signed by most of the world, Richard Nixon signing for the USA, banning the use of bio-weapons. Most of the signatories kept their word. Sadly, the Soviets not only held onto their stores, but shifted them around like a pea in a hucksterish street game when inspectors came a'calling. Thankfully a high level Soviet scientist defected and spilled the beans. Not that that prevented the Soviets from continuing their activities, but at least the rest of the world was put on to their game.The author looks at the details of both anthrax and smallpox through the eyes of the researchers as they attempt to determine the provenance of, in particular, the Daschle-targeted anthrax. He offers enough biological detail without wandering too far into techno-speak-land. He learns from those who know how deadly pathogens might be delivered to maximize death. Preston passes on government suspicions that Steven Hatfill, one of the virologists he interviewed for the book, might be the source of the Daschle anthrax. Another scientist, Bruce Edwards Ivins, believed to be angry over pro-choice stands taken by alleged targets, was later found to have been the guilty party by the FBI, but the case was regarded as inconclusive and no criminal charges were filed before Ivins killed himself. The mystery remains.Preston is a compelling story teller and his is a tale of potential horror. He makes it crystal clear that deadly diseases, kept in freezers around the world, can, at any time, be thawed out and weaponized. We do not know where all these stores are located, and we do not have a means for protecting people against superpox, specifically designed to get past immune systems and antibiotics. The only real surprise is that the big kill-off has not yet occurred. This is a short book with a very long shadow. You really need to read this.Links to Preston's personal, FB, and GR pagesBTW the personal site link shown on Preston's GR page is inaccurate"
2,075531218X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/20408288-will-m,5,"""We could eradicate smallpox from nature, but we could not uproot the virus from the human heart."" I will be honest and say that I am a bit genre ignorant. I only read genres that are of my interest, and ignore those that seem daunting and boring. Non-fiction is not my usual genre, but medical science is. I decided to give this novel a try out of the blue. I'm not new to medical science, in fact, I studied Microbiology for a whole semester, and Mycology and Virology for another semester. I didn't enjoy the subjects that much because of the difficult quizzes and exams, but now I'm actually enjoying them. It's a matter of perspective. I don't have a quiz or an exam the next day regarding the subject, so I'm actually enjoying reading about it and researching more. The terminologies used in the novel were not jargon for me. I enjoyed the fact that I understood almost everything the author wrote.This novel is about smallpox. Smallpox is this seemingly eradicated disease caused by 2 viruses namely Variola Major and Variola minor. I say seemingly because there are frozen strains of the virus kept at the CDC and in Russia. What is daunting about this fact is that terrorist can make a bioengineered weapon using smallpox. There is not enough vaccine out there today to cater for the world in case a major outbreak of the eradicated disease would suddenly happen. There are no funds allocated for a disease that is known to be eradicated. I am honestly rooting for the eradication of the virus. I don't see the need for it to be there. Based on the facts written, one of the few ways for smallpox to be back is intentional release of the virus. Aside from the intentional desire to kill millions of people, another way for the disease to back is from an accident in the lab. Accident from a research done for an eradicated disease. Why study something that is already eradicated and imposes a huge risk of causing a global catastrophe? I may be young and I only know the basics of medical science, but I still don't see the reason why the virus hasn't been eradicated for good.The novel itself is great. It's factual and entertaining at the same time. It's one of the few non-fiction books to be considered interesting. I am willing to read more non-fiction books now thanks to this novel. I am vastly interested in microbiology and virology, so Preston's other novels are of interest to me. 5/5 stars. Honestly one of the most helpful and interesting books out there. It's scary in a way that it's non-fiction, yet it could really happen in real life. Highly recommended for people in the medical field, or even casual readers who want to try non-fiction."
3,075531218X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/16254355-matthew,4,"This book is terrifying! I wish it was fiction . . . I spent the entire book itching and squirming. The descriptions of small pox are harrowing - not for the faint of heart (if I recall, there are some pictures too). But, it is riveting, so if you like a good non-fiction thriller that might make you scared to go outside (or touch anything!), this is the book for you. Preston is really good at writing this type of novel."
4,075531218X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/961766-kim,4,"So I was in bed for a few days with a terrible flu -- fever, chills, coughing, etc... But this book really cheered me up since with its vivid description of how one dies from Smallpox -- bloody pistules covering the body, lucidity until the end despite intense pain -- I realized my suffering was sort of at the low end of possibilities! I've really become drawn to the science thriller genre these days, and while this book is nonfiction, its narrative and page-turning suspense makes it feel like a novel, as the author investigates the state of smallpox in the world today. While I haven't been one to fully trust the CDC in terms of vaccinations vis-a-vis my kids, this book makes me greater appreciate those who have tried to eradicate the world of smallpox, a much more fearsome disease than I realized. I can't wait for Preston's next book!"
5,075531218X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/35645863-lena,5,"“The dream of total eradication had failed, the viruses last strategy was to bewitch its host and become a source of power. We could eradicate smallpox from nature but we could not uproot the virus from the human heart.”   My mother has a smallpox vaccine scar on her arm and I do not. That I’ve never had to worry about it is thanks largely to  Donald Ainslie Henderson. That I may have to worry about it in the future is the fault of well meaning, and possibly narcissistic, scientists, forgetful virologists, or terrorists. The Covid-19 virus is giving us just the merest taste of what a smallpox outbreak would mean in today’s mobile population."
6,075531218X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5427149-nick-borrelli,5,"Holy shit, the scariest book I've ever read. Smallpox is no joke. makes you wonder if it's still around being stored by a world government ready to unleash it again as the ultimate biological weapon. A must read. Had me up nights."
7,075531218X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6326169-negin,3,"I love reading non-fiction that feels like fiction. Although this book was interesting, it didn’t blow me away nearly as much as Richard Preston’s other book, The Hot Zone. The subject matter (smallpox and anthrax) is fascinating, but there’s far more scientific details in this one, a bit too much for my liking. I think that this book would have been better if he had stuck to just smallpox. The back and forth between smallpox and anthrax was a bit distracting. I think that the anthrax part is related to the publication date, the early 2000's, during the time of the anthrax attacks. “Doctors generally consider smallpox to be the worst human disease. It is thought to have killed more people than any other infectious pathogen, including the Black Death of the Middle Ages. Epidemiologists think that smallpox killed roughly one billion people during its last hundred years of activity on earth.”Even though smallpox was eradicated more than four decades ago, the virus can be found in several labs around the world. The thought that it could be used as a biological weapon is terrifying.Some quotes:“Today, many adults over age thirty have a scar on their upper arm, which is the pockmark left by the pustule of a smallpox vaccination that they received in childhood, and some adults can remember how much the pustule hurt. Unfortunately, the immune system’s ‘memory’ of the vaccinia infection fades, and the vaccination begins to wear off after about five years. Today, almost everyone who was vaccinated against smallpox in childhood has lost much or all of their immunity to it.” “Smallpox is the one virus that can basically bring the world to its knees. And the likelihood of smallpox being visited on us is far greater than a nuclear war, in my opinion.”"
8,075531218X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4058534-leeanne,4,"Warning: Do not read this during cough and flu season or if you think you might be coming down with a cold! Do you remember the first ever bio-terror attack on U.S. soil when envelops full of anthrax were sent through the U.S. mail system to various places in the U.S.? It was in October 2001, a few months after the 9-11 attacks. If Smallpox had been used instead of Anthrax, we might not being around today to talk about it. The author gives the reader a brief history of smallpox. Although smallpox was eradicated in 1979, it cannot really be eradicated from the earth. It is still ""out there'. In fact, Soviet defectors confessed in the 1980's that the USSR had developed and was testing weaponized smallpox and anthrax. Undocumented reserves of smallpox not only sit dormant in hidden freezers but are probably secretly researched and held as possible bio-weapons. Scientists continue to debate funding new smallpox research to develop a new vaccine as a defense. What if one of these smallpox samples falls into the hands of terrorists? What makes smallpox unique is that it is highly contagious. Smallpox floats and travels easily, quickly and far distances through the air. One single virus particle can drift along in the air for over nine miles before a person unknowingly inhales it and becomes infected. (See: The Aral Smallpox Incident of 1971 in the Soviet Union)After you've been infected, the incubation period is ten days. During that time incubation period, you will feel normal and have no idea you have smallpox. Then, the illness hits you with full force. You will come down with a fever, sore throat, fatigue, splitting headache and eventually vomiting. You will assume you have a very nasty case of the flu. No doctor will be able to tell that you have smallpox, until it is too late. Then, a few days later the more severe symptoms of smallpox will emerge.Three kinds of smallpox and their symptoms 1. Normal Smallpox. After the flu like symptoms are in full force, painful blisters will form all over your body, like a cobblestone road. The blisters eventually turn into scabs which tear away from your skin. The tearing away from the skin is extremely painful. Your eyes swell shut with blisters and pus which can cause blindness in some people. It is too painful to eat, drink or talk as blisters form in your mouth and throat. If you survive you will have ugly scars all over your body from the blisters.2. Extreme Smallpox or Black pox - Flat Verity (100% Fatal):In flat smallpox, the skin remains smooth and does not form blisters all over. The skin darkens until it looks charred, mottled and silky to the touch. The skin begins to slip off the body in sheets. Black pox is close to a hundred per cent fatal. If any sign of it appears in the body, the victim will almost certainly die. The virus destroys the linings of the throat, mouth, stomach, intestines, rectum, and vagina as these membranes disintegrate. It destroys the body's entire skin -- both exterior skin and interior. 2. Extreme Smallpox or Black Pox - Hemorrhagic Verity (100% Fatal): In hemorrhagic smallpox, black, unclotted blood oozes from the mouth and other body orifices. The whites of the eyes turn red with blood and continue to fill with blood until they look black. The virus attacks the immune system so the body cannot produce pus. Like the flat variety, the hemorrhagic variety is nearly 100% fatal and the virus destroys the the body's entire skin and membranes, exterior and interior. For some reason, the victims remain conscious and acutely aware of what is happening to them until death.With accessible air travel all over the globe now, it would only take about six weeks for a smallpox epidemic to spread throughout the entire world. I understand that these are distressing, gruesome matters that a lot of us prefer to avoid, but sometimes it is better to uncomfortable and informed than to remain in ignorance bliss. Bt the way, how's that cold of yours doing? ;)"
9,075531218X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7862560-leanne-geezermom,5,"I read this terrifying work of nonfiction ages ago, but it still sticks with me and is one of those books that entirely changed my political viewpoint on something. Yes, it was that powerful.Do y'all remember the Gulf War? Desert Storm? I was about 30 when all that was going on, and it was the first time people started keeping the ""new"" 24 hour news stations on all the time. At the time, I couldn't believe that Saddam Hussein was invading other countries - it was like something out of WWII to me - and I felt positive that the various UN countries were right to step in and stop him. First, he marched on Kuwait and then was headed for Saudi. When he was stopped, we all breathed easier.Flash forward to 9/11. Of course, I believed the US and other UN countries were right to target cells of terrorists in Afghanistan and in pockets hidden in other countries. But when the then-president of the US later stated we'd be going into Iraq because Saddam Hussein, was up to no good again, I cringed. It felt like the world had whipped him back into alignment years before, and that possibly, this second Bush was biased because the first Bush had not taken Saddam Hussein into custody. We had so much going on with terrorists trying to wipe us out and trying to pound them in their various spots in Afghanistan that going into Iraq seemed wrong...and stupid...like poking a stick into a currently-quiet wasps nest.And then? I read this book. Game changer!The demon in the freezer here is smallpox. Not your great, great, great grandma's smallpox but an especially lethal and weaponized version that could be the plague of all plagues.This book is a collection of interviews with numerous UN weapons inspectors, WHO investigators, research scientists, and people in the dark fields. When we all heard that Hussein might have weapons of mass destruction, they weren't necessarily talking about plutonium and uranium enrichment facilities disguised as power plants to bring electricity to starving families (although, yeah, that was also out there and France actually PAID for one of these as a humanitarian gesture). There was evidence that biological warfare was going on strong, and that just a cute little wheeled suitcase on a plane or a compact car could deliver death to hundreds of thousands of people.Yes, I've read that George W. Bush only got a 22 on his ACT and supposedly wasn't the brightest of leaders, but the guy was not surrounded by fools. In hindsight, I'm guessing they wouldn't have wanted to bring up biological warfare and freak people out, but when you read this book, let's see what you think. The number of accounts from well respected scientists blew me away.I'm a retired scientist and during the good old days, I attended all sorts of conferences. Sometimes, there'd be maybe five sets of lectures going on at the same time. You'd pick which papers you wanted to hear presented, and over the next three days, you'd fill your brain with new info relative to your field. There were also these things called Poster Sessions. In a great big hall, dozens and dozens of presenters would be all set up with cubicles full of their research results, tips on how you might make use of it, and sometimes various products to sell.This is the part of the book that really got me. A couple of guys from Australia had been working on some sort of genetic modification (I'm a geologist - don't ask me for details). Apparently, there was a horrible little mouse problem down under where the rodents were decimating the grain crops. Well, understandably, farmers didn't want to be using poisons...and there are only so many farm cats out there... so here was this cool idea.'The scientists decided to create a new version of Mouse Pox. And yeah... there are tons of poxes out there. Monkey pox, horse pox, mouse pox. They decided to tweak something in the T-cells of the mouse pox gene in order to make the next batch of mice infertile after they caught mouse pox. Sure, the current mice would keep reproducing, but by releasing a ton of these infected and sterile ones, the population would eventually be cut back by, I dunno, maybe 80 percent.What happened instead is that when the modified mice were allowed to grow up to achive sexual maturity, instead of being infertile or impotent, they died. Like, nearly ALL OF THEM.The researchers were stunned. So, at this big biomedical conference, there they were in the giant hall with their poster session going - yo! Can y'all believe we tweaked this teeny tiny little thing and suddenly made boring old mouse pox 80% lethal??Holy crap. The people from WHO went nuts. Because these guys were handing out their recipe to not just make mouse pox 80% lethal, it was exactly what could make smallpox - which none of you little whipper snappers have had the vaccine for - equally virulent.The new version of smallpox - the demon in the freezer - would also work on us old poots who did get the shot as kids, because this new stuff is different.Wanna scare the pants off yourself? Read this."
10,075531218X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/116652-punk,4,"Non-Fiction. If you're looking to become bugfuck paranoid about smallpox, then this is the book for you. Act now and you'll receive a heightened awareness of anthrax at no additional cost!An in-depth look at the history of smallpox, the enormous international effort undertaken to eradicate the virus, and just how vulnerable we are to it now. Also the many ways Russia, North Korea, and Iraq are probably going to kill us with genetically engineered bioweapons.Basically after reading this you're never going to want to leave the house again, or let anyone else into it. Because who knows where they've been.This takes place over decades, which makes it a little hard to keep track of all the players. Plus at no time does Preston explain why this book starts out with the 2001 anthrax attacks, then moves on to smallpox. There was supposedly some (unfounded) fear that the anthrax was laced with smallpox, but that never went anywhere, so it's a weak connection to build an entire book around. Some of the same agencies and people were involved in both matters, but the two threads weren't tied together as well as I would have liked. Four stars. It's like true crime, but with viruses. Don't read it if you're sensitive to blood, descriptions of the complete failure of the human body, or animal testing.eBook: No cover, and it has some formatting errors: hyphens where there shouldn't be hyphens, spaces where there aren't spaces, etc."

No, wait... we're all going to die from anthrax-laced smallpox! No, wait... MONKEYPOX is going to get us! Or is it mousepox? Meh. Whatever.This is the second book I've read from Richard Preston. You'd have thought that I'd have run screaming from his writing after reading The Hot Zone. But, no. I had to read more. Granted, it has been many years since the mere thought of recycled air on a plane gave me the heebie jeebies, but still... this is scary stuff.You thought that smallpox had been eradicated and that the remaining seeds of the virus had been destroyed. You would be wrong. You thought that the smallpox vaccination that you got 50 years ago is still protecting you. (ok, it was I who got the vaccination 50 years ago... don't forget that I was premature) You would be batting 0 for 2. Not only is smallpox still around, but our friendly neighborhood scientists have experimented with the damned virus for so long, it's possible that if there is an outbreak, the world might have to deal with a super-virus. Oh, joy. Richard Preston goes into fairly graphic detail when he writes about pox, what it does and how it does what it does.Wait, there's more. The author veers from variola (our pox's true name) after the anthrax attacks in 2001. He revisits the anthrax laced letters that were mailed to two senators and several news agencies. He reminds us about the postal workers who died from anthrax, the elderly woman who died from anthrax because she inhaled a few spores that were clinging to a letter that was processed in the same facility as the anthrax letters. He reminds us that five people altogether died from that attack. He also reminds us that no one was ever caught... and that it would be very easy for another attack to be launched. Scary and scarier.So. The book is fairly disjointed. It starts out as a warning about smallpox and then suddenly takes off in the direction of anthrax. It jumps around fairly frequently. However, I found the whole thing fascinating. Preston uses a casual narrative style, which makes the book easy to read and easy to understand. I won't say that I enjoyed it, but I felt the same way about The Hot Zone. Fascinating and unsettling. Did you know that there is a pox for just about every living creature? Me either. But there is. And you'll hear about them all in this book.One word of warning... I tried taking the book with me to a restaurant. Bad move. Weeping pustules and pasta primavera do not mix. Srsly. Eww."
12,075531218X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/38036772-annie,3,"Not quite as heart-pounding as Preston's The Hot Zonewhich had me seeing the world differently for a few weeks, but not a bad book at all. For fans of The Hot Zone, we get to revisit some of our familiar characters and settings. Notably USAMRIID, the government virus research facility, and the scientists Peter Jahrling and Nancy Jaax, both stationed there. The book seems like it's going to be about anthrax, based on the opening chapter, but in fact anthrax is but a tiny part of this book, which is primarily devoted to smallpox (which seems irrelevant post-Eradication, but isn't). The meat of the book (smallpox) is bookended at the beginning and ending with anthrax. The book is memorable for the quote ""This was not your mother's anthrax."
13,075531218X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/73029907-cav,2,"I didn't like this one at all...This is my second (and likely last) from author Richard Preston.I was interested to hear a more in-depth take on the Anthrax attacks of 2001. The book's narrative jumps around quite a lot; talking about Ebola, AIDS, Smallpox, vaccinations, and other assorted topics. It only spends a fraction of its pages on the 2001 attacks, and even less on the anthrax bacillus...I think his writing style is what grates on me the most; there's just something I find seriously lacking in his pages.Anyhow, I would not recommend this book to others.2.5 stars."
14,075531218X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6345207-michelle,3,"As much as I loved/was terrified of The Hot Zone, I did not feel the same about this book. The book jumps around quite a bit and is a little hard to follow along, so I kept waiting to see how the author would connect all the dots, and was left a little disappointed in the story-telling overall.It starts out discussing smallpox and its supposed eradication in the 70s. Then it switches to the various poxes that exist (seriously, there's one for practically every creature roaming the planet), and about trans-species jumps some poxes take that can be a threat to humans, if not now, then possibly some point in the future. Then it goes back to the smallpox eradication, and explains how some variations were kept, only later to be considered a threat and questions of destroying all stockpiles were then raised, except by then, it was too late, because it was feared that some may already be in the wrong hands, being engineered as a weapon (and just fyi, that vaccine you may have gotten as a child was only protective for about 4-5 years after you got it).Then the author steers the storyline into the anthrax-in-the-mail attacks following 9/11, which I thought was the first indication we had that viruses could be used as a weapon, but I was wrong. The author establishes it pretty well that for years prior to this event, scientists and the government have long been concerned about that possibility, but I was left overwhelmed and not entirely sure how all this information fit together, and he never quite spelled it out for me.So I guess this is a story about how no one was caught in the anthrax attacks, so it serves as a reminder to us all about how easy it would be for a bioterrorist attack to occur again. Except next time, it might not be anthrax (which isn't contagious), it might be smallpox (which is highly contagious). Any country could have it this point, it's the most deadly virus known to us, and the global effects of an engineered (or even accidental) release would be catastrophic. It's fascinating and scary-as-hell subject matter, but the story here could have been told better."

Through interviews with those involved with the eradication and working to prevent bioterrorism a strong case is made for the Soviet government creating genetically-modified smallpox by the ton into the 1990s and how these virii might currently be in the possession of rogue nations. You'll also learn why smallpox is most-likely the worst virus ever inflicted upon humankind and is much more dangerous than Ebola, Avian Flu, or AIDS. From 1850-1970 is is estimated that smallpox is responsible for the death of over one billion humans worldwide."

By trying to weave the anthrax attacks of 2001, Preston fractured the narrative and lost momentum with the larger story (the history, eradication, and bio-warfare threat of a resurrected smallpox virus). I felt he tried to connect the two to the detriment of the story. Bummed to say the least. THE DEMON IN THE FREEZER had real potential. It just wasn't met. With that said, I am looking forward to reading Preston's other works like THE COBRA EVENT and PANIC IN LEVEL 4."

To know we came so close to eradicating this disease and then, through human hubris, came up short. Very sad indeed.Only complaint about this book on Smallpox is I wish it had been more about Smallpox. A lot of information on other diseases not central to the topic."
19,075531218X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10762842-nicole-r,4,"Last week, vials of what turned out to be viable smallpox where found in a refrigerator on a National Institutes of Health Campus in Maryland. Date on the vial: 1954. Many people probably just scoffed and moved on to the next news story but what they may not have known is that smallpox is considered the most deadly human virus and is responsible for killing hundreds of millions of people in the 20th century before eradicated in 1980. Vaccines are no longer given, the vaccines given to our older generations may no longer be effective, and we no longer make the vaccine in mass quantities so an out break would spread like wildfire through our interconnected world.Now, I will move on to the book synopsis....When that news story hit, I knew it was time to reread The Demon in the Freezer. Written after the anthrax scare of 2001 in the Senate Office of Mr. Daschle when a priority concern was that the anthrax was laced with smallpox, Mr. Preston walks us through the history of smallpox eradication and the current ethical dilemmas with keeping stockpiles in the U.S. CDC and the Russian VECTOR. In fact, Mr. Preston foreshadowed this exact situation. His book, published 12 years ago, says, ""Officially, the smallpox virus exists in only two repositories....but, if you believe smallpox is sitting in only two freezers, I have a bridge for you to buy"". He goes on to say that a freezer with a few vials of smallpox in it could become a biological time bomb.I had shivers when I read that line in the book.The eradication of smallpox is a modern medical miracle. It took decades, the dedication of ambitious doctors and volunteers, and cost millions - probably billions - of dollars. But, do we have an obligation to keep the virus for future research?Preston does a great job of writing nonfiction like it is a suspense novel and not sugar coating how devastating a smallpox outbreak today would be. While the bookending of the smallpox story with the anthrax story was a flimsy prop to bring in smallpox while tying the book to a popular news topic of 2002, it was still interesting to read. Now, I am off to see about getting a smallpox vaccination....TL;DROnce of my favorite aspects of the book is that it sets up so many ethical quandaries where both sides can be effectively argued - heck, I personally could argue both sides - and there just isn't a right answer. There may not even be a good answer. A few of these are: - Is testing smallpox on monkeys ethical? These animals suffer, ultimately die, and we do it on purpose. (I have a very clear answer on whether I think this is acceptable).- If the smallpox vaccine were given to every US citizen today, perhaps several thousand people would die and others would be sickened by it. In the fact of a smallpox pandemic, is the sacrifice of a few worth saving the greater good.Other interesting facts:- 99.75 percent of the vaccine stockpile was destroyed to save approximately $25,000 a year on electricity costs. However, replacing that lost quantity would cost half a billion dollars.- The Russian made bioweapons out of smallpox and actually tested them. It is extremely reasonable to think that many countries today have unknown supplies of weaponized small pox - Russia, Iraq, Japan, and France among them.- The doctors who ended smallpox as a natural disease effectively saved 50 to 60 million human lives, yet not one of them has ever received a Nobel Prize."

While the subject matter is potentially fascinating: Researching biological terrorism and the remaining smallpox virus in the aftermath of the 9/11 attacks-- the delivery was sterile and unengaging. Those who read the book for squeamish details will be bored, those who expected a novel will be disappointed. While the information contained therein is useful, the delivery left much to be desired. It would be easier and faster to simply read the CDC website. "
21,075531218X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/974210-erik-graff,3,"Author Preston has written both non-fiction and fiction, the style of the thriller being reflected in this factual account of the bioterror threat as it existed in 2002, the time of publication.'The Demon in the Freezer' is a disquieting account of how infectious diseases such as smallpox, Ebola and anthrax, diseases which have devastated populations in the past, have the potential to destroy human civilization. The one 'happy' story is that of how the World Health Organization removed smallpox from the environment. The unhappier theme of this book is how governments, such as our own, have failed to destroy smallpox entirely, choosing instead to continue research, often in the name of finding antidotes.Having been written in the aftermath of 9/11 and the subsequent anthrax scare in the United States, considerable attention is paid to the potentials of weaponized anthrax and anthrax/smallpox as well as to the source, then still unknown, of the culprit behind the anthrax put through the USPS during that period."

26,075531218X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/117566-mauri,2,"Perhaps not the greatest book for the almost completely trained epidemiologist and maybe not for the general public too.The epidemiologist will likely be bored, unless they've been buried in cancer epi classes or something and miss their ID lectures. If you're looking to read everything ever written on smallpox you might as well skim this, but there's nothing new or earth-shattering here.For the general public looking to bone up on ways you can die while drowning in your own blood, I ask you to take a quick glance at the publication date. 2002. A year after 9/11 and the anthrax mailings, a year before we rolled into Iraq, something like half my lifetime ago. Go find something written this decade. Preston's writing about how Russia, Iraq, and North Korea are all out to kill us sounds believable and scary, until you remember that we were told that we invaded Iraq partially because we thought they had WMDs (including biowarfare capabilities or hopes), but turned up jack shit. Want to be scared about something? Pandemic flu is coming for you and it isn't going to need terrorists to help it along. Look up dual use research of concern - the fact that we're getting ever closer to just being able to make smallpox whole cloth in a lab, forget stockpiles in Siberia.There are other annoyances - Preston makes out like the CDC was wasting thousands of dollars every year storing smallpox vaccine, then destroyed most of the stockpile ""just to save a few thousand dollars a year"". Then in the next section, it's revealed that the smallpox vaccine is kind of shitty and while having enough on hand to vaccinate the civilian population sounds like a great idea, a decision to vaccinate would be a decision to let a lot of people die from vaccine-related complications. Dude, make up your mind.Then there's the fact that the book opens with the 2001 anthrax mailings and then quickly segues into smallpox with no explanation. I thought we'd eventually move back to anthrax (which did eventually happen) or onto other biowarfare possibilities, but I guess when Preston called the book ""The Demon in the Freezer"" he only had one demon on his mind."
27,075531218X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/87074116-kathryn,5,"Besides just informing or educating, non-fiction books often hide subtle themes for their readers to explore. This was true with The Demon in the Freezer by Richard Preston; which captured the story of the effort of the countless scientist and workers who fought to eliminate smallpox from the world. The international struggle against the highly infectious smallpox virus was a tale of hard work and dedication. However, the conflict against smallpox is still in the back of many minds. 	While the disease has been successfully eradicated, it still sits in freezers in Russia and America. Even more terrifyingly, it most likely resides on the shelves of biochemical warfare labs of many countries, such as Iran and Russia. This book made me wish that countries would resort to more ethical measures than chemical warfare to resolve issues and multi-national conflicts. The fear biochemical terrorism struck through the United States and United Kingdoms governments was evident in the writing. The potential disaster that a biochemical attack poses to not just soldiers, but civilians is overwhelming. The US has not only witnessed but fallen victim to acts of national and international terrorism. At the time, America had just seen the Twin Towers knocked out of the sky, the threat of an anthrax attack only exasperated the situation. Recently, we saw the passing of the one year anniversary of the Las Vegas; the largest shooting in the country’s history. However, nothing would match the effects of biochemical terrorism. Nations need to be held accountable and made to follow international guidelines involving testing biochemical weapons. 	 While reading this book I realized that the crackdown on smallpox was an international collaboration. It took many years and a plentiful number of scientist and employees to rid the world’s population of smallpox. There were numerous attempts. Right as scientists announced zero cases, another popped up. While the vaccination circles did stop the spread of smallpox; it took a long time to corner the last few cases of smallpox. Ending the smallpox’ expansion required participation from multiple countries and organizations. It didn’t end there, storing and stocking all forms of the disease was another globe wide task. Ridding the world of smallpox wasn’t a small task, but universal accomplishment.Richard Preston humanizes the victims of the diseases and illnesses he covers. Smallpox had an international effect, but many times media coverage and attention of citizens was focused on regions near them. Because of this, countries more distant from the reach of US received less aid. This isn’t an anomaly. All around the world, disasters occur and are often ignored by the US press. After reading this book I wondered about the impact global media coverage could have on catastrophes such as war, disease, famine, and droughts. Many times, problems needing international treatment don’t receive it, solely because they exist in another hemisphere, such as Ebola outbreaks in Africa. In the Demon in the Freezer, it was made clear that each case of smallpox was just as dreadful as the one before, and this idea penetrated into the media. The spread of global news, while not common, is necessary for our functioning.This book made me see that the scientific process behind the eradication of smallpox was thorough and deliberate. Even though the disease posed a risk to the population, scientists had to make sure they took the appropriate steps to vaccinate and were careful not to rush into the project without scrutinizing every detail. This remained true later in the book, after the eradication of the virus, when scientists experimented with different strains on monkeys. They were forced to curb their enthusiasm and take rational and calculated steps to a find conducive result. This paid off because the work they did so carefully, granted them a better understanding of the virus.The extermination of smallpox is easily one of the greatest human feats. The eradication made me believe that people can do just about anything. Smallpox wasn’t meant to be controlled or eradicated, in fact, the virus is one of the most dangerous and deadly out there. However, it was done with large volumes of teamwork and brilliant minds. Most importantly the hard work put into this project made a difference. Scientist felt like they were running a race against smallpox; one they needed to win. They spent hours in labs and in the field working, hours they could have been spending with family or friends. The danger and sacrifices they worked through seemed insurmountable, however, their hard work delivered the results they needed. The sheer number of scientific barriers broken and doors opened by the eradication is astounding. While it took a great deal of work and risks by all involved, the annihilation of smallpox proved the human race is unstoppable. 	This piece of writing was a testimony to human life. It also showed the difficulties that people face. After reading and reflecting, I felt that diseases such as smallpox are unfair. Smallpox is a ruthless disease, it is a long and painful death, and for those who survive, it might be even worse. They are left with blister for years, painful reminders of the torture they endured. It attacked where people felt the safest. In what they thought were sanitary hospitals, smallpox had a way of slithering down hallways and into another patient’s room. Some people couldn’t even make it to hospitals. Many people were so remote that they couldn’t even receive help before smallpox had run its course. While we eventually won our battle with smallpox, the millions of casualties were abysmal. 	While the topic matter was dismal, not all of the book was negative. It was also filled with faith and hope. The book made me hope that this is the last disease we see of this magnitude. Additionally, as science evolves, we are able to find cures for cancers and other animal poxes before they spread to the human race. If we are lucky, scientific breakthroughs will make fatal diseases a thing of the past. Also, I am optimistic that the human race we be able to collaborate on other global issues as well as we did with smallpox. While smallpox was a tragedy, the eradication of smallpox laid a base for many more scientific accomplishments. Beating smallpox was the start of a new and improving era."

34,075531218X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/71789635-alicec09,3,"I found this book interesting, though not as good as either of Preston's books on Ebola, perhaps because the account here is even less resolved. A major strength of the book is Preston's access to top-level officials. His discussion of the eradication of small pox was great, and could have been longer. The efforts to contain (and destroy) remaining samples of the virus were also fascinating. It is scary, though not surprising, to read about how far those samples may have spread from the two places where they were supposed to be totally contained.Weaknesses here are similar to those of his other books: excessive purple prose and awkward physical descriptions of essentially every person of note encountered in the book.Another weakness is the book jumps oddly and abruptly between anthrax and smallpox. It is not immediately clear why the book jumps suddenly from the discussion of the 2001 anthrax attacks to smallpox. The jump is so abrupt I went back to reread to make sure I didn't miss some key point as to why the sudden shift in focus was happening. These shifts happens several times, and none are well signposted. If Preston had stayed focused on smallpox, the book could have been just as strong as his writing on Ebola. Instead, the two are forced together rather awkwardly.Finally, Preston, I think, pushed too hard on one of his core claims. He constantly hypes smallpox (or some other deadly and highly contagious, possibly engineered virus) as a major weaponized threat- either from a terrorist group or an enemy nation. While there is no doubt to his claims about how deadly such a virus is, there is at least one unexplored reason why I think the threat of the use of such a weapon is not as great as Preston suggests. Preston rightly acknowledges that, once released, such a virus would race around the world from wherever it is released. As a consequence, the virus would very easily reach back to the releasers themselves. Thus any nation (or group) who released such a weapon would likely have to deal with many deaths of their own people- which it is plausible to assume they would want to avoid. Put far more bluntly, a bomb permits far more control over who is affected, while a virus is virtually uncontrollable once released.I'm not meaning to imply that such a threat is not serious. It most certainly is. Preston's purple prose simply allows him to get carried away. A less manic discussion would be beneficial."
35,075531218X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6610972-nina,5,"If this doesn’t give you nightmares, I don’t know what will. I actually believed that smallpox had been eradicated, but it continues to exist in freezers and has the potential to bring the world to its knees. The disease was still a major problem so very recently, with an epidemic occurring just a year before my oldest son was born. At the end, the nations of the world blew it. Small repositories of the virus were to be kept in the US and Soviet Union, but when the USSR fell, controls fell apart. “The Russians themselves have told us that they lost control of their smallpox. They aren’t sure where it went, but they think it migrated to North Korea.” The author bemoaned, “All I knew was that the dream of total Eradication had failed. The virus’s last strategy for survival was to bewitch its host and become a source of power. We could eradicate smallpox from nature, but we could not uproot the virus from the human heart.” The book also addresses Ebola and anthrax. What the coronavirus can do pales in comparison. And then you have our leadership cutting funding for the CDC. Such a world my grandchildren are inheriting. "
36,075531218X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/45293195-ronald,4,"I always liked Richard Preston's writing style and story telling of the several little events that make up our understanding of the disease today. Unlike The Hot Zone, The Demon in the Freezer is all about the parallel concerns around smallpox and anthrax, mostly focusing around 9/11 when anthrax was sent in a New Jersey USPS distribution center and the fears quietly intensifying among world leaders about who may have and be able to use smallpox in biological weaponry.I am going to as a trained scientist, I find Preston's grasp and ability to write about scientific knowledge in my area of expertise (microbiology) to be quite good and understandable to a reader who is not a scientist. The only reason for 4 stars is I felt the book was not as cohesive or ""urgent"" for me to read as The Hot Zone. The story telling in The Hot Zone was so appealing and addicting! This one was very good, but not quite the same level of enjoyment. I would absolutely read the book again though for enjoyment. Looking forward to reading some of Preston's other works!"

I must admit that while I knew a thing or two about anthrax, I knew close to nothing about smallpox as it had been eradicated quite some time before I was born. But it's long gone, right? Well... maybe?The history of the disease was one of the most interesting things I've read today, combined with bits abut genetics, epidemiology and international espionage. And it's chilling because it's real. Kudos to the author for writing an intelligent and yet accessible book about the topic. And kudos to all the great people out there who work on keeping everyone alive. My only issue with the book is the structure and the going back and forth between smallpox and anthrax. I feel like anthrax probably should have better gotten its own book, but the situation was hardly clear at the time this book was written.Overall, highly informative. And scary. Very scary. "

Having an interest in the medical field his descriptions of how simple microorganisms can fundamentally dismantle and massacre the human body is extremely disturbing yet intriguing. Touching on the possibilities of weaponized diseases and the dangers even an eradicated disease like smallpox can pose, Preston makes it clear in this book that at any time these diseases can be thawed out and used against a population. An idea reinforced by the fact some storage locations are unknown and the WHO is completely unprepared to deal with a kill off if one were to occur. Overall, this book was a thoroughly enjoying read but should be cautioned by the faint of heart due to Preston's love for gore."

It was rather disjointed. Needed more connection between topics and people. At times too much detail on things that don’t matter (what people were wearing, that a boyfriend got her grandmother’s couch)“Doctors generally consider smallpox to be the worst human disease. It is thought to have killed more people than any other infectious pathogen, including the Black Death of the Middle Ages. Epidemiologists think that smallpox killed roughly one billion people during its last hundred years of activity on earth.”“We could start an arms race over smallpox…”“The main thing that stands between the human species and the creation of a supervirus is a sense of responsibility among individual biologists.”"

Turns out there are metric tons of virus unaccounted for hidden around the world, some of which could be held by terrorist organizations. I was also mistaken in my assumption that the typical circular scar on my upper arm was a solid protection from any further outbreaks in the future. My immunity wore off 5 years after the initial vaccination. Another mistake this time lies with the US government, who thought it would be a good idea to destroy their stockpiles of vaccine, deeming them obsolete. Currently there is only enough supply to vaccinate 1 in every 12000 people globally. If someone out there decided to spread the invisible virus, like Anthrax was spread in the early 2000s, we are all done for. Now try to go to sleep tonight. "

The most mind-blowing part is that it's all true-- it reads like a thriller, but is a true story about actual events that went down around 9/11. Based on the description, when I went into this read I expected it to be 100% about anthrax. Wrong! This book is sort of a crash course on virology in the context of human health, and for most of the book focuses on other major diseases such as smallpox and Ebola that have terrorized (and, in the case of Ebola, continue to terrorize) humanity for centuries. If you have an interest in science, infectious diseases, virology, or just are looking for an engaging read to teach you something new, I highly recommend this book!"

The author highlights the efforts of numerous people in the smallpox eradication program and the ongoing efforts of scientists to force countries to destroy the demon in their freezer. Biowarfare is an imminent threat and despite our efforts, we have no way to know when and where the attack will happen. One thing is for sure, it will definitely happen."

Preston does a great job masking the sheer amount of scientific research behind a book about disease by molding it into a tale with a coherent timeline and actual characters, which increased its appeal exponentially. For a book about diseases (fascinating as epidemics, not in their own right), it sure doesn't feel like one- I like science books, but Preston's voice lacked a scientific tone, if such a thing even exists. I'd recommend this to fiction-inclined people experimenting with nonfiction. "

A major strength of the book is Preston's access to top-level officials. His discussion of the eradication of small pox was great, and could have been longer. The efforts to contain (and destroy) remaining samples of the virus were also fascinating. It is scary, though not surprising, to read about how far those samples may have spread from the two places where they were supposed to be totally contained.Weaknesses here are similar to those of his other books: excessive purple prose and awkward physical descriptions of essentially every person of note encountered in the book.Another weakness is the book jumps oddly and abruptly between anthrax and smallpox. It is not immediately clear why the book jumps suddenly from the discussion of the 2001 anthrax attacks to smallpox. The jump is so abrupt I went back to reread to make sure I didn't miss some key point as to why the sudden shift in focus was happening. These shifts happens several times, and none are well signposted. If Preston had stayed focused on smallpox, the book could have been just as strong as his writing on Ebola. Instead, the two are forced together rather awkwardly.Finally, Preston, I think, pushed too hard on one of his core claims. He constantly hypes smallpox (or some other deadly and highly contagious, possibly engineered virus) as a major weaponized threat- either from a terrorist group or an enemy nation. While there is no doubt to his claims about how deadly such a virus is, there is at least one unexplored reason why I think the threat of the use of such a weapon is not as great as Preston suggests. Preston rightly acknowledges that, once released, such a virus would race around the world from wherever it is released. As a consequence, the virus would very easily reach back to the releasers themselves. Thus any nation (or group) who released such a weapon would likely have to deal with many deaths of their own people- which it is plausible to assume they would want to avoid. Put far more bluntly, a bomb permits far more control over who is affected, while a virus is virtually uncontrollable once released.I'm not meaning to imply that such a threat is not serious. It most certainly is. Preston's purple prose simply allows him to get carried away. A less manic discussion would be beneficial."

Preston does a great job masking the sheer amount of scientific research behind a book about disease by molding it into a tale with a coherent timeline and actual characters, which increased its appeal exponentially. For a book about diseases (fascinating as epidemics, not in their own right), it sure doesn't feel like one- I like science books, but Preston's voice lacked a scientific tone, if such a thing even exists. I'd recommend this to fiction-inclined people experimenting with nonfiction. "

We spent a long time researching and discussing bioterrorism and the assertion that the anthrax could have been made in a college laboratory. This book is really two stories — the anthrax story, and then the nightmare scenario: smallpox as a bio weapon. The smallpox storyline was fascinating (and terrifying) to me - especially the discussion about whether to destroy the known samples. "

The bottom line: we have the scientific capability of ending smallpox, but we don't have the political will. Also, small pox is even worse than you think it is. And vaccinating everyone won't work, so you can get over that idea. So, I'll just be over here quietly contemplating dystopian landscapes and trembling . . ."

Biowarfare is an imminent threat and despite our efforts, we have no way to know when and where the attack will happen. One thing is for sure, it will definitely happen."

Preston does a great job masking the sheer amount of scientific research behind a book about disease by molding it into a tale with a coherent timeline and actual characters, which increased its appeal exponentially. For a book about diseases (fascinating as epidemics, not in their own right), it sure doesn't feel like one- I like science books, but Preston's voice lacked a scientific tone, if such a thing even exists. I'd recommend this to fiction-inclined people experimenting with nonfiction. "
104,075531218X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4337911-renee,4,"I remember so clearly the anthrax threats after September 11, 2001 — I was a senior in college, a biology major, and president of the debate team. We spent a long time researching and discussing bioterrorism and the assertion that the anthrax could have been made in a college laboratory. This book is really two stories — the anthrax story, and then the nightmare scenario: smallpox as a bio weapon. The smallpox storyline was fascinating (and terrifying) to me - especially the discussion about whether to destroy the known samples. "

The bottom line: we have the scientific capability of ending smallpox, but we don't have the political will. Also, small pox is even worse than you think it is. And vaccinating everyone won't work, so you can get over that idea. So, I'll just be over here quietly contemplating dystopian landscapes and trembling . . ."

124,075531218X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/71789635-alicec09,3,"I found this book interesting, though not as good as either of Preston's books on Ebola, perhaps because the account here is even less resolved. A major strength of the book is Preston's access to top-level officials. His discussion of the eradication of small pox was great, and could have been longer. The efforts to contain (and destroy) remaining samples of the virus were also fascinating. It is scary, though not surprising, to read about how far those samples may have spread from the two places where they were supposed to be totally contained.Weaknesses here are similar to those of his other books: excessive purple prose and awkward physical descriptions of essentially every person of note encountered in the book.Another weakness is the book jumps oddly and abruptly between anthrax and smallpox. It is not immediately clear why the book jumps suddenly from the discussion of the 2001 anthrax attacks to smallpox. The jump is so abrupt I went back to reread to make sure I didn't miss some key point as to why the sudden shift in focus was happening. These shifts happens several times, and none are well signposted. If Preston had stayed focused on smallpox, the book could have been just as strong as his writing on Ebola. Instead, the two are forced together rather awkwardly.Finally, Preston, I think, pushed too hard on one of his core claims. He constantly hypes smallpox (or some other deadly and highly contagious, possibly engineered virus) as a major weaponized threat- either from a terrorist group or an enemy nation. While there is no doubt to his claims about how deadly such a virus is, there is at least one unexplored reason why I think the threat of the use of such a weapon is not as great as Preston suggests. Preston rightly acknowledges that, once released, such a virus would race around the world from wherever it is released. As a consequence, the virus would very easily reach back to the releasers themselves. Thus any nation (or group) who released such a weapon would likely have to deal with many deaths of their own people- which it is plausible to assume they would want to avoid. Put far more bluntly, a bomb permits far more control over who is affected, while a virus is virtually uncontrollable once released.I'm not meaning to imply that such a threat is not serious. It most certainly is. Preston's purple prose simply allows him to get carried away. A less manic discussion would be beneficial."
125,075531218X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6610972-nina,5,"If this doesn’t give you nightmares, I don’t know what will. I actually believed that smallpox had been eradicated, but it continues to exist in freezers and has the potential to bring the world to its knees. The disease was still a major problem so very recently, with an epidemic occurring just a year before my oldest son was born. At the end, the nations of the world blew it. Small repositories of the virus were to be kept in the US and Soviet Union, but when the USSR fell, controls fell apart. “The Russians themselves have told us that they lost control of their smallpox. They aren’t sure where it went, but they think it migrated to North Korea.” The author bemoaned, “All I knew was that the dream of total Eradication had failed. The virus’s last strategy for survival was to bewitch its host and become a source of power. We could eradicate smallpox from nature, but we could not uproot the virus from the human heart.” The book also addresses Ebola and anthrax. What the coronavirus can do pales in comparison. And then you have our leadership cutting funding for the CDC. Such a world my grandchildren are inheriting. "
126,075531218X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/45293195-ronald,4,"I always liked Richard Preston's writing style and story telling of the several little events that make up our understanding of the disease today. Unlike The Hot Zone, The Demon in the Freezer is all about the parallel concerns around smallpox and anthrax, mostly focusing around 9/11 when anthrax was sent in a New Jersey USPS distribution center and the fears quietly intensifying among world leaders about who may have and be able to use smallpox in biological weaponry.I am going to as a trained scientist, I find Preston's grasp and ability to write about scientific knowledge in my area of expertise (microbiology) to be quite good and understandable to a reader who is not a scientist. The only reason for 4 stars is I felt the book was not as cohesive or ""urgent"" for me to read as The Hot Zone. The story telling in The Hot Zone was so appealing and addicting! This one was very good, but not quite the same level of enjoyment. I would absolutely read the book again though for enjoyment. Looking forward to reading some of Preston's other works!"
127,075531218X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5752751-ana-maria-bujor,4,"I think I'm moving all my horror novels to the ""fairy tale section"" - this thing is truly scary. I must admit that while I knew a thing or two about anthrax, I knew close to nothing about smallpox as it had been eradicated quite some time before I was born. But it's long gone, right? Well... maybe?The history of the disease was one of the most interesting things I've read today, combined with bits abut genetics, epidemiology and international espionage. And it's chilling because it's real. Kudos to the author for writing an intelligent and yet accessible book about the topic. And kudos to all the great people out there who work on keeping everyone alive. My only issue with the book is the structure and the going back and forth between smallpox and anthrax. I feel like anthrax probably should have better gotten its own book, but the situation was hardly clear at the time this book was written.Overall, highly informative. And scary. Very scary. "
128,075531218X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/59245918-miko-wollner,4,"With each new book, Richard Preston cements himself as one of the most vividly disturbing authors I have had the pleasure of reading. Having an interest in the medical field his descriptions of how simple microorganisms can fundamentally dismantle and massacre the human body is extremely disturbing yet intriguing. Touching on the possibilities of weaponized diseases and the dangers even an eradicated disease like smallpox can pose, Preston makes it clear in this book that at any time these diseases can be thawed out and used against a population. An idea reinforced by the fact some storage locations are unknown and the WHO is completely unprepared to deal with a kill off if one were to occur. Overall, this book was a thoroughly enjoying read but should be cautioned by the faint of heart due to Preston's love for gore."
129,075531218X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1444977-ann,3,"An interesting time for our book club to pick this one. Overall I liked it ok. Certainly increased awareness on some important topics. It was rather disjointed. Needed more connection between topics and people. At times too much detail on things that don’t matter (what people were wearing, that a boyfriend got her grandmother’s couch)“Doctors generally consider smallpox to be the worst human disease. It is thought to have killed more people than any other infectious pathogen, including the Black Death of the Middle Ages. Epidemiologists think that smallpox killed roughly one billion people during its last hundred years of activity on earth.”“We could start an arms race over smallpox…”“The main thing that stands between the human species and the creation of a supervirus is a sense of responsibility among individual biologists.”"
130,075531218X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1881113-andrea,5,"If you think you are safe from smallpox because it was eradicated in 1979 you are very much mistaken. Turns out there are metric tons of virus unaccounted for hidden around the world, some of which could be held by terrorist organizations. I was also mistaken in my assumption that the typical circular scar on my upper arm was a solid protection from any further outbreaks in the future. My immunity wore off 5 years after the initial vaccination. Another mistake this time lies with the US government, who thought it would be a good idea to destroy their stockpiles of vaccine, deeming them obsolete. Currently there is only enough supply to vaccinate 1 in every 12000 people globally. If someone out there decided to spread the invisible virus, like Anthrax was spread in the early 2000s, we are all done for. Now try to go to sleep tonight. "
131,075531218X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/23734187-cait,5,"This book was a wild ride! I am a big fan of Michael Crichton and found this book reminded me a lot of his writing. The most mind-blowing part is that it's all true-- it reads like a thriller, but is a true story about actual events that went down around 9/11. Based on the description, when I went into this read I expected it to be 100% about anthrax. Wrong! This book is sort of a crash course on virology in the context of human health, and for most of the book focuses on other major diseases such as smallpox and Ebola that have terrorized (and, in the case of Ebola, continue to terrorize) humanity for centuries. If you have an interest in science, infectious diseases, virology, or just are looking for an engaging read to teach you something new, I highly recommend this book!"

Having an interest in the medical field his descriptions of how simple microorganisms can fundamentally dismantle and massacre the human body is extremely disturbing yet intriguing. Touching on the possibilities of weaponized diseases and the dangers even an eradicated disease like smallpox can pose, Preston makes it clear in this book that at any time these diseases can be thawed out and used against a population. An idea reinforced by the fact some storage locations are unknown and the WHO is completely unprepared to deal with a kill off if one were to occur. Overall, this book was a thoroughly enjoying read but should be cautioned by the faint of heart due to Preston's love for gore."

It was rather disjointed. Needed more connection between topics and people. At times too much detail on things that don’t matter (what people were wearing, that a boyfriend got her grandmother’s couch)“Doctors generally consider smallpox to be the worst human disease. It is thought to have killed more people than any other infectious pathogen, including the Black Death of the Middle Ages. Epidemiologists think that smallpox killed roughly one billion people during its last hundred years of activity on earth.”“We could start an arms race over smallpox…”“The main thing that stands between the human species and the creation of a supervirus is a sense of responsibility among individual biologists.”"

Turns out there are metric tons of virus unaccounted for hidden around the world, some of which could be held by terrorist organizations. I was also mistaken in my assumption that the typical circular scar on my upper arm was a solid protection from any further outbreaks in the future. My immunity wore off 5 years after the initial vaccination. Another mistake this time lies with the US government, who thought it would be a good idea to destroy their stockpiles of vaccine, deeming them obsolete. Currently there is only enough supply to vaccinate 1 in every 12000 people globally. If someone out there decided to spread the invisible virus, like Anthrax was spread in the early 2000s, we are all done for. Now try to go to sleep tonight. "

The most mind-blowing part is that it's all true-- it reads like a thriller, but is a true story about actual events that went down around 9/11. Based on the description, when I went into this read I expected it to be 100% about anthrax. Wrong! This book is sort of a crash course on virology in the context of human health, and for most of the book focuses on other major diseases such as smallpox and Ebola that have terrorized (and, in the case of Ebola, continue to terrorize) humanity for centuries. If you have an interest in science, infectious diseases, virology, or just are looking for an engaging read to teach you something new, I highly recommend this book!"

Preston does a great job masking the sheer amount of scientific research behind a book about disease by molding it into a tale with a coherent timeline and actual characters, which increased its appeal exponentially. For a book about diseases (fascinating as epidemics, not in their own right), it sure doesn't feel like one- I like science books, but Preston's voice lacked a scientific tone, if such a thing even exists.

A major strength of the book is Preston's access to top-level officials. His discussion of the eradication of small pox was great, and could have been longer. The efforts to contain (and destroy) remaining samples of the virus were also fascinating. It is scary, though not surprising, to read about how far those samples may have spread from the two places where they were supposed to be totally contained.Weaknesses here are similar to those of his other books: excessive purple prose and awkward physical descriptions of essentially every person of note encountered in the book.Another weakness is the book jumps oddly and abruptly between anthrax and smallpox. It is not immediately clear why the book jumps suddenly from the discussion of the 2001 anthrax attacks to smallpox. The jump is so abrupt I went back to reread to make sure I didn't miss some key point as to why the sudden shift in focus was happening. These shifts happens several times, and none are well signposted. If Preston had stayed focused on smallpox, the book could have been just as strong as his writing on Ebola. Instead, the two are forced together rather awkwardly.Finally, Preston, I think, pushed too hard on one of his core claims. He constantly hypes smallpox (or some other deadly and highly contagious, possibly engineered virus) as a major weaponized threat- either from a terrorist group or an enemy nation. While there is no doubt to his claims about how deadly such a virus is, there is at least one unexplored reason why I think the threat of the use of such a weapon is not as great as Preston suggests. Preston rightly acknowledges that, once released, such a virus would race around the world from wherever it is released. As a consequence, the virus would very easily reach back to the releasers themselves. Thus any nation (or group) who released such a weapon would likely have to deal with many deaths of their own people- which it is plausible to assume they would want to avoid. Put far more bluntly, a bomb permits far more control over who is affected, while a virus is virtually uncontrollable once released.I'm not meaning to imply that such a threat is not serious. It most certainly is. Preston's purple prose simply allows him to get carried away. A less manic discussion would be beneficial."
185,075531218X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6610972-nina,5,"If this doesn’t give you nightmares, I don’t know what will. I actually believed that smallpox had been eradicated, but it continues to exist in freezers and has the potential to bring the world to its knees. The disease was still a major problem so very recently, with an epidemic occurring just a year before my oldest son was born. At the end, the nations of the world blew it. Small repositories of the virus were to be kept in the US and Soviet Union, but when the USSR fell, controls fell apart. “The Russians themselves have told us that they lost control of their smallpox. They aren’t sure where it went, but they think it migrated to North Korea.” The author bemoaned, “All I knew was that the dream of total Eradication had failed. The virus’s last strategy for survival was to bewitch its host and become a source of power. We could eradicate smallpox from nature, but we could not uproot the virus from the human heart.” The book also addresses Ebola and anthrax. What the coronavirus can do pales in comparison. And then you have our leadership cutting funding for the CDC. Such a world my grandchildren are inheriting. "
186,075531218X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/45293195-ronald,4,"I always liked Richard Preston's writing style and story telling of the several little events that make up our understanding of the disease today. Unlike The Hot Zone, The Demon in the Freezer is all about the parallel concerns around smallpox and anthrax, mostly focusing around 9/11 when anthrax was sent in a New Jersey USPS distribution center and the fears quietly intensifying among world leaders about who may have and be able to use smallpox in biological weaponry.I am going to as a trained scientist, I find Preston's grasp and ability to write about scientific knowledge in my area of expertise (microbiology) to be quite good and understandable to a reader who is not a scientist. The only reason for 4 stars is I felt the book was not as cohesive or ""urgent"" for me to read as The Hot Zone. The story telling in The Hot Zone was so appealing and addicting! This one was very good, but not quite the same level of enjoyment. I would absolutely read the book again though for enjoyment. Looking forward to reading some of Preston's other works!"

While there is no doubt to his claims about how deadly such a virus is, there is at least one unexplored reason why I think the threat of the use of such a weapon is not as great as Preston suggests. Preston rightly acknowledges that, once released, such a virus would race around the world from wherever it is released. As a consequence, the virus would very easily reach back to the releasers themselves. Thus any nation (or group) who released such a weapon would likely have to deal with many deaths of their own people- which it is plausible to assume they would want to avoid. Put far more bluntly, a bomb permits far more control over who is affected, while a virus is virtually uncontrollable once released.I'm not meaning to imply that such a threat is not serious. It most certainly is. Preston's purple prose simply allows him to get carried away. A less manic discussion would be beneficial."
215,075531218X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6610972-nina,5,"If this doesn’t give you nightmares, I don’t know what will. I actually believed that smallpox had been eradicated, but it continues to exist in freezers and has the potential to bring the world to its knees. The disease was still a major problem so very recently, with an epidemic occurring just a year before my oldest son was born. At the end, the nations of the world blew it. Small repositories of the virus were to be kept in the US and Soviet Union, but when the USSR fell, controls fell apart. “The Russians themselves have told us that they lost control of their smallpox. They aren’t sure where it went, but they think it migrated to North Korea.” The author bemoaned, “All I knew was that the dream of total Eradication had failed. The virus’s last strategy for survival was to bewitch its host and become a source of power. We could eradicate smallpox from nature, but we could not uproot the virus from the human heart.” The book also addresses Ebola and anthrax. What the coronavirus can do pales in comparison. And then you have our leadership cutting funding for the CDC. Such a world my grandchildren are inheriting. "
216,075531218X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/45293195-ronald,4,"I always liked Richard Preston's writing style and story telling of the several little events that make up our understanding of the disease today. Unlike The Hot Zone, The Demon in the Freezer is all about the parallel concerns around smallpox and anthrax, mostly focusing around 9/11 when anthrax was sent in a New Jersey USPS distribution center and the fears quietly intensifying among world leaders about who may have and be able to use smallpox in biological weaponry.I am going to as a trained scientist, I find Preston's grasp and ability to write about scientific knowledge in my area of expertise (microbiology) to be quite good and understandable to a reader who is not a scientist. The only reason for 4 stars is I felt the book was not as cohesive or ""urgent"" for me to read as The Hot Zone. The story telling in The Hot Zone was so appealing and addicting! This one was very good, but not quite the same level of enjoyment. I would absolutely read the book again though for enjoyment. Looking forward to reading some of Preston's other works!"
217,075531218X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5752751-ana-maria-bujor,4,"I think I'm moving all my horror novels to the ""fairy tale section"" - this thing is truly scary. I must admit that while I knew a thing or two about anthrax, I knew close to nothing about smallpox as it had been eradicated quite some time before I was born. But it's long gone, right? Well... maybe?The history of the disease was one of the most interesting things I've read today, combined with bits abut genetics, epidemiology and international espionage. And it's chilling because it's real. Kudos to the author for writing an intelligent and yet accessible book about the topic. And kudos to all the great people out there who work on keeping everyone alive. My only issue with the book is the structure and the going back and forth between smallpox and anthrax. I feel like anthrax probably should have better gotten its own book, but the situation was hardly clear at the time this book was written.Overall, highly informative. And scary. Very scary. "
218,075531218X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/59245918-miko-wollner,4,"With each new book, Richard Preston cements himself as one of the most vividly disturbing authors I have had the pleasure of reading. Having an interest in the medical field his descriptions of how simple microorganisms can fundamentally dismantle and massacre the human body is extremely disturbing yet intriguing. Touching on the possibilities of weaponized diseases and the dangers even an eradicated disease like smallpox can pose, Preston makes it clear in this book that at any time these diseases can be thawed out and used against a population. An idea reinforced by the fact some storage locations are unknown and the WHO is completely unprepared to deal with a kill off if one were to occur. Overall, this book was a thoroughly enjoying read but should be cautioned by the faint of heart due to Preston's love for gore."
219,075531218X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1444977-ann,3,"An interesting time for our book club to pick this one. Overall I liked it ok. Certainly increased awareness on some important topics. It was rather disjointed. Needed more connection between topics and people. At times too much detail on things that don’t matter (what people were wearing, that a boyfriend got her grandmother’s couch)“Doctors generally consider smallpox to be the worst human disease. It is thought to have killed more people than any other infectious pathogen, including the Black Death of the Middle Ages. Epidemiologists think that smallpox killed roughly one billion people during its last hundred years of activity on earth.”“We could start an arms race over smallpox…”“The main thing that stands between the human species and the creation of a supervirus is a sense of responsibility among individual biologists.”"
220,075531218X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1881113-andrea,5,"If you think you are safe from smallpox because it was eradicated in 1979 you are very much mistaken. Turns out there are metric tons of virus unaccounted for hidden around the world, some of which could be held by terrorist organizations. I was also mistaken in my assumption that the typical circular scar on my upper arm was a solid protection from any further outbreaks in the future. My immunity wore off 5 years after the initial vaccination. Another mistake this time lies with the US government, who thought it would be a good idea to destroy their stockpiles of vaccine, deeming them obsolete. Currently there is only enough supply to vaccinate 1 in every 12000 people globally. If someone out there decided to spread the invisible virus, like Anthrax was spread in the early 2000s, we are all done for. Now try to go to sleep tonight. "

The most mind-blowing part is that it's all true-- it reads like a thriller, but is a true story about actual events that went down around 9/11. Based on the description, when I went into this read I expected it to be 100% about anthrax. Wrong! This book is sort of a crash course on virology in the context of human health, and for most of the book focuses on other major diseases such as smallpox and Ebola that have terrorized (and, in the case of Ebola, continue to terrorize) humanity for centuries. If you have an interest in science, infectious diseases, virology, or just are looking for an engaging read to teach you something new, I highly recommend this book!"

Richard Preston takes us back in the past and allows us to relive the painful past of humanity where we could do nothing against this deadly disease. The author highlights the efforts of numerous people in the smallpox eradication program and the ongoing efforts of scientists to force countries to destroy the demon in their freezer. Biowarfare is an imminent threat and despite our efforts, we have no way to know when and where the attack will happen. One thing is for sure, it will definitely happen."

Preston does a great job masking the sheer amount of scientific research behind a book about disease by molding it into a tale with a coherent timeline and actual characters, which increased its appeal exponentially. For a book about diseases (fascinating as epidemics, not in their own right), it sure doesn't feel like one- I like science books, but Preston's voice lacked a scientific tone, if such a thing even exists. I'd recommend this to fiction-inclined people experimenting with nonfiction. "

We spent a long time researching and discussing bioterrorism and the assertion that the anthrax could have been made in a college laboratory. This book is really two stories — the anthrax story, and then the nightmare scenario: smallpox as a bio weapon.

A major strength of the book is Preston's access to top-level officials. His discussion of the eradication of small pox was great, and could have been longer. The efforts to contain (and destroy) remaining samples of the virus were also fascinating. It is scary, though not surprising, to read about how far those samples may have spread from the two places where they were supposed to be totally contained.Weaknesses here are similar to those of his other books: excessive purple prose and awkward physical descriptions of essentially every person of note encountered in the book.Another weakness is the book jumps oddly and abruptly between anthrax and smallpox. It is not immediately clear why the book jumps suddenly from the discussion of the 2001 anthrax attacks to smallpox. The jump is so abrupt I went back to reread to make sure I didn't miss some key point as to why the sudden shift in focus was happening. These shifts happens several times, and none are well signposted. If Preston had stayed focused on smallpox, the book could have been just as strong as his writing on Ebola. Instead, the two are forced together rather awkwardly.Finally, Preston, I think, pushed too hard on one of his core claims. He constantly hypes smallpox (or some other deadly and highly contagious, possibly engineered virus) as a major weaponized threat- either from a terrorist group or an enemy nation.

269,075531218X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/398346-gina,3,"The amazing, accomplished smart women in my book group occasionally make me do things like read a whole book about smallpox. I am pretty clear about the fact that I only read for entertainment purposes, not to learn. Here is what I learned from this book: smallpox is no joke, biological weapons exist and could be as devastating as nuclear weapons, Wavy Gravy is not just a Ben and Jerry’s ice cream flavor, and I still prefer fiction. "
270,075531218X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/21287077-evalina,2,"This is a good book on viruses for those who are not as familiar with them. I have studied them before so I found the material redundant. Preston does a good job at explaining the topic and the intricacies of what a virus is and what it does, however it was a smidgen boring for me. I would have liked to have read more about patients affected as individual cases."
271,075531218X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5801791-kacee,3,"Super interesting!! I really didn't know much about smallpox, and this book was very eye opening. I wish I had a different ""star"" rating system for books that I am really glad I read, but that weren't quite up there among my favs. I guess three stars will have to do. "
272,075531218X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2454570-katie-r-herring,4,"This book was more scientific than his previous, and it was more historical. I cried in this one, too. I've never thought about smallpox before, and I'd like to go back to not thinking about it. I don't think it's gone, but I hope it stays in the freezer. "
273,075531218X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1416912-trudi,4,Fascinating and scary as hell. 
274,075531218X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/71789635-alicec09,3,"I found this book interesting, though not as good as either of Preston's books on Ebola, perhaps because the account here is even less resolved. A major strength of the book is Preston's access to top-level officials. His discussion of the eradication of small pox was great, and could have been longer. The efforts to contain (and destroy) remaining samples of the virus were also fascinating. It is scary, though not surprising, to read about how far those samples may have spread from the two places where they were supposed to be totally contained.Weaknesses here are similar to those of his other books: excessive purple prose and awkward physical descriptions of essentially every person of note encountered in the book.Another weakness is the book jumps oddly and abruptly between anthrax and smallpox. It is not immediately clear why the book jumps suddenly from the discussion of the 2001 anthrax attacks to smallpox. The jump is so abrupt I went back to reread to make sure I didn't miss some key point as to why the sudden shift in focus was happening. These shifts happens several times, and none are well signposted. If Preston had stayed focused on smallpox, the book could have been just as strong as his writing on Ebola. Instead, the two are forced together rather awkwardly.Finally, Preston, I think, pushed too hard on one of his core claims. He constantly hypes smallpox (or some other deadly and highly contagious, possibly engineered virus) as a major weaponized threat- either from a terrorist group or an enemy nation. While there is no doubt to his claims about how deadly such a virus is, there is at least one unexplored reason why I think the threat of the use of such a weapon is not as great as Preston suggests. Preston rightly acknowledges that, once released, such a virus would race around the world from wherever it is released. As a consequence, the virus would very easily reach back to the releasers themselves. Thus any nation (or group) who released such a weapon would likely have to deal with many deaths of their own people- which it is plausible to assume they would want to avoid. Put far more bluntly, a bomb permits far more control over who is affected, while a virus is virtually uncontrollable once released.I'm not meaning to imply that such a threat is not serious. It most certainly is. Preston's purple prose simply allows him to get carried away. A less manic discussion would be beneficial."
275,075531218X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6610972-nina,5,"If this doesn’t give you nightmares, I don’t know what will. I actually believed that smallpox had been eradicated, but it continues to exist in freezers and has the potential to bring the world to its knees. The disease was still a major problem so very recently, with an epidemic occurring just a year before my oldest son was born. At the end, the nations of the world blew it. Small repositories of the virus were to be kept in the US and Soviet Union, but when the USSR fell, controls fell apart. “The Russians themselves have told us that they lost control of their smallpox. They aren’t sure where it went, but they think it migrated to North Korea.” The author bemoaned, “All I knew was that the dream of total Eradication had failed. The virus’s last strategy for survival was to bewitch its host and become a source of power. We could eradicate smallpox from nature, but we could not uproot the virus from the human heart.” The book also addresses Ebola and anthrax. What the coronavirus can do pales in comparison. And then you have our leadership cutting funding for the CDC. Such a world my grandchildren are inheriting. "
276,075531218X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/45293195-ronald,4,"I always liked Richard Preston's writing style and story telling of the several little events that make up our understanding of the disease today. Unlike The Hot Zone, The Demon in the Freezer is all about the parallel concerns around smallpox and anthrax, mostly focusing around 9/11 when anthrax was sent in a New Jersey USPS distribution center and the fears quietly intensifying among world leaders about who may have and be able to use smallpox in biological weaponry.I am going to as a trained scientist, I find Preston's grasp and ability to write about scientific knowledge in my area of expertise (microbiology) to be quite good and understandable to a reader who is not a scientist. The only reason for 4 stars is I felt the book was not as cohesive or ""urgent"" for me to read as The Hot Zone. The story telling in The Hot Zone was so appealing and addicting! This one was very good, but not quite the same level of enjoyment. I would absolutely read the book again though for enjoyment. Looking forward to reading some of Preston's other works!"
277,075531218X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5752751-ana-maria-bujor,4,"I think I'm moving all my horror novels to the ""fairy tale section"" - this thing is truly scary. I must admit that while I knew a thing or two about anthrax, I knew close to nothing about smallpox as it had been eradicated quite some time before I was born. But it's long gone, right? Well... maybe?The history of the disease was one of the most interesting things I've read today, combined with bits abut genetics, epidemiology and international espionage. And it's chilling because it's real. Kudos to the author for writing an intelligent and yet accessible book about the topic. And kudos to all the great people out there who work on keeping everyone alive. My only issue with the book is the structure and the going back and forth between smallpox and anthrax. I feel like anthrax probably should have better gotten its own book, but the situation was hardly clear at the time this book was written.Overall, highly informative. And scary. Very scary. "
278,075531218X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/59245918-miko-wollner,4,"With each new book, Richard Preston cements himself as one of the most vividly disturbing authors I have had the pleasure of reading. Having an interest in the medical field his descriptions of how simple microorganisms can fundamentally dismantle and massacre the human body is extremely disturbing yet intriguing. Touching on the possibilities of weaponized diseases and the dangers even an eradicated disease like smallpox can pose, Preston makes it clear in this book that at any time these diseases can be thawed out and used against a population. An idea reinforced by the fact some storage locations are unknown and the WHO is completely unprepared to deal with a kill off if one were to occur. Overall, this book was a thoroughly enjoying read but should be cautioned by the faint of heart due to Preston's love for gore."
279,075531218X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1444977-ann,3,"An interesting time for our book club to pick this one. Overall I liked it ok. Certainly increased awareness on some important topics. It was rather disjointed. Needed more connection between topics and people. At times too much detail on things that don’t matter (what people were wearing, that a boyfriend got her grandmother’s couch)“Doctors generally consider smallpox to be the worst human disease. It is thought to have killed more people than any other infectious pathogen, including the Black Death of the Middle Ages. Epidemiologists think that smallpox killed roughly one billion people during its last hundred years of activity on earth.”“We could start an arms race over smallpox…”“The main thing that stands between the human species and the creation of a supervirus is a sense of responsibility among individual biologists.”"
280,075531218X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1881113-andrea,5,"If you think you are safe from smallpox because it was eradicated in 1979 you are very much mistaken. Turns out there are metric tons of virus unaccounted for hidden around the world, some of which could be held by terrorist organizations. I was also mistaken in my assumption that the typical circular scar on my upper arm was a solid protection from any further outbreaks in the future. My immunity wore off 5 years after the initial vaccination. Another mistake this time lies with the US government, who thought it would be a good idea to destroy their stockpiles of vaccine, deeming them obsolete. Currently there is only enough supply to vaccinate 1 in every 12000 people globally. If someone out there decided to spread the invisible virus, like Anthrax was spread in the early 2000s, we are all done for. Now try to go to sleep tonight. "
281,075531218X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/23734187-cait,5,"This book was a wild ride! I am a big fan of Michael Crichton and found this book reminded me a lot of his writing. The most mind-blowing part is that it's all true-- it reads like a thriller, but is a true story about actual events that went down around 9/11. Based on the description, when I went into this read I expected it to be 100% about anthrax. Wrong! This book is sort of a crash course on virology in the context of human health, and for most of the book focuses on other major diseases such as smallpox and Ebola that have terrorized (and, in the case of Ebola, continue to terrorize) humanity for centuries. If you have an interest in science, infectious diseases, virology, or just are looking for an engaging read to teach you something new, I highly recommend this book!"
282,075531218X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/50231391-aneeza,5,"We've all heard of smallpox but never really thought about it. Sure it killed tons of people but that was before our time. Richard Preston takes us back in the past and allows us to relive the painful past of humanity where we could do nothing against this deadly disease. The author highlights the efforts of numerous people in the smallpox eradication program and the ongoing efforts of scientists to force countries to destroy the demon in their freezer. Biowarfare is an imminent threat and despite our efforts, we have no way to know when and where the attack will happen. One thing is for sure, it will definitely happen."

Preston does a great job masking the sheer amount of scientific research behind a book about disease by molding it into a tale with a coherent timeline and actual characters, which increased its appeal exponentially. For a book about diseases (fascinating as epidemics, not in their own right), it sure doesn't feel like one- I like science books, but Preston's voice lacked a scientific tone, if such a thing even exists. I'd recommend this to fiction-inclined people experimenting with nonfiction. "
284,075531218X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4337911-renee,4,"I remember so clearly the anthrax threats after September 11, 2001 — I was a senior in college, a biology major, and president of the debate team. We spent a long time researching and discussing bioterrorism and the assertion that the anthrax could have been made in a college laboratory. This book is really two stories — the anthrax story, and then the nightmare scenario: smallpox as a bio weapon. The smallpox storyline was fascinating (and terrifying) to me - especially the discussion about whether to destroy the known samples. "
285,075531218X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5358077-andrea-lakly,4,"This terrifying little story about small pox is COMPLETELY TRUE! The ninth grade STEM kids are reading it, so I decided to get on board and see what they were reading about. The bottom line: we have the scientific capability of ending smallpox, but we don't have the political will. Also, small pox is even worse than you think it is. And vaccinating everyone won't work, so you can get over that idea. So, I'll just be over here quietly contemplating dystopian landscapes and trembling . . ."

The combination of the inherent lethality of the viruses and bacteria combined with the lethal ingenuity of the bioweapon engineers is truly terrifying.
