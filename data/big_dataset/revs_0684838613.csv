0,0684838613,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2309246-cassandra-kay-silva,5,"This book dates itself quite frequently. Which normally I would be very bothered by. But you could tell that the author was trying to stay current with his time and his writing was wonderful. It just amazes me how much cosmology has changed in ten years! He was so timid with inflation it was staggering. I wonder what the authors thoughts on the newer cyclical models are? What does he think about membranes and so forth? Who knows? It wasn't in question at the time. In fact a great deal of this book wanders ""around"" physics and has little to do with modern cosmology at all! Oh how far we have come. The reason I absolutely loved this book? Because he creates an undertone throughout the work that says ""what he thinks"" without coming out and actually saying it directly. I think that is a damned good idea! Especially in the world of science. And frankly his undertones I will laud: The Copenhagen interpretation! Common! No one has not struggled with that internally, I don't care what you want to say. Even Hawking said of Shrodingers cat that his ""solution"" was a shotgun. Its a bad joke but seriously guys! You get that internal struggle from the author as well, and I applaud it. His quick but understated remarks about quantum tunneling and quantum fluxation? That is freaking hilarious! Did no one else pick up on that? He couldn't even help himself with the Dark Matter rap. You could see him wondering if it was just a bit much and then just saying oh fuck it. I love this author. I would love to read more from him. "
1,0684838613,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2105523-bob-nichols,3,"This book is less engaging than Ferris' ""Coming of Age in the Milky Way."" There's less of a story here and more of a status report on the state of the science lying at the frontiers of cosmology (as of 1997). If there is one underlying theme to this book it is that we live in a quantum universe, but we have evolved in a world that is best understood in terms of classical physics. This helps explain why the discussion of cosmology is so challenging for the general reader. We try our best to grasp what we can. Ferris has a few nuggets that stand out. All spaces that exist today were originally in the same place he says. The Big Bang (which Ferris notes is challenged by another theory that our Big Bang is one of many Big Bangs) created space and time. Space is stretching, and the universe is not expanding into pre-existing space. What lies beyond ever-stretching space is not clear in Ferris. ""Nothing"" is not a satisfying answer. Ferris says that Einstein's theory of gravity does away with gravitational force and that all forces are consequences of geometry. That nugget, while tantalizing, is not clear. The universe begins, Ferris comments, in a high-energy state that forms matter as energy cools. Structure in the universe, from atoms to galaxies, are ""cathedrals of cavernous space"" with infinitely vast areas of emptiness interspersed with higher density matter. That is nicely descriptive. Ferris says that galaxies and local groups of galaxies that form supercluster galaxies are only part of the story for there are also supercluster complexes, billions of light years across. This puts a finer point on the scales that are involved. This is all great stuff. Ferris' review of cosmological science indicates the universe has a history and is evolving, and this stands in contrast with Plato and other philosophers and Hindu cosmology that view the cosmos in terms of ""stasis"" and ""eternal return."" There's a relevance here for philosophies that anchor their thought in views about ultimate reality. One physicist says we study physics so that philosophy is not non-sense. Less kind is a quote from Niels Bohr who comments that ""It is hopeless to have any kind of understanding between scientists and philosophers directly....All that philosophers have ever written is purely drivel."" That said, and as to what nevertheless might be a central observation drawn from Ferris' summary of all of this high-altitude cosmology, if our Big Bang began as a high energy state, and if at the basic quantum level matter and energy (particle and wave) are interchangeable, and if one understands energy as motion, not stasis, this would lend itself to the conclusion that the only permanent reality is change itself. As for the physicists' description of their own work, Ferris has a good summary of eminent scientists who urge that their work be simplified and ""communicated in the common human language."" Ferris refers to one who says that ""If the basic idea is too complicated to fit on a T-shirt, it's probably wrong."" This I suppose explains E=MC squared. "
2,0684838613,http://goodreads.com/user/show/84128348-neilw,2,"Ferris' book on cosmology is well written, well sourced, and engaging...but it definitely suffers in a few big ways. First, it's about twenty years out of date, so quite a bit has changed. I knew this going in, and figured it would be fun to see how expectation vs reality would turn out. Unfortunately, the books later chapters, which cover the speculative predictions, are the weakest aspects of the book. At least Michio Kaku's books are daring in their speculation, even if his predictions wind up pretty far afield.Next, while a great overview, it doesn't cover the material in a ton of depth. In fact, it felt a bit like John Gribbin's The Scientists, or Bill Bryson's A Short History of nearly everything. It mostly details the development of cosmology and high-energy physics via biography. At least those other books covered a wider field.At the end of the day, it's a fun read, but I didn't come away feeling that my understanding of the material had deepened or that the book had given me new ideas to explore. On the otherhand, as a laymen's popularization of the field, it's perhaps a touch too specific. Winds up being stuck in the middle."
3,0684838613,http://goodreads.com/user/show/122647-sarah-sammis,4,"Timothy Ferris's enthusiasm for space is infective. In Seeing in the Dark he wrote about his love of astronomy (and many others who share his love of it). In The Whole Shebang he tries to tackle the current state of our knowledge of life, the universe and everything. The title is also a delicious pun on the ""big bang"" and he has things to say about it too.The Whole Shebang looks like a hefty book at first at 400 pages, but the last hundred are devoted to the end notes and bibliography. The remaining 300 pages is divided into 12 chapters that cover many of the different ways of thinking about the universe: how it expands, how it is shaped, the big bang and the evidence we have for it, dark matter, the structure of the universe, the evolution of stars and other bodies in space, and chapters on quantum physics (but presented in Ferris's engaging and easy to follow manner) and finally where we fit into all of this.I enjoyed The Whole Shebang more than I did Seeing in the Dark because there is less focus on Ferris's interviews with other experts in the field. The Whole Shebang instead sticks with the topic and only glances at the people responsible for advancing our understanding of space and the universe. I came to this book with a layman's basic understanding of the science in the book and so found it a relatively quick read giving the complexity of the subject. Others who aren't as familiar with the subject might want to take it in smaller chunks than I did but I think it will still be an interesting and understandable book. "
4,0684838613,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1068292-christy,2,"I’m always looking for understandable books about the cosmos, and I was excited to dive into this one. The recommendations on the back cover were glowing:  Takes readers on an incredible journey from the big bang to the whole shebang . . . his erudition is brightly lit, reader friendly, and at all times provocative . . . few literary figures know the cosmos as well as he does, or explain its technical details so clearly. So I was expecting this book to be, of all things, clear. But I found myself reading some sentences two or three times without understanding them at all. Sometimes I found whole paragraphs completely incomprehensible. Then I started wondering if Timothy Ferris himself understood what he was talking about. Come to find out, he isn’t even a scientist. His undergraduate majors were English and communications, and after one year of law school, he became a journalist. And he’s writing about the cosmos? I’m sure there are better books out there, and I’ll keep looking for them."

Certainly nature displays a self-similarity on many spatial scales. As the physicist Philip Morrison or MIT points out, if we span the universe from nuclear to intergalactic dimensions, we encounter a two-beat rhythm: Areas of emptiness - the voids between the nucleus and the electron shell of the atom, between stars and their planets, between galaxy clusters and voids, and so forth - are interspersed with high-density regions, like atomic nuclei, molecules in crystals, and galaxy clusters and walls.""

6,0684838613,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8848209-scott-kardel,4,"I picked this up in a used book store a few months ago and I am glad that I did. There has been a lot going on in cosmology since The Whole Shebang was published in 1997, but it is still good science writing. "

8,0684838613,http://goodreads.com/user/show/49575307-rodney-harvill,4,"This book, a survey of cosmology, the whole shebang, written for a general audience, may be twenty years old and somewhat dated, but I found it to be enlightening and easy to read. In other words, Mr. Ferris did a good job with this book. His discussions about quantum weirdness whetted my appetite for quantum mechanics, and I can see more reading on that topic in my future.One thing I appreciate about Mr. Ferris' writing style is his ability to frame details within the context of the big picture. When I was an undergraduate nuclear engineering student, I had to take a nuclear physics class. Two decades have passed since then, and I have forgotten a lot of the details, but I remember learning about a variety of subatomic particles and performing a variety of special relativity calculations. Given my major, it was important to understand these topics, but I don't remember any discussion about how the different concepts fit together or what general relativity was all about. I didn't get to learn the forest before studying the trees. Thanks to Mr. Ferris, I have an understanding of general relativity that I never got from a college level nuclear physics class.In his discussion of various theories of inflation, I noticed an absence of dogmatism regarding competing frameworks and even some degree of frustration. Some frameworks start with assumed initial conditions that exclude other possibilities. What is the basis? SWAG? A framework that attempts to avoid these pitfalls, chaotic inflation, which dispenses with initial conditions, has its own problems, like a need for a predecessor universe to start the process. Of course, the predecessor universe would also need its own predecessor universe, and so on, and on and on . . . In other words, I appreciated Mr. Ferris' candor with regards to the problems inflation, especially given that I have questions of my own. My engineer brain wants to know mechanism, what caused rapid inflation to suddenly start and suddenly slow down. Perhaps the cosmologists just don't know. Is there some other explanation that they cannot or will not consider?Finally, I found the ""Contrarian Theological Afterward"" to be more balanced than I expected when I saw the title in the table of contents. I just happen to be a Christian, a theist, and a creationist and am accustomed to seeing creationists and intelligent design proponents dismissed out of hand by scientists and science aficionados as unscientific and anti-science, their concerns ignored. Mr. Ferris is doubtless an agnostic or an atheist. In this afterward, he methodically critiqued the cosmological, ontological and design arguments used by Christian apologists and exposed a number of weak points while also noting that many arguments trumpeted by atheists as proof of God's nonexistence have their own weak points. This seemed intellectually honest, and I appreciated it.I am glad to have read Mr. Ferris' critique of the Christian arguments because it is important to understand one's strengths and weaknesses. That said, I think his critique of the design argument employed a subtle logical fallacy. In this critique, he considers""the question of whether God had free will when He created the universe. If so, he was free to make the universe in a random, haphazard way. But if the universe is random, what need have we to postulate the existence of God? And if it is not - if, say, God could have made the universe only the most reasonable way, or in a way that promoted human existence - then God cannot be all powerful.""In making logical arguments, it is vital to maintain consistency of definition from start to finish, and I think object of ""free will"" is in play. God had two free will choices:1. Create man (yes/no)2. Make a universe suitable for human existence (yes/no)If I choose to travel to a destination, and there is only one way to get there, does this constraint prove that I lack free will? I don't think so! I am free to chose to go or not to go. So, why does the need for a fine tuned universe take free will from God, who is still free to chose to create man or not to do so?This issue notwithstanding, I enjoyed the book and recommend it, especially to Christians and creationists. I may be a committed creationist but consider it important to understand all sides of the issues. Also, some Christian creationists can be just as smug and arrogant in their positions as Richard Dawkins and company. If it takes an agnostic or atheist to remind them that ""God resists the proud, but gives grace to the humble,"" so be it."
9,0684838613,http://goodreads.com/user/show/41103848-yaru-lin,4,"""Feynman, I know why all electrons have the same charge and the same mass.""""Why?""""Because they are all the same electron!""***A rather orthodox buildup of astrophysics and cosmology up until we hit the fascinating topic of quantum nonlocality (this book uses the term weirdness) - the entanglement that allows subatomic particles thousands of light-years apart to instantaneously resolve into their proper quantum states with relations as if they could communicate. From this problem arises some interesting philosophical solutions:The Copenhagen interpretation declares that uncertainties at the quantum level are not resolved until the particle is observed, and that only the act of measurement turns potentiality into certainty. The famous thought experiment in criticism this interpretation, Schrödinger's cat, reduces that such a bifurcated quantum-classical universe yields dead/alive cats and hence nonsensical results. The many worlds interpretation quickly overwhelms any man's computational imagination by suggesting that the universe is constantly splitting apart, making copies of itself that are identical except for the outcome of each particular observation (of subatomic particles). The hidden-variables interpretation introduces the concept of the ""quantum potential"", a guiding force that allows particles to communicate and manipulate each other instantaneously without being affected by distance. While at a first glance this seems to violate special relativity, imagine the universe as it was billions of years ago, when it was not always big and classical as we perceive it today. Perhaps the universe has not lost the memory of its small and quantum self; it may very be that the universe remains as it was in the beginning, when all places were one place, all times one time, and all things one thing. Subatomic particles may look to us like countless individual things, but this may simply be their appearance in our observable four spacetime dimensions. In hyperspace, perhaps they are only one thing, and not only connected but identical. "
10,0684838613,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1490838-tom,5,"I am fascinated by science. I went to a Baptist school where the entirety of the science curriculum can be summarized to a word: God. The benefit of this is that The Mystic is tied into the universe, the cost is that there isn't much depth. Couple this with the fact that the only good science teacher in the school had a student teacher the semester I had the class, I didn't learn too much. I had an Astronomy class in college that was taught by a recognized genius; his skills extended to the application of science only. To pass the test with a C, after the curve, you needed only a 28%. To make up for this, I've been taking a tour of science books; Bill Bryson's A Brief History of Nearly Everything was the start. Recommended was The Whole Shebang, which does an awesome job of explaining the Cosmos and Cosmology. Though I don't pretend to understand it all, I do think I could explain the concept of a black hole. It also does a great job of poetically walking you through the biggest of sciences. I recommend the book. I think it was published in the late 90's, so I'm excited to see how the field has developed. I recommend this book. "
11,0684838613,http://goodreads.com/user/show/17344111-joseph-f,4,"The author is a great writer, especially given the difficulty of the subject matter. this book covers it all: quantum weirdness, the big bang, inflation theory, strings, superstrings, dark matter, cosmological constants, solar nucleosythesis, symmetry and even an evaluation on where God fits into all of this, if there is one. It really is aptly titled The Whole Shebang, or perhaps it should have been called Too Much Shebang: it sometimes feels like it bites off more than it can chew. Even with the author's skill, I still felt a bit frustrated. I wish i had a physics professor next to me at all times to answer the myriad questions I had to help me understand things better. Then again, what do you expect from such a difficult subject. I particularly liked the way Dr. Ferris throughs in stories of the scientists themselves, giving the book a feeling of levity in the midst of such complicated material. Although this book is not for the specialist, it is definitely for the well informed layperson with at least a high school understanding of physics."
12,0684838613,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1399578-becca,3,"I do love a physics book, so this one automatically gets some leeway from me. However, the author seems too caught up in trying to become one of those beloved popularizers of science a la Michio Kaku or Neil De Grasse Tyson. He too often lets that get in the way of clarity, mixing his metaphors and choosing ""everyday"" reference points that aren't really so everyday (Lohengrin, anyone?). Oddly, this is more of a problem in the first half of the book, when the discussion is centered on the evolution of classical physics up through relativity. The text becomes much more lucid when it comes to putting quantum physics in context and talking through the recent (as of 2000) developments in string theory.Whatevs. If you're a physics geek, this isn't a bad read. But if you're just looking to get your feet wet, there are far better options out there--many of them written by Michio Kaku and Neil De Grasse Tyson."
13,0684838613,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10797234-ravi-warrier,4,"I love Ferris' books. The first one I read was The Red Limit and I liked the way he managed to explain a lot of complicated stuff in a simple manner. But I have read many books on the topic with similar comments for various authors (like Briane Green). What makes Ferris different is his candid writing style, which makes the reader feel as if s/he were reading the transcript of a lecture rather than a book.Moreoever, in The Whole Shebang, Ferris skirts the ideas of philosophy and religion. A book on the genesis of the Universe would be incomplete without considering philosophical thoughts; and that's why I like this book more than those of other scientists, who refuse to delve into the realm of philosophy.All in all, if one wants to read about the theories on the origins of the Universe, this book would and should be in the to-read list. The simplicity and yet the depth of the book will definitely astonish any serious reader."
14,0684838613,http://goodreads.com/user/show/33171375-hank-hoeft,3,"This is a popular science book that puts forth what we know about cosmology at the time of the book's writing. I had two problems with reading The Whole Shebang, but neither were characteristics of the book itself. First of all, the book was written in 1995--that was twenty years ago, and a lot has happened in astronomy and physics since then. So, if I had read this book sooner, it would have been more useful. Or at least more timely. And second, my knowledge of physics--especially quantum physics--is limited and rudimentary at best. Consequently, large portions of this book were slow going for me,and even when taking my time to slog through it, much of it was simply above my head. But this wasn't a flaw in the book, which does an admirable job explaining phenomena that sometimes even other physicists don't fully understand; it was a flaw in my own science literacy."
15,0684838613,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2623566-michael,5,"Just finished the book. I think I learned more from this book than from any that I can think of, in recent memory.Marvelous book. Mr Ferris' writing style makes what could be a very dry book into smooth and enjoyable reading. I was far behind in knowing what the current thinking in modern physics was, and I like to keep up, but had only picked up bits and pieces here and there from Quantum Mechanics and so forth. I do realize that the book was published in 1997, so it only caught me up to there. So I'm hoping that the author will write another book bringing us up to 2015, in a similarly palatable style. And this book, as I say did catch me up in a comprehensive way much further than I had been."
16,0684838613,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4873736-keith,3,"For those interested in the ""big questions"" of the universe, this is an excellent status on the answers so far. (Although it it now getting to be a bit old -- circa. 1997 -- it seems to have age well when I read it almost 14 years later.) Some of it, honestly, went right over my head, but I highly recommend the chapters on dark matter, cosmic evolution, the big bang and quantum physics. Ferris is a very clear and entertaining writer. If you're a curious person with just a general knowledge of modern cosmology, I highly recommend this book. Those with a deep interest in the subject probably won't find much new."

45,0684838613,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6759494-brent-pickett,5,This book is mind-blowing. 
46,0684838613,http://goodreads.com/user/show/22485188-donna-riley,4,Made me think hard. But this was fascinating.
47,0684838613,http://goodreads.com/user/show/20926327-lora-shouse,5,"Remarkably good book. Easy to understand considering how many of its topics are still barely understood, or not at all."
48,0684838613,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5775132-scott,5,"This book is one of the best I've ever read about science. Covers so many branches of knowledge, and how we know what we know. Even better than Kip Thorne's Black Holes and Time Warps. Read it today!"

50,0684838613,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2039846-jaime,4,The book would have been a five if Ferris could keep the fluff to himself. 
51,0684838613,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10128149-steven,4,Excellent survey in modern cosmology. No real knowledge in higher mathematics is necessary.
