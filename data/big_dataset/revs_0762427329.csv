I'd try to hold onto it but it ultimately faded. I'd feel myself coming closer and closer back to dull reality, each and every time. There's a scene in the film “Lucy” where she's looking at a tree which seems alive, pulsing w/movement and brilliantly coloured light. Ages ago, my friends and I called them jizzles and we'd see them anywhere anything grew (resulting in multiple trips in the woods, old cemeteries, anywhere there was foliage and we couldn't see buildings)."

The brief section from Einstein is more accessible, as are Hawking's commentaries, but Copernicus, Galileo, Kepler, and Newton are very difficult indeed. It is, however, pretty neat to see what these important original works looked like."
2,0762427329,http://goodreads.com/user/show/61033954-m-r,4,"The man has always wondered about the Universe around him.What laws reign on the cosmos? Does the Universe have a center? Where is he ? Which rules obeys the movement of celestial bodies? What forces keep the planets in their orbits?Stephen Hawking gathered in this book the texts that successively revolutionized the human perception of the world:""From the revolution of the celestial spheres"" by Nicolas Copernicus, ""Dialogues on the two great systems of the world"" of Galileo Galilei,""The Secret of the World"" by Johannes Kepler,""The Mathematical Principles of Natural Philosophy"" by Isaac Newton and ""The Relativity"" by Albert Einstein.These texts tell us about the evolution of our knowledge of the Universe, from a precopernic cosmos centered on the Earth to the relation that unites time and space.The texts are introduced by a biography of each scholar where Stephen Hawking explains the importance of their work, placing them in their historical context.Five founding scientific texts, with short biographies:- Nicolas Copernicus: Revolutions of the Celestial Orbs (Book I)- Galilee: Speeches and Mathematical Demonstrations concerning two New Sciences- Johannes Kepler: The Harmony of the World (Book V),- Isaac Newton: The Mathematical Principles of Natural Philosophy (Books I to III),- Albert Einstein: RelativitiesIt should be noted that Hawkings does not propose any theory of knowledge or questioning about scientific progress. He sees science as a pile of knowledge and discoveries where scientists rely on the shoulder of older discoveries. To read for the content of the texts of these 5 great scientists.For an innovative and well-argued analysis of scientific revolutions, much prefer the rigorous work of Thomas Samuel Kuhn and his Structure of Scientific Revolutions, a few notches above all the same."
3,0762427329,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3977649-tim,4,"This is a really intimidating book, both in size and most definitely, in content! It's a highly recommended read for anyone who has an interest in physics as it contains much of the original material from which huge sections of classical physics are derived.The problem with this however is that four of the five texts contained in this book are between 500 and 350 years old and so the writing style is incredibly far removed from modern scientific writing. Galileo's section for example is presented as a dialogue between three friends discussing the physical concepts that he addresses which, while an inventive way of explaining these principles to the renaissance mind, takes a bit of getting used to!The introductions to each text by Stephen Hawking are interesting but honestly do very little to prepare the reader for what is to come, serving mostly just to provide a bit of historical context for each work.Regardless of the stylistic problems, these are indeed some of the classics of physics and something that any scientific mind should attempt to read once."
4,0762427329,http://goodreads.com/user/show/12484910-charbel,4,"It took me months to finish this colossus but I did it! Right, about the book...Reading On The Shoulders of Giants is like time traveling through the most significant moments of physics. At times it was challenging, I'm not going to lie, but in the end it was totally worth. Stephen Hawking's intros about each physicist were some of my most favourite parts of the book. Unfortunately, you cannot review this book in the traditional sense since it's a collection of works by different authors. So I'm rating it as a whole: the progression of the book was brilliant both from a temporal perspective and a topical perspective, and the cohesiveness of the book was optimal. The only downside is that you can't tackle it all like any other book, you're gonna have to read it in chunks (sometimes weeks at a time). "
5,0762427329,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1779598-pete-dapixie,3,"On the shoulders of giants, the reader may well have their head in the clouds. The book contains five giants of astronomy and physics, namely Nicolaus Copernicus, Galileo Galilei, Johannes Kepler, Isaac Newton and Albert Einstein. Their famous works are 'On the revolutions of heavenly spheres' by Copernicus. 'Dialogues concerning two new sciences' by Galileo Galilei, 'Harmonies of the world' by Johannes Kepler, 'Principia' by Isaac Newton and 'The principle of relativity' by Albert Einstein.All these works are excerpts from the originals. Steven Hawking provides a brief biography of each man.I found many of the writings would have benefited from the provision of diagrams that most of the texts were referring to. Especially as 'illustrated' is included in the title, most of the illustrations do not relate to the text.It is noticable how much the young Albert Einstein shows a resemblance to the young Bob Dylan, but again, this illustration is of no help with the principle of relativity."
6,0762427329,http://goodreads.com/user/show/13777842-joseph-sciuto,5,"Let me state from the very beginning that the book ""On The Shoulders of Giants"" with commentary from Stephen Hawkin is not, in any way or form, a book for everyone. It is not a book for beginners. As someone who came to read this book, after having read biographies on Einstein and DaVinci, the theories of Einstein, Newton, and Copernicus, I was nevertheless lost at least half the time, totally lost. Yet, even in the dark I had gained knowledge that just a short time ago I had no idea existed. It is at once mind boggling and awe inspiring that such men, with such supreme intellectual and without the tools available in today's world, could achieve and conceive of such theories and discoveries is totally beyond me. This is a very, very big book and it will probably be a very long time before I pick it up again, but I am so very glad I did and have absolutely no regrets"
7,0762427329,http://goodreads.com/user/show/27195238-menglong-youk,5,"4.5/5 stars""On the Shoulders of Giants"" is a collection of some of the most influential works of Copernicus, Kepler, Galileo, Newton and Einstein with Stephen Hawking provided the short biography and his comments on each scientist above. I must admit that the original work of the four most important figures (with the exception of Einstein's) is completely incomprehensible to me as they are around four hundred years old, thus making the method of writing and explaining concepts quite different from today's world. But I love the short descriptions and the personal views that Stephen Hawking wrote."
8,0762427329,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1198421-bill-carney,4,"You'll need about 20 grams of caffeine, 12 months and a public storage facility to house the book when you're not reading it. It's only a few hundred pages yet it takes up like half of my bookshelf. I could do about 30 pages at a time. Fascinating stuff though. "
9,0762427329,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3260857-andrew,3,This book is really interesting in parts. I'll be likely to be reading this for the rest of my life. The biggest challenge is that all of the math (except for Einstein's) is old school geometry. Reading this book is always a stretching experience.
10,0762427329,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3903826-dallas,5,Doubles as an amazing recount of scientific advancement and a club to thwart off theives.
11,0762427329,http://goodreads.com/user/show/66171578-matt-hertel,4,"Hawking has compiled a well-rounded collection of the most significant scientific papers ever written and even the casual science-minded person would benefit from a quick review of these pages. I mostly focused on reading the overview of each author, as well as skimming the papers when the language grew overly technical. Even though I avoided a deep dive into the substance of each of the papers, I felt a sense of appreciation for the impact of each paper presented. I'm very happy that I took the time to tackle this significant text, even just to review the important points and remind myself that we all stand at the scientific peak of human understanding only due to the pioneering work of a number of thought-leaders that were intelligent enough to understand that they didn't need to be universally accepted at the time of their publications. Science is the greatest human achievement because the truth of the universe is self-evident. Great people tend to find these truths, to explore them, and to stand by their beliefs in the face of significant resistance. Hawking's book does a great job of providing context to their contributions, something that is often forgotten when we revere their great achievements from the comfort of modern hindsight."
12,0762427329,http://goodreads.com/user/show/12748651-ricardo,2,"Stephen Hakwing is th author of this book, which is basically a compilation of some of the works/papers of 5 of the most important minds in Physics.Each chapter is preluded by a very short and simple biography of each one (Copernicus, Galileo, Kepler, Newton, Einstein) and then we're presented by what Hakwing considered the most important work of each one.When I bought this book I thought it was something more in the way of showing how their work had impacted our current society and/or visible conquests which ensued from it. There's no explanation of the terms and subjects in analysis for any layman.Altough having a thechnical background from college, where I had contact with Physics with some depth (balistics, thermodinamics, basic notions of quantum, etc) those days are long gone.The only relevant notion I got from this was that the matters each one of them addressed and how they enunciated/solved it is beyond astounding.If you have no physics knowledge and/or are more interested in biographies of said Physicists or how they helped mold our technical advances I suggest other reading.Teading this book was a extremely cumbersome task for me. For those in the field this might be a more interesting book than for me, hence the two stars (instead of just one)"
13,0762427329,http://goodreads.com/user/show/18942380-william-schram,5,"While this book is an excellent collection of science writings, it also shows how science writing has evolved since the time of Copernicus. Included in each section is a short biography of each writer. Some of the works are rather confusing to me. For instance, Kepler spends most of his time talking about ratios of planetary distances and relating them to music.Copernicus speaks of his calculations and observations, finding a number of astronomical distances and things. Of course he uses Euclidean geometry throughout, which is something I really need to brush up on.Galileo uses discourse between some imaginary people to discuss his methods and ideas.Kepler uses ratios and observations collected by Tycho Brahe. They must have really guarded their observations back in the day, though I don't get why...Newton explains his ideas in terms of Euclidean geometry also, which hinders my understanding, since I have to flip back to find the little drawings.Einstein uses Vector Calculus and simple high school algebra to showcase his ideas, which are quite powerful in this day and age. It is rather amazing that he figured out most of this without experimental data, which only furthered his fame back when he was alive."
14,0762427329,http://goodreads.com/user/show/60036118-alok,5,"A compilation of works by Some greatest minds in the history of Physics And Astronomy , Greatest parts in the book are the Introduction By Sir Stephen Hawking given in his own words before beginning of each scientist's work.In this books there are works of Nicolas Copernicus ,Galileo Galilei , Johannes Kepler , Sir Isaac Newton , Albert Einstein . This book is like a Dictionary for Astronomy and astrophysics Enthusiasts ......Your Book shelf,and your knowledge just isn't complete without this book."
15,0762427329,http://goodreads.com/user/show/19957884-chessmen,4,"I didn't read it all from cover to cover because it is not as acessible as Hawking's other popular writings for the most part. Reading the scientists from Copernicus to Einstein, you will discover your favorite. Mine was Galileo because he wrote dialogues that were easy to digest and made you think. His style and characters reminded me a bit of Plato. I wonder how much work Stephen Hawking actually put into this book, all I konw for sure is that the foreword and brief biographies are probably his. But I don't think he edited any of the original works himself as the notes state that they were compiled from previous editions ages ago. I would also have wanted to see the appendixes from the original but they were omitted here due to ""lack of interest"" as explained by notes in the margins.In summary, On the Shoulders of Giants is the biggest science book I own and I didn't feel the urge to buy another science book for a long time afterwards."
16,0762427329,http://goodreads.com/user/show/15656262-john-rauch,4,"I've really enjoyed the 'life and works' sections, written by Hawking. The actual published works of the scientists mentioned are somewhat more tedious, especially the older ones, because of the language used and my inability to grasp some of the math easily. I'm not finished with all of the originally published stuff, but I'm working through it in bits and pieces, not in chronological order. While all of these men are fascinating, Galileo Galilei, Isaac Newton, and Albert Einstein are clear standouts to me; Galileo for his snark and resolve, Newton for the contrast of brilliance and petty feuding that I feel somewhat akin to, and Einstein for his modern relevance, pure genius, and philosophical insight. One of the better books on science I've read. I suspect I'll soon be looking for more in-depth biographies of these three, especially."
17,0762427329,http://goodreads.com/user/show/44289250-robert-martin,2,"While the book does contain landmark works that inspired paradigm shifts, it is almost completely unreadable. This, if anything, is a testament to the good work that many scientists have done in recent days to popularise science and make it accessible to the general public.Even for someone who is studying physics at university, I found the arguments presented by Galileo and Copernicus extremely hard to follow. It is difficult to decide what rating to give this book. Clearly contains genius, yet genius that the stupid (relative to such great minds) are not able to access. Because we are, in this day, spoiled with so much readable scientific works, I am afraid that I have to put more emphasis on the fact that this book is opaque. "
18,0762427329,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2855874-greg,5,"In these pages, Stephen Hawking has compiled a marvelous collection of excerpts from the science greats of the past. They are, like any serious scientific literature, extremely dense, specific, and often difficult to read. Hawkings himself gives us a Barney-style overview of the accomplishments of each scientist, followed by excerpts from their primary works. I found it absolutely fascinating to follow the logic and thoughts of these men. Not only that, but you can gain an enormous respect for the way these men pushed the boundaries of what we know. This is a must read for any scientific minded person."
19,0762427329,http://goodreads.com/user/show/31562534-darko-djokic,5,"Didn't read entire book, of course. But, only having scientific masterpieces from different eras is a big deal! Imagine having Copernicus' ""On the revolutions of heavenly spheres"", Galileo's ""Dialogues..."", Kepler's ""Harmonies of the worlds"". Newton's ""Principia..."" and Einstein's ""The principles of relativity"" in one place! Amazing!"
20,0762427329,http://goodreads.com/user/show/971687-melody,5,book giving the history of both physics and astronomy through the works of the most influential of its practicioners. Includes a lot of sketches and some pretty technical terms but I think still a book many could pick up and read.

22,0762427329,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6376568-john,5,"The old scientists used to give praises to God, quote from the Bible and that sort of stuff. Sadly, it doesn't happen anymore. When Hawking quotes Copernicus, he includes Copernicus' comments about God. I'm glad he did that. Good book! Wide and deep in science. "
23,0762427329,http://goodreads.com/user/show/21114678-pat-lee,5,"Hawking enthusiasts should beware! This particular book is likely not for you. His intended audience are people with a background and sharp understanding physics, plus those fascinated by history of science, but not afraid of a bit of math."
24,0762427329,http://goodreads.com/user/show/34086481-eric-solski,4,Great read. While some of the math is difficult to understand its enough to just read through and get an idea of how these great minds percieved the world around them. Also Hawkings write ups are almost worth it in itself. 
25,0762427329,http://goodreads.com/user/show/712375-adrienne,5,Very satisfying to read the original works of these great astronomers and to follow their lines of arguments. A valuable reference work.

43,0762427329,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5917720-gordon,4,"A mix of fascinating and frustrating. I enjoyed the introductory contextual pieces by Hawking. I again really enjoyed the written context of some of the early writings by Galileo and Copernicus - they gave a good sense of the paradigm they lived in and struggled to escape and an appreciation for how much we take a heliocentric solar system and spherical globe for granted today. on the other hand, the works by Kepler become difficult - mostly for its mystical babbling about the harmonies and ratios of Platonic solids ... Despite having the illustrated version of this book, I was disappointed that with Kepler, Newton, and Einstein, there were numerous on-going geometric discussions with talk of labeled lines, chords and arcs etc. with NO corresponding diagram to follow along. With patience, I suppose one could read super critically and reconstruct the diagrams as discussed, but I just didn’t have the patience for what was otherwise expected to be an enlightening read, not a thesis regurgitation. I was also disappointed in some of the writing selections offered. While Hawkings’ overview discussed certain topics of contribution, the same for the original authors written excerpts were not included. Anyway, overall good stuff. It’s sciencey! Dig in.
