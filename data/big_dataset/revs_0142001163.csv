It is surprising to find that she chooses to include other aspects rather than having a fixed dry approach to the subject. She will be relaying facts and figures from Space probes or the Hubble space telescope - then will veer off into beliefs or poetry of the Ancient Greeks. I can recognise that this is a ground-breaking book. If you are looking for a primer on the planets however, this is not for you. There IS a chapter devoted to each planet, but this is misleading. After reading it you may not really retain any new ""facts and figures"". But you may feel about each planet in a different way, and have a different breadth of understanding.Objectively it probably deserves a better star rating. But sadly I personally found it a bit of a slog."
1,0142001163,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3409532-april-does-feral-sometimes,2,"This is an asinine science book. What it is, actually, is a group of lyrical essays rhapsodizing in poetic, easy to understand, prose mixing science fact and selected bits of science history and lots of subjective ecstasy. In other words, a coffee table book for readers of Vogue Magazine, except that it needs more pictures and its small paperback size fits most purses. Perfect for the literary magazine reader who has difficulty with science subjects, or those readers of a poetic and romantic nature. If you are at all Asperger's, you will be tossing this into the nearest bin.Some quotes from the book: ""The Book of Genesis tells how the dust of the ground, molded and exalted by the breath of life, became the first man. The ubiquitous dust of the early Solar System-flecks of carbon, specks of silicon, molecules of ammonia, crystals of ice-united bit by bit into ""planetesimals,"" which were the seeds, or first stages, of planets."" and so on. Another excerpt: ""Call me ""It,"" or call me ""Allan Hills 84001'"" my given name-even ""Thing from Mars"" will suit. Although I am only a rock and cannot answer, allow me this conceit of conscious identity for the space of these few pages, that I may speak for Mars, whence I traveled via chance and the laws of physics."" Or: ""The hot soup still counts as ""ice"" in the parlance of planetary science, however, like the 'hot ice and wondrous strange snow' of 'A Midsummer Night's Dream.' Or: ""All of the above, probably, all rendered the more extraordinary for having traveled to her across 240,000 miles of interplanetary space, in the belly of a rocket ship, and hand-delivered as the love token of a handsome man. Lucky, lucky Carolyn.""Included are entire poems written about the planets. Self-conscious, an MFA's graduate's dream of successful writing (which I think it is, by the way-A plus), nonetheless I found myself alternately bent over in mirth and disgust. Ths book has too much saccharine for me and not enough sugar."
2,0142001163,http://goodreads.com/user/show/695116-jim,4,"An interesting tour of the solar system with not only factual information, but some history of the myths & beliefs that surround each one. I found her narration of the discovery of Pluto particularly good. She really weaves the story of Lowell & Tombaugh together well & then takes us down its road of demotion."
3,0142001163,http://goodreads.com/user/show/16622661-pamela-kinney,4,"I devoured this book, and was very sad when it ended. Her format of comparing and contrasting the science of astronomy (modern, ancient, and everything in between) and folklore of astrology was enthralling. I did not give it five stars because I kept feeling like I wanted more, just a bit more, for each planet. But I loved the book, and it led me to search out her other works. I have read each of her books since, except ""A More Perfect Heaven."" Still trying to get to it. I definitely recommend this book, though it was a bit more of a ""light"" read than I wanted. "
4,0142001163,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6812983-mark-mortensen,3,"In a concise manner this book refreshed my memory on the basics of our planets. Mythology and music is also woven into the history. As for Venus, it is at times the “morning star”, while on other days it’s the “evening star”. With a bit of light humor the author stated: “Who knows how many childhood wishes are squandered on that planet before the gathering darkness brings out the stars?”. Certainly a few of my grand wishes were foiled decades ago."
5,0142001163,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1731269-chelsea,4," Dava Sobel manages beautifully and engagingly to bring these heavenly bodies as close as one's own backyard. With eloquent descriptions of their compositions, the reader is transported throughout the solar system from the scorching toxic surface of Venus to the seas of liquid metallic hydrogen underneath Jupiter's crushing atmosphere and beyond. The chapters are organized by planet and they include discussions on history, mythology, geology, and the scientific community that has discovered and explored the planets and their neighboring objects. Her prose is lyrical and her passion for science and space apparent. The book is written to be accessible to the non-science major and manages this well, if not flawlessly. The true science buff will definitely want for more, but the intention behind this book seems to be to whet the appetite, not gorge the mind on facts.Some chapters are more successful than others (Venus and Jupiter being stand-outs while Mars and Neptune are much weaker), but overall, this book is beautifully written and would be a good introduction to non-fiction for the staunch pretty prose reader. "
6,0142001163,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4901122-cara,2,"If you open this book expecting science, you will be sorely disappointed, as I was. All the same, it's not fair to rate a book low just because it wasn't what I expected, and that's not why I gave ""The Planets"" only two stars (and I think I'm being quite generous). The reason is, ""The Planets"" isn't really about anything at all. It's a tiny part personal history - the author's relationship with the planets, tiny part social and cultural history - the discovery of and significance of the planets in a cultural sense, tiny part science, and tiny part creative writing (there's a vignette from the first-person perspective of a Mars rock). The problem is all these tiny parts don't add up to one coherent whole. Whether you're looking for science, history, culture, or whatever else, you'll be left feeling disappointed and unfulfilled. I give this book two stars instead of just one because I do like Dava Sobel's writing style - it's eloquent and fun, though not by itself able to save this book."
7,0142001163,http://goodreads.com/user/show/63058444-joshua,4,"A beautiful reminder that the pretty orbs we memorized in grade school are more than that. They're actual alien worlds rich with a chemical character and harmony that mirrors our connection to them. Dave Sobel writes poetry and facts about the Solar System, and reminds her reader to look up to the stars with wonder and inspiration."

9,0142001163,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7766197-adrian-white,3,Fascinating because of its subject but I wasn't totally convinced by Dava Sobel's approach: I thought it worked better for some chapters than for others. What it did do well for a simple lad such as myself was to instill a sense of wonder at the many varied worlds out there - in our planetary system and beyond.
10,0142001163,http://goodreads.com/user/show/799019-andrew,4,"Confession time: I originally perused this book because the cover is beautiful. As a child, I was fascinated with astronomy. As a college Freshman, I took an astronomy course and dropped out after a few weeks. Perhaps now I would be able to grasp the difficult mathematics required for even elementary-level space science. Perhaps. But I think I'm better off with a text like The Planets, which dives into the fascinating history (and indeed much of the science) of our solar system with a sense of whimsy and poetry. Unlike, apparently, some who have written reviews of this book, I read a few pages before buying it. I do that regardless of topic or genre. To begin reading something is an investment of my time and energy. I've read criticisms of the approach used here, and I don't understand how that approach wasn't apparent from the beginning. I guess this isn't my problem, but I feel a bit sad to read negative reviews by people who really are not within the intended audience here. This is beginning-level stuff, surely, for a general readership with an interest in, not an expertise with, the material.I know I haven't retained a lot of the specifics Dava Sobel has shared here, but that's not to say I haven't learned a lot. I also have a strong appreciation for how Sobel shaped each chapter, each treatment of individual bodies of the solar system. I'm happy to have read it.http://darkmagnet.blogspot.com/"
11,0142001163,http://goodreads.com/user/show/223837-nicky,3,"I think I expected this to be more scientific than it turned out to be, which may be a common problem judging from other reviews. It's actually more of a historical glance at the way humanity has envisioned the galaxy, and the way our knowledge has grown over the millennia. It's a lot literary, with bits of science and mythology thrown in. Some parts of it were lovely for that, though I wasn't sure about the emphasis on linking the Old Testament Genesis story with the scientific facts of creation. It seems likely to alienate a lot of readers, even if it sounds pretty.Of course, we mustn't forget that this is also quite behind the times now: published in 2007ish, shortly after the demotion of Pluto, it has nothing to say about more recent discoveries about the moons of the outer planets, or Curiosity, or anything like that. It's quite accessible, but not up to date, which is a pity.Sometimes the literary interludes really got on my nerves, with Sobel putting words into people's mouths and anthropomorphizing inanimate objects. I like literary tricks like that as much as the next person, but it just seems ridiculous when they're giving words and complex thought to a meteorite..."
12,0142001163,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1310120-lisa,2,"Should have been published with large color pictures as a coffee table book. I'm not sure this should be shelved with the science books- while it does include some facts about the planets, it's more a literary effort. As it is, the individual chapters feel wholly disconnected from each other, written in a wide variety of styles, and some with entirely extraneous information, such as the friend of the author's who ate moon dust after being given it as a present by a boyfriend. I honestly thought that would be the strangest bit of the book, but that was before I reached the chapter where the author suddenly decided to write in the first person as a bit of Martian rock or the one where a letter written by Caroline Herschel was reproduced in its entirety . (That chapter was very odd. Did the author have a word quota she had to make and was short on? The chapter started with a quote from Mitchell, switched to the letter from Herschel to Mitchell, and then concluded with a minimal amount of text by the author.) All in all, a disappointment."
13,0142001163,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3563552-pat,3,"The Planets is an interesting book, but one that is not for everyone. If you are looking for highly technical or academic treatment of planetary science, look elsewhere. If you want to get an overview of the planets in our solar system, this book does that. Mostly this book reminded me of information I used to know but had forgotten. There were a few new facts from more recent discoveries that I found interesting, The writing style is clear and very readable, not weighed down with a technical jargon or mathematics. The text is sprinkled with poetry (which I skipped) and personal reflections. I expect these were intended to make the subject more accessible or relatable. I found them distracting and at times condescending.There are a number of color illustrations scattered throughout the text. While these are pleasing to look at, I did not think they added anything. I received this book from a Goodreads giveaway."
14,0142001163,http://goodreads.com/user/show/61568-lena,4,"Not for scienceheads. This is a book for lit nerds who want to learn about our solar system but who want it told prettily and connected to art and myth and music, etc. "
15,0142001163,http://goodreads.com/user/show/80750585-claudia,4,"An introduction to the planets of our solar system from creation and the Sun, through the inner planets with the Earth's moon, the gas giants and ice giants all the way out to the Keiper Belt objects, starting with Sobel's own fascination with astronomy.And these aren't dry recitations of facts. Sobel has found a way to individualize each entry be it with an interview with an asteroid from Mars 'talking' about its former home to beginning Saturn's entry with Gustav Holtz's opus, The Planets and Saturn, Bringer of Old Age. Even the author's own surprising encounter with moon-dust or not. And the focus on the Uranus and Neptune entry being a paraphrased letter from Carolyn Herschel (assistant and sister of Sir William Hershel, discoverer of Uranus) to Miss Maria Mitchell.The writing is almost playful, teasing and informative. It was easy to read and didn't get bogged down with highly detailed descriptions of scientific theory. Oh, and Lynette R. Cook, who did the color illustrations, did a lovely job.The only possible negative is that it was published in 2006 so much of the information inside has been updated with new discoveries.2020-035"
16,0142001163,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7307086-joan,4,"An interesting mix of fact, myth, culture, astrology, and science fiction woven together with history, biography, and poetry. The prose is lyrical, celebrating the solar system with insight, facts, and explanations folded into , inspiring story-telling. It’s an elegant paean, promising to engage and captivate the reader. Twelve full-color illustrations accompany the narrative; following are a glossary, notes about the illustrations, details on the narrative, and a bibliography.Recommended."
17,0142001163,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8848209-scott-kardel,3,"The Planets is Dava Sobel's somewhat whimsical look at the planets of our solar system. In it she takes and historical look at our knowledge of the planets that sometimes goes back to mythology and astrology that sometimes put me off. Still, she is a very good writer, but I very much preferred her other books (Longitude, Galileo's Daughter, A More Perfect Heaven)."
18,0142001163,http://goodreads.com/user/show/14705641-nathalia-rojas,4,This was a fantastic read! I loved exploring the symbolism of the planets and delving into the more scientific aspects of them. Very enjoyable. I'm sure I'll be looking at it for symbolic interpretations in the future. 
19,0142001163,http://goodreads.com/user/show/56330657-trey-mcintyre,3,"I appreciate the effort to make what would otherwise be a dry, recitation of facts into something more fun, but this book is far too romantic for my tastes. And I did not appreciate the constant references to supernatural and mystical things... I'm reading for science, not magic here."
20,0142001163,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3551130-shelly,5,"This was a great read - I picked it up at 2nd and Charles mainly because the front cover was beautiful and featured Saturn, my favorite planet. I'm so glad I did; the author was very engaging - each chapter covers one of the planets in our solar system (including poor non-planet Pluto.)"
21,0142001163,http://goodreads.com/user/show/49558538-flyingbulgarian-svetli-h,4,"Dava Sobel has this very special way of making me care about the planets. I've never been interested by them, but I suddenly feel like I know them intimately, and like they have been my friends for a long time. Only a writer of great ability can achieve such a feat. Highly recommend!"
22,0142001163,http://goodreads.com/user/show/15431964-meg,3,"If I was ever going to get into astronomy, it would be with this book. It covers the solar system from a historical, mythological, and astrophysical perspective, giving each planet it's own personality. But it's just not a topic I can get excited about."
23,0142001163,http://goodreads.com/user/show/38874522-madina,4,an astronomy book not looking down at astrology & actually incorporating the myths and stories and history about the planets? i love it
24,0142001163,http://goodreads.com/user/show/24056206-madeleine,4,Excellent! I enjoy her writing very much.
25,0142001163,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1660264-alex-robinson,4,"Very good overview of our solar system, marred only by including way too much astrology. "
26,0142001163,http://goodreads.com/user/show/294729-ben-siems,2,"This is the first book I have read in a long time that had me strongly tempted to abandon the journey fifty pages in. Although I know Sobel's writing style has garnered high praise from far and wide, I was not particularly taken with her approach to blending science, mythology, astrology, and religion. I find it all a bit contrived, even forced at times. I was always very conscious of the writer's presence, more so than I usually care to be. As a result, I felt like I never had a chance to really sink into this book.Still, I am glad I stuck it out. The Planets does offer an abundance of fascinating facts that give one pause to ponder the rather wondrous harmony of our solar system. Admittedly, I had encountered a number of these facts before, but to have them all gathered into one book that one can easily get through in a few days is in itself a lovely thing. A few samples:* Our moon has a diameter four hundred times smaller than that of the sun, but is four hundred times closer to us than the sun. Hence, the two appear to be the same size to our eyes. The consequence is positively spiritual: the only planet in our solar system where the awesome spectacle of a solar eclipse can occur is also the only planet inhabited by creatures that can behold the sight.* The discovery in the 1970s that Venus has surface temperatures much, much hotter than would be expected simply because of its closer proximity to the sun than that of Earth—temperatures that reach 800 degrees Fahrenheit and more—greatly raised awareness among scientists of the threat of global warming. (The atmosphere of Venus is thick with carbon dioxide, the primary ""greenhouse gas."")* That moonlight strikes us as eerie has a scientific basis. The only colors the human eye can detect by moonlight alone are a few shades of green, the color of light our retinae are most sensitive to. The moon does not reflect enough sunlight for the human retina to sort out wavelengths (the key to color vision), so all other hues are rendered into black-and-white.*Jupiter's mass is twice that of all the other planets combined.These are just a few of the many, many striking facts about our cosmic neighborhood that can be found in this book. In addition, Sobel offers some fascinating stories from the history of astronomy and astrology.Again, the things I disliked about this book were all matters of style. Sobel seems convinced that history and science are only palatable when dressed up into rather cutesy narrative conceits. I don't share the view that human and celestial history needs a publicist. I think the stories are endlessly fascinating in their own right, and I would enjoy them more if they were presented in a more straightforward way. To do so, I think, would make the science more interesting and understandable, rather than less so."
27,0142001163,http://goodreads.com/user/show/595788-alex-telander,2,"THE PLANETS BY DAVA SOBEL: This is another book I bought because of it's beautiful cover, especially in the hardcover edition, and one which, after reading, I thought had failed in it's job. I've read Sobel's Galileo's Daughter, which I really enjoyed with the mixture of history, science and story, so I had high hopes for The Planets. There was a chapter on each of the nine planets, along with one for the sun and the moon, and an intro and an epilogue. The book was under 300 pages and I felt didn't go into anywhere near enough depth on each of the planets. Sobel presented each planet with a story on how it came to be discovered and by whom and then with some story and mythology surrounding the planet and then moved on the next planet. I was expecting in-depth science with the planets and just far more than was given. There wasn't a single photo in the book, which seemed crazy: you write a book about the planets with a colorful and interesting cover, the least I expect is glossy color photos inside of the planets and moons. But nada. So if you're looking for a quick uninspired read that gives you some fun facts and quaint tales about the planets, go with this one, but if you're looking for something that educates you and inspires you about the planets, look somewhere else.For more book reviews, and author interviews, go to BookBanter."
28,0142001163,http://goodreads.com/user/show/683792-jen,3,"As I mentioned, my days are listening to books and knitting--so we can only be but so impressed by the quickness of my finishing this book.I loved this book...and I hated it.I loved the information. The way she went through the planets, the discussion of their geologic qualities, the history that surrounded them, how they were discovered, how their size was found. I enjoyed how she wove the story from Genesis into a discussion of the Big Bang. I found the tales of the mapping of the circumference of our own planet fascinating. In essence, the facts that went into this book and all the things I learned were at least a 5.So why is this book a three.Because Dava Sobel couldn't just let it be a book about the planets. She got overly caught up in her own prose to a point that it would sicken a sugar addict. She told the story of Mars from the point of view of a meteorite from Mars that was discovered in Antarctica. Cute for a kids book...annoying for an adult. And then it was the tale of the discovery of Uranus, told in form of a fake epistolary from the wife of the discoverer, William Hershel. I was grateful that she hadn't thought of talking about Pluto from the point of view of the Disney dog. Planets are by nature fascinating. They don't need the help of a writer's bag of carnival tricks."
29,0142001163,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3587142-peter,1,"It is extremely rare that I give up on a book. I will often start a book and decide that I'm not going to finish it 'right now', but to decide that a book is bad enough to never, ever want to finish reading, well that hardly ever happens, and this is one of those books. Tedious, ponderous, meandering writing that does not clearly convey much of the history of the knowledge of our solar system, nor any of the sense of wonder or thrill of discovery that I would expect from a book on this subject. There are so many exciting stories to tell on this subject, but this book is just too disorganized and poorly thought out to be of much interest. Besides the obvious information on Astronomy and some Physics there's a mish mash of Mythology, Astrology, Geography and History; all without clear context or connection. It's all presented as a group of tangental sentences unburdened by the need to make any sense at all.It's off to the used bookstore for this one!"
30,0142001163,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4680796-jeni-enjaian,5,"I picked up this book while waiting for ""Longitude"" (highly recommended by one of my history professors). I did not know what to expect and was pleasantly blown away by Ms. Sobel's magnificent prose. Each chapter is dedicated to one of the traditional nine planets. (Uranus and Neptune were covered in a single chapter.) Ms. Sobel's prose flows in a manner unexpected from a book about a scientific topic. She chooses vocabulary according to the theme of each chapter without becoming pedestrian. For example, Ms. Sobel begins the chapter on Saturn with a beautiful description of Holst's beautiful symphony ""Planets"", one of my own favorites. When Ms. Sobel moves from discussing the music to discussing the planet the prose shows no noticeable shift. Words such as ""resonate"", ""beat"", ""dynamics"", and ""volume"" fill the text.I highly recommend this book. "
31,0142001163,http://goodreads.com/user/show/18695911-daniel-chaikin,3,"Not a book that needs to be read (or listened in my case). It' OK. Sobel tries the make this more interesting by waxing poetic, quoting many poetic bits about planets and using some other gimmicks. I liked the quotes, but would have preferred a simpler straight forward prose. The core of the book is not the planets as much as the history of our understanding of them, and of their discovery. This I liked, but it's a rushed history. These histories are most interesting because of the people involved. But the coverage is too brief to ever meet anyone (or re-acquaint with them, since most of the people she covers are well known). The worst chapter for me was on earth where she jumps from maps to explorers, leaping through time without any chance to provide context. I just found it disorienting.I don't regret the book, just feel a little underwhelmed by it."
32,0142001163,http://goodreads.com/user/show/22923455-powder-river-rose,5,"This is probably one of the best planetary books that I've read or listened to. I definitely encourage everyone who has ever thought about the heavenly bodies or space stuff in general to read this. It might be a bit complex for my 10 yr old adorable, but I think if he hears the audiobook version while reading along with the paperback version, he'll have no problems understanding or enjoying this incredible history, and history in the making, story; plus he'll get the pronunciation of all those words. The female narrator of the audiobook has a matter-of-fact, no nonsense voice that is easy on the ears. It's filled with information about the planets, how they were named, when and who located them, everything one may or may not want to know, though I imagine you won't be disappointed when you find out. I hope that you enjoy this book as much as I have and learn something new as I did."
33,0142001163,http://goodreads.com/user/show/35045211-rebecca,4,"A multi-disciplinary, personal and intricate look at the planets. Sobel doesn't disdain the astrological, poetical or anecdotal (whilst clearly debunking any scientific misconceptions) and thus creates a really loving and illuminating portrait of our solar system. I also got quite a heavy dose of Pluto feelz, especially after learning that it was named by an eleven year old from England and that its discoverer, Clyde Tombaugh, chose the same name for his cat. One of my favourite quotes;'Sometimes the stupefying view into deep space can send me burrowing like a small animal into the warm safety of Earth's nest. But just as often I feel the Universe pull me by the heart, offering, in all its other Earths elsewhere, some larger community to belong to.'"
34,0142001163,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2309246-cassandra-kay-silva,3,I don't really understand the style of it all. Why write about something so haphazardly? It contains just enough science to I suppose be considered science. Yet she uses each chapter to tell one particular story relating to each of the planets in turn. The stories have no tie in. There seems to be little reason for each choice. There is also a terrible mixing in of non scientific information that also seems to be chosen at random and perhaps irrelevant. I guess the ordering of it is just not for me. The continuity of the work is in question here. 
35,0142001163,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3562797-leah,4,"This is the first book I have read by Dava Sobel.... but Longitude is waiting for me on the bookshelf!I was not initially thrilled by the writing style presented in the first chapter. It just felt.... odd. I couldn't get into it at all. By chapter 2, however, I was sold. I like how the author presented each planet in a unique way. The book is informative, yet reads like a gorgeous blend of adventure, mythology, poetry, and history. If you are remotely interested in planetary science, yet don't want to crack open a dense text, give this a try. "
36,0142001163,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3038974-steve-van-slyke,3,"For those who keep abreast of planetary exploration, there will not be very much here that is new in that regard, however the author takes each planet, plus the Moon, and weaves a well-written narrative about the mythology, gradual accumulation of knowledge (to 2005), and the personalities involved. As a former NYT science journalist the author knows how to turn a phrase and that it is one of the more appealing features of the book. It's a quick easy read, very few illustrations and no photos."
37,0142001163,http://goodreads.com/user/show/49989-kathy,3,"Just enough information to keep a 7 1/2 hour drive interesting. Carl really liked it. I was very tired and would have fallen asleep without the chocolate. Written before Pluto was demoted but now I know what I should have known when I was 8. My very educated mother just showed us nine planets (Carl's version) or Dava's ""my very educated mother just served us nine pies,"" MVEMJSUNP= Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, Neptune, Pluto. I hope to find another of her books on CD for the long ride next month."
38,0142001163,http://goodreads.com/user/show/806082-jimmy-tarlau,3,"I guess you would call this Science very-light. It's a pleasnat book with a different technique for describing each of the planets from the view of a satellite, to a piece of Mars rock, to a short history of the person who discovered Uranus. Books like this make me want to spend more time paying attentin to current scientific developments and to look at photos from distant satellites. We miss too much."
39,0142001163,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7094406-rohan,2,"A very average piece of work. With a title like that, you would think there is a whole lot of interesting information and research that could be provided to the reader without putting in much effort as a writer. But Dava Sobel takes the completely opposite approach of presenting very little detail making the book very uninteresting at times. If not for my love of astronomy and science I would give this a one star at best."

46,0142001163,http://goodreads.com/user/show/782114-nathan-albright,4,"This book, as one might expect, is very much a product of its time.  It also has some of the most insightful comments as to why Pluto is such a big deal for some of us [1]:  ""People love Pluto.  Children identify with its smallness.  Adults relate to its inadequacy, its marginal experience as a misfit (214).""  That said, while I found the book an enjoyable read, I also found it a somewhat odd book, and a big part of that oddness was the result of the author doing her best to insert herself and her own family story into the story of the planets.  It's not hard to understand why she wanted to do this, although it is likely that few people will read this book wanting to know more about the author or her grandmother's experience in Ellis Island dealing with a quarantine and the threat of deportation for having an illness.  If you want information on the planets, though, this is still an enjoyable book to read that at least provides some amusing and intriguing discussions about the planets as they have been viewed in history and in culture.This book is a bit more than 200 pages and is divided into twelve chapters.  The first chapter gives an overview of the work and discusses the way in which our experience in the solar system has been extrapolated into other planets in other solar systems that we are beginning to examine (1).  After that the author talks about the sun (2), Mercury (3), Venus (4), Earth (5), the Moon (6), Mars (7), Jupiter (8), Saturn (9), Uranus and Neptune (10), Pluto (11), and then a short coda about planeteers (12).  Each of the discussions has its own focus.  When talking about the planet Mercury, there is a discussion about the mythology of that false god.  Venus leads to a discussion about dangerous beauty and the threat of global warming.  Alongside the moon the author discusses lunacy and the sterility of the moon and its eventual equilibrium with the earth.  And so it goes throughout the book, as the author discusses the relationship between planets and astrology, between planets and mythology, between planets and views of chemistry and associated elements, and the way that planets have found themselves a part of popular culture and have all been found to have surprises once they were examined in closer detail by more contemporary researchers.My own feelings about this book are highly mixed.  I'm not someone who is inclined to view mythology free, whether one looks at ancient mythology about Mercury or its equivalent being some kind of messenger between heaven and earth and the grave, or the way that the planets and the moons often have heathen implications, and that Venus has feminine geography while Uranus' moons come from Shakespeare.  While some of this information is amusing and worthwhile, the author both inserts herself into the story too much for my tastes and has views that I have no sympathy with.  Even when the author says something I would agree with about the perfect one to one correspondence between the sun and moon that allows for total eclipses as being an indication of design, it is hard to tell if the author is being serious or just trolling her audience.  And when I cannot fully trust a writer because I doubt her integrity, it is hard to really fully enjoy reading an author or getting fully invested in her works, and that is certainly the case here.  This book would have been better had the author been more honest and less political, but that is often the case in what I read, alas.[1] See, for example:https://edgeinducedcohesion.blog/2016...https://edgeinducedcohesion.blog/2015...https://edgeinducedcohesion.blog/2018...https://edgeinducedcohesion.blog/2016...https://edgeinducedcohesion.blog/2015..."

Sobel explores the planets’ origins and oddities through the lens of popular culture, from astrology, mythology, and science fiction to art, music, poetry, biography, and history. A perfect gift and a captivating journey, The Planets is a gorgeously illustrated study of our place in the universe that will mesmerize everyone who has ever gazed with awe at our night sky.The Review: The planets of the solar system have enjoyed a place in mankind's collective consciousness for many thousand’s of years. Mars, Venus, the Moon and Sun. Some could say that looking up into the night sky has been what has defined humanity’s nature since the beginning. This book could have gotten four rankings out of five, were it not for one section of the book, specifically one dealing with the planet Jupiter and on the probes that was sent to it. The author went on a very out of place tangent regarding astrological signs and how if Mission Control would have timed the probe alongside Jupiter being in the fifth house from the Sun with Sagittarius or whatever. Upon reading that section, Bookworm is afraid to say that most, if not all, the author’s credibility was sucked right out of the airlock. If astrology is your thing and one really believes the constellations have an effect on your daily life, so be it, go knock yourself out. Far be it from Bookworm to stop you, there are people out there who believe stuff that is a lot weirder. Bookworm admits that they have read a book or two about astrology and will admit it is a rather interesting topic from a symbolic and cultural standpoint. The way the author lends their prose though, it looks like that she really believes in this stuff. Again, there is nothing wrong with that, but this book was meant to serve as a cultural and scientific introduction to the planets of the Sol System and the passage as a whole came as an unpleasant bump on the textual road. “Bumpy” would be an accurate word to describe the way this book was written. A much better format would have been to divide the book into sections that dealt with each planet individually. Instead, the author seems to take a rather winding course across the celestial spheres. A little more organization would have been greatly appreciated.Final Verdict: While not meant to serve as a serious astronomical text, this book is a light hearted read that in spite of its flaws, is an informative tour of the Solar System and is sure to tickle the fancy of any stargazer.

48,0142001163,http://goodreads.com/user/show/58505482-michaela-priddy,3,"A rare thing happened when I read this book - I got exactly what I expected. Nothing more and nothing less. I saw a lot of complaints in the reviews that this book isn't very heavy in the science department and this is true. If you are expecting this book to go into deep, hard scientific facts and complex terminology on the planets that people within the science community will understand and appreciate but anyone not heavily involved in science would be completely lost you will be disappointed. Luckily that wasn't what I was expecting or wanting. I was looking for lyric essays based on the planets in our Solar System and that is what I got.This is a collection of essays based around the planets. Each section is based on a different aspect of the Solar System, with a heavy focus on each planet, or in the case of Uranus and Neptune - planets, with a different theme to correspond and intertwine with scientific facts. Themes range from classical music to horoscopes to sci-fi novels, and so on. Quite a few of these sections were very interesting to me, it's always amazing to see how connected themes are once you start looking into them - which is why I love lyric essays so much. Of course there were some sections I didn't enjoy as much as the others. Usually this was either because the section got too long winded or I didn't understand how the theme went with the planet based on how the section was being written. I especially felt this way with the Earth and Moon sections, which I felt could have been left out completely. The most enjoyable and interesting sections in my opinion were on Mercury, Saturn, and Uranus/Neptune. More reactions to each section can be found on updates I made while reading.This book really just reminded me on how much I liked learning about the planets in school. I love learning about the physical aspects of the planets as well as those interesting little facts I hadn't heard of before. Dava Sobel does a great job at giving us information without going so deep into science jargon that it would go over the heads of anyone not in the science field or used to reading the unique language of scientists. While this isn't a book for anyone wanting hard science, it is a nice look at the interesting nature of planets, the history behind astronomy, and how connected the Universe is when you really look at it."
49,0142001163,http://goodreads.com/user/show/51664350-paul-weiss,5,"Entertaining and informativeIf John Lennon were alive today to read Dava Sobel's The Planets, I've no doubt he would be pleased to call it ""a magical mystery tour"".I've always enjoyed reading popular science but, frankly, some of it is turgid, dry-as-dust commentary that is far more soporific than informative. By contrast, Sobel's The Planets, a whirlwind tour of some of the most fascinating features of our very own solar system, waxes lyrical, indeed, almost poetic at times with the compelling beauty of its prose.Each chapter, written from a unique imaginative perspective, takes what might otherwise be difficult scientific concepts and weaves them into a narrative that will draw in even the most science-phobic reader with an irresistible urgency and fascination. Sci-Fi, for example, the chapter that lucidly tells us the story of Mars, uses the extraordinarily clever device of narration from the point of view of a Martian meteorite, a piece of Martian rock blasted loose from Mars' surface by an asteroid impact that found its way to earth, landing in an Antarctic icefield over sixteen million years ago.I don't think I could improve on Newsweek's comment ... ""a guided tour so imaginative that we forget we're being educated while we're being entertained.""The Planets is highly recommended and adds to a growing body of work that includes the equally entertaining Longitude and Galileo's Daughter.Paul Weiss"

While this book does contain quite a bit of scientific information it is more of a love letter to the universe.Weaving scientific data, mythology, poetry, spirituality, history, astrology, astronomy, navigation, NASA missions, and personal feelings, Sobel presents each planet, and the Sun, in a unique way. A bit like a stream of consciousness exercise, Sobel wanders through the information about each planet much like each planet wanders around the universe - in a precise orbit that is constantly pushed and pulled by other influences.Sobol introduces us to the solar system through adoring eyes. In her first sentence she confesses to a “planet fetish”. Starting with her first science fair diorama Sobol has been telling the world about the wonders of the solar system and her excitement is contagious.One of the most novel chapters (and my personal favorite) is the one about Uranus and Neptune. Sobol presents the history of the discovery of Uranus by a fictional letter from Caroline Herschel to Maria Mitchell. Caroline, working along with her brother William discovered Uranus. Maria, working alone while she was a librarian on Nantucket, was the first woman to discover a comet.This is the third Dava Sobel book that I’ve read. She is an extremely gifted writer who puts a “people” spin on everything scientific. It took me a few chapters to get into the spirit of this book but once I did I thoroughly enjoyed it."
51,0142001163,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4764673-tammy-mannarino,4,"I loved Sobel's ""Longitude"" and ""Galileo's Daughter"". I've had ""Planets"" on my to-read pile for years. The illustrations (by Lynette Cook) are as tempting as Sobel's lyrical prose. While the book is organized like an astronomy textbook with the planets in order (My Very Educated Mother....), Sobel chooses a theme for each planet based on its mythological background, reputation or discovery and performs jazz with the detailed technical information. Sobel owns that the book is destined to be quickly dated (published in 2006, it is), but her purpose is to ignite interest in pursuing knowledge of our solar system, so spurring people toward newer information works. The most brilliant device that Sobel uses to deliver what could be dry facts to her readers is in the chapter on Uranus and Neptune. She packages the story of William Hershel's discovery of Neptune in the form of a letter from his sister (and gifted astronomer in her own right), Caroline Hershel, to her niece, Maria Mitchell, congratulating her on her own find, a comet. These literary devices may not appeal to some who would prefer a straight scientific presentation. While this book predates much of the current buzz regarding the ""Creative Non-Fiction"" genre, I think it falls squarely in that category."
52,0142001163,http://goodreads.com/user/show/49020869-benjamin,3,"A short 'Grand Tour' that seems like a good precursor to the authors ""The Glass Universe: How the Ladies of the Harvard Observatory Took the Measure of the Stars"" and ""A More Perfect Heaven: How Copernicus Revolutionized the Cosmos"". An assumption on my part, I haven't gotten to those yet. The most notable facts that have come to light by robotic probe and the Hubble Telescope are contrasted with earlier perceptions throughout the centuries. To me the highlights were the stories of the astronomers who struggled to make their discoveries with whatever was the state of the art during their careers. Another nice touch was the poetry inspired by Venus interwoven with the story of the second planet. The others didn't get that treatment but then I'm sure the vast majority of words inspired by 'the wanderers' are dedicated to the one that's easiest to see with the naked eye. That's worth a few Google searches.I always enjoy when a book presents a turn of phrase that sticks in the mind long afterwards. For The Planets, it will be ""planetesimal diaspora."" Neptune & Uranus sweeping the outer solar system of smaller than Pluto sized members of the Kuiper Belt and hurling them out past the boundary of the Oort cloud into interstellar space."

There were some parts that I thought were a little boring, but the way in which the author wrote the book is very creative. I felt like some ideas in the book had nothing to do with the subject being talked about. I wouldn't say I enjoyed this book, but I would say that I learned some things about the planets that I didn't know before. Also, this book was a little outdated, and that's the problem with writing scientific books, because science is always changing, so some facts known today weren't known then. I would recommend this book to someone who wanted to learn more about the planets, because it's full of interesting facts and information. One thing I noticed was that it didn't mention the Kuiper belt object Eris, which I thought it should've mentioned because it's about the size of Pluto, and it's also a dwarf planet. I liked this book, and I found the way that the facts and information was presented was very different from normal books about the planets."
54,0142001163,http://goodreads.com/user/show/18942380-william-schram,4,"In this book, Dava Sobel shows her skills in writing for a wide audience. In the beginning, she relates the stories of her fascination with the planets and how mysterious they were to a child of the 1950s. It is really not that hard to imagine that sort of thing since a lot of our recent information on the planets has come from probes and satellites during the time that Sobel was growing up. So as I mentioned, she discusses the diorama that she made of the Solar System that was not to scale and all sorts of other interesting little tidbits of information on the planets.The book is really short but packed with information and stories. It includes a Glossary at the end if you need some help with the terms and jargon in the book.Thankfully I could find a copy in the library. I realize that science books are priced at a premium but that still doesn't mean I am willing to shell out 25 US dollars for one."
55,0142001163,http://goodreads.com/user/show/419395-betsy,4,"This is a fascinating read, and it's a hard one to categorize. Sobel essentially uses the planets (plus sun and moon) as a framework from which to explore so many other arenas that have all intersected with astronomy at some point: origin stories (primarily Genesis), poetry, mythology, astrology, science fiction, and more. Each chapter is tied to primarily one celestial body and focuses on one sub-aspect (such as mythology). Sobel then looks at the history of that sub-topic in the context of the one planet. I found so many ideas roiling around in this book, and those who are interested in space will likely, too.But it is not a ""fact"" book or a straightforward journalistic account of space and the planets. If that is what you're looking for, you might be disappointed. Then again, you might find that you can learn a lot from a living book :-).Note: Sobel is respectful of biblical accounts of Creation, but she uses plenty of evolutionary language throughout the book.

Science meets poetry, meets myth then swills them all into popular culture. The writing draws you in. Did I fully understand everything I was reading, no, but I did not give up. I will do a re-read just so I can re-think and try and get a better understanding of the full picture of her out of box thinking. I did admire the Author for giving the planets their own chapter. I also liked the glossary at the end of the book. It helped refresh me with some things I had in my brain but don't use very often on science. Taken from the second chapter, Genesis, ""All the while the planets were forming, projectiles flew through the young Solar System like avenging angels."" I Love this description."
57,0142001163,http://goodreads.com/user/show/101109758-joseph-bamber,1,"Ultimately, I was disappointed with this book. I picked this up expecting a book filled with science about the Solar System, but found very little in that regard. Sure, there are some interesting facts about the planets, but it seems to be more about narrative than information. This book is part personal experience, part mythology and astrology (a whole chapter detailing Galileo the person and Galileo the space probe's zodiac charts!), and part fanciful story telling, not what I was looking for from an astronomy related book. My main issue with this book is that it treats astrology as a branch of science instead of pseudo-science, something no astronomer would do. All in all, this book is, in my opinion, not for people who are already interested in astronomy."
58,0142001163,http://goodreads.com/user/show/42219049-joy,5,"A fascinating book, full of interesting information presented in a lyrical style. Each chapter looks at a different solar system body or bodies but also at different themes related to the planets, such as discovery, mythology, music and science fiction. These themes influence the ways in which the chapters are written as well as the information in them. Some of the influence is more obvious, eg. the chapter on discovery is written as an autobiographical letter describing the discoveries of Uranus and Neptune. In other chapters the influence is more subtle, affecting tone and feel. Overall it is an impressive and ambitious book, full of a fascination with and love for the planets."

I definitely learned more about the planets than I knew or remembered, and the thing that amazes me about it is that this book has managed to present the information in a way in which it has actually stuck in my brain. I can recall factoids and stories about the planets that before would have just slipped my mind. I'm glad I read this one. Not only did it assist me in seeing Venus one early morning, but it has also encouraged me to be in awe once again of how much bigger than us everything is. More space things please. I need the distraction. "

Ms. Sobel weaves into the narrative tales of astronomers and explorers, as well as her personal sense of wonder and awe, to construct a delightful story that will charm you and leave you wanting for more. Unfortunately, this book is rather short and does not go in depth, so for those who wish to learn more about the planets, a different book is a must.

I do wish that the section on Earth would have been shorter and/or that more space had been devoted to the planets from Mars out.The reader was easy enough to listen to, but there were some pronunciation issues, right off the bat being Willamette, which as an Oregonian (and alum of Willamette University) perhsps rubs me more raw than it should, but also the names of half a dozen or so well known astronomers and mathematicians and, the ost annoying, several astronomical terms."

I am so glad I did - her writing is sparkling but always focused on elucidating the subject matter at hand.

Despite being brief with each chapter - one for each of the planets - being only 15 pages or so, the flowery, artsy flavor of the rhetoric meshes poorly with the subject matter of the nature and discovery of the planets. Merging the Greek myths with the actual chemical compositions just doesn't work when dressed up in the flowery dreamy language. As good as longitude is, this book is equally bad."

271,0142001163,http://goodreads.com/user/show/15890704-eric-cone,4,"THis is a good primer on the planets of our solar system. It is at least as much hisorty book as it is astronomy book, and I found it very interesting to look into who discovered the planets and how. I do wish that the section on Earth would have been shorter and/or that more space had been devoted to the planets from Mars out.The reader was easy enough to listen to, but there were some pronunciation issues, right off the bat being Willamette, which as an Oregonian (and alum of Willamette University) perhsps rubs me more raw than it should, but also the names of half a dozen or so well known astronomers and mathematicians and, the ost annoying, several astronomical terms."
272,0142001163,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6854780-kend,4,"A handy-dandy guide to the Solar System in which the planets serve as anchor points for larger discussions about history, society, culture, religion, and yes--science! I was already familiar with most of the information, but this was a new way of presenting it, and I was interested enough to see the architectural structure play out to finish it in its entirety. I would highly recommend this for readers who have a casual interest in space and enjoy novel constructs, but are not so familiar with astronomy and astrophysics as I am."
273,0142001163,http://goodreads.com/user/show/82136015-daisy-hawker,5,"Simply heavenly. If I didn't already adore astronomy, this beautiful piece heightened it by tenfolds, offering a more poetic outlook on our galstic neighbours in the solar system; not only this, it also incorporates many different subjects, such as history, music, geography, literature and more. The facts, although I fear a little outdated considering the release date, had me revelling in new knowledge of the Solar System, and the fact that it was written with such lyrical beauty made it an absolute joy to read."
274,0142001163,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3346363-matt-heavner,2,"Mostly good writing with good information about planetary science at a popular science level. However - planetary science is moving fast, so this is a bit dated (10 years old, no Messenger, New Horizons, ...; the author does recognize this is a potential problem at the end of the book); there is a little too much religion (""is the perfect geometry of the sun / earth / moon system to give us eclipses just chance? or sign of the divine?"" was one that got me); but worst was the astrology references (with a long section when discussion Jupiter) - really bad."
275,0142001163,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4126974-jeannette,4,"Have to confess that I am not an astronomy buff and that I only picked this up because it was a book I decided to read aloud to my teen son. If someone can write about each planet in a fascinating yet scientific way, Dava Sobel is that someone. I appreciated the mix of fact, lore, description, and history laid out in each chapter. A good author leaves the reader wanting more and I found myself searching the web for images, for more of the story. A great intro to the planets for any student, or just for fun. "
276,0142001163,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8893304-b,5,"While some of the chapters are somewhat dated, given the amount of time that has passed from publication to my awareness of the book, if you like outer space, that won't matter at all. This book reminded me why I fell in love with astronomy and science fiction in the first place. It reminded me of how to take joy in something for no reason other than the pure wonder of it all. And so saying, it also taught me some new factoids of which I was not previously aware. It was a great book. "
277,0142001163,http://goodreads.com/user/show/20595684-ronald-mccoy,0,"Another wonderful journey from Dava Sobel through the planets. This is no 'routine' popular science book. Sobel is a wonderful write. I hesitated in reading this, as I am well versed in planetary science, but I so enjoyed The Glass Universe, that I thought I would give it a go. I am so glad I did - her writing is sparkling but always focused on elucidating the subject matter at hand. Drawing together diverse sources, this book not only informs, but entertains as it scintillates. Pure joy!"
278,0142001163,http://goodreads.com/user/show/105301492-paul-whitla,1,"Beautifully produced book, but the diagrams and colour mask an almost unreadable text. Despite being brief with each chapter - one for each of the planets - being only 15 pages or so, the flowery, artsy flavor of the rhetoric meshes poorly with the subject matter of the nature and discovery of the planets. Merging the Greek myths with the actual chemical compositions just doesn't work when dressed up in the flowery dreamy language. As good as longitude is, this book is equally bad."
279,0142001163,http://goodreads.com/user/show/575451-jen-hyatt,4,"An enjoyable, fascinating mash-up of memoir, astronomy, history, science, mythology, and art, the book is a celebration of and education on the planets in our solar system. This reader learned a great deal about the makeup and powers of each planet, as well as the astronomers who discovered them and the information gleaned by satellites that collected data on them. Sobel’s artistic/themed approach to each planet (and Earth’s moon) makes it all the more engaging."
280,0142001163,http://goodreads.com/user/show/13866266-lawrence,3,"This is a wonderful book that is stylistically well written and an excellent primmer on the planets. The primary flaw has nothing to do with the author but as with any scientific material, it ages rapidly. There is a beautiful blending of personal experience, astronomical history and current research. I would still recommend it for someone developing an interest in astronomy or as a good summer read."
281,0142001163,http://goodreads.com/user/show/57457576-amy,3,"A lovely and spellbinding ode to our solar system. Though sometimes a little gimmicky, this book really captures the wonder and majesty of looking out at the stars. If you want an in depth description of the planets, look elsewhere. If you want magic and whimsy mixed with history, then give this book a try. "
282,0142001163,http://goodreads.com/user/show/21711898-annie,5,"an enchanting read. facts presented poetically, with magic. different ways of presenting info in each chapter--from an asteroid ""talking"" to a ""letter"" from a historical person. poetry and mythological references, historical viewpoints compared to modern proven facts--and wow, how close even the ancient Greeks got with measurements of such vast distances! a book to annotate, savor, and reread."
283,0142001163,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3158467-jennifer,5,"Sobel's lyrical depiction of the planets captures the joy and wonder she professes for them. I especially enjoyed the sometimes amusing and more often awe-inspiring anecdotes strewn throughout. It was pure joy to read Caroline Lucretia Herschel's enthusiastic letter to Maria Mitchell. I imagine this will be a book I'll revisit, perhaps many times."
284,0142001163,http://goodreads.com/user/show/26239600-samantha-kerr-vanderslice,3,"I loved the first few chapters, then I hit the parts that several other reviewers got hung up on: the chapter narrated by Martian rock, the chapter devoted to a letter written by Caroline Herschel, and the parts about astrology. Regardless, it reminded me a lot of the new Cosmos show with Neil Degrasse-Tyson. A bit of science, a bit of storytelling, a bit of kooky trivia. "
285,0142001163,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4444898-maria,4,"This was a really good read for those of us who like anything to do with space and a good introduction for those whose want to be savvy with their planet. Tons of informative facts and although written a few years ago now, there was for me anyway a fair amount of new information to digest. Dava Sobel writes in an accessible way and I enjoyed reading this."
286,0142001163,http://goodreads.com/user/show/50614697-sb,2,"The most interesting fact from the book:-The Atlantic Ocean is spreading, but the Pacific is shrinking, ""under the restless coasts of Peru, Chile, Japan and the Philippines, old, cold ocean floor is plunging back into the Earth's infernal interior, to the accompaniment of earthquakes and volcanoes [and] tsunamis."""
287,0142001163,http://goodreads.com/user/show/90149802-colleen,5,"I read this when I needed a break from novels. Beautiful prose about each planet; truly a welcome escape from reality on Earth. I will say this is definitely more of a literary work than scientific text... While she does include facts and figures regarding the planets, the primary focus seemed to be more on elegant writing."
288,0142001163,http://goodreads.com/user/show/12747252-damon,4,"Hard history combined with romantic prose. Would make a good textbook for astronomy and physics students. My only issue is the way Dava tends to change perspective from chapter to chapter (planet to planet) for the sake of creative license. She'll go from first person, to second person, to third person. It's kind of exhausting. Still, an accessible book full of integral knowledge."
289,0142001163,http://goodreads.com/user/show/43197723-norman-smith,3,"Astronomy is one of the most dynamic sciences being studied today, due to the wealth of information coming in from space-based observation as well as better devices on Earth. If you are looking for the latest on astronomy, then look elsewhere; this is already dated. If you are looking for a nice introduction to the planets, this is a pretty nice read."
290,0142001163,http://goodreads.com/user/show/19990739-abe,4,"Having read Longitude and Galileo's daughter, I expected more history of science, and while there is some, this book is more a piece of artistic expression than a coherent account of planetary research. I liked it anyways, but was disappointed that it wasn't more like her other books. "
291,0142001163,http://goodreads.com/user/show/53483800-alyson-walton,4,such a different spin on a subject matter that is constantly written about! chapters 7 and 10 are fascinating and I found the whole book thoroughly enjoyable. would recommend this and will pass on to a friend.
292,0142001163,http://goodreads.com/user/show/18195557-claudia,4,"Profound and interesting knowledge on the planets and their discoveries as well as the astronomers involved. The paperback edition does not contain any illustrations, which would have helped to understand some information better. "
293,0142001163,http://goodreads.com/user/show/12525661-scott-wiggerman,5,"I don't read a lot of nonfiction, but this was a fascinating look at the planets in our solar system--I learned so much about each and every planet! It also had a literary feel, as some chapters were even told in persona and through letters! Surprisingly cool for someone who's not into astronomy."
294,0142001163,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5666473-kate-looking-glass-reads,2,"While the language was beautiful, this book simply could not hold my attention. There was little science to be found here, instead focusing more on the wonder of the solar system. Planets and planetary objects are compared to Christian and mythological themes. It simply didn't work for me. "
295,0142001163,http://goodreads.com/user/show/28649061-madelyn,2,"Too lyrical to be a nonfiction book. Ironically, I found myself zoning out during the more descriptive parts; I wanted her to get back to the facts. It'a a good book, and I learned a lot, but I wish I could've learned more. "
296,0142001163,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3871172-kirsty,5,"This was really entertaining. I loved the creative ways Dava used to narrate chapters ( the chapter on Mars was narrated by a Martian meteorite that landed in Antarctica). I want to reread this already, and i want an updated version ( this was published in 2005). Audiobook was excellent too."
297,0142001163,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2514977-suzanne-auckerman,4,"I bought this book many years ago, and when I grabbed it from the shelf I thought it would be very out of date. It wasn't. It was a history of how we thought about the planets over the years. It was great. "
298,0142001163,http://goodreads.com/user/show/63267413-claire,3,"The author writes with flowery prose, which I did not connect to. I did appreciate some very cool facts about each of the planets! Think: Jupiter is 318 x the mass of Earth. Neptune has rings which resemble a bullseye around the planet. Uranus takes 84 years to orbit the Sun."
299,0142001163,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2773024-laura,3,"This one was just a bit odd. I really liked Longitude; this one, not so much. It's like a humanities professor decided to write a science book. Not enough astronomy in a book about astronomy. And an entire chapter told from the viewpoint of a Mars rock?"
