0,0393355551,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2933855-brina,4,"For years my mother has refused to drink tap water claiming that zebra mussels have affected the taste of her water supply. Lake Michigan is part of the Great Lakes, the largest freshwater source in the world, and to me, the water still tastes crystal clear, until this past summer when it did not, and I reluctantly joined her in drinking filtered water. While zebra mussels are only one issue affecting the future of the Great Lakes today, the species is hardly the only living being or environmental change that could affect the future of the Great Lakes in the century to come. Dan Egan in his Pulitzer finalist The Death and Life of the Great Lakes has exposed how science and history have wrought change on the once cleanest, freshest bodies of water in the world. Until the advent of the industrial revolution, the Great Lakes- Lakes Superior, Huron, Michigan, Ontario, and Erie- were self contained and held the majority of the world's fresh water. Explorers Marquette and Joliet discovered waters so pristine in 1684 that they thought that they had at long last discovered the mythical Northwest Passage to Asia. Although mistaken, the French explorers were among the first Europeans to view waters crystal clear and teeming with fish such as perch, bass, walleye, and whitefish, all fish that had swam in these waters since the lakes had been formed by the melting of glaciers at the close of the last ice age. Following Marquette and Joliet, however, came more explorers who used means of transportation other than primitive canoes. In order to reach the western great lakes from the St Lawrence Seaway would mean passing through treacherous waters from Montreal onward through Niagara Falls until they came across clear sailing in the continuous lakes Huron and Michigan. The need to create a system of canals creating a single path from the Atlantic to the Mississippi had been born and with it the end of the self contained ecosystem that the Great Lakes had known for millennia.In a balance of scientific evidence, historical anecdotes, and interviews, Egan maps out the past, present, and future of the Great Lakes as we know them. He details everything from invasive species to the drainage of a bog by farmers to geological patterns and how each instance has wrought havoc on the eighth sea. He begins by discussing how the birth of the St Lawrence Seaway and Erie and Welland Canals brought the first steamer ships and with them hundreds of invasive species of fish and organisms. With canals popular in the late 19th century, scientists did realize the magnitude of the problem until the 1950s, and by then 70 years of damage had to be undone. Species such as the lamprey eel, alewife, Asian carp, and zebra and quagga mussel have killed off native fish such as whitefish, chubs, and trout. Scientists have had to contain and attempt to kill off these species while attempting to reintroduce native species such as trout and perch while also introducing non native noninvasive species such as chinook salmon in an attempt to restore order to nature. As early as the 1960s, Michigan head of fishery and wildlife Howard Tanner saw that the lakes were dead. He viewed the steamers coming from Europe as the root of the problem, yet, it will not be until 2021 that all steamers will be required to dump their water before entering the Great Lake system of water. Tanner knew that commercial fishermen at this point had dwindled with the lampreys, alewifes, and mussels taking over the lakes. He decided to introduce salmon to the lakes in an attempt to stymy the alewives and siding with leisurely weekend fishermen and vacationers rather than those who fished for a living. Tanner's plan worked, that is until the mussel invasion became rampant. Egan points out that certain fish like the whitefish have adapted their diet to eating mussels and the lake is starting to rebound; yet, the future of the lakes and what fish is to be found in them is still to be decided.Being a native Midwesterner, Egan's findings on the science behind the zebra mussels as well as the mix of history as to how they arrived in Lake Michigan was fascinating to me. Chicago's decision to link Lake Michigan to the Mississippi River basin as a means of ridding the lake of human waste and making the water fit for drinking has essentially linked all American waterways. Hitching rides on pleasure boats, steamers, and barges, zebra and quagga mussels have found their way west. To quell the invasion, states such as Utah have began boat contamination programs and made it illegal to transport any mussels alive or dead. If this finally stems the spread of zebra mussels, then Utah scientists have a leg up on their Midwestern counterparts. If not, as Egan points out, then fish in these states will have to learn to adapt to their new surroundings as some of the Great Lakes native fish have and actually started to rebound.Egan believes that the future of the Great Lakes does not depend on scientists but on children like his son who still enjoy fishing its waters and invest in its future. My kids and I love swimming in Lake Michigan each summer and have thankfully not stepped on a zebra mussel yet. Whether it is only a matter of time until one of us does or if whitefish have indeed rebounded their population and begun to feast on mussels remains to be seen. It is my hope that Egan's findings have opened more eyes than not so that the Great Lakes as we have known them will still be there to be enjoyed by future generations.4.5 stars"
1,0393355551,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1826682-trish,5,"Egan separates a couple of salient facts by the length of a book, but I here eclipse the space between them:  The Great Lakes are the largest expanse of freshwater in the world.  The Great Lakes are in the midst of a slow-motion ecological catastrophe begun by opening to the St. Lawrence Seaway and the Atlantic.  Freshwater is the world's most precious natural resource.  “The intuition is that a very large lake like this would be slow to respond somehow to climate change. But in fact we’re finding that its particularly sensitive.”After the last election I became laser-focused on Wisconsin. I watched as a traditionally blue state voted red, and kept Governor Scott Walker and Speaker of the House Paul Ryan in office through severe gerrymandering that could not be reversed even by mandate from federal judges. The Wisconsin gerrymandering case was forced to our country’s highest court, and SCOTUS's decision on the fairness of such twisted districts should be heard before the November 2018 election. But decisions made by the severely gerrymandered Republican legislature has been allowed to impact and will continue to impact Lake Michigan’s watershed at a time when it needs urgent attention. A proposed $10 billion investment in Paul Ryan's District #1 by Taiwan's Foxconn, maker of touch screens for the iPad, was inked in 2017. Foxconn will use 7 billion gallons of water from Lake Michigan per day, five billion of which will be used outside and not returned to the lake's watershed area. By the end of Egan's book, contracts like this and that made with Waukesha city, a suburb of Milwaukee and also outside the watershed area, take on far greater meaning. Lake Michigan and the rest of the Great Lakes have been under pressure from invasive species from the Seaway to the north, and from the south through the Sanitary & Ship Canal to the Mississippi. Just when scientists managed to tackle the problems caused by one devastating species, they would encounter another, even more overwhelming, until we arrived where we are now, with toxic algae blooms regularly threatening the water supplies of major cities that use lake water for drinking water.Besides that, we discover the increases in the lake’s winter temperatures means increases in the lake’s summer temperatures, encouraging evaporation and shrinkage of water area. This, along with pollution of existing supplies and inevitable demands from rapidly drying areas of the country who have gone through their aquifers is increasing the pressures on scientists to refresh and preserve this enormously important natural resource. It requires attention and political support, and one fears what would happen should business-influenced politicians force through compromises that have short-term gains for the few and long term consequences for the many.Dan Egan is a reporter at the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel and has been researching and reporting on the Great Lakes for at least a decade. He has done something we rarely encounter: he has made science and history come alive. As I did my own research into the political conditions in Wisconsin, I thought it would be important to learn more about Lake Michigan which plays such an important role in the life and economy of the state but I expected Egan’s book would be struggle to read. Instead I found it completely riveting and hard to put down. When was the last time you said that about a science/geography/history book?A few years ago I read another nonfiction title, Boys in the Boat, by Daniel James Brown that was similarly involving. Although the history of the Washington crew team competing in the 1936 Olympics in Hitler’s Germany is long over, Brown made the book completely propulsive and un-put-down-able. That is the way I feel about Egan's book. One threat to the lakes follows another, and our hearts squeeze as we hear of dangers and disasters in the last couple of years. It feels absolutely critical that we pay attention to the resource--freshwater--scientists have been telling us for half a century is in limited supply and which has everything to do with life on earth.I can’t recommend this title more highly. Egan should definitely be on award lists for this title, and indeed has already scooped a couple. The W.W. Norton paperback came out last month (April 2018) and the Random House Audio production is likewise terrific, narrated by Jason Culp. "

Even if you live thousands of miles away from these North American freshwater marvels, this book makes the case why we should all care about the impacts of invasive species, eutrophication, and the larger issues of climate change and access to fresh water. An unparalleled work of reportage and science writing."
3,0393355551,http://goodreads.com/user/show/28397995-nancy,5,"Dan Egan's book The Death and Life of the Great Lakes was distressing to read. I know these lakes. I have lived near the Great Lakes for almost 50 years. I grew up along the Niagara River and have lived 40 years in Michigan--including seven years living near Lake Michigan, three years so close I heard the sound of the waves day and night. I have seen the lakes die and become reborn and die again. I remember in the 1970s when the water at the base of Niagara Falls foamed with brown-yellow froth from pollution. I remember when shallow Lake Erie was declared dead; the wonder of it's rebirth; now its waters have become poisonous.We have wrecked havoc with the beautiful and perfect ecosystem. We have made decisions based on capital gain, without foresight or thought about our actions' impact on the natural balance. We have altered the landscape to serve our need, heedless of the consequences.We dug canals, opened the Lakes to world-wide shipping, dumped industrial and agricultural waste into their waters. Non-native species, by accident or intent, were brought in and allowed to become established and alter the ecosystem. And in the big picture we have contributed to a climate change that threatens the Lakes as their waters remain warm and ice free in winter, promoting evaporation and lowering lake levels. My husband and son camped in the Upper Peninsula in the late 1990s and early 2000s. They knew the lake levels were dropping. The shipwrecks along the Superior coast between the Hurricane River campground and the Au Sable lighthouse were more exposed every year. The Sitka had been underwater when they first saw it. Later it was exposed. The cold waters of Lake Superior preserved the shipwrecks; exposure will speed their decay.*****Egan's book explains how we got to 'here': a Lake Michigan so devoid of life you can see deep into its waters; a Lake Erie covered in poisonous algae that makes the water undrinkable; lake levels dropping, evaporation increasing. And the whole country itching to get a share of the water. Canada's decisions also impact what happened, or does not happen, to the lakes. Had they closed the 'front door' to allow foriegn ships direct access into the Lakes the introduction of alien species would have been stemmed.The Lakes were a 'closed system', an ecosystem developed and perfected in isolation since the glacial melt created them at the end of the last ice age. In ""The Front Door"" section Egan explains how the St. Lawrence Seaway, the Welland Canal, and even the Erie Canal opened the door to non-native species. The native Lake Trout were killed off by Sea Lampreys. Alewives found their way into the lakes and flourished, replacing native species, Coho and Chinook Salmon were brought in to feed off the Alewives. The Salmon were chosen over restocking native fish because sportsmen preferred them. For a time the Winter Water Wonderland of Michigan offered some of the best fishing around. Then--the Salmon ate all the Alewives and were left starving.The next wave of invaders were the Zebra and Quagga Mussels. Inedible to native fish, they flourished in the lakes and quickly covered everything. Literally. Including the inflow pipes that provided drinking water and water for industry. The costs for controlling the mussels is mind boggling.The second part of the book, ""The Back Door,"" tells how Asian Carp are waiting in the Chicago Canal System to invade Lake Michigan; how mussels were carried from the Great Lakes to invade pristine Western Lakes; and addresses the Toledo Water Crisis, created when the Black Swamp was drained and turned into the lush farmland whose fertilizers are carried into the lake to feed the algae.In Part Three, ""The Future,"" Egan explains how climate change, the bottling of lake water, and the diversion of the water to 'dry' states will impact the future of the Lakes.The final chapter addresses ways to move into a sustainable future for the Great Lakes.America already is facing a water crisis as glacial ground water is used up and changing weather patterns bring drought. It is urgent that we address how to protect our most important resource--the Lakes, which comprise 20% of the world's fresh water--before it is truly too late.Egan's book lays out the history and the problems we have wrought in the past. Can we--will we--preserve and restore the Great Lakes? As a new presidential administration takes over with ties to business and unfriendly to science I fear the Federal Government will not provide support. I received an ARC from the publisher in exchange for a fair and unbiased review."
4,0393355551,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4739465-monica,5,"The Death and Life of the Great Lakes was one of those books that was fascinating and engaging well beyond my expectations. No one was more surprised than me that the history of the Great Lakes would be so captivating. But this was far more than a history book. It's also a bit of an horror story without the inevitability of doom. In an America that finds itself being governed by a President Trump, it isn't a stretch to understand that we have a long history of squandering one of our greatest assets. What has transpired in the history of the Great Lakes is fundamentally about corporate avarice as well as individual hubris and macho individualism and selfishness. Heck, that's the story of America.Egan believes that in the coming years, fresh water will become the world's most precious resource. The Great Lakes are home to 20% of the fresh water supply in the world. We share the Great Lakes with our neighbor to the north, Canada (perhaps that is why there is no talk of building a wall there--oh who am I kidding, the American perception of a Canadian is a white male drinking beer and using the word ""Ay"" at the end of every sentence). Needless to say, as we face an uncertain future with climate change, the maintenance of the Great Lakes becomes paramount. It truly is the most lucrative treasure that we have. So of course we have a deep history of exploitation and greed and general selfishness that has reared its ugly head since their discovery. Funny thing is, that shortsighted stinginess on a massive scale may have been what saved the Great Lakes from an ecological death. History details the discovery of the inland sea. There was a desire to make the metropolitan areas that emerged on the lakes into major ports of call. More opportunity to export and import commerce worldwide to inland cities. Thus became the desire to build a canal from the Atlantic to the Great Lakes. There was a desire to capitalize on this idea much in the same way that the canals enhanced commerce around the world (Suez, Panama etc). This desired represented one of the more successful bilateral country treaties. The expense was beared by the US and Canada and the system would run through both countries. Egan chronicles the development of the various locks and canals (Erie etc) to connect the Atlantic Ocean via the St Lawrence seaways to the Great Lakes. It's win-win!! What could possibly go wrong…? Well for starters, they built the canal to work with 19th century ships of transport. In a word, too small. And the desire to increase the size of the canals were dampened by the incredibly large price tag associated with expansion. So only the smaller ships could make their ways to the Great Lakes so cities like Chicago and Cleveland and Toledo etc, never get to be major ports of call except for trade among other metropolitan cities located on or near the Great Lakes. Ah, but this doesn't stop the callous disregard for the treasure of fresh water. Indeed, entitled Americans and corporations were rife with disdain for their lucre. The cities located on the lakes essentially made them into a giant toilet bowl and trash dump. A situation so pervasive that it gave rise to disease outbreaks in the cities and the rivers that fed the Great Lakes quickly became toxic, flammable trash heaps endangering the health of the population as well as the fish. Back then as well as today, action is predicated upon greed. The commerce in the cities was faltering and the fishing industry suffering and thus was born the Clean Water Act. Shortsightedness was never in short supply, the clean water act did not include the ships coming in from the Atlantic dumping their ballast water, thus begins the alien species invasions. Some of which were horrific. These environmental invasions were by far the most terrifying and overwhelming. The methods of dealing with it included eradication of a species with very targeted poisons to genetic manipulation (which introduces some truly scary ethical considerations) to introducing new alien species to control (see eat) the other invasive species. But controlling an alien invasion wasn't the only reason for introducing new species into the Great Lakes. Native Trout fish don't provide much of a challenge, so in order to attract sport fishing to the Lakes, Chinook Salmon were introduced. They are a far more interesting sport fish and the come with the added bonus of subsisting on an alien species fish. But these man made forms of control obviously and inevitably had unintended consequences…every time. There are tales of sparkling water salesmen and of men trying to sell fresh water (owned by public) to other countries and trying to keep invasive species out of the Great Lakes that have already invaded national water system (carp) and tales of invasive species in the Great Lakes escaping into the national water system (mussels). There are ecological battles being waged daily all over the country that people seem to know little about. Always we are in danger of putting the lakes out of balance and thus frankly the entire country. The most important battle is of course climate change. With the average lake temperatures rising 1.6 F degrees a year translates into less ice which translates into higher water temps which translates into more evaporation and a receding shorelines of the lakes. Though Egan stresses that the Lakes are likely to be around in our lifetimes, he wonders about his children and future generations.For all of these dangers (mostly man-made and ignored until it becomes impossible to do such), Egan presents some optimism. For all of the foibles, the Lakes seem to be adjusting and bouncing back. The eradication of one species saw the resurgence of other native species. The Lakes seem to endure. Egan ends the book by saying that it will be future generations that have to deal with the importance of the Great Lakes. He shows a picture of his young son catching his first trout and hopes that it sparked his interest in preserving the Lakes.This was a fantastic book that richly details the history of the Great Lakes and outlines the historical, political, economic and environmental battles. Frankly I think this is must read stuff for mankind to discover the ecological mess we are making and understanding why we need to care. Egan has written an engaging and interesting masterpiece. A far more enjoyable and surprisingly optimistic and positive read than expected. Recommended for anyone who cares about the Earth!!5 StarsRead on kindle"
5,0393355551,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5364077-connie-g,5,"Dan Egan, a journalist who covers the Great Lakes for the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel, has written a fascinating book about the changes in their ecosystems. The Great Lakes (Lakes Ontario, Erie, Huron, Michigan, and Superior) hold about 20% of the world's freshwater, a precious commodity.For years, the Lakes and their connecting rivers were isolated from invasive species from the Atlantic Ocean by the tremendous force of the Niagara Falls which prevented organisms from moving upstream. The construction of the Erie Canal and the St Lawrence Seaway (bypassing the Falls) permitted shipping barges coming from the Atlantic Ocean to travel through all the Great Lakes. The barges carried ballast water that can be pumped out to adjust for taking on cargo. The ballast water also released invasive species from ports all over the world. The Great Lakes now contain 186 non-native species, including the zebra and quagga mussels from the Black and Caspian Seas. The mussels and other invaders have done severe damage to the ecosystems as well as costing millions of dollars of damage every year.The lakes were also separated from the Mississippi River basin by the subcontinental divide. But the Chicago Sanitary and Ship Canal was built in 1900 to allow sewage to go into the Mississippi River system. This is an opening for non-native species from the Mississippi River system to enter the Great Lakes. There is a worry that gigantic Asian carp from Arkansas may enter the Lakes system from this ""back door"".One of the biggest threats to the drinking water is a blue-green toxic algae in Lake Erie that feeds off phosphorus draining from fertilized farms in the region. Toledo's water supply was shut down for several days in 2014 when the deadly toxin entered the city's water system.Egan discusses water shortages and environmental threats to the water supply in other parts of the United States, and the financial implications in some of the ending chapters. He also writes about policy changes that could help the situation. Egan also recognizes the wonderful recreational value of the Lakes. The book combines science and history with many quotes from scientific experts, fishermen, and government officials. I found ""The Death and Life of the Great Lakes"" to be a well-researched and exceptionally interesting book."
6,0393355551,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8079403-max,4,"Egan traces the environmental decline of the Great Lakes from the pristine waters discovered by early European explorers to the despoiled waters of today. He skims over pollution and focuses on the problem of invasive species. He describes the dramatic changes as one invader after the other finds a home in the Lakes. While some species were able to go upstream in the St. Lawrence River and reach Lake Ontario, none could get past Niagara Falls to the other lakes, that is, until the Erie Canal opened the way in 1825. Larger and deeper canals followed eventually allowing ocean going ships into the lakes where they emptied their ballast water letting in a wide array of creatures from all over the globe. The first invasive species to do serious damage to the Great Lakes native fish was the sea lamprey. Discovered in Lake Erie in 1921 and the upper lakes in the late 1930s the sea lamprey went on to decimate what had been an abundance of the popular lake trout. Biologists however figured out a way to get rid of the lampreys. Poison them and so they did catching the lampreys in their larval stage in rivers and creeks that flowed into the lakes. The next invader was the river herring which became known as the alewife. The alewife, as the lamprey before it, had been in Lake Ontario for over a century but when it reached the lakes above Niagara Falls, it caused real trouble. Lake trout would have kept the small alewives in check but the trout had been largely eliminated by the Sea Lamprey. The alewife population exploded. By 1965 this six inch fish comprised 90% of the fish mass in Lake Michigan. This overpopulation resulted in repeated massive die-offs fouling the lake and beaches.The biologists answered with the introduction of Coho and Chinook salmon in the 1980s which brought about a renaissance for sport fisherman. The renaissance lasted twenty or so years until the alewife population became too diminished to support the salmon. The predator fish took their share of alewives but the alewives suffered from a more sinister problem. The plankton eating alewives had displaced native plankton eaters, but now the alewives lost out to a new invasive competitor. The filter feeding zebra mussel and its even more efficient cousin, the quagga mussel, fed on the alewives plankton. The zebra mussels first discovered in the Great Lakes in the 1980s gained notoriety for coating water intakes and pipelines causing damage that was expensive to repair. But the quagga mussel following in the 1990s would cause far worse damage.The quagga mussels followed their relatives the zebra mussels from the Black Sea. While the zebra mussels had coated hard surfaces on the lake bottom the quagga mussels coated the much more extensive soft areas. The quagga mussels also survived at far greater depths than the zebra mussels and they fed year round not just in the warm months as did the zebra mussels. The quagga mussels became so prevalent and took in so much plankton that the water turned clear. By 2010 plankton had decreased by 90% and visibility through the water more than tripled. This food chain collapse finished off small feeder fish and in turn sport fish. But the new conditions were perfect for the growth of a plant, Cladophora, which soon coated the lake bottoms growing on top of the mussels. Cladophora now had the three things it needed to survive: light at great depths, phosphorus from the excrement of the mussels, and something to attach itself to, the shell of the mussels. When Cladophora eventually died it rotted taking the oxygen out of the water. This fostered the growth of botulism producing bacteria that thrive in low oxygen environments. The mussels took in the botulism. The goby, a small fish and still another invader from the Black Sea, had prospered eating the mussels. But now the gobies succumbed to botulism and died in droves. Seabirds in turn ate the dead gobies and they too suffered large scale die-offs.Egan goes on to examine new threats to the Great Lakes. Perhaps most pressing is that of the Asian bighead and silver carp, both plankton feeders that dominate the food chain in the Mississippi River just as the zebra and quagga mussels do in the Great Lakes. Dumped into tributaries of the Mississippi by experimental biologists in the 1970s, the Asian carp have spread widely eliminating native fish. The Mississippi is not naturally connected to the Great Lakes, but the Chicago Sanitary and Ship Canal takes water from Lake Michigan and sends it to the Mississippi River basin providing a back door for invasive species such as the Asian carp. The federal government spent $318 million from 2009 -2015 to keep the carp out of the Great Lakes. As the threat grows more imminent, efforts are intensifying, but if history is a guide it’s just a matter of time before the new invader gets through. Taking advantage of the flow of the Chicago Sanitary and Ship Canal into the Mississippi, the zebra and quagga mussels have also spread widely into the river basin and even unattached lakes. How does that happen? The mussels attach themselves to boat hulls and people moving their boats carry the mussels to new homes. In 2007 they were found in Lake Mead which supplies water to Las Vegas and within two years they coated the lake bottom. From there they spread down the Colorado River much as they had the Mississippi. Killing and clearing the mussels from water intakes and dam infrastructure is now a significant ongoing expense. Lake Powell in Utah succumbed to the mussels in 2014 despite extensive prevention efforts that required hull inspections and cleaning for boats using the lake. To protect unaffected areas some states in in the West have made it a felony to carry or possess the mussels. The mussels have been labelled the STD of the sea. Another threat to the Great Lakes is the spread of toxic algae blooms that have flourished due to phosphorous laden agricultural runoff, particularly in Lake Erie. The zebra and quagga musses contribute by spitting out the offending algae and consuming the non-toxic algae. The algae produced poison not only inhibits recreational use but threatens water supplies of cities that take their water from Lake Erie. Perhaps a bigger threat long term is the tapping of the Great Lakes by water hungry distant locations. Midwest farmers are draining their aquifers. Cities from Atlanta to New York and many in the West are expanding and depleting their resources. Today state and provincial compacts in the US and Canada restrict water usage to counties that are in the drainage basin of the Great Lakes. But once a severe extended drought hits a major city or farming area the pressure will be intense to pipe the water to bail them out. The Great lakes hold 20% of the world’s fresh surface water. It’s an immense resource and may be the last one readily available as the U. S. and the world run out of fresh water. Egan only touches on this issue which requires a separate book.Of course we can’t forget climate change. Climate Change exacerbates the problem prolonging droughts and altering traditional weather cycles. Climate change also affects the water levels of the Great Lakes. Climate change is causing prolonged stationary weather patterns and they are more extreme. Warm winter patterns mean less winter ice that raise water temperatures and increase evaporation lowering the water level. This was evidenced between 1998 and 2013 when the upper lakes (Michigan, Superior and Huron) reached record low levels. The low levels were also partly due to the increased flow of the St. Clair River which empties the upper lakes into Lake Erie. The St. Clair has been dredged to make way for ever larger ships and its bottom is eroding. Conversely when arctic air swings south over the lakes, it now can persist for a long time increasing the ice which will raise water levels. Such polar vortexes occurred in 2014 and 2015. The new normal is uncertainty about water levels that make managing and planning for those dependent on the Lakes very difficult.One piece of good news is the adaptation of some native fish to their new environment. Lake Whitefish which are bottom feeders without teeth have learned to eat the small gobies and even the mussels. Their bodies have changed over generations particularly their stomachs which can now breakdown the mussel shells. Trout too have adapted to a new diet of gobies. Those species that can evolve quickly enough will survive, but this won’t be the last time they will be challenged. In addition to the back door Chicago Sanitary and Ship Canal invasive species still have an open front door through the canals that allow ocean going ships into the upper Great Lakes. Regulations now require these ships to flush their ballast tanks mid-ocean, but compliance and effectiveness are another thing. Egan does a great job of showing how one degradation leads to another, how the interplay of invasive life in a new environment creates conditions that are difficult to anticipate. He writes in a folksy style and fills his text with interesting bits of history and stories of the people involved that make the text flow fast. His narrative is much warmer than that in this review but the facts presented are not comforting. I have no special interest in the Great Lakes, but I think the story here is important. It is being repeated all over the world. Business interests dominate and environmental interests are ignored until the problem is so severe that correcting it is not feasible or outrageously expensive. Hasty counter-measures can make the problem worse. For those who want to understand the seriousness and complexity of invasive species, Egan’s book is an excellent choice."

They and area lakes and rivers have been repeatedly poisoned for the last couple hundred years, as if water supplies were somehow permanently resilient and endless. They are neither. When I swam in Lake Michigan in the seventies, for a couple summers I had to wade through a sludge of alewives spread across the shoreline. On the other hand, during that time you could never imagine a time in which you could swim in the Chicago-area lakeshore, where I now live, but today many do. I am a huge fan of Rachel Carson. Dan Egan’s award-winning book stands in the same proud tradition of calling attention both to the greed and stupidity of neglecting one of our most precious resources and also the heroism of scientists (can I use that word, 45?!) who have had the ingenuity to time and time again rescue it from that greed and stupidity. Our ambition in opening up the St. Lawrence Seaway and the Chicago ship canal has in the past had disastrous consequences, Egan shows us. What are the problems we now face? Invasive species such as Asian carp, sea lamprey, and zebra mussels have decimated native species and are not just a sport-fishing problem, but actually endanger the entire United States. Algae poisoning caused by over-fertilization and run-off poisoned the water in Toledo in 2004 to the point where no one could drink it. This problem intensifies now, and is not yet solved. We all know about Flint, still drinking water from plastic bottles. Perhaps you know about the water crisis in Cape Town, which runs out of water in less than 90 days. Our heads in the sand will not save it; neither will diverting water to all the other places that no longer have adequate water. The news today is that the snow levels in the US are at a 30 year low. In the already drought-devastated states west of the Rockies, this has serious implications for the immediate and not just the distant future. Climate change is real and heating up the lake, causing unprecedented evaporation.Trump’s plan to gut the Clean Water Act, which is keeping the Great Lakes (and other lakes and rivers), alive, though corporate greed and its attendant rapacious poisoning practices continue and will inevitably increase, thanks to shorts-sighted and ignorant businessmen. http://www.sciencemag.org/news/2017/0...Vote for not only the restoration of the Clean Water Act, but an increase in protections, always. The thing I like about Egan’s book is that while making sure you know the threat of devastation is real, he also shows that we can still do much to save the lakes. Especially if you live near these lakes you should read this or at least some of this book. Necessary!! Joni Mitchell’s “Big Yellow Taxi”https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94bdM..."

I live on Lake Erie, so when I saw the book at the library I picked it up.The Great Lakes are not really lakes, they are inland fresh water seas. If you’ve ever stood on the shore of one, you know what I’m talking about. They are beautiful (yes, even Lake Erie is...now, thanks to the clean water act.) I recently saw Lake Michigan, where it just about meets up with Lake Superior and I was absolutely stunned by the beauty.The fresh water on the surface of the planet is limited... in fact, if you were to put all the fresh water on the planet in gallon jugs, one of every five would be from the Great Lakes. Because of climate change the future of the Great Lakes (our drinking water....water is life) are in danger. They have faced, and are facing, threats. But because the lakes are warming (and they are more sensitive to warming than an ocean is) they are evaporating faster than the water can be replaced. This is bad.I remember when the lake would freeze over entirely every winter. There would be ice fishing (which seems not fun), but that sort of thing hasn’t happened..... at least since a few years ago when we had the super awful arctic blast winter, but that winter was an outlier.I hate winter, but I do love the lakes, and I like having water to drink. But because of the awful people now in control of things, like the clean water act (something Yammy wants to defund and remove....asshole) it’s not bloody likely the lakes will survive.*sigh*"
9,0393355551,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10978428-jim,5,"I read this for a book discussion group--and I'm glad I did. I thought I knew all about the problems facing the Great Lakes, and, after all, I've been living near one of the Lakes most of my life. However, after reading this book by journalist Dan Egan (published in 2017), I realized that there was A LOT I didn't know, and, moreover, the situation is far worse than I thought. The most important fact about the five Great Lakes is that they are beyond value, as they constitute 20% of the accessible freshwater (not including water locked in ice and underground). As the world, and especially the American West, face increasing drought conditions, the water of the Great Lakes only becomes of greater value. Egan points out that the opening of the St. Lawrence Seaway in 1959 has proven to be an ecological catastrophe for the Great Lakes. In 1988, zebra mussels were discovered in Lake St. Clair between Lakes Erie and Huron. These destructive mollusks had spread from the Caspian and Black Seas into Europe by ship. It was surmised that they had entered the Great Lakes by being carried in the ballast tanks of oceangoing ships that had passed through the St. Lawrence Seaway. They rapidly colonized across the Great Lakes. Along with quagga mussels, they have destroyed ecosystems and have caused billions of dollars of damage to water intake pipes, dams, and other infrastructure. As Egan also points out, if the St.Lawrence Seaway is the front door into the Great Lakes, then the Chicago Sanitary and Ship Canal is the back door. And another invader-- ( the Asian carp, and actually there are three species of them)--is threatening to enter the Great Lakes from the Mississippi River basin (into which they were released!). Egan also discusses other threats to the Lakes, such as the toxic algae which threatened Toledo's water supply and global warming's possible effects. And, as a resident of a Great Lakes state, I was angered by plans to build pipelines to siphon out the precious water of the Great Lakes for the parched West...No way. Egan hopes that we are now beginning to realize the indispensability of safe and clean water and that we have to protect what is our most valuable resource--water! And that means saving the Great Lakes."

This book is something else entirely. It's an edge-of-your-seat nail-biting horror experience. There is shock after shock, at an unrelenting pace. It would have been a fun ride if it had been fiction, but this is reality and the facts slam-dunk you into the mud. The story of the ecological collapses of the Great Lakes is devastating reading. The ale wives, the zebra mussels, the quagga mussels, the continuous threat of new invasive species arriving in the ballast water compartments of ocean-going vessels. The threat of species slipping in through the back-door, the canal connecting to the Mississippi river.The man-made disasters of the Great Lakes and their surroundings are numerous and relentless. You'd think lakes that contain 20% of the world's fresh water would be better protected. That somewhere along the line, someone would actually have tried to make smart ecological decisions. But no. Sadly not.This is an incredibly important book. In regards to invasive species, it's the best one I have ever read. In regards to fresh water, it is also one of the best ones I have ever read. The subject - ecological collapse, access to fresh water - will become ever more important as the global warming drives climate change to cause new rain fall patterns and increased drought. Read this book! It's well-written, superbly paced and the terrible facts are presented in an easily digestible manner. I can't say it's fun, but I still didn't want to put the book down. Come on, order it! Reserve a book at the library. Educate yourself. It's rarely been as easy as with this book."
11,0393355551,http://goodreads.com/user/show/30261451-celia,5,"I read this book to satisfy a prompt: a book that scares or intimidates. And did it ever!!For thousands of years, the pristine Great Lakes were separated from the Atlantic by Niagara Falls and the Mississippi River basin by a ""sub-continental divide"". Then man begin to circumvent these barriers. The Erie Canal, the first circumvention, started to allow invasive species into the system. The St Lawrence Seaway continued to allow the invasion. The Chicago Sanitary and Ship Canal routed Chicago's sewage away from the Great Lakes and into the Mississippi River Basin.The description of the unforeseen effects of these great technological advances is chilling. Some of the invasive species are described in horrible detail: the sea lamprey, the quagga mussel and the zebra mussel. The picture of the sea lamprey's mouth is enough to scare you to death. The writing in this book is very vivid and understandable. If you are from one of the 8 Great Lakes states or the 2 Canadian Provinces that border the lakes, I consider this book required reading. This book also describes effects beyond the eight states, so if you live anywhere in the USA, you might read something about your area.I was glued to this book for the duration of the read. Scary, yes. However, the book, in its last section, does show hope for the future. A great read.5 stars"
12,0393355551,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4957858-judith-e,5,"Dan Egan and his excellent book have reinforced the notion that once you've messed with Mother Nature's delicate balance there is a resulting crash like a falling tower of cards. He has spent a lifetime living and writing about the Great Lakes, and he has penned a very readable page turner about man's influence on this and other watersheds.Beginning with the creation of the Erie Canal, Egan explains how the perfect ecosystem of the world's largest body of freshwater was changed and damaged. How each impact was frantically counter-acted by man's attempts to restore the balance. He exposes how the alewive, lamprey, algae stench, zebra mussel, quagga, and salmon disasters came to be and how industrial and fertilizer runoff, dredging, dumping ship ballast and the Chicago Sanitary Canal have had mind-boggling impacts on our water.Recommended to anyone who drinks water."
13,0393355551,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2758455-katy,5,This is an excellent read on the Great Lakes and water in the USA. It is a call to heal our waters before it is too late. 
14,0393355551,http://goodreads.com/user/show/38036772-annie,4,"Until a year ago, I had lived all of my then-22 years of life along the same long, connected body of water. From the shores of Lake Erie in Cleveland to the Saint Lawrence River in Montreal, this watershed is intimately familiar to me, my lifelong companion. And it’s dying. I’ve heard this book compared to Rachel Carson’s Silent Spring, and while I’m wary to jump on board with such a comparison, I don’t think it’s an impossibility. Egan writes with a similar urgency and clarity of purpose. The topic is likewise chilling. Humans have been playing God with ecosystems, introducing species and removing others, for far too long, and it can’t be, won’t be, sustained by the earth.It’s a reminder that, as proud as Clevelanders are of the cleanliness of Lake Erie relative to its status in the first half of the 20th century (when it was so bad that Dr. Seuss wrote a book about it, among other environmental crises: see The Lorax), the health of the lake is not as it appears. Sure, it may lack the intense pollution dumping of yore, and the waters may appear surprisingly clear, but that’s not because the water is healthy but because the water is dead. The microorganisms, the phyto- and zoo-plankton, are all being devastated by the invasive species. The invasive species, in turn, eat all the good algae but spit toxic algae species back out, letting the toxic algae completely overwhelm the good algae species and co-opt all of the available nutrients in the water. It's to the point where toxic algae blooms cover a fifth of Lake Erie, and just swimming in it can cause vomiting, diarrhea, skin blistering, and even liver failure. It also temporarily caused the entire Toledo region to go without water twice.Not to mention the fact that these invasive species aren't just devastating the Great Lakes. What happens in the Great Lakes happens to all of North America, because it's all intricately connected. After invasive species like zebra and quagga mussels were allowed into the Great Lakes (mostly by freshwater ballast water, used to maintain balance in shipping vessels), they eventually made their way as far west as the Hoover Dam, which now must spend millions of dollars removing them constantly in order for the dam to operate. I can’t really recommend this book to everyone- unless you have a deep curiosity concerning, and investment in, the Great Lakes region, or else a passion for reading about invasive aquatic species, you’ll likely find this dry- but for what it is, it’s perfect. "
15,0393355551,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5013497-mark,4,"Okay, what do Asian carp, sea lamprey, homo sapiens, zebra mussels and climate change have in common? They are all destroying the mighty Great Lakes. Ouch! The five Great Lakes are one of the true wonders of the world, but we are continuously throwing wicked curve balls at this amazing water system. A system we all take for granted, much like our great oceans. Dan Egan, a prize winning journalist, lays it all out here: the history, the canal systems, the invasive species, the various battles, which include the losses and recoveries and finally what can be done to restore and revitalize these national treasures.Egan is a fine writer and his narrative flow, is smart and informative. At first, I thought this might be just a grim, painful look at the destruction of the Great Lakes, but Egan balances it out with some humor and a surprising amount of hope. Highly recommended. 4.5 stars"
16,0393355551,http://goodreads.com/user/show/47188780-kathleen,5,"Having lived in four of the eight states sharing a coastline with the five Great Lakes, I have a strong kinship to these beautiful, precious bodies of water. So, it was depressing to read Egan’s heavily researched book detailing the many problems that face the lakes today. The beautiful clear, blue waters of Lake Michigan do not demonstrate its health. Instead, its clarity is due to an invasion of zebra and quagga mussels from bilge water originating from the Caspian Sea, sucking up 90 percent of the lake’s phytoplankton.Unfortunately, these bivalves continue to multiply and invade North American rivers and lakes. Scientists are at a loss as to how to control their damage on the lakes’ ecosystem. They were more successful in combating the lamprey, which devastated the fish population in the 1940s, and then the alewives in the 1950s. The introduction of western salmon fed on the alewives, creating a sport fishing boom as their numbers multiplied. It also triggered interest in the ecological health of the lakes, resulting in the banning of harmful pesticides like DDT. But spectacular salmon fishing fell off as the alewives and phytoplankton populations fell.More bilge water dumps harboring foreign organisms resulted in infestations of spiny water fleas, fishhook water fleas, and bloody red shrimp. Farm land run-off of phosphates feed Lake Erie’s blue-green algae—and the toxic form called microcystis—threatening the drinking water for 11 million people. Climate change has caused a modest increase in the average temperatures of the lakes. But even this small increase has caused the lakes to lose more water to evaporation—both in summer and winter. Pressure to share the lakes’ water with drier communities and states is sure to increase. Highly recommend this most informative book."
17,0393355551,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4280875-booknblues,4,"The Death and Life of the Great Lakes by Dan Egan gives the reader a good picture of the Great Lakes and the troubles which they face today. I was impressed with the research and care which Egan took in writing this book and found it easy to understand for a non-scientist.Egan describes the Great Lakes as seen by the first Europeans as being majestic inland oceans surrounded by pristine forests. He goes on to illustrate their importance in the world today:Most all the water on the planet—some 97 percent—is, of course, saltwater—basically useless to humans as sustenance or for irrigation. The sliver of freshwater left over is mostly locked up in the polar ice caps or trapped so far underground it is inaccessible. This leaves the Great Lakes holding roughly 20 percent of the world’s surface freshwater.Where problems began for the Great Lakes is that man could perfect them for the purpose of more readily bringing goods for import and export directly to the ports within the Lakes by developing an inland waterway. This led to numerous exotic species as lamprey eels, alewives, zebra and quagga mussels, which worked toward the destruction of native species.I found this book fascinating, but realize it may not be for everyone."
18,0393355551,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2994598-blaine-desantis,4,"A very good and highly detailed book that looks at the problems that invasive species have caused in our Great Lakes and what has been done to try and combat these problems. Some interesting issues include the fact that the Erie Canal caused the first invasive species problem, how Chicago destroyed a natural barrier to such species, how the Clean Water Act backfired and caused so many problems due to a loophole that allowed ballast to be dumped into the Lakes, how phosphorus killed Lake Erie and how the drainage of a swamp area in Ohio way back in the 1800's caused a change to the entire eco-system (of course it also make for wonderful farmland which has helped feed our country!) Loaded with facts and information we discover the lamprey, the zebra and quagga mussels, along with the Asian Carp. Both a cautionary tale, as well as a story of the efforts to try and combat the problems that have been created by the invasive species. Might not be for everyone, but I enjoyed huge chunks of this book!"
19,0393355551,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3100250-jeremy,5,"This wonderful and timely book is a great read about a timely subject. The writing is snappy and engaging, and can transform sometimes fairly technical discussions into a captivating study. What emerges clearly from this book is the critical importance of a much more sophisticated public conversation about the health of the Great Lakes at a time where there are proposal to reduce federal funding for crucial ecological restorations by as much as 97%.The Great Lakes have already repeatedly suffered catastrophic environmental damage. Much of this damage can probably never truly be repaired. The Clean Water Act has critical limitations that limit its impact. At the same time, efforts to keep an anemic shipping industry afloat put the fragile green shoots of ecological health at continued risk. In particular, invasive species from ballast water will not be regulated until 2023 (if at all in light of new environmental policies and cuts) and the threat of Asian carp coming through the Chicago canal remains serious. Aside from these two gigantic problems, simply coping with current difficulties is a huge challenge. Simply controlling the lamprey infestation costs twice as much as the Trump administration is budgeting for Great Lakes restoration.Understanding the ecology of the lake, harm that has already been done and the threats ahead are absolutely critical. This book is a major contribution to a informed citizenry around the Lakes, and hopefully, better policy. And not just that, it's an absorbing read. Highly recommended."
20,0393355551,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2118933-leo-walsh,5,"Journalist Dan Egan's The Death and Life of the Great Lakes is a dense, detailed but fascinating look at where I hang my hat, on the shores of Lake Erie, one of the Great Lakes. I lived through much of what Egan writes of here. When I was growing up in the late 70;s and early 80's, Lake Erie had recovered from the algal blooms that had choked it and the nasty pollution that caused the Cuyahoga to burn. Still, I heard about these incidents. Just like I'd heard my father moan about the decline and rebound of his favorite fishing prey, yellow perch and walleye.My father was a traditionalist. taught his kids to fish for classic Great Lakes food species, like perch and walleye. It wasn't until after college that I learned the value of stocked trout. I missed the salmon boom, but still love to plow the rivers during the autumn and mild winter days to catch steelhead trout, which are stocked ""anadromous"" rainbow trout, who spawn in the rivers and grow fat during the summers on the lake. Thing is, I never paid attention to how unnatural that was. Egan makes it clear, detailing the origins of the stocking. In the 50's and 60's, alewives invaded the Great Lakes via the brand-new Saint Lawrence Seaway. At the same time, pollution and another invader, lamprey eels, were killing the lake's native top predator, the lake trout. So to save the fisheries, scientists needed to kill lampreys, which they did, and then establish a predator population to control alewives. Problem was, lake trout were a poor game fish. Like walleye, they provided a poor fight. Great eating, but not ""sporting,"" like the spunky but nasty-tasting native smallmouth. Great Lakes governments wanted to create a sports fishing/ tourism industry, and needed a fish that fought like the smallmouth but was tasty. So they enlisted Howard Tanner, a Michigan-born fisheries biologist who learned his craft managing the near sterile southwestern reservoirs, enhancing their appeal to sports fisherman. Thus empowered. Tanner introduced coho and chinook, who were spectacular fighters, tail walking and stripping line. Those fish feasted on the alewives, controlling their invasion. And sales of fishing boats and equipment caused the desired economic boom. Thing is, the salmon proved too effective at their jobs, and soon the salmon fisheries collapsed. What's more, since they are a managed species, it took funding to keep the ball rolling. Luckily, the native lake trout are rebounding. Freed from the lampreys and foul water, they are re-establishing themselves as the Great Lakes' top predator. Tanner's folly is the sort that makes me laugh. I love stories where bright, well-intentioned people create a brilliant solution to today's problem... that often backfire tomorrow. Which leads to the next solution and backfire. And the next. Regardless, man leaps from success turned failure to success turned failure with no loss of optimism. There's something noble and creative about that, seems to me. Egan also spends considerable pages addressing the Lakes' most pressing problem circa 2017, the zebra and quagga mussel infestation. Like most Great Lakes natives, I'm aware of the problem. It's often on the news, especially when they clog up and important pipe. Still, Egan gives those reports perspective, an often-missing component on contemporary newscasts who deal in the sensational (if it bleeds, it leads), often sacrificing accuracy for dumbed-down ratings. So instead of interviewing an Ohio State scientist, they'll quickly cover the mussel-caused problem, and cut off to cover a tragedy, whether that tragedy is a murder, a drive-by or some other dramatic ""pow."" Egan fills that void, providing substance. What I found most intriguing was the possibility that, as Global Warming increases droughts in the American west, that having fresh water could make the Great Lakes the sunbelt of the latter half of the 21st century. But Egan also made me aware of threats I didn't know existed, Asian bighead and silver carp, invasive species that are heading up the Mississippi towards the Lake Michigan. I also learned that nature created the Great Lakes and Mississippi watersheds as separate, but that Chicago created a sewage and shipping canal, connecting those sheds via the Illinois river... so they could flush their sewage downstream. Typical. NIMBY. And screw your neighbors, like downstream St. Louis. On the fun side, I also learned about a super-funny event called the Redneck Fishing Tournament held on the Illinois River. Where locals exploit the invasive silver carp's propensity to jump several feet into the air when a boat engine spooks them. So the locals gather, swill some beer, and have a tourney. Where, instead of hook and line, they spook the fish, and catch the leaping critters in a landing net.  check out the Redneck Fishing Tournament on YouTube. It's gave me a few chuckles. Recommended for science, history and policy wonks. Five stars."
21,0393355551,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9944598-deb-andrade,5,"Born and bred in the eastern US, I first laid eyes on Lake Michigan in my early 20's. It was in Chicago during my first bona fide business trip after university. Prior to that, my idea of a formidable body of water was the Atlantic Ocean. However, over the next 40 years, Lake Michigan would come to replace the Atlantic as the emotional anchor for this Pisces. I eventually lived and worked next to it, raised two kids who swam in it, and even own a house on an island in the middle of it.Personal connection aside, I believe readers will find the book incredibly relevant. It is an amazing piece of research told in a very accessible way. It's just great story-telling. Start with a pristine closed five lake ecosystem system accounting for 20% of the world's fresh water supply. Add man and his quest for progress, and you get a scientific, political, economic, and environmental suspense story that had me riveted. The revelation of invasive species from Europe being introduced into the Lakes in ballast water from ships coming up the St Lawrence Seaway was a stunner. And somehow, the author made details of alewives, gobies, zebra and quagga mussels, and various fleas, shrimp and algae entertaining. Describing a video from a lab observation, he writes that it shows ""a zebra mussel in an aquarium sucking in a drifting fleck of microcystis (a poisonous algae) and spitting it out with all the vigour of an unsuspecting toddler fed Brussels sprouts."" Cracked me up. One can read this book, shake one's head, and figure we should have left the continent to the native Americans. But I read the book with curiosity and hope, despite the reams of bad decisions and crappy luck that have sent the lakes on a survival roller coaster. The author demonstrated the adaptability of nature - that an ecosystem whacked out of balance kept striving to rebalance itself. The example of the whitefish slowly beginning to use the invasive mussels as food hits close to home for me - whitefish being my favoured lake fish. In the final chapters, the author discusses several interventions to assist the lakes to return to full vitality - like ceasing foreign shipping and introducing genetically engineered fish. Whatever is done in the future, however, should be methodically and carefully considered. A key takeaway for me was the importance of ""letting nature run its course."""
22,0393355551,http://goodreads.com/user/show/350705-carol-evans,5,"I was actually at Lakeside Chautauqua on Lake Erie for a week earlier this summer. I’ve lived in Ohio most of my life and even if we don’t go up to Lake Erie often, it’s still part of our state identity, if that makes sense, which is why The Death and Life of the Great Lakes caught my attention. It’s an interesting book and an easy read, even for a non-history, non-science girl like me. We all know that humans affect the environment, but found it really interesting how a lot of the problems the lakes experience now can really be traced back to the 1800s when the lakes were first opened to the Atlantic Ocean and the Chicago River and onto the Mississippi.Egan does a wonderful job of combining history and science in relating all the lakes have been through and why. He also includes individual’s stories, about what the lake was like when they were young versus today, or how they thought/think that the choices they made were in the best interest of the communities.The last bit was especially interesting looking forward. In that section, Egan’s not talking about the fish or mussels or seaweed, he’s talking about the actual water. The Great Lakes account for 21% of the world’s surface freshwater and about 84% of North America’s. Many people think that the next set of wars will not be over oil but over water. Recently even places as far away as Atlanta have been eyeing the Great Lakes’ water to supplement their own supplies. At the moment, with few exceptions, a county needs to be in the Great Lake basin to utilize the Great Lakes as a source of water, but in the future who knows.I won’t remember many of the details Egan supplied, but I will remember his general points. I would definitely recommend The Death and Life of the Great Lakes, especially for those of us with a connection to the lakes, which is pretty much all of us, one way or another."
23,0393355551,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4916836-gail-baugniet,5,"My first 23 years were spent around, on, or in Lake Michigan, one of the ""best"" of the Great Lakes. How true it is that you don't know what you've got 'til it's gone, as was proved to the fishing industry on this lake. One time the beaches were so polluted with dead alewives, the smell forced everyone to stay away. My dad loved fishing for trout, coho, and chinook salmon. I have been reading about the Great Lakes all my life, so winning this book in a Goodreads Giveaway was better than winning at the casino. This book covers anything and everything we should know about these fresh water lakes. People need to be reminded that there isn't that much fresh water on the globe. Invasive species, algae, engineering, and threats to siphon off the water aren't doing the lakes any good."
24,0393355551,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8783586-michelle,4,"I liked the overall story arc of the book. Egan really brought home the impact of invasive species, the ecology and health of the lakes, water conservation, and all the varied changes we humans have made to the lakes over the past century or two. I was worried at first it would be dry but overall, I enjoyed the book. There were moments when the book goes into detail about a specific fish or mussel and I started to drift off until the author told another story that illustrates why the past several pages matter, and then I was back in. I also spent about half the book looking up articles of events or happenings the book mentions in the library's NYT and Chicago Trib historical databases, which was quite fun!"
25,0393355551,http://goodreads.com/user/show/12120075-pamela-mikita,5,"Well researched and well written. So interesting, but man, what a freaking bummer of a topic. It reminded me of a quote from 20,000 Leagues Under the Sea. “Natures creative power is far beyond mans instinct of destruction.” What a crock. We have been killing those amazing lakes, knowingly, and because of the almighty dollar they will never be the same. Nature has nothing on us Jules Verne! Our entire water systems are being spoiled in one way or another and we happily chug on. I’m glad I’ll be dead when it all fails. Great book!"
26,0393355551,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2717872-tammy,4,"Non-fiction journalism about the history of The Great Lakes and the invasive and native species within. I'm neither a fisherman nor a wildlife biologist, and I found this book to be engaging -- page-turning, in fact -- very accessibly written.I found myself hating humans, admiring nature, and thinking about the Great Lakes almost like a part of the body. If the Great Lakes have an infection, it affects the rest of our country.Again, I am reminded of the importance of maintaining healthy waterways and the urgency of doing so.The food chain in the wild is anything but clear-cut and makes for a fascinating read.Bottom line: If you have any tolerance for reading non-fiction, this is worth reading. I recommend it even more strongly if you rarely have thought about our waterways."
27,0393355551,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2531665-charlene,5,"A few chapters toward the beginning moved a bit too slowly for me, but the rest of the book was great. The first half of the book should have been subtitled: What are Ballasts and How Can They Affect the Health of Lakes and Even Threaten the Lives of Humans? The short and interesting answer is that boats are built with areas that can be filled with water, ballast water, which is taken in upon takeoff and dumped when the boat fills up with cargo. If the water that was taken in the boat comes from an environment that is suitable for salt water species and is dumped in a completely different environment, like the water of the Great Lakes, it can wreak havoc on the eco systems that took a long time to develop in the Great Lakes. In a very short time, that ecosystem can be destroyed and create an environmental crisis. The chapters go into extreme detail about how scientists came to understand that the ballasts were indeed what was ruining the ecosystems, and thus the health of, the Great Lakes. I was very interested in the general picture but felt that there was detail added that actually took detracted from the main message because I felt too bogged down in minute and unnecessary detail that kept stealing my focus. All the detail added up to the fact that ballast water brought in foreign species, mainly through bringing eggs from seawater species and dumping it in the lakes. The EPA thought ballast water harmless and allowed ships to dump their ballast water without having any guidelines. That all changed when researchers made the issues public. To fix the problem, the ballast water had to be bleached to sterilize it and then treated with vitamin C to neutralize it before it could be dumped into the lake. To make up for the over-detail-sharing, the author included a story about how ballast water made a ship wobble until it tipped and sank, killing more passengers than the Titanic. Ballast water is not the only thing that has threatened the health of the Great Lakes. Phosphorus was a huge problem. This is one of the biggest problems with allowing sewage to flow into a body of water. Human urine contains a lot of phosphorus, which poisons lakes. For science lovers, you will really enjoy the story included about how one scientist boiled down buckets of urine to isolate phosphorus and how upon its discovery, was seen as a cure-all. It reminded me a lot of how radium was viewed in society before everyone realized how dangerous it actually was. Climate change is also creating a significant problem for the health of the Great Lakes. At its core, this book read like Rachel Carson's Silent Spring, warning its reader about how different pollutants can affect our most valuable natural resources. It was, at times, shocking how devastatingly fragile the fresh water environment is and it was made very clear how important it is to care for this resource. The book ends with suggestions about how to do just that. We should listen carefully to this warning. "
28,0393355551,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8034370-grady,3,"In his introduction to this book, Egan takes the relatively unusual step of preemptively telling the reader that they’ve probably misunderstood what his book will be about: not the poisoning of the lakes with industrial effluent between 1870 and 1970, followed by a resurrection after enactment of the federal Clean Water Act in 1972. Instead, Egan says,The story of The Death and Life of the Great Lakes takes you beneath the lakes’ shimmering surface and illuminates an ongoing and unparalleled ecological unraveling of what is arguably North America’s most precious natural resource. It’s about how the Great Lakes were resuscitated after a century’s worth of industrial abuse only to be hit with an even more vexing environmental catastrophe.Which is certainly truth in advertising. The book is really a selective history of the havoc wrought by invasive species in the lakes: lamphreys (alewives), chinook salmon, zebra and quagga mussels, gobies, and unnamed fish viruses. He also spends time on the potential for several kinds of carp to invade the lakes from the Mississippi. One chapter throws some attention to the Great Lakes waters wars - the question of whether the current compact will succeed in protecting the lakes from being drained by thirsty communities beyond the basin. Another chapter discusses the toxic algal blooms in Lake Erie that have plagued Toledo, but these are outliers from the book’s main theme.The main policy takeaway from the book is that we ought to close the canals between the St. Lawrence Seaway and the lakes, and between the Mississippi and the lakes. A relatively tiny amount of commerce moves along these channels, and the prospect of introducing another devastating exotic species through either one is high. Any reasonable cost-benefit analysis should support closing off the canals. That thesis is only slightly undermined by recent good news: the manmade alewife/chinook food web that has dominated the lakes for the last fifty years is in the process of collapsing, allowing a resurgence of native fish. Stylewise, Egan’s writing is lively and journalistic. The book was cobbled together (with significant additional research) from his previously-published articles; a minor annoyance is that in several places the seams are showing, with information re-shared as though for the first time. But that is minor, and Egan makes a strong case that we should make greater effort to prevent invasions by exotic species, in the Great Lakes and everywhere else."

The Great lakes contain 1/5 of the fresh water in the world, but how fresh is the water? The history and current day analysis are fully discussed in this book, which in part is a suspense filled “whodunit”. Much of the biological turbulence and natural disorder that has occurred within the Great Lakes was assisted by humans and although their thought process was well intended they did not comprehend the full ramifications of each and every change to the natural habitat and waterway boarders. The problems extend way beyond pollution as today there are close to 200 nonnative organisms living in the Great Lakes including numerous that are invasive originating in Asia and other foreign territories. Now the Great Lakes ecosystem teeters between life support and survival of the fittest.During the 20th Century the water within the Great Lakes became rapidly globalized. My final thoughts led me to ponder beyond the Great Lakes to nature at a higher level, concerning the United Nations human globalization “COEXIST” movement so prevalent today. Diversity is good; however those striving for peace and harmony with unchecked open boarders may too find real danger lurking with severe consequences."

That's kind of surprising considering that I literally live on the shores of Lake Superior. I loved this book AND it scared the crap out of me. I have lived in Michigan my whole life and one of the reasons I decided to live where I do is because of the beauty of the lake and the fact that I can afford to live on the most northern of the Great Lakes. Their health is important to me. The lamprey, the salmon, the Asian carp, the zebra then quagga mussel, the algae blooms, the lake levels, the rising water temperatures all conspire to shift the way the lakes function. The lakes are big, they're resilient, but they're not going to be able to handle everything that gets thrown at them. I felt like it ended on a hopeful note, which I really needed. Not that I'm lulled into thinking everything is OK, but it's nice to know that the lakes have been able to adapt to some of the changes. "

Also covers related changes in the rest of the country, including the Mississippi basin and Lake Mead. Very readable and interesting!Dan Egan is reporter for the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel, focused specifically on the Great Lakes. This book focuses primarily on the ecosystem, from pristine (famed lake trout) to heavily invaded (the ale wife and later quagga mussels) to some form of recovery (white fish evolving for a new food source). He also focuses on the history of canal projects to open up the lakes for commerce, or clean up Chicago sewage.While primarily an American story, the Canadian angle is also mentioned. The politics of multiple states and provinces trying to deal with ecological problems is daunting. Comparing the nuisance cost of porting goods or cleaning boats to the billions spent repairing the damage is shocking. Fresh water is a focus towards the end of the book, including water grabs by Atlanta, California and others. An excellent quote from the book, showing the scale of what we are talking about here:“Roughly 97 percent of the globe’s water is saltwater. Of the 3 percent or so that is freshwater, most is locked up in the polar ice caps or trapped so far underground it is inaccessible. And of the sliver left over that exists as surface freshwater readily available for human use, about 20 percent of that—one out of every five gallons available on the planet—can be found in the Great Lakes.”"

All of us residing and/or working in “The Great Lakes Watershed” should read this book to understand what is happening to our treasured and valuable Great Lakes. Egan describes the impact of international shipping compliments of the opening of the St. Lawrence Seaway in 1959 (front door), the reversal of the Chicago River in 1900 (back door) and the continuous dredging of the St. Clair River. He discusses the myriad problems involved in protecting the lakes with so many competing and varied agendas including those of 8 US States, 1 Canadian Province, USA, Canada, commercial and sport fishermen, shipping vessels, and many more. The stakes are high since the five lakes contain 20% of the world’s fresh water and serves as the main source of water for so many. "

37,0393355551,http://goodreads.com/user/show/16346692-art,5,"“This story picks up after the Cuyahoga River caught fire in 1969,” said Dan Egan, speaking to a surprisingly packed, standing-room-only crowd at Milwaukee’s largest indie bookshop on Friday night. The Cuyahoga River winds through downtown Cleveland before flowing into Lake Erie. Although it caught on fire a dozen times in a hundred years, the blaze of 1969 upset people enough that the incident transformed from an easy joke into the beginning of the Clean Water Act and related environmental action. The Clean Water Act of 1972 reduced the waste going into the lakes. The quick and dramatic recovery since then explains why lakefronts from Milwaukee to Toronto glimmer with sparkling condos and towers, writes Egan.This readable but thorough study of the Great Lakes uses science journalism to investigate invasive species and water diversion. Egan also conveys the vastness of the Great Lakes. Three percent of the world’s water is fresh, and, within that tiny fraction, the Great Lakes hold twenty percent of the world’s surface freshwater, making it an enviable asset for those outside the protected watershed.Going way, way back, these five inland seas trace their history to the Ice Age when glaciers receded about twelve thousand years ago, scouring out their basins. A normal lake ripples and may send a two-foot wave, while any one of the Great Lakes can swell to twenty-five feet. Fast forward to the nineteen fifties when the St Lawrence Seaway opened, which allowed ocean-going vessels to load and unload cargo on the Great Lakes at industrial ports, including Cleveland, Chicago and Milwaukee. What seemed like a good idea at the time brought with it some invasive species that would hitch a ride in the ballast water and make their homes here, away from their natural predators. Alewives, then lampreys and mussels invaded. Almost two hundred nonnative species live in the Great Lakes, according to Egan. The St Lawrence Seaway serves as a front door from the Atlantic Ocean to the Great Lakes for the invading species, while the Chicago River serves as the back door flowing from Lake Michigan, carrying these unwanted creatures to the Mississippi River drainage system, which serves forty percent of the country. Environmental issues occupy two-thirds of the book, while other matters close it out. Water diversion, for example. A Great Lakes water compact serves as a high point of regionalism, said Egan on Friday night. “This is one area where we’ve done everything right.” These governors protect the water and carefully weigh requests from those outside the watershed. While the Great Lakes hold twenty percent of the world’s surface freshwater, twenty percent of the United States population lives in the Great Lakes Megalopolis, stretching from Milwaukee, through Chicago, Detroit, Cleveland and Buffalo as well as Toronto and Montreal. I lived most of my life near Lake Michigan, born and raised in Chicago and now living in Milwaukee twelve blocks from the lake. Dad accepted a job in Cleveland during my high school years, so that made me familiar with Lake Erie. A short foray to Carmel during my nomad years put me a few blocks from the Pacific Ocean, but soon Lake Michigan called me back home. This book celebrates and carefully describes the bounty here and its threats. Pairs well with The Great Lakes Water Wars.

But the situation should be setting off alarm bells for everyone. The stakes are high: there isn't much fresh water in the world, the Great Lakes are the largest system we have, and the lakes are in trouble (for a variety of reasons). We need to take care of the lakes, and we need to do it now. It really is that simple.Dan Egan has written an excellent account of the dire situation the lakes face. Egan is a gifted reporter and stylist, and his story is fascinating and very readable. It's a thoroughly researched and very detailed book -- there's lots of scientific information and historical background. But it's also a very human story, and he shares the stories of many of the people involved and affected by this “slow-motion catastrophe.” And it's that human element that drives his narrative and makes it so affecting. Egan's book is the final result of years of reporting for the Milwaukee JOURNAL SENTINEL. And it sometimes reads like a collection of stories, with occasional awkwardness and rough edges. But for the most part, I thought it came together nicely as a coherent whole. He finds a nice balance between the ecology, history, and reportage. It's a very good book.This is a true reporter's book, and I have enormous respect for the work he has done. I don't want to proselytize on politics or the current state of America, but suffice it to say that Egan's book is a timely reminder of the value of a free and independent media. We should never take that for granted.(Thanks to W. W. Norton for an advance copy in exchange for an impartial review.)"
39,0393355551,http://goodreads.com/user/show/26195174-russ-marcinek,5,"As someone who grew up and lives near Lake Michigan, I found this to be an extraordinary work. Thoroughly researched and written clearly, this is a must read for anyone who loves the Great Lakes. The book details the fragile ecosystem and other challenges of the largest freshwater system in the world. As someone who enjoys the beauty and majesty of the lakes, it is difficult to imagine the struggles that occur under the water. The book begins by explaining that with the construction of the Welland Canal and other inlets, the lakes have become vulnerable to a plethora of invasive species (through fish migration and ballast water) that have altered their course. Sea lampreys, alewives, and muscles are just a few examples. I also found interesting the section about Asian carp and the threat they pose to the lakes. The history behind the Chicago Sanitary and Ship Canal is another topic I found fascinating. There is so much information in this book that it is difficult to summarize in a short space. However, readers will be amazed not only at the incredible ecosystems of the lakes, but also the biology involved and the responses that researchers have had to combat the threats. Additionally, there are also sections on the specific struggles of Lake Erie (algae, pollution) and how the former Great Black Swamp of NW Ohio, SE Michigan, and NE Indiana (and the Maumee River) plays a role. I would highly recommend this book to anyone who is interested in learning about the Great Lakes. It combines history, current events, biology, and regional interests. Coming away from this read, you will realize the awesome power of the lakes, what an incredible resource they are, and what challenges they have faced (and which ones lie ahead)."
40,0393355551,http://goodreads.com/user/show/76921931-sandy,3,"Living a mile from Lake Michigan I am naturally interested in this review of man's interaction with the Lakes. Egan does an excellent job tracing the history of development on and near the Lakes and how this has impacted the Lakes in ways both intended and unintended. I had, of course, heard of zebra mussels and Asian carp, but the history of lampreys, quagga mussels, alewives and even chinook salmon in the Lakes was new and surprising to me. While I sometimes got lost in the science, Egan does not over-do the technical jargon and in general makes the explanations very readable. The ""tinkering"" we have done and continue to do to ""improve"" the Lakes, left me at times amused, at other times horrified. He also does an excellent of job of weaving in the historical context of the various Lake projects. I am glad I read this. It is a well-written and very timely reminder that water is the thing we take most for granted and yet the most vital resource we have. I like that Egan's ultimate conclusion is less hectoring and more hopeful: that if we respect the Lakes and stop trying to bend them to our will they will continue to sustain and delight us in ways both new and old in years to come.

Which it was, and it did. I was kind of in a constant state of panic reading this book as I learned about everything humans have done to destroy the Great Lakes ecosystem. I learned so much about canals and locks, ballast water, marine life and Great Lakes history that I never would have guessed I'd be interested in, but I was.

It has an import focus, rather than export; dealing with what is being introduced into the system of North America's waterways, rather than what is washing out into the seas for the rest of the world to share. It reads like an informative fishing manual or travel guide. It is filled with info about fishing, fish behavior, and commercial and recreational fishing and water sports. It is a positively focused work that presents solutions being utilized today, and hoped for the future.""By 1985 Tanner was busy developing a super strain of salmon he hoped would grow to twice the size of the lake’s trophy chinook. The idea was to heat-shock fertilized chinook eggs in a manner that would give the fish three sets of chromosomes instead of two. The end product would be an adult fish that would never reach sexual maturity, which meant none of its energy had to be wasted on sperm or egg production. Everything would go into growth, and because its biological clock was frozen, the fish would not be shackled to the salmon’s three-year lifecycle, enabling it to grow for up to a decade or longer.""Egan explains carefully the exact systems of canals, in the order they were added. One after another, new exotic species make their way into the Great Lakes, like a dramatic fishing show. The same inventiveness that looked for ways to introduce international shipping into the middle of the continent, and was embraced by both countries, worked to find solutions to each problem as it arose. But by the second half of the book, things become more problematic. The lesson learned is that when man changes nature, his work is not done. He must work to maintain that artifice. His design is never his own permanently. ""...in the ocean these early returners, referred to as “jacks,” are almost always males... the first full class of coho returning by the tens of thousands to their “native” waters. In 1967 Michigan expanded the stocking program to include chinook salmon, similar to coho but substantially bigger.""Many invasive species are described in the most intriguing manner, such as lampreys and zebra mussels. Hatchery raised Salmon are artificially introduced into the Great Lakes, and soon create a fisherman's paradise... for years. The book reveals how individual lives were made, changed, and remade by environmental decisions of the government. Regardless of the decision made in the intervening decades, man seems little qualified to change the course of the seas. “As humans, we always want to be in control, but we can’t control the Great Lakes,” said John Dettmers, a biologist with the Great Lakes Fishery Commission. “We changed it, but we didn’t necessarily control it.” From the St. Lawrence Seaway, to the Welland Canal; Canada has moved in tandem with the USA to divert the waters of the Great Lakes. Both countries will have many issues to resolve in the future with dwindling freshwater supplies in metropolitan areas. The book covers many water supply issues in various places, including Atlanta, Georgia. And, it describes how Chicago accidentally built a superhighway for Great Lakes invasive species to fan out across North America when they 'flushed' their sewage problems into the Mississippi and the Gulf. ""Although the Great Lakes have more than 10,000 miles of shoreline—more than the United States’ Pacific and Atlantic Coasts combined—the region is uniquely positioned to stop biological invasions because of one incredible geographical fact: every overseas freighter that sails up from the East Coast into the lakes must pass through a single pinch point: the first lock on the St. Lawrence Seaway. Put a screen on this door, and your next “fly” problem is solved—for the Great Lakes, and for the whole continent. Yet essentially every day during the Seaway’s nine-month shipping season this door swings open to overseas freighters, and to god-knows-what they might be carrying in their ballast tanks.""I read this book for my stop in Canada on my Journey Around the World in 80 books for 2019. My next stop will be across the 'pond' to Wales. I enjoyed the Kindle format with the not-whisper-synced Audible narrated by Jason Culp. Both formats were very well done and I saw no errors. It was Scientifically accurate and limited itself to the known facts. I highly recommend this in either format for anyone interested in fishing, the Great Lakes, or North America in general. ""The year after The Lorax was published the United States and Canada agreed to work together to throttle the amount of phosphorus pumping into the lake."""
45,0393355551,http://goodreads.com/user/show/61115-kimber,4,"This book is a good basic overview of the history of the Great Lakes, with a heavy emphasis on invasive species that have entered the lakes over the years, or are close enough to the lakes now to be a threat. The reader learns about how the lakes were formed, how locks were created to make the lakes accessible to international freighters, and how this opening up of a previously closed off system allowed invasive species in. A good part of the middle of the book devotes a chapter to each invasive species, how native species of fish nearly died out, and how the populations might recover over time. Toward the end of the book, the changing water levels of the Great Lakes are addressed. I found this part particularly interesting because we are currently experiencing the highest Great Lakes water levels since the 80s – wind and waves are taking a toll on the sand dunes, which are shearing off, making waterfront yards shorter. Some homes have fallen into Lake Michigan.Holland State Park, in my hometown, has a pier that goes out into Lake Michigan, and a concrete boardwalk with a picnic table or two that runs along a channel and out to the pier. This past year during some heavy storms, the wind and waves washed out the sand in that area, and the boardwalk crumbled. The picnic tables that fell have been removed, but the broken boardwalk is still there.This book looks at the ecology of the lakes, and what humans have done to devastate the natural balance. Some of it I knew, but I learned a heck of a lot. The book was published just a few years ago, so the information in it is pretty up to date. I started out reading this book in print, but it was slow going and the delivery is a little dry. I switched to audio and it went along a lot more smoothly.

The history of the Great Lakes is as fascinating as it is troubling. I was expecting the book to be mainly about pollution and climate change. In fact, it takes over half the book to cover all the different invasive species, “biological pollution,” as the author calls them, that have been introduced to the lakes as a result of people either not caring or not thinking about the consequences of their actions as they manipulated nature to suit their interests. To be fair, I don’t think people in the past could have predicted every consequence, but after decades of problems, we should all be learning from past mistakes and doing better. The last chapter offers some small hope, as the author talked about fish evolving and adapting their diets to include mussels. On the other hand, the segment about the daughterless gene project just made me nervous. Hopefully the legal battles mentioned by the author will be won sooner rather then later. I wish I had read this when it was the Go Big Read selection. The book discussions were probably really good. I’ll get my discussion in the online classroom, which should be pretty good too. "

Upsetting, but there are also some glimmers of hope - it's amazing how quickly ecosystems can recover if you just, you know, LEAVE THEM THE F*CK ALONE. This book definitely makes the case for the utter destructiveness of the sport fishing and luxury boating lifestyles of the lakefront wealthy; the idea that you would continually stock the great lakes with nonnative Pacific salmon at the expense of native species, purely due to the preferences of sport fishers (apparently fishing for native trout and walleye is too ""boring"") - I mean. It's infuriating. But there's way, way more here, about invasive species and sewage treatment and canal building and water supply and agriculture and climate change -- Egan shows clearly that the fate of the Great Lakes is the fate of the entire continent.

67,0393355551,http://goodreads.com/user/show/16346692-art,5,"“This story picks up after the Cuyahoga River caught fire in 1969,” said Dan Egan, speaking to a surprisingly packed, standing-room-only crowd at Milwaukee’s largest indie bookshop on Friday night. The Cuyahoga River winds through downtown Cleveland before flowing into Lake Erie. Although it caught on fire a dozen times in a hundred years, the blaze of 1969 upset people enough that the incident transformed from an easy joke into the beginning of the Clean Water Act and related environmental action. The Clean Water Act of 1972 reduced the waste going into the lakes. The quick and dramatic recovery since then explains why lakefronts from Milwaukee to Toronto glimmer with sparkling condos and towers, writes Egan.This readable but thorough study of the Great Lakes uses science journalism to investigate invasive species and water diversion. Egan also conveys the vastness of the Great Lakes. Three percent of the world’s water is fresh, and, within that tiny fraction, the Great Lakes hold twenty percent of the world’s surface freshwater, making it an enviable asset for those outside the protected watershed.Going way, way back, these five inland seas trace their history to the Ice Age when glaciers receded about twelve thousand years ago, scouring out their basins. A normal lake ripples and may send a two-foot wave, while any one of the Great Lakes can swell to twenty-five feet. Fast forward to the nineteen fifties when the St Lawrence Seaway opened, which allowed ocean-going vessels to load and unload cargo on the Great Lakes at industrial ports, including Cleveland, Chicago and Milwaukee. What seemed like a good idea at the time brought with it some invasive species that would hitch a ride in the ballast water and make their homes here, away from their natural predators. Alewives, then lampreys and mussels invaded. Almost two hundred nonnative species live in the Great Lakes, according to Egan. The St Lawrence Seaway serves as a front door from the Atlantic Ocean to the Great Lakes for the invading species, while the Chicago River serves as the back door flowing from Lake Michigan, carrying these unwanted creatures to the Mississippi River drainage system, which serves forty percent of the country. Environmental issues occupy two-thirds of the book, while other matters close it out. Water diversion, for example. A Great Lakes water compact serves as a high point of regionalism, said Egan on Friday night. “This is one area where we’ve done everything right.” These governors protect the water and carefully weigh requests from those outside the watershed. While the Great Lakes hold twenty percent of the world’s surface freshwater, twenty percent of the United States population lives in the Great Lakes Megalopolis, stretching from Milwaukee, through Chicago, Detroit, Cleveland and Buffalo as well as Toronto and Montreal. I lived most of my life near Lake Michigan, born and raised in Chicago and now living in Milwaukee twelve blocks from the lake. Dad accepted a job in Cleveland during my high school years, so that made me familiar with Lake Erie. A short foray to Carmel during my nomad years put me a few blocks from the Pacific Ocean, but soon Lake Michigan called me back home. This book celebrates and carefully describes the bounty here and its threats. Pairs well with The Great Lakes Water Wars.

But the situation should be setting off alarm bells for everyone. The stakes are high: there isn't much fresh water in the world, the Great Lakes are the largest system we have, and the lakes are in trouble (for a variety of reasons). We need to take care of the lakes, and we need to do it now. It really is that simple.Dan Egan has written an excellent account of the dire situation the lakes face. Egan is a gifted reporter and stylist, and his story is fascinating and very readable. It's a thoroughly researched and very detailed book -- there's lots of scientific information and historical background. But it's also a very human story, and he shares the stories of many of the people involved and affected by this “slow-motion catastrophe.” And it's that human element that drives his narrative and makes it so affecting. Egan's book is the final result of years of reporting for the Milwaukee JOURNAL SENTINEL. And it sometimes reads like a collection of stories, with occasional awkwardness and rough edges. But for the most part, I thought it came together nicely as a coherent whole. He finds a nice balance between the ecology, history, and reportage. It's a very good book.This is a true reporter's book, and I have enormous respect for the work he has done. I don't want to proselytize on politics or the current state of America, but suffice it to say that Egan's book is a timely reminder of the value of a free and independent media. We should never take that for granted.(Thanks to W. W. Norton for an advance copy in exchange for an impartial review.)"
69,0393355551,http://goodreads.com/user/show/26195174-russ-marcinek,5,"As someone who grew up and lives near Lake Michigan, I found this to be an extraordinary work. Thoroughly researched and written clearly, this is a must read for anyone who loves the Great Lakes. The book details the fragile ecosystem and other challenges of the largest freshwater system in the world. As someone who enjoys the beauty and majesty of the lakes, it is difficult to imagine the struggles that occur under the water. The book begins by explaining that with the construction of the Welland Canal and other inlets, the lakes have become vulnerable to a plethora of invasive species (through fish migration and ballast water) that have altered their course. Sea lampreys, alewives, and muscles are just a few examples. I also found interesting the section about Asian carp and the threat they pose to the lakes. The history behind the Chicago Sanitary and Ship Canal is another topic I found fascinating. There is so much information in this book that it is difficult to summarize in a short space. However, readers will be amazed not only at the incredible ecosystems of the lakes, but also the biology involved and the responses that researchers have had to combat the threats. Additionally, there are also sections on the specific struggles of Lake Erie (algae, pollution) and how the former Great Black Swamp of NW Ohio, SE Michigan, and NE Indiana (and the Maumee River) plays a role. I would highly recommend this book to anyone who is interested in learning about the Great Lakes. It combines history, current events, biology, and regional interests. Coming away from this read, you will realize the awesome power of the lakes, what an incredible resource they are, and what challenges they have faced (and which ones lie ahead)."
70,0393355551,http://goodreads.com/user/show/76921931-sandy,3,"Living a mile from Lake Michigan I am naturally interested in this review of man's interaction with the Lakes. Egan does an excellent job tracing the history of development on and near the Lakes and how this has impacted the Lakes in ways both intended and unintended. I had, of course, heard of zebra mussels and Asian carp, but the history of lampreys, quagga mussels, alewives and even chinook salmon in the Lakes was new and surprising to me. While I sometimes got lost in the science, Egan does not over-do the technical jargon and in general makes the explanations very readable. The ""tinkering"" we have done and continue to do to ""improve"" the Lakes, left me at times amused, at other times horrified. He also does an excellent of job of weaving in the historical context of the various Lake projects. I am glad I read this. It is a well-written and very timely reminder that water is the thing we take most for granted and yet the most vital resource we have. I like that Egan's ultimate conclusion is less hectoring and more hopeful: that if we respect the Lakes and stop trying to bend them to our will they will continue to sustain and delight us in ways both new and old in years to come.

It has an import focus, rather than export; dealing with what is being introduced into the system of North America's waterways, rather than what is washing out into the seas for the rest of the world to share. It reads like an informative fishing manual or travel guide. It is filled with info about fishing, fish behavior, and commercial and recreational fishing and water sports. It is a positively focused work that presents solutions being utilized today, and hoped for the future.""By 1985 Tanner was busy developing a super strain of salmon he hoped would grow to twice the size of the lake’s trophy chinook. The idea was to heat-shock fertilized chinook eggs in a manner that would give the fish three sets of chromosomes instead of two. The end product would be an adult fish that would never reach sexual maturity, which meant none of its energy had to be wasted on sperm or egg production. Everything would go into growth, and because its biological clock was frozen, the fish would not be shackled to the salmon’s three-year lifecycle, enabling it to grow for up to a decade or longer.""Egan explains carefully the exact systems of canals, in the order they were added. One after another, new exotic species make their way into the Great Lakes, like a dramatic fishing show. The same inventiveness that looked for ways to introduce international shipping into the middle of the continent, and was embraced by both countries, worked to find solutions to each problem as it arose. But by the second half of the book, things become more problematic. The lesson learned is that when man changes nature, his work is not done. He must work to maintain that artifice. His design is never his own permanently. ""...in the ocean these early returners, referred to as “jacks,” are almost always males... the first full class of coho returning by the tens of thousands to their “native” waters. In 1967 Michigan expanded the stocking program to include chinook salmon, similar to coho but substantially bigger.""Many invasive species are described in the most intriguing manner, such as lampreys and zebra mussels. Hatchery raised Salmon are artificially introduced into the Great Lakes, and soon create a fisherman's paradise... for years. The book reveals how individual lives were made, changed, and remade by environmental decisions of the government. Regardless of the decision made in the intervening decades, man seems little qualified to change the course of the seas. “As humans, we always want to be in control, but we can’t control the Great Lakes,” said John Dettmers, a biologist with the Great Lakes Fishery Commission. “We changed it, but we didn’t necessarily control it.” From the St. Lawrence Seaway, to the Welland Canal; Canada has moved in tandem with the USA to divert the waters of the Great Lakes. Both countries will have many issues to resolve in the future with dwindling freshwater supplies in metropolitan areas. The book covers many water supply issues in various places, including Atlanta, Georgia. And, it describes how Chicago accidentally built a superhighway for Great Lakes invasive species to fan out across North America when they 'flushed' their sewage problems into the Mississippi and the Gulf. ""Although the Great Lakes have more than 10,000 miles of shoreline—more than the United States’ Pacific and Atlantic Coasts combined—the region is uniquely positioned to stop biological invasions because of one incredible geographical fact: every overseas freighter that sails up from the East Coast into the lakes must pass through a single pinch point: the first lock on the St. Lawrence Seaway. Put a screen on this door, and your next “fly” problem is solved—for the Great Lakes, and for the whole continent. Yet essentially every day during the Seaway’s nine-month shipping season this door swings open to overseas freighters, and to god-knows-what they might be carrying in their ballast tanks.""I read this book for my stop in Canada on my Journey Around the World in 80 books for 2019. My next stop will be across the 'pond' to Wales. I enjoyed the Kindle format with the not-whisper-synced Audible narrated by Jason Culp. Both formats were very well done and I saw no errors. It was Scientifically accurate and limited itself to the known facts. I highly recommend this in either format for anyone interested in fishing, the Great Lakes, or North America in general. ""The year after The Lorax was published the United States and Canada agreed to work together to throttle the amount of phosphorus pumping into the lake."""
75,0393355551,http://goodreads.com/user/show/61115-kimber,4,"This book is a good basic overview of the history of the Great Lakes, with a heavy emphasis on invasive species that have entered the lakes over the years, or are close enough to the lakes now to be a threat. The reader learns about how the lakes were formed, how locks were created to make the lakes accessible to international freighters, and how this opening up of a previously closed off system allowed invasive species in. A good part of the middle of the book devotes a chapter to each invasive species, how native species of fish nearly died out, and how the populations might recover over time. Toward the end of the book, the changing water levels of the Great Lakes are addressed. I found this part particularly interesting because we are currently experiencing the highest Great Lakes water levels since the 80s – wind and waves are taking a toll on the sand dunes, which are shearing off, making waterfront yards shorter. Some homes have fallen into Lake Michigan.Holland State Park, in my hometown, has a pier that goes out into Lake Michigan, and a concrete boardwalk with a picnic table or two that runs along a channel and out to the pier. This past year during some heavy storms, the wind and waves washed out the sand in that area, and the boardwalk crumbled. The picnic tables that fell have been removed, but the broken boardwalk is still there.This book looks at the ecology of the lakes, and what humans have done to devastate the natural balance. Some of it I knew, but I learned a heck of a lot. The book was published just a few years ago, so the information in it is pretty up to date. I started out reading this book in print, but it was slow going and the delivery is a little dry. I switched to audio and it went along a lot more smoothly.

The history of the Great Lakes is as fascinating as it is troubling. I was expecting the book to be mainly about pollution and climate change. In fact, it takes over half the book to cover all the different invasive species, “biological pollution,” as the author calls them, that have been introduced to the lakes as a result of people either not caring or not thinking about the consequences of their actions as they manipulated nature to suit their interests. To be fair, I don’t think people in the past could have predicted every consequence, but after decades of problems, we should all be learning from past mistakes and doing better. The last chapter offers some small hope, as the author talked about fish evolving and adapting their diets to include mussels. On the other hand, the segment about the daughterless gene project just made me nervous. Hopefully the legal battles mentioned by the author will be won sooner rather then later. I wish I had read this when it was the Go Big Read selection. The book discussions were probably really good. I’ll get my discussion in the online classroom, which should be pretty good too. "

Upsetting, but there are also some glimmers of hope - it's amazing how quickly ecosystems can recover if you just, you know, LEAVE THEM THE F*CK ALONE. This book definitely makes the case for the utter destructiveness of the sport fishing and luxury boating lifestyles of the lakefront wealthy; the idea that you would continually stock the great lakes with nonnative Pacific salmon at the expense of native species, purely due to the preferences of sport fishers (apparently fishing for native trout and walleye is too ""boring"") - I mean. It's infuriating. But there's way, way more here, about invasive species and sewage treatment and canal building and water supply and agriculture and climate change -- Egan shows clearly that the fate of the Great Lakes is the fate of the entire continent.

97,0393355551,http://goodreads.com/user/show/16346692-art,5,"“This story picks up after the Cuyahoga River caught fire in 1969,” said Dan Egan, speaking to a surprisingly packed, standing-room-only crowd at Milwaukee’s largest indie bookshop on Friday night. The Cuyahoga River winds through downtown Cleveland before flowing into Lake Erie. Although it caught on fire a dozen times in a hundred years, the blaze of 1969 upset people enough that the incident transformed from an easy joke into the beginning of the Clean Water Act and related environmental action. The Clean Water Act of 1972 reduced the waste going into the lakes. The quick and dramatic recovery since then explains why lakefronts from Milwaukee to Toronto glimmer with sparkling condos and towers, writes Egan.This readable but thorough study of the Great Lakes uses science journalism to investigate invasive species and water diversion. Egan also conveys the vastness of the Great Lakes. Three percent of the world’s water is fresh, and, within that tiny fraction, the Great Lakes hold twenty percent of the world’s surface freshwater, making it an enviable asset for those outside the protected watershed.Going way, way back, these five inland seas trace their history to the Ice Age when glaciers receded about twelve thousand years ago, scouring out their basins. A normal lake ripples and may send a two-foot wave, while any one of the Great Lakes can swell to twenty-five feet. Fast forward to the nineteen fifties when the St Lawrence Seaway opened, which allowed ocean-going vessels to load and unload cargo on the Great Lakes at industrial ports, including Cleveland, Chicago and Milwaukee. What seemed like a good idea at the time brought with it some invasive species that would hitch a ride in the ballast water and make their homes here, away from their natural predators. Alewives, then lampreys and mussels invaded. Almost two hundred nonnative species live in the Great Lakes, according to Egan. The St Lawrence Seaway serves as a front door from the Atlantic Ocean to the Great Lakes for the invading species, while the Chicago River serves as the back door flowing from Lake Michigan, carrying these unwanted creatures to the Mississippi River drainage system, which serves forty percent of the country. Environmental issues occupy two-thirds of the book, while other matters close it out. Water diversion, for example. A Great Lakes water compact serves as a high point of regionalism, said Egan on Friday night. “This is one area where we’ve done everything right.” These governors protect the water and carefully weigh requests from those outside the watershed. While the Great Lakes hold twenty percent of the world’s surface freshwater, twenty percent of the United States population lives in the Great Lakes Megalopolis, stretching from Milwaukee, through Chicago, Detroit, Cleveland and Buffalo as well as Toronto and Montreal. I lived most of my life near Lake Michigan, born and raised in Chicago and now living in Milwaukee twelve blocks from the lake. Dad accepted a job in Cleveland during my high school years, so that made me familiar with Lake Erie. A short foray to Carmel during my nomad years put me a few blocks from the Pacific Ocean, but soon Lake Michigan called me back home. This book celebrates and carefully describes the bounty here and its threats. Pairs well with The Great Lakes Water Wars.

But the situation should be setting off alarm bells for everyone. The stakes are high: there isn't much fresh water in the world, the Great Lakes are the largest system we have, and the lakes are in trouble (for a variety of reasons). We need to take care of the lakes, and we need to do it now. It really is that simple.Dan Egan has written an excellent account of the dire situation the lakes face. Egan is a gifted reporter and stylist, and his story is fascinating and very readable. It's a thoroughly researched and very detailed book -- there's lots of scientific information and historical background. But it's also a very human story, and he shares the stories of many of the people involved and affected by this “slow-motion catastrophe.” And it's that human element that drives his narrative and makes it so affecting. Egan's book is the final result of years of reporting for the Milwaukee JOURNAL SENTINEL. And it sometimes reads like a collection of stories, with occasional awkwardness and rough edges. But for the most part, I thought it came together nicely as a coherent whole. He finds a nice balance between the ecology, history, and reportage. It's a very good book.This is a true reporter's book, and I have enormous respect for the work he has done. I don't want to proselytize on politics or the current state of America, but suffice it to say that Egan's book is a timely reminder of the value of a free and independent media. We should never take that for granted.(Thanks to W. W. Norton for an advance copy in exchange for an impartial review.)"
99,0393355551,http://goodreads.com/user/show/26195174-russ-marcinek,5,"As someone who grew up and lives near Lake Michigan, I found this to be an extraordinary work. Thoroughly researched and written clearly, this is a must read for anyone who loves the Great Lakes. The book details the fragile ecosystem and other challenges of the largest freshwater system in the world. As someone who enjoys the beauty and majesty of the lakes, it is difficult to imagine the struggles that occur under the water. The book begins by explaining that with the construction of the Welland Canal and other inlets, the lakes have become vulnerable to a plethora of invasive species (through fish migration and ballast water) that have altered their course. Sea lampreys, alewives, and muscles are just a few examples. I also found interesting the section about Asian carp and the threat they pose to the lakes. The history behind the Chicago Sanitary and Ship Canal is another topic I found fascinating. There is so much information in this book that it is difficult to summarize in a short space. However, readers will be amazed not only at the incredible ecosystems of the lakes, but also the biology involved and the responses that researchers have had to combat the threats. Additionally, there are also sections on the specific struggles of Lake Erie (algae, pollution) and how the former Great Black Swamp of NW Ohio, SE Michigan, and NE Indiana (and the Maumee River) plays a role. I would highly recommend this book to anyone who is interested in learning about the Great Lakes. It combines history, current events, biology, and regional interests. Coming away from this read, you will realize the awesome power of the lakes, what an incredible resource they are, and what challenges they have faced (and which ones lie ahead)."
100,0393355551,http://goodreads.com/user/show/76921931-sandy,3,"Living a mile from Lake Michigan I am naturally interested in this review of man's interaction with the Lakes. Egan does an excellent job tracing the history of development on and near the Lakes and how this has impacted the Lakes in ways both intended and unintended. I had, of course, heard of zebra mussels and Asian carp, but the history of lampreys, quagga mussels, alewives and even chinook salmon in the Lakes was new and surprising to me. While I sometimes got lost in the science, Egan does not over-do the technical jargon and in general makes the explanations very readable. The ""tinkering"" we have done and continue to do to ""improve"" the Lakes, left me at times amused, at other times horrified. He also does an excellent of job of weaving in the historical context of the various Lake projects. I am glad I read this. It is a well-written and very timely reminder that water is the thing we take most for granted and yet the most vital resource we have. I like that Egan's ultimate conclusion is less hectoring and more hopeful: that if we respect the Lakes and stop trying to bend them to our will they will continue to sustain and delight us in ways both new and old in years to come. "
101,0393355551,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10878734-katie,4,"I just stumbled across this book while searching for library books and thought, hey, this looks like it could be interesting & teach me something new. Which it was, and it did. I was kind of in a constant state of panic reading this book as I learned about everything humans have done to destroy the Great Lakes ecosystem. I learned so much about canals and locks, ballast water, marine life and Great Lakes history that I never would have guessed I'd be interested in, but I was. Really, really fascinating, if disheartening, read."
102,0393355551,http://goodreads.com/user/show/51900416-becky,3,"Interesting but not exciting. Information packed. It's a tragedy what has been done to our lakes, and will continue to be done, since all is driven by commerce. Hopefully someone will soon realize limited resource means exactly that and will make a change. Growing up around the Great Lakes much of this was a walk down memory lane, but it was shocking to have it all laid out in black and white in a very orderly fashion. A must read, but it's a trudge to absorb it all. "

104,0393355551,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10310364-vicky-hunt,5,"Don't Move a Mussel“When the well is dry, we know the worth of water.”A comprehensive survey of governmental canal engineering plans and the extensive network of canals that connect the waterways of the continent with those of the world; Dan Egan's work is a macro view of the Great Lakes, Canada, and the United States. It has an import focus, rather than export; dealing with what is being introduced into the system of North America's waterways, rather than what is washing out into the seas for the rest of the world to share. It reads like an informative fishing manual or travel guide. It is filled with info about fishing, fish behavior, and commercial and recreational fishing and water sports. It is a positively focused work that presents solutions being utilized today, and hoped for the future.""By 1985 Tanner was busy developing a super strain of salmon he hoped would grow to twice the size of the lake’s trophy chinook. The idea was to heat-shock fertilized chinook eggs in a manner that would give the fish three sets of chromosomes instead of two. The end product would be an adult fish that would never reach sexual maturity, which meant none of its energy had to be wasted on sperm or egg production. Everything would go into growth, and because its biological clock was frozen, the fish would not be shackled to the salmon’s three-year lifecycle, enabling it to grow for up to a decade or longer.""Egan explains carefully the exact systems of canals, in the order they were added. One after another, new exotic species make their way into the Great Lakes, like a dramatic fishing show. The same inventiveness that looked for ways to introduce international shipping into the middle of the continent, and was embraced by both countries, worked to find solutions to each problem as it arose. But by the second half of the book, things become more problematic. The lesson learned is that when man changes nature, his work is not done. He must work to maintain that artifice. His design is never his own permanently. ""...in the ocean these early returners, referred to as “jacks,” are almost always males... the first full class of coho returning by the tens of thousands to their “native” waters. In 1967 Michigan expanded the stocking program to include chinook salmon, similar to coho but substantially bigger.""Many invasive species are described in the most intriguing manner, such as lampreys and zebra mussels. Hatchery raised Salmon are artificially introduced into the Great Lakes, and soon create a fisherman's paradise... for years. The book reveals how individual lives were made, changed, and remade by environmental decisions of the government. Regardless of the decision made in the intervening decades, man seems little qualified to change the course of the seas. “As humans, we always want to be in control, but we can’t control the Great Lakes,” said John Dettmers, a biologist with the Great Lakes Fishery Commission. “We changed it, but we didn’t necessarily control it.” From the St. Lawrence Seaway, to the Welland Canal; Canada has moved in tandem with the USA to divert the waters of the Great Lakes. Both countries will have many issues to resolve in the future with dwindling freshwater supplies in metropolitan areas. The book covers many water supply issues in various places, including Atlanta, Georgia. And, it describes how Chicago accidentally built a superhighway for Great Lakes invasive species to fan out across North America when they 'flushed' their sewage problems into the Mississippi and the Gulf. ""Although the Great Lakes have more than 10,000 miles of shoreline—more than the United States’ Pacific and Atlantic Coasts combined—the region is uniquely positioned to stop biological invasions because of one incredible geographical fact: every overseas freighter that sails up from the East Coast into the lakes must pass through a single pinch point: the first lock on the St. Lawrence Seaway. Put a screen on this door, and your next “fly” problem is solved—for the Great Lakes, and for the whole continent. Yet essentially every day during the Seaway’s nine-month shipping season this door swings open to overseas freighters, and to god-knows-what they might be carrying in their ballast tanks.""I read this book for my stop in Canada on my Journey Around the World in 80 books for 2019. My next stop will be across the 'pond' to Wales. I enjoyed the Kindle format with the not-whisper-synced Audible narrated by Jason Culp. Both formats were very well done and I saw no errors. It was Scientifically accurate and limited itself to the known facts. I highly recommend this in either format for anyone interested in fishing, the Great Lakes, or North America in general. ""The year after The Lorax was published the United States and Canada agreed to work together to throttle the amount of phosphorus pumping into the lake."""
105,0393355551,http://goodreads.com/user/show/61115-kimber,4,"This book is a good basic overview of the history of the Great Lakes, with a heavy emphasis on invasive species that have entered the lakes over the years, or are close enough to the lakes now to be a threat. The reader learns about how the lakes were formed, how locks were created to make the lakes accessible to international freighters, and how this opening up of a previously closed off system allowed invasive species in. A good part of the middle of the book devotes a chapter to each invasive species, how native species of fish nearly died out, and how the populations might recover over time. Toward the end of the book, the changing water levels of the Great Lakes are addressed. I found this part particularly interesting because we are currently experiencing the highest Great Lakes water levels since the 80s – wind and waves are taking a toll on the sand dunes, which are shearing off, making waterfront yards shorter. Some homes have fallen into Lake Michigan.Holland State Park, in my hometown, has a pier that goes out into Lake Michigan, and a concrete boardwalk with a picnic table or two that runs along a channel and out to the pier. This past year during some heavy storms, the wind and waves washed out the sand in that area, and the boardwalk crumbled. The picnic tables that fell have been removed, but the broken boardwalk is still there.This book looks at the ecology of the lakes, and what humans have done to devastate the natural balance. Some of it I knew, but I learned a heck of a lot. The book was published just a few years ago, so the information in it is pretty up to date. I started out reading this book in print, but it was slow going and the delivery is a little dry. I switched to audio and it went along a lot more smoothly. If you are looking for a basic overview of the history and ecology of the Great Lakes, this is a great book."
106,0393355551,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4449127-emily,5,"Well, my list of worries is longer now, but I’m glad I read this. It was well written, and I learned a lot. The history of the Great Lakes is as fascinating as it is troubling. I was expecting the book to be mainly about pollution and climate change. In fact, it takes over half the book to cover all the different invasive species, “biological pollution,” as the author calls them, that have been introduced to the lakes as a result of people either not caring or not thinking about the consequences of their actions as they manipulated nature to suit their interests. To be fair, I don’t think people in the past could have predicted every consequence, but after decades of problems, we should all be learning from past mistakes and doing better. The last chapter offers some small hope, as the author talked about fish evolving and adapting their diets to include mussels. On the other hand, the segment about the daughterless gene project just made me nervous. Hopefully the legal battles mentioned by the author will be won sooner rather then later. I wish I had read this when it was the Go Big Read selection. The book discussions were probably really good. I’ll get my discussion in the online classroom, which should be pretty good too. "
107,0393355551,http://goodreads.com/user/show/46988975-leigh,5,"So good. Upsetting, but there are also some glimmers of hope - it's amazing how quickly ecosystems can recover if you just, you know, LEAVE THEM THE F*CK ALONE. This book definitely makes the case for the utter destructiveness of the sport fishing and luxury boating lifestyles of the lakefront wealthy; the idea that you would continually stock the great lakes with nonnative Pacific salmon at the expense of native species, purely due to the preferences of sport fishers (apparently fishing for native trout and walleye is too ""boring"") - I mean. It's infuriating. But there's way, way more here, about invasive species and sewage treatment and canal building and water supply and agriculture and climate change -- Egan shows clearly that the fate of the Great Lakes is the fate of the entire continent. Worth a read for everyone, especially if you, like me, have come to love these amazing bodies of water."

This book provides an interesting history and geography of the Great Lakes region and so much I never knew about the complexity of the water system and all the variables affecting the lakes.

I have lived in Michigan my whole life and one of the reasons I decided to live where I do is because of the beauty of the lake and the fact that I can afford to live on the most northern of the Great Lakes. Their health is important to me. The lamprey, the salmon, the Asian carp, the zebra then quagga mussel, the algae blooms, the lake levels, the rising water temperatures all conspire to shift the way the lakes function. The lakes are big, they're resilient, but they're not going to be able to handle everything that gets thrown at them. I felt like it ended on a hopeful note, which I really needed. Not that I'm lulled into thinking everything is OK, but it's nice to know that the lakes have been able to adapt to some of the changes. "

Also covers related changes in the rest of the country, including the Mississippi basin and Lake Mead. Very readable and interesting!Dan Egan is reporter for the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel, focused specifically on the Great Lakes. This book focuses primarily on the ecosystem, from pristine (famed lake trout) to heavily invaded (the ale wife and later quagga mussels) to some form of recovery (white fish evolving for a new food source). He also focuses on the history of canal projects to open up the lakes for commerce, or clean up Chicago sewage.While primarily an American story, the Canadian angle is also mentioned. The politics of multiple states and provinces trying to deal with ecological problems is daunting. Comparing the nuisance cost of porting goods or cleaning boats to the billions spent repairing the damage is shocking. Fresh water is a focus towards the end of the book, including water grabs by Atlanta, California and others. An excellent quote from the book, showing the scale of what we are talking about here:“Roughly 97 percent of the globe’s water is saltwater. Of the 3 percent or so that is freshwater, most is locked up in the polar ice caps or trapped so far underground it is inaccessible. And of the sliver left over that exists as surface freshwater readily available for human use, about 20 percent of that—one out of every five gallons available on the planet—can be found in the Great Lakes.”"

All of us residing and/or working in “The Great Lakes Watershed” should read this book to understand what is happening to our treasured and valuable Great Lakes. Egan describes the impact of international shipping compliments of the opening of the St. Lawrence Seaway in 1959 (front door), the reversal of the Chicago River in 1900 (back door) and the continuous dredging of the St. Clair River. He discusses the myriad problems involved in protecting the lakes with so many competing and varied agendas including those of 8 US States, 1 Canadian Province, USA, Canada, commercial and sport fishermen, shipping vessels, and many more.

The Cuyahoga River winds through downtown Cleveland before flowing into Lake Erie. Although it caught on fire a dozen times in a hundred years, the blaze of 1969 upset people enough that the incident transformed from an easy joke into the beginning of the Clean Water Act and related environmental action. The Clean Water Act of 1972 reduced the waste going into the lakes. The quick and dramatic recovery since then explains why lakefronts from Milwaukee to Toronto glimmer with sparkling condos and towers, writes Egan.This readable but thorough study of the Great Lakes uses science journalism to investigate invasive species and water diversion. Egan also conveys the vastness of the Great Lakes. Three percent of the world’s water is fresh, and, within that tiny fraction, the Great Lakes hold twenty percent of the world’s surface freshwater, making it an enviable asset for those outside the protected watershed.Going way, way back, these five inland seas trace their history to the Ice Age when glaciers receded about twelve thousand years ago, scouring out their basins. A normal lake ripples and may send a two-foot wave, while any one of the Great Lakes can swell to twenty-five feet. Fast forward to the nineteen fifties when the St Lawrence Seaway opened, which allowed ocean-going vessels to load and unload cargo on the Great Lakes at industrial ports, including Cleveland, Chicago and Milwaukee. What seemed like a good idea at the time brought with it some invasive species that would hitch a ride in the ballast water and make their homes here, away from their natural predators. Alewives, then lampreys and mussels invaded. Almost two hundred nonnative species live in the Great Lakes, according to Egan. The St Lawrence Seaway serves as a front door from the Atlantic Ocean to the Great Lakes for the invading species, while the Chicago River serves as the back door flowing from Lake Michigan, carrying these unwanted creatures to the Mississippi River drainage system, which serves forty percent of the country. Environmental issues occupy two-thirds of the book, while other matters close it out. Water diversion, for example. A Great Lakes water compact serves as a high point of regionalism, said Egan on Friday night. “This is one area where we’ve done everything right.” These governors protect the water and carefully weigh requests from those outside the watershed. While the Great Lakes hold twenty percent of the world’s surface freshwater, twenty percent of the United States population lives in the Great Lakes Megalopolis, stretching from Milwaukee, through Chicago, Detroit, Cleveland and Buffalo as well as Toronto and Montreal. I lived most of my life near Lake Michigan, born and raised in Chicago and now living in Milwaukee twelve blocks from the lake. Dad accepted a job in Cleveland during my high school years, so that made me familiar with Lake Erie. A short foray to Carmel during my nomad years put me a few blocks from the Pacific Ocean, but soon Lake Michigan called me back home. This book celebrates and carefully describes the bounty here and its threats. Pairs well with The Great Lakes Water Wars.

But the situation should be setting off alarm bells for everyone. The stakes are high: there isn't much fresh water in the world, the Great Lakes are the largest system we have, and the lakes are in trouble (for a variety of reasons). We need to take care of the lakes, and we need to do it now. It really is that simple.Dan Egan has written an excellent account of the dire situation the lakes face. Egan is a gifted reporter and stylist, and his story is fascinating and very readable. It's a thoroughly researched and very detailed book -- there's lots of scientific information and historical background. But it's also a very human story, and he shares the stories of many of the people involved and affected by this “slow-motion catastrophe.” And it's that human element that drives his narrative and makes it so affecting. Egan's book is the final result of years of reporting for the Milwaukee JOURNAL SENTINEL. And it sometimes reads like a collection of stories, with occasional awkwardness and rough edges. But for the most part, I thought it came together nicely as a coherent whole. He finds a nice balance between the ecology, history, and reportage. It's a very good book.This is a true reporter's book, and I have enormous respect for the work he has done. I don't want to proselytize on politics or the current state of America, but suffice it to say that Egan's book is a timely reminder of the value of a free and independent media. We should never take that for granted.(Thanks to W. W. Norton for an advance copy in exchange for an impartial review.)"
129,0393355551,http://goodreads.com/user/show/26195174-russ-marcinek,5,"As someone who grew up and lives near Lake Michigan, I found this to be an extraordinary work. Thoroughly researched and written clearly, this is a must read for anyone who loves the Great Lakes. The book details the fragile ecosystem and other challenges of the largest freshwater system in the world. As someone who enjoys the beauty and majesty of the lakes, it is difficult to imagine the struggles that occur under the water. The book begins by explaining that with the construction of the Welland Canal and other inlets, the lakes have become vulnerable to a plethora of invasive species (through fish migration and ballast water) that have altered their course. Sea lampreys, alewives, and muscles are just a few examples. I also found interesting the section about Asian carp and the threat they pose to the lakes. The history behind the Chicago Sanitary and Ship Canal is another topic I found fascinating. There is so much information in this book that it is difficult to summarize in a short space. However, readers will be amazed not only at the incredible ecosystems of the lakes, but also the biology involved and the responses that researchers have had to combat the threats. Additionally, there are also sections on the specific struggles of Lake Erie (algae, pollution) and how the former Great Black Swamp of NW Ohio, SE Michigan, and NE Indiana (and the Maumee River) plays a role. I would highly recommend this book to anyone who is interested in learning about the Great Lakes. It combines history, current events, biology, and regional interests. Coming away from this read, you will realize the awesome power of the lakes, what an incredible resource they are, and what challenges they have faced (and which ones lie ahead)."
130,0393355551,http://goodreads.com/user/show/76921931-sandy,3,"Living a mile from Lake Michigan I am naturally interested in this review of man's interaction with the Lakes. Egan does an excellent job tracing the history of development on and near the Lakes and how this has impacted the Lakes in ways both intended and unintended. I had, of course, heard of zebra mussels and Asian carp, but the history of lampreys, quagga mussels, alewives and even chinook salmon in the Lakes was new and surprising to me. While I sometimes got lost in the science, Egan does not over-do the technical jargon and in general makes the explanations very readable. The ""tinkering"" we have done and continue to do to ""improve"" the Lakes, left me at times amused, at other times horrified. He also does an excellent of job of weaving in the historical context of the various Lake projects. I am glad I read this. It is a well-written and very timely reminder that water is the thing we take most for granted and yet the most vital resource we have. I like that Egan's ultimate conclusion is less hectoring and more hopeful: that if we respect the Lakes and stop trying to bend them to our will they will continue to sustain and delight us in ways both new and old in years to come. "
131,0393355551,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10878734-katie,4,"I just stumbled across this book while searching for library books and thought, hey, this looks like it could be interesting & teach me something new. Which it was, and it did. I was kind of in a constant state of panic reading this book as I learned about everything humans have done to destroy the Great Lakes ecosystem. I learned so much about canals and locks, ballast water, marine life and Great Lakes history that I never would have guessed I'd be interested in, but I was. Really, really fascinating, if disheartening, read."
132,0393355551,http://goodreads.com/user/show/51900416-becky,3,"Interesting but not exciting. Information packed. It's a tragedy what has been done to our lakes, and will continue to be done, since all is driven by commerce. Hopefully someone will soon realize limited resource means exactly that and will make a change. Growing up around the Great Lakes much of this was a walk down memory lane, but it was shocking to have it all laid out in black and white in a very orderly fashion. A must read, but it's a trudge to absorb it all. "
133,0393355551,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2842947-hapzydeco,4,"This complex, well researched, somewhat technical expose on the Great Lakes needs to be read by our congressional representatives for the environmental health of this nation. A rereading of Rachel Carson's Silent Spring would also be appropriate."
134,0393355551,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10310364-vicky-hunt,5,"Don't Move a Mussel“When the well is dry, we know the worth of water.”A comprehensive survey of governmental canal engineering plans and the extensive network of canals that connect the waterways of the continent with those of the world; Dan Egan's work is a macro view of the Great Lakes, Canada, and the United States. It has an import focus, rather than export; dealing with what is being introduced into the system of North America's waterways, rather than what is washing out into the seas for the rest of the world to share. It reads like an informative fishing manual or travel guide. It is filled with info about fishing, fish behavior, and commercial and recreational fishing and water sports. It is a positively focused work that presents solutions being utilized today, and hoped for the future.""By 1985 Tanner was busy developing a super strain of salmon he hoped would grow to twice the size of the lake’s trophy chinook. The idea was to heat-shock fertilized chinook eggs in a manner that would give the fish three sets of chromosomes instead of two. The end product would be an adult fish that would never reach sexual maturity, which meant none of its energy had to be wasted on sperm or egg production. Everything would go into growth, and because its biological clock was frozen, the fish would not be shackled to the salmon’s three-year lifecycle, enabling it to grow for up to a decade or longer.""Egan explains carefully the exact systems of canals, in the order they were added. One after another, new exotic species make their way into the Great Lakes, like a dramatic fishing show. The same inventiveness that looked for ways to introduce international shipping into the middle of the continent, and was embraced by both countries, worked to find solutions to each problem as it arose. But by the second half of the book, things become more problematic. The lesson learned is that when man changes nature, his work is not done. He must work to maintain that artifice. His design is never his own permanently. ""...in the ocean these early returners, referred to as “jacks,” are almost always males... the first full class of coho returning by the tens of thousands to their “native” waters. In 1967 Michigan expanded the stocking program to include chinook salmon, similar to coho but substantially bigger.""Many invasive species are described in the most intriguing manner, such as lampreys and zebra mussels. Hatchery raised Salmon are artificially introduced into the Great Lakes, and soon create a fisherman's paradise... for years. The book reveals how individual lives were made, changed, and remade by environmental decisions of the government. Regardless of the decision made in the intervening decades, man seems little qualified to change the course of the seas. “As humans, we always want to be in control, but we can’t control the Great Lakes,” said John Dettmers, a biologist with the Great Lakes Fishery Commission. “We changed it, but we didn’t necessarily control it.” From the St. Lawrence Seaway, to the Welland Canal; Canada has moved in tandem with the USA to divert the waters of the Great Lakes. Both countries will have many issues to resolve in the future with dwindling freshwater supplies in metropolitan areas. The book covers many water supply issues in various places, including Atlanta, Georgia. And, it describes how Chicago accidentally built a superhighway for Great Lakes invasive species to fan out across North America when they 'flushed' their sewage problems into the Mississippi and the Gulf. ""Although the Great Lakes have more than 10,000 miles of shoreline—more than the United States’ Pacific and Atlantic Coasts combined—the region is uniquely positioned to stop biological invasions because of one incredible geographical fact: every overseas freighter that sails up from the East Coast into the lakes must pass through a single pinch point: the first lock on the St. Lawrence Seaway. Put a screen on this door, and your next “fly” problem is solved—for the Great Lakes, and for the whole continent. Yet essentially every day during the Seaway’s nine-month shipping season this door swings open to overseas freighters, and to god-knows-what they might be carrying in their ballast tanks.""I read this book for my stop in Canada on my Journey Around the World in 80 books for 2019. My next stop will be across the 'pond' to Wales. I enjoyed the Kindle format with the not-whisper-synced Audible narrated by Jason Culp. Both formats were very well done and I saw no errors. It was Scientifically accurate and limited itself to the known facts. I highly recommend this in either format for anyone interested in fishing, the Great Lakes, or North America in general. ""The year after The Lorax was published the United States and Canada agreed to work together to throttle the amount of phosphorus pumping into the lake."""
135,0393355551,http://goodreads.com/user/show/61115-kimber,4,"This book is a good basic overview of the history of the Great Lakes, with a heavy emphasis on invasive species that have entered the lakes over the years, or are close enough to the lakes now to be a threat. The reader learns about how the lakes were formed, how locks were created to make the lakes accessible to international freighters, and how this opening up of a previously closed off system allowed invasive species in. A good part of the middle of the book devotes a chapter to each invasive species, how native species of fish nearly died out, and how the populations might recover over time. Toward the end of the book, the changing water levels of the Great Lakes are addressed. I found this part particularly interesting because we are currently experiencing the highest Great Lakes water levels since the 80s – wind and waves are taking a toll on the sand dunes, which are shearing off, making waterfront yards shorter. Some homes have fallen into Lake Michigan.Holland State Park, in my hometown, has a pier that goes out into Lake Michigan, and a concrete boardwalk with a picnic table or two that runs along a channel and out to the pier. This past year during some heavy storms, the wind and waves washed out the sand in that area, and the boardwalk crumbled. The picnic tables that fell have been removed, but the broken boardwalk is still there.This book looks at the ecology of the lakes, and what humans have done to devastate the natural balance. Some of it I knew, but I learned a heck of a lot. The book was published just a few years ago, so the information in it is pretty up to date. I started out reading this book in print, but it was slow going and the delivery is a little dry. I switched to audio and it went along a lot more smoothly. If you are looking for a basic overview of the history and ecology of the Great Lakes, this is a great book."
136,0393355551,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4449127-emily,5,"Well, my list of worries is longer now, but I’m glad I read this. It was well written, and I learned a lot. The history of the Great Lakes is as fascinating as it is troubling. I was expecting the book to be mainly about pollution and climate change. In fact, it takes over half the book to cover all the different invasive species, “biological pollution,” as the author calls them, that have been introduced to the lakes as a result of people either not caring or not thinking about the consequences of their actions as they manipulated nature to suit their interests. To be fair, I don’t think people in the past could have predicted every consequence, but after decades of problems, we should all be learning from past mistakes and doing better. The last chapter offers some small hope, as the author talked about fish evolving and adapting their diets to include mussels. On the other hand, the segment about the daughterless gene project just made me nervous. Hopefully the legal battles mentioned by the author will be won sooner rather then later. I wish I had read this when it was the Go Big Read selection. The book discussions were probably really good. I’ll get my discussion in the online classroom, which should be pretty good too. "
137,0393355551,http://goodreads.com/user/show/46988975-leigh,5,"So good. Upsetting, but there are also some glimmers of hope - it's amazing how quickly ecosystems can recover if you just, you know, LEAVE THEM THE F*CK ALONE. This book definitely makes the case for the utter destructiveness of the sport fishing and luxury boating lifestyles of the lakefront wealthy; the idea that you would continually stock the great lakes with nonnative Pacific salmon at the expense of native species, purely due to the preferences of sport fishers (apparently fishing for native trout and walleye is too ""boring"") - I mean. It's infuriating. But there's way, way more here, about invasive species and sewage treatment and canal building and water supply and agriculture and climate change -- Egan shows clearly that the fate of the Great Lakes is the fate of the entire continent. Worth a read for everyone, especially if you, like me, have come to love these amazing bodies of water."
138,0393355551,http://goodreads.com/user/show/24829130-tara,5,"Having spent the majority of my life living near Lake Erie in the greater Toledo and Cleveland areas and having my tap water come from Lake Erie, having grown up hearing about zebra and quagga mussels and Asian carp but never paying enough attention to learn why they were news, and having spent a summer stockpiling water for my parents in case the Toledo water crisis dragged on and they couldn’t find enough water locally, I found this book incredibly compelling. This book provides an interesting history and geography of the Great Lakes region and so much I never knew about the complexity of the water system and all the variables affecting the lakes. Also I can’t believe a book that had so much to say about fish and fishing was this good."

I learned so much in just a few hours! Why is Chicago where it is? Why the fires on Lake Erie were only a very minor aspect of environmental pollution. How climate change, just in this decade, has both raised and lowered lake elevation by 3 feet in one year.Such an enjoyable and meaningful book!"

I’m a little embarrassed that I’d never thought much about the Great Lakes prior to reading this book, even though I’ve been to two of them and lived in Wisconsin for 24 years.

Death and Life of the Great Lakes provoked an excellent discussion. The group pointed out so many issues and ideas in the book that I hadn't spent much time considering because I was so busy worrying about Asian carp and toxic algae blooms. Everyone present for the book club has lived and traveled in the Great Lakes in the US and Canada and thought we knew all there is to know.

That's kind of surprising considering that I literally live on the shores of Lake Superior. I loved this book AND it scared the crap out of me. I have lived in Michigan my whole life and one of the reasons I decided to live where I do is because of the beauty of the lake and the fact that I can afford to live on the most northern of the Great Lakes. Their health is important to me. The lamprey, the salmon, the Asian carp, the zebra then quagga mussel, the algae blooms, the lake levels, the rising water temperatures all conspire to shift the way the lakes function. The lakes are big, they're resilient, but they're not going to be able to handle everything that gets thrown at them. I felt like it ended on a hopeful note, which I really needed. Not that I'm lulled into thinking everything is OK, but it's nice to know that the lakes have been able to adapt to some of the changes. "

Also covers related changes in the rest of the country, including the Mississippi basin and Lake Mead. Very readable and interesting!Dan Egan is reporter for the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel, focused specifically on the Great Lakes. This book focuses primarily on the ecosystem, from pristine (famed lake trout) to heavily invaded (the ale wife and later quagga mussels) to some form of recovery (white fish evolving for a new food source). He also focuses on the history of canal projects to open up the lakes for commerce, or clean up Chicago sewage.While primarily an American story, the Canadian angle is also mentioned. The politics of multiple states and provinces trying to deal with ecological problems is daunting. Comparing the nuisance cost of porting goods or cleaning boats to the billions spent repairing the damage is shocking. Fresh water is a focus towards the end of the book, including water grabs by Atlanta, California and others. An excellent quote from the book, showing the scale of what we are talking about here:“Roughly 97 percent of the globe’s water is saltwater. Of the 3 percent or so that is freshwater, most is locked up in the polar ice caps or trapped so far underground it is inaccessible. And of the sliver left over that exists as surface freshwater readily available for human use, about 20 percent of that—one out of every five gallons available on the planet—can be found in the Great Lakes.”"

All of us residing and/or working in “The Great Lakes Watershed” should read this book to understand what is happening to our treasured and valuable Great Lakes. Egan describes the impact of international shipping compliments of the opening of the St. Lawrence Seaway in 1959 (front door), the reversal of the Chicago River in 1900 (back door) and the continuous dredging of the St. Clair River. He discusses the myriad problems involved in protecting the lakes with so many competing and varied agendas including those of 8 US States, 1 Canadian Province, USA, Canada, commercial and sport fishermen, shipping vessels, and many more. The stakes are high since the five lakes contain 20% of the world’s fresh water and serves as the main source of water for so many. "

157,0393355551,http://goodreads.com/user/show/16346692-art,5,"“This story picks up after the Cuyahoga River caught fire in 1969,” said Dan Egan, speaking to a surprisingly packed, standing-room-only crowd at Milwaukee’s largest indie bookshop on Friday night. The Cuyahoga River winds through downtown Cleveland before flowing into Lake Erie. Although it caught on fire a dozen times in a hundred years, the blaze of 1969 upset people enough that the incident transformed from an easy joke into the beginning of the Clean Water Act and related environmental action. The Clean Water Act of 1972 reduced the waste going into the lakes. The quick and dramatic recovery since then explains why lakefronts from Milwaukee to Toronto glimmer with sparkling condos and towers, writes Egan.This readable but thorough study of the Great Lakes uses science journalism to investigate invasive species and water diversion. Egan also conveys the vastness of the Great Lakes. Three percent of the world’s water is fresh, and, within that tiny fraction, the Great Lakes hold twenty percent of the world’s surface freshwater, making it an enviable asset for those outside the protected watershed.Going way, way back, these five inland seas trace their history to the Ice Age when glaciers receded about twelve thousand years ago, scouring out their basins. A normal lake ripples and may send a two-foot wave, while any one of the Great Lakes can swell to twenty-five feet. Fast forward to the nineteen fifties when the St Lawrence Seaway opened, which allowed ocean-going vessels to load and unload cargo on the Great Lakes at industrial ports, including Cleveland, Chicago and Milwaukee. What seemed like a good idea at the time brought with it some invasive species that would hitch a ride in the ballast water and make their homes here, away from their natural predators. Alewives, then lampreys and mussels invaded. Almost two hundred nonnative species live in the Great Lakes, according to Egan. The St Lawrence Seaway serves as a front door from the Atlantic Ocean to the Great Lakes for the invading species, while the Chicago River serves as the back door flowing from Lake Michigan, carrying these unwanted creatures to the Mississippi River drainage system, which serves forty percent of the country. Environmental issues occupy two-thirds of the book, while other matters close it out. Water diversion, for example. A Great Lakes water compact serves as a high point of regionalism, said Egan on Friday night. “This is one area where we’ve done everything right.” These governors protect the water and carefully weigh requests from those outside the watershed. While the Great Lakes hold twenty percent of the world’s surface freshwater, twenty percent of the United States population lives in the Great Lakes Megalopolis, stretching from Milwaukee, through Chicago, Detroit, Cleveland and Buffalo as well as Toronto and Montreal. I lived most of my life near Lake Michigan, born and raised in Chicago and now living in Milwaukee twelve blocks from the lake. Dad accepted a job in Cleveland during my high school years, so that made me familiar with Lake Erie. A short foray to Carmel during my nomad years put me a few blocks from the Pacific Ocean, but soon Lake Michigan called me back home. This book celebrates and carefully describes the bounty here and its threats. Pairs well with The Great Lakes Water Wars.

But the situation should be setting off alarm bells for everyone. The stakes are high: there isn't much fresh water in the world, the Great Lakes are the largest system we have, and the lakes are in trouble (for a variety of reasons). We need to take care of the lakes, and we need to do it now. It really is that simple.Dan Egan has written an excellent account of the dire situation the lakes face. Egan is a gifted reporter and stylist, and his story is fascinating and very readable. It's a thoroughly researched and very detailed book -- there's lots of scientific information and historical background. But it's also a very human story, and he shares the stories of many of the people involved and affected by this “slow-motion catastrophe.” And it's that human element that drives his narrative and makes it so affecting. Egan's book is the final result of years of reporting for the Milwaukee JOURNAL SENTINEL. And it sometimes reads like a collection of stories, with occasional awkwardness and rough edges. But for the most part, I thought it came together nicely as a coherent whole. He finds a nice balance between the ecology, history, and reportage. It's a very good book.This is a true reporter's book, and I have enormous respect for the work he has done. I don't want to proselytize on politics or the current state of America, but suffice it to say that Egan's book is a timely reminder of the value of a free and independent media. We should never take that for granted.(Thanks to W. W. Norton for an advance copy in exchange for an impartial review.)"
159,0393355551,http://goodreads.com/user/show/26195174-russ-marcinek,5,"As someone who grew up and lives near Lake Michigan, I found this to be an extraordinary work. Thoroughly researched and written clearly, this is a must read for anyone who loves the Great Lakes. The book details the fragile ecosystem and other challenges of the largest freshwater system in the world. As someone who enjoys the beauty and majesty of the lakes, it is difficult to imagine the struggles that occur under the water. The book begins by explaining that with the construction of the Welland Canal and other inlets, the lakes have become vulnerable to a plethora of invasive species (through fish migration and ballast water) that have altered their course. Sea lampreys, alewives, and muscles are just a few examples. I also found interesting the section about Asian carp and the threat they pose to the lakes. The history behind the Chicago Sanitary and Ship Canal is another topic I found fascinating. There is so much information in this book that it is difficult to summarize in a short space. However, readers will be amazed not only at the incredible ecosystems of the lakes, but also the biology involved and the responses that researchers have had to combat the threats. Additionally, there are also sections on the specific struggles of Lake Erie (algae, pollution) and how the former Great Black Swamp of NW Ohio, SE Michigan, and NE Indiana (and the Maumee River) plays a role. I would highly recommend this book to anyone who is interested in learning about the Great Lakes. It combines history, current events, biology, and regional interests. Coming away from this read, you will realize the awesome power of the lakes, what an incredible resource they are, and what challenges they have faced (and which ones lie ahead)."
160,0393355551,http://goodreads.com/user/show/76921931-sandy,3,"Living a mile from Lake Michigan I am naturally interested in this review of man's interaction with the Lakes. Egan does an excellent job tracing the history of development on and near the Lakes and how this has impacted the Lakes in ways both intended and unintended. I had, of course, heard of zebra mussels and Asian carp, but the history of lampreys, quagga mussels, alewives and even chinook salmon in the Lakes was new and surprising to me. While I sometimes got lost in the science, Egan does not over-do the technical jargon and in general makes the explanations very readable. The ""tinkering"" we have done and continue to do to ""improve"" the Lakes, left me at times amused, at other times horrified. He also does an excellent of job of weaving in the historical context of the various Lake projects. I am glad I read this. It is a well-written and very timely reminder that water is the thing we take most for granted and yet the most vital resource we have. I like that Egan's ultimate conclusion is less hectoring and more hopeful: that if we respect the Lakes and stop trying to bend them to our will they will continue to sustain and delight us in ways both new and old in years to come.

164,0393355551,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10310364-vicky-hunt,5,"Don't Move a Mussel“When the well is dry, we know the worth of water.”A comprehensive survey of governmental canal engineering plans and the extensive network of canals that connect the waterways of the continent with those of the world; Dan Egan's work is a macro view of the Great Lakes, Canada, and the United States. It has an import focus, rather than export; dealing with what is being introduced into the system of North America's waterways, rather than what is washing out into the seas for the rest of the world to share. It reads like an informative fishing manual or travel guide. It is filled with info about fishing, fish behavior, and commercial and recreational fishing and water sports. It is a positively focused work that presents solutions being utilized today, and hoped for the future.""By 1985 Tanner was busy developing a super strain of salmon he hoped would grow to twice the size of the lake’s trophy chinook. The idea was to heat-shock fertilized chinook eggs in a manner that would give the fish three sets of chromosomes instead of two. The end product would be an adult fish that would never reach sexual maturity, which meant none of its energy had to be wasted on sperm or egg production. Everything would go into growth, and because its biological clock was frozen, the fish would not be shackled to the salmon’s three-year lifecycle, enabling it to grow for up to a decade or longer.""Egan explains carefully the exact systems of canals, in the order they were added. One after another, new exotic species make their way into the Great Lakes, like a dramatic fishing show. The same inventiveness that looked for ways to introduce international shipping into the middle of the continent, and was embraced by both countries, worked to find solutions to each problem as it arose. But by the second half of the book, things become more problematic. The lesson learned is that when man changes nature, his work is not done. He must work to maintain that artifice. His design is never his own permanently. ""...in the ocean these early returners, referred to as “jacks,” are almost always males... the first full class of coho returning by the tens of thousands to their “native” waters. In 1967 Michigan expanded the stocking program to include chinook salmon, similar to coho but substantially bigger.""Many invasive species are described in the most intriguing manner, such as lampreys and zebra mussels. Hatchery raised Salmon are artificially introduced into the Great Lakes, and soon create a fisherman's paradise... for years. The book reveals how individual lives were made, changed, and remade by environmental decisions of the government. Regardless of the decision made in the intervening decades, man seems little qualified to change the course of the seas. “As humans, we always want to be in control, but we can’t control the Great Lakes,” said John Dettmers, a biologist with the Great Lakes Fishery Commission. “We changed it, but we didn’t necessarily control it.” From the St. Lawrence Seaway, to the Welland Canal; Canada has moved in tandem with the USA to divert the waters of the Great Lakes. Both countries will have many issues to resolve in the future with dwindling freshwater supplies in metropolitan areas. The book covers many water supply issues in various places, including Atlanta, Georgia. And, it describes how Chicago accidentally built a superhighway for Great Lakes invasive species to fan out across North America when they 'flushed' their sewage problems into the Mississippi and the Gulf. ""Although the Great Lakes have more than 10,000 miles of shoreline—more than the United States’ Pacific and Atlantic Coasts combined—the region is uniquely positioned to stop biological invasions because of one incredible geographical fact: every overseas freighter that sails up from the East Coast into the lakes must pass through a single pinch point: the first lock on the St. Lawrence Seaway. Put a screen on this door, and your next “fly” problem is solved—for the Great Lakes, and for the whole continent. Yet essentially every day during the Seaway’s nine-month shipping season this door swings open to overseas freighters, and to god-knows-what they might be carrying in their ballast tanks.""I read this book for my stop in Canada on my Journey Around the World in 80 books for 2019. My next stop will be across the 'pond' to Wales. I enjoyed the Kindle format with the not-whisper-synced Audible narrated by Jason Culp. Both formats were very well done and I saw no errors. It was Scientifically accurate and limited itself to the known facts. I highly recommend this in either format for anyone interested in fishing, the Great Lakes, or North America in general. ""The year after The Lorax was published the United States and Canada agreed to work together to throttle the amount of phosphorus pumping into the lake."""
165,0393355551,http://goodreads.com/user/show/61115-kimber,4,"This book is a good basic overview of the history of the Great Lakes, with a heavy emphasis on invasive species that have entered the lakes over the years, or are close enough to the lakes now to be a threat. The reader learns about how the lakes were formed, how locks were created to make the lakes accessible to international freighters, and how this opening up of a previously closed off system allowed invasive species in. A good part of the middle of the book devotes a chapter to each invasive species, how native species of fish nearly died out, and how the populations might recover over time. Toward the end of the book, the changing water levels of the Great Lakes are addressed. I found this part particularly interesting because we are currently experiencing the highest Great Lakes water levels since the 80s – wind and waves are taking a toll on the sand dunes, which are shearing off, making waterfront yards shorter. Some homes have fallen into Lake Michigan.Holland State Park, in my hometown, has a pier that goes out into Lake Michigan, and a concrete boardwalk with a picnic table or two that runs along a channel and out to the pier. This past year during some heavy storms, the wind and waves washed out the sand in that area, and the boardwalk crumbled. The picnic tables that fell have been removed, but the broken boardwalk is still there.This book looks at the ecology of the lakes, and what humans have done to devastate the natural balance. Some of it I knew, but I learned a heck of a lot. The book was published just a few years ago, so the information in it is pretty up to date. I started out reading this book in print, but it was slow going and the delivery is a little dry. I switched to audio and it went along a lot more smoothly. If you are looking for a basic overview of the history and ecology of the Great Lakes, this is a great book."
166,0393355551,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4449127-emily,5,"Well, my list of worries is longer now, but I’m glad I read this. It was well written, and I learned a lot. The history of the Great Lakes is as fascinating as it is troubling. I was expecting the book to be mainly about pollution and climate change. In fact, it takes over half the book to cover all the different invasive species, “biological pollution,” as the author calls them, that have been introduced to the lakes as a result of people either not caring or not thinking about the consequences of their actions as they manipulated nature to suit their interests. To be fair, I don’t think people in the past could have predicted every consequence, but after decades of problems, we should all be learning from past mistakes and doing better. The last chapter offers some small hope, as the author talked about fish evolving and adapting their diets to include mussels. On the other hand, the segment about the daughterless gene project just made me nervous. Hopefully the legal battles mentioned by the author will be won sooner rather then later. I wish I had read this when it was the Go Big Read selection. The book discussions were probably really good. I’ll get my discussion in the online classroom, which should be pretty good too. "

Upsetting, but there are also some glimmers of hope - it's amazing how quickly ecosystems can recover if you just, you know, LEAVE THEM THE F*CK ALONE. This book definitely makes the case for the utter destructiveness of the sport fishing and luxury boating lifestyles of the lakefront wealthy; the idea that you would continually stock the great lakes with nonnative Pacific salmon at the expense of native species, purely due to the preferences of sport fishers (apparently fishing for native trout and walleye is too ""boring"") - I mean. It's infuriating. But there's way, way more here, about invasive species and sewage treatment and canal building and water supply and agriculture and climate change -- Egan shows clearly that the fate of the Great Lakes is the fate of the entire continent. Worth a read for everyone, especially if you, like me, have come to love these amazing bodies of water."

This book provides an interesting history and geography of the Great Lakes region and so much I never knew about the complexity of the water system and all the variables affecting the lakes.

I have lived in Michigan my whole life and one of the reasons I decided to live where I do is because of the beauty of the lake and the fact that I can afford to live on the most northern of the Great Lakes. Their health is important to me. The lamprey, the salmon, the Asian carp, the zebra then quagga mussel, the algae blooms, the lake levels, the rising water temperatures all conspire to shift the way the lakes function. The lakes are big, they're resilient, but they're not going to be able to handle everything that gets thrown at them. I felt like it ended on a hopeful note, which I really needed.

Also covers related changes in the rest of the country, including the Mississippi basin and Lake Mead. Very readable and interesting!Dan Egan is reporter for the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel, focused specifically on the Great Lakes. This book focuses primarily on the ecosystem, from pristine (famed lake trout) to heavily invaded (the ale wife and later quagga mussels) to some form of recovery (white fish evolving for a new food source). He also focuses on the history of canal projects to open up the lakes for commerce, or clean up Chicago sewage.While primarily an American story, the Canadian angle is also mentioned. The politics of multiple states and provinces trying to deal with ecological problems is daunting. Comparing the nuisance cost of porting goods or cleaning boats to the billions spent repairing the damage is shocking. Fresh water is a focus towards the end of the book, including water grabs by Atlanta, California and others. An excellent quote from the book, showing the scale of what we are talking about here:“Roughly 97 percent of the globe’s water is saltwater. Of the 3 percent or so that is freshwater, most is locked up in the polar ice caps or trapped so far underground it is inaccessible. And of the sliver left over that exists as surface freshwater readily available for human use, about 20 percent of that—one out of every five gallons available on the planet—can be found in the Great Lakes.”"

All of us residing and/or working in “The Great Lakes Watershed” should read this book to understand what is happening to our treasured and valuable Great Lakes. Egan describes the impact of international shipping compliments of the opening of the St. Lawrence Seaway in 1959 (front door), the reversal of the Chicago River in 1900 (back door) and the continuous dredging of the St. Clair River. He discusses the myriad problems involved in protecting the lakes with so many competing and varied agendas including those of 8 US States, 1 Canadian Province, USA, Canada, commercial and sport fishermen, shipping vessels, and many more. The stakes are high since the five lakes contain 20% of the world’s fresh water and serves as the main source of water for so many. "

The Cuyahoga River winds through downtown Cleveland before flowing into Lake Erie. Although it caught on fire a dozen times in a hundred years, the blaze of 1969 upset people enough that the incident transformed from an easy joke into the beginning of the Clean Water Act and related environmental action. The Clean Water Act of 1972 reduced the waste going into the lakes. The quick and dramatic recovery since then explains why lakefronts from Milwaukee to Toronto glimmer with sparkling condos and towers, writes Egan.This readable but thorough study of the Great Lakes uses science journalism to investigate invasive species and water diversion. Egan also conveys the vastness of the Great Lakes. Three percent of the world’s water is fresh, and, within that tiny fraction, the Great Lakes hold twenty percent of the world’s surface freshwater, making it an enviable asset for those outside the protected watershed.Going way, way back, these five inland seas trace their history to the Ice Age when glaciers receded about twelve thousand years ago, scouring out their basins. A normal lake ripples and may send a two-foot wave, while any one of the Great Lakes can swell to twenty-five feet. Fast forward to the nineteen fifties when the St Lawrence Seaway opened, which allowed ocean-going vessels to load and unload cargo on the Great Lakes at industrial ports, including Cleveland, Chicago and Milwaukee. What seemed like a good idea at the time brought with it some invasive species that would hitch a ride in the ballast water and make their homes here, away from their natural predators. Alewives, then lampreys and mussels invaded. Almost two hundred nonnative species live in the Great Lakes, according to Egan. The St Lawrence Seaway serves as a front door from the Atlantic Ocean to the Great Lakes for the invading species, while the Chicago River serves as the back door flowing from Lake Michigan, carrying these unwanted creatures to the Mississippi River drainage system, which serves forty percent of the country. Environmental issues occupy two-thirds of the book, while other matters close it out. Water diversion, for example. A Great Lakes water compact serves as a high point of regionalism, said Egan on Friday night. “This is one area where we’ve done everything right.” These governors protect the water and carefully weigh requests from those outside the watershed. While the Great Lakes hold twenty percent of the world’s surface freshwater, twenty percent of the United States population lives in the Great Lakes Megalopolis, stretching from Milwaukee, through Chicago, Detroit, Cleveland and Buffalo as well as Toronto and Montreal. I lived most of my life near Lake Michigan, born and raised in Chicago and now living in Milwaukee twelve blocks from the lake. Dad accepted a job in Cleveland during my high school years, so that made me familiar with Lake Erie. A short foray to Carmel during my nomad years put me a few blocks from the Pacific Ocean, but soon Lake Michigan called me back home. This book celebrates and carefully describes the bounty here and its threats. Pairs well with The Great Lakes Water Wars.

But the situation should be setting off alarm bells for everyone. The stakes are high: there isn't much fresh water in the world, the Great Lakes are the largest system we have, and the lakes are in trouble (for a variety of reasons). We need to take care of the lakes, and we need to do it now. It really is that simple.Dan Egan has written an excellent account of the dire situation the lakes face. Egan is a gifted reporter and stylist, and his story is fascinating and very readable. It's a thoroughly researched and very detailed book -- there's lots of scientific information and historical background. But it's also a very human story, and he shares the stories of many of the people involved and affected by this “slow-motion catastrophe.” And it's that human element that drives his narrative and makes it so affecting. Egan's book is the final result of years of reporting for the Milwaukee JOURNAL SENTINEL. And it sometimes reads like a collection of stories, with occasional awkwardness and rough edges. But for the most part, I thought it came together nicely as a coherent whole. He finds a nice balance between the ecology, history, and reportage. It's a very good book.This is a true reporter's book, and I have enormous respect for the work he has done. I don't want to proselytize on politics or the current state of America, but suffice it to say that Egan's book is a timely reminder of the value of a free and independent media. We should never take that for granted.(Thanks to W. W. Norton for an advance copy in exchange for an impartial review.)"

Thoroughly researched and written clearly, this is a must read for anyone who loves the Great Lakes. The book details the fragile ecosystem and other challenges of the largest freshwater system in the world. As someone who enjoys the beauty and majesty of the lakes, it is difficult to imagine the struggles that occur under the water. The book begins by explaining that with the construction of the Welland Canal and other inlets, the lakes have become vulnerable to a plethora of invasive species (through fish migration and ballast water) that have altered their course. Sea lampreys, alewives, and muscles are just a few examples. I also found interesting the section about Asian carp and the threat they pose to the lakes. The history behind the Chicago Sanitary and Ship Canal is another topic I found fascinating. There is so much information in this book that it is difficult to summarize in a short space. However, readers will be amazed not only at the incredible ecosystems of the lakes, but also the biology involved and the responses that researchers have had to combat the threats. Additionally, there are also sections on the specific struggles of Lake Erie (algae, pollution) and how the former Great Black Swamp of NW Ohio, SE Michigan, and NE Indiana (and the Maumee River) plays a role. I would highly recommend this book to anyone who is interested in learning about the Great Lakes. It combines history, current events, biology, and regional interests. Coming away from this read, you will realize the awesome power of the lakes, what an incredible resource they are, and what challenges they have faced (and which ones lie ahead)."

I had, of course, heard of zebra mussels and Asian carp, but the history of lampreys, quagga mussels, alewives and even chinook salmon in the Lakes was new and surprising to me. While I sometimes got lost in the science, Egan does not over-do the technical jargon and in general makes the explanations very readable. The ""tinkering"" we have done and continue to do to ""improve"" the Lakes, left me at times amused, at other times horrified. He also does an excellent of job of weaving in the historical context of the various Lake projects. I am glad I read this. It is a well-written and very timely reminder that water is the thing we take most for granted and yet the most vital resource we have.

It has an import focus, rather than export; dealing with what is being introduced into the system of North America's waterways, rather than what is washing out into the seas for the rest of the world to share. It reads like an informative fishing manual or travel guide. It is filled with info about fishing, fish behavior, and commercial and recreational fishing and water sports. It is a positively focused work that presents solutions being utilized today, and hoped for the future.""By 1985 Tanner was busy developing a super strain of salmon he hoped would grow to twice the size of the lake’s trophy chinook. The idea was to heat-shock fertilized chinook eggs in a manner that would give the fish three sets of chromosomes instead of two. The end product would be an adult fish that would never reach sexual maturity, which meant none of its energy had to be wasted on sperm or egg production. Everything would go into growth, and because its biological clock was frozen, the fish would not be shackled to the salmon’s three-year lifecycle, enabling it to grow for up to a decade or longer.""Egan explains carefully the exact systems of canals, in the order they were added. One after another, new exotic species make their way into the Great Lakes, like a dramatic fishing show. The same inventiveness that looked for ways to introduce international shipping into the middle of the continent, and was embraced by both countries, worked to find solutions to each problem as it arose. But by the second half of the book, things become more problematic. The lesson learned is that when man changes nature, his work is not done. He must work to maintain that artifice. His design is never his own permanently. ""...in the ocean these early returners, referred to as “jacks,” are almost always males... the first full class of coho returning by the tens of thousands to their “native” waters. In 1967 Michigan expanded the stocking program to include chinook salmon, similar to coho but substantially bigger.""Many invasive species are described in the most intriguing manner, such as lampreys and zebra mussels. Hatchery raised Salmon are artificially introduced into the Great Lakes, and soon create a fisherman's paradise... for years. The book reveals how individual lives were made, changed, and remade by environmental decisions of the government. Regardless of the decision made in the intervening decades, man seems little qualified to change the course of the seas. “As humans, we always want to be in control, but we can’t control the Great Lakes,” said John Dettmers, a biologist with the Great Lakes Fishery Commission. “We changed it, but we didn’t necessarily control it.” From the St. Lawrence Seaway, to the Welland Canal; Canada has moved in tandem with the USA to divert the waters of the Great Lakes. Both countries will have many issues to resolve in the future with dwindling freshwater supplies in metropolitan areas. The book covers many water supply issues in various places, including Atlanta, Georgia. And, it describes how Chicago accidentally built a superhighway for Great Lakes invasive species to fan out across North America when they 'flushed' their sewage problems into the Mississippi and the Gulf. ""Although the Great Lakes have more than 10,000 miles of shoreline—more than the United States’ Pacific and Atlantic Coasts combined—the region is uniquely positioned to stop biological invasions because of one incredible geographical fact: every overseas freighter that sails up from the East Coast into the lakes must pass through a single pinch point: the first lock on the St. Lawrence Seaway. Put a screen on this door, and your next “fly” problem is solved—for the Great Lakes, and for the whole continent. Yet essentially every day during the Seaway’s nine-month shipping season this door swings open to overseas freighters, and to god-knows-what they might be carrying in their ballast tanks.""I read this book for my stop in Canada on my Journey Around the World in 80 books for 2019. My next stop will be across the 'pond' to Wales. I enjoyed the Kindle format with the not-whisper-synced Audible narrated by Jason Culp. Both formats were very well done and I saw no errors. It was Scientifically accurate and limited itself to the known facts. I highly recommend this in either format for anyone interested in fishing, the Great Lakes, or North America in general. ""The year after The Lorax was published the United States and Canada agreed to work together to throttle the amount of phosphorus pumping into the lake."""
195,0393355551,http://goodreads.com/user/show/61115-kimber,4,"This book is a good basic overview of the history of the Great Lakes, with a heavy emphasis on invasive species that have entered the lakes over the years, or are close enough to the lakes now to be a threat. The reader learns about how the lakes were formed, how locks were created to make the lakes accessible to international freighters, and how this opening up of a previously closed off system allowed invasive species in. A good part of the middle of the book devotes a chapter to each invasive species, how native species of fish nearly died out, and how the populations might recover over time. Toward the end of the book, the changing water levels of the Great Lakes are addressed. I found this part particularly interesting because we are currently experiencing the highest Great Lakes water levels since the 80s – wind and waves are taking a toll on the sand dunes, which are shearing off, making waterfront yards shorter. Some homes have fallen into Lake Michigan.Holland State Park, in my hometown, has a pier that goes out into Lake Michigan, and a concrete boardwalk with a picnic table or two that runs along a channel and out to the pier. This past year during some heavy storms, the wind and waves washed out the sand in that area, and the boardwalk crumbled. The picnic tables that fell have been removed, but the broken boardwalk is still there.This book looks at the ecology of the lakes, and what humans have done to devastate the natural balance. Some of it I knew, but I learned a heck of a lot. The book was published just a few years ago, so the information in it is pretty up to date. I started out reading this book in print, but it was slow going and the delivery is a little dry. I switched to audio and it went along a lot more smoothly. If you are looking for a basic overview of the history and ecology of the Great Lakes, this is a great book."

The history of the Great Lakes is as fascinating as it is troubling. I was expecting the book to be mainly about pollution and climate change. In fact, it takes over half the book to cover all the different invasive species, “biological pollution,” as the author calls them, that have been introduced to the lakes as a result of people either not caring or not thinking about the consequences of their actions as they manipulated nature to suit their interests. To be fair, I don’t think people in the past could have predicted every consequence, but after decades of problems, we should all be learning from past mistakes and doing better. The last chapter offers some small hope, as the author talked about fish evolving and adapting their diets to include mussels. On the other hand, the segment about the daughterless gene project just made me nervous. Hopefully the legal battles mentioned by the author will be won sooner rather then later. I wish I had read this when it was the Go Big Read selection. The book discussions were probably really good. I’ll get my discussion in the online classroom, which should be pretty good too. "

Upsetting, but there are also some glimmers of hope - it's amazing how quickly ecosystems can recover if you just, you know, LEAVE THEM THE F*CK ALONE. This book definitely makes the case for the utter destructiveness of the sport fishing and luxury boating lifestyles of the lakefront wealthy; the idea that you would continually stock the great lakes with nonnative Pacific salmon at the expense of native species, purely due to the preferences of sport fishers (apparently fishing for native trout and walleye is too ""boring"") - I mean. It's infuriating. But there's way, way more here, about invasive species and sewage treatment and canal building and water supply and agriculture and climate change -- Egan shows clearly that the fate of the Great Lakes is the fate of the entire continent. Worth a read for everyone, especially if you, like me, have come to love these amazing bodies of water."

This book provides an interesting history and geography of the Great Lakes region and so much I never knew about the complexity of the water system and all the variables affecting the lakes.

I have lived in Michigan my whole life and one of the reasons I decided to live where I do is because of the beauty of the lake and the fact that I can afford to live on the most northern of the Great Lakes. Their health is important to me. The lamprey, the salmon, the Asian carp, the zebra then quagga mussel, the algae blooms, the lake levels, the rising water temperatures all conspire to shift the way the lakes function. The lakes are big, they're resilient, but they're not going to be able to handle everything that gets thrown at them. I felt like it ended on a hopeful note, which I really needed.

Also covers related changes in the rest of the country, including the Mississippi basin and Lake Mead. Very readable and interesting!Dan Egan is reporter for the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel, focused specifically on the Great Lakes. This book focuses primarily on the ecosystem, from pristine (famed lake trout) to heavily invaded (the ale wife and later quagga mussels) to some form of recovery (white fish evolving for a new food source). He also focuses on the history of canal projects to open up the lakes for commerce, or clean up Chicago sewage.While primarily an American story, the Canadian angle is also mentioned. The politics of multiple states and provinces trying to deal with ecological problems is daunting. Comparing the nuisance cost of porting goods or cleaning boats to the billions spent repairing the damage is shocking. Fresh water is a focus towards the end of the book, including water grabs by Atlanta, California and others. An excellent quote from the book, showing the scale of what we are talking about here:“Roughly 97 percent of the globe’s water is saltwater. Of the 3 percent or so that is freshwater, most is locked up in the polar ice caps or trapped so far underground it is inaccessible. And of the sliver left over that exists as surface freshwater readily available for human use, about 20 percent of that—one out of every five gallons available on the planet—can be found in the Great Lakes.”"

All of us residing and/or working in “The Great Lakes Watershed” should read this book to understand what is happening to our treasured and valuable Great Lakes. Egan describes the impact of international shipping compliments of the opening of the St. Lawrence Seaway in 1959 (front door), the reversal of the Chicago River in 1900 (back door) and the continuous dredging of the St. Clair River. He discusses the myriad problems involved in protecting the lakes with so many competing and varied agendas including those of 8 US States, 1 Canadian Province, USA, Canada, commercial and sport fishermen, shipping vessels, and many more. The stakes are high since the five lakes contain 20% of the world’s fresh water and serves as the main source of water for so many. "

The Cuyahoga River winds through downtown Cleveland before flowing into Lake Erie. Although it caught on fire a dozen times in a hundred years, the blaze of 1969 upset people enough that the incident transformed from an easy joke into the beginning of the Clean Water Act and related environmental action. The Clean Water Act of 1972 reduced the waste going into the lakes. The quick and dramatic recovery since then explains why lakefronts from Milwaukee to Toronto glimmer with sparkling condos and towers, writes Egan.This readable but thorough study of the Great Lakes uses science journalism to investigate invasive species and water diversion. Egan also conveys the vastness of the Great Lakes. Three percent of the world’s water is fresh, and, within that tiny fraction, the Great Lakes hold twenty percent of the world’s surface freshwater, making it an enviable asset for those outside the protected watershed.Going way, way back, these five inland seas trace their history to the Ice Age when glaciers receded about twelve thousand years ago, scouring out their basins. A normal lake ripples and may send a two-foot wave, while any one of the Great Lakes can swell to twenty-five feet. Fast forward to the nineteen fifties when the St Lawrence Seaway opened, which allowed ocean-going vessels to load and unload cargo on the Great Lakes at industrial ports, including Cleveland, Chicago and Milwaukee. What seemed like a good idea at the time brought with it some invasive species that would hitch a ride in the ballast water and make their homes here, away from their natural predators. Alewives, then lampreys and mussels invaded. Almost two hundred nonnative species live in the Great Lakes, according to Egan. The St Lawrence Seaway serves as a front door from the Atlantic Ocean to the Great Lakes for the invading species, while the Chicago River serves as the back door flowing from Lake Michigan, carrying these unwanted creatures to the Mississippi River drainage system, which serves forty percent of the country. Environmental issues occupy two-thirds of the book, while other matters close it out. Water diversion, for example. A Great Lakes water compact serves as a high point of regionalism, said Egan on Friday night. “This is one area where we’ve done everything right.” These governors protect the water and carefully weigh requests from those outside the watershed. While the Great Lakes hold twenty percent of the world’s surface freshwater, twenty percent of the United States population lives in the Great Lakes Megalopolis, stretching from Milwaukee, through Chicago, Detroit, Cleveland and Buffalo as well as Toronto and Montreal. I lived most of my life near Lake Michigan, born and raised in Chicago and now living in Milwaukee twelve blocks from the lake. Dad accepted a job in Cleveland during my high school years, so that made me familiar with Lake Erie. A short foray to Carmel during my nomad years put me a few blocks from the Pacific Ocean, but soon Lake Michigan called me back home. This book celebrates and carefully describes the bounty here and its threats. Pairs well with The Great Lakes Water Wars.

But the situation should be setting off alarm bells for everyone. The stakes are high: there isn't much fresh water in the world, the Great Lakes are the largest system we have, and the lakes are in trouble (for a variety of reasons). We need to take care of the lakes, and we need to do it now. It really is that simple.Dan Egan has written an excellent account of the dire situation the lakes face. Egan is a gifted reporter and stylist, and his story is fascinating and very readable. It's a thoroughly researched and very detailed book -- there's lots of scientific information and historical background. But it's also a very human story, and he shares the stories of many of the people involved and affected by this “slow-motion catastrophe.” And it's that human element that drives his narrative and makes it so affecting. Egan's book is the final result of years of reporting for the Milwaukee JOURNAL SENTINEL. And it sometimes reads like a collection of stories, with occasional awkwardness and rough edges. But for the most part, I thought it came together nicely as a coherent whole. He finds a nice balance between the ecology, history, and reportage. It's a very good book.This is a true reporter's book, and I have enormous respect for the work he has done. I don't want to proselytize on politics or the current state of America, but suffice it to say that Egan's book is a timely reminder of the value of a free and independent media. We should never take that for granted.(Thanks to W. W. Norton for an advance copy in exchange for an impartial review.)"

Thoroughly researched and written clearly, this is a must read for anyone who loves the Great Lakes. The book details the fragile ecosystem and other challenges of the largest freshwater system in the world. As someone who enjoys the beauty and majesty of the lakes, it is difficult to imagine the struggles that occur under the water. The book begins by explaining that with the construction of the Welland Canal and other inlets, the lakes have become vulnerable to a plethora of invasive species (through fish migration and ballast water) that have altered their course. Sea lampreys, alewives, and muscles are just a few examples. I also found interesting the section about Asian carp and the threat they pose to the lakes. The history behind the Chicago Sanitary and Ship Canal is another topic I found fascinating. There is so much information in this book that it is difficult to summarize in a short space. However, readers will be amazed not only at the incredible ecosystems of the lakes, but also the biology involved and the responses that researchers have had to combat the threats. Additionally, there are also sections on the specific struggles of Lake Erie (algae, pollution) and how the former Great Black Swamp of NW Ohio, SE Michigan, and NE Indiana (and the Maumee River) plays a role. I would highly recommend this book to anyone who is interested in learning about the Great Lakes. It combines history, current events, biology, and regional interests. Coming away from this read, you will realize the awesome power of the lakes, what an incredible resource they are, and what challenges they have faced (and which ones lie ahead)."

Egan does an excellent job tracing the history of development on and near the Lakes and how this has impacted the Lakes in ways both intended and unintended. I had, of course, heard of zebra mussels and Asian carp, but the history of lampreys, quagga mussels, alewives and even chinook salmon in the Lakes was new and surprising to me. While I sometimes got lost in the science, Egan does not over-do the technical jargon and in general makes the explanations very readable. The ""tinkering"" we have done and continue to do to ""improve"" the Lakes, left me at times amused, at other times horrified. He also does an excellent of job of weaving in the historical context of the various Lake projects. I am glad I read this. It is a well-written and very timely reminder that water is the thing we take most for granted and yet the most vital resource we have. I like that Egan's ultimate conclusion is less hectoring and more hopeful: that if we respect the Lakes and stop trying to bend them to our will they will continue to sustain and delight us in ways both new and old in years to come.

It has an import focus, rather than export; dealing with what is being introduced into the system of North America's waterways, rather than what is washing out into the seas for the rest of the world to share. It reads like an informative fishing manual or travel guide. It is filled with info about fishing, fish behavior, and commercial and recreational fishing and water sports. It is a positively focused work that presents solutions being utilized today, and hoped for the future.""By 1985 Tanner was busy developing a super strain of salmon he hoped would grow to twice the size of the lake’s trophy chinook. The idea was to heat-shock fertilized chinook eggs in a manner that would give the fish three sets of chromosomes instead of two. The end product would be an adult fish that would never reach sexual maturity, which meant none of its energy had to be wasted on sperm or egg production. Everything would go into growth, and because its biological clock was frozen, the fish would not be shackled to the salmon’s three-year lifecycle, enabling it to grow for up to a decade or longer.""Egan explains carefully the exact systems of canals, in the order they were added. One after another, new exotic species make their way into the Great Lakes, like a dramatic fishing show. The same inventiveness that looked for ways to introduce international shipping into the middle of the continent, and was embraced by both countries, worked to find solutions to each problem as it arose. But by the second half of the book, things become more problematic. The lesson learned is that when man changes nature, his work is not done. He must work to maintain that artifice. His design is never his own permanently. ""...in the ocean these early returners, referred to as “jacks,” are almost always males... the first full class of coho returning by the tens of thousands to their “native” waters. In 1967 Michigan expanded the stocking program to include chinook salmon, similar to coho but substantially bigger.""Many invasive species are described in the most intriguing manner, such as lampreys and zebra mussels. Hatchery raised Salmon are artificially introduced into the Great Lakes, and soon create a fisherman's paradise... for years. The book reveals how individual lives were made, changed, and remade by environmental decisions of the government. Regardless of the decision made in the intervening decades, man seems little qualified to change the course of the seas. “As humans, we always want to be in control, but we can’t control the Great Lakes,” said John Dettmers, a biologist with the Great Lakes Fishery Commission. “We changed it, but we didn’t necessarily control it.” From the St. Lawrence Seaway, to the Welland Canal; Canada has moved in tandem with the USA to divert the waters of the Great Lakes. Both countries will have many issues to resolve in the future with dwindling freshwater supplies in metropolitan areas. The book covers many water supply issues in various places, including Atlanta, Georgia. And, it describes how Chicago accidentally built a superhighway for Great Lakes invasive species to fan out across North America when they 'flushed' their sewage problems into the Mississippi and the Gulf. ""Although the Great Lakes have more than 10,000 miles of shoreline—more than the United States’ Pacific and Atlantic Coasts combined—the region is uniquely positioned to stop biological invasions because of one incredible geographical fact: every overseas freighter that sails up from the East Coast into the lakes must pass through a single pinch point: the first lock on the St. Lawrence Seaway. Put a screen on this door, and your next “fly” problem is solved—for the Great Lakes, and for the whole continent. Yet essentially every day during the Seaway’s nine-month shipping season this door swings open to overseas freighters, and to god-knows-what they might be carrying in their ballast tanks.""I read this book for my stop in Canada on my Journey Around the World in 80 books for 2019. My next stop will be across the 'pond' to Wales. I enjoyed the Kindle format with the not-whisper-synced Audible narrated by Jason Culp. Both formats were very well done and I saw no errors. It was Scientifically accurate and limited itself to the known facts. I highly recommend this in either format for anyone interested in fishing, the Great Lakes, or North America in general. ""The year after The Lorax was published the United States and Canada agreed to work together to throttle the amount of phosphorus pumping into the lake."""
225,0393355551,http://goodreads.com/user/show/61115-kimber,4,"This book is a good basic overview of the history of the Great Lakes, with a heavy emphasis on invasive species that have entered the lakes over the years, or are close enough to the lakes now to be a threat. The reader learns about how the lakes were formed, how locks were created to make the lakes accessible to international freighters, and how this opening up of a previously closed off system allowed invasive species in. A good part of the middle of the book devotes a chapter to each invasive species, how native species of fish nearly died out, and how the populations might recover over time. Toward the end of the book, the changing water levels of the Great Lakes are addressed. I found this part particularly interesting because we are currently experiencing the highest Great Lakes water levels since the 80s – wind and waves are taking a toll on the sand dunes, which are shearing off, making waterfront yards shorter. Some homes have fallen into Lake Michigan.Holland State Park, in my hometown, has a pier that goes out into Lake Michigan, and a concrete boardwalk with a picnic table or two that runs along a channel and out to the pier. This past year during some heavy storms, the wind and waves washed out the sand in that area, and the boardwalk crumbled. The picnic tables that fell have been removed, but the broken boardwalk is still there.This book looks at the ecology of the lakes, and what humans have done to devastate the natural balance. Some of it I knew, but I learned a heck of a lot. The book was published just a few years ago, so the information in it is pretty up to date. I started out reading this book in print, but it was slow going and the delivery is a little dry. I switched to audio and it went along a lot more smoothly. If you are looking for a basic overview of the history and ecology of the Great Lakes, this is a great book."

The history of the Great Lakes is as fascinating as it is troubling. I was expecting the book to be mainly about pollution and climate change. In fact, it takes over half the book to cover all the different invasive species, “biological pollution,” as the author calls them, that have been introduced to the lakes as a result of people either not caring or not thinking about the consequences of their actions as they manipulated nature to suit their interests. To be fair, I don’t think people in the past could have predicted every consequence, but after decades of problems, we should all be learning from past mistakes and doing better. The last chapter offers some small hope, as the author talked about fish evolving and adapting their diets to include mussels. On the other hand, the segment about the daughterless gene project just made me nervous. Hopefully the legal battles mentioned by the author will be won sooner rather then later. I wish I had read this when it was the Go Big Read selection. The book discussions were probably really good. I’ll get my discussion in the online classroom, which should be pretty good too. "

Upsetting, but there are also some glimmers of hope - it's amazing how quickly ecosystems can recover if you just, you know, LEAVE THEM THE F*CK ALONE. This book definitely makes the case for the utter destructiveness of the sport fishing and luxury boating lifestyles of the lakefront wealthy; the idea that you would continually stock the great lakes with nonnative Pacific salmon at the expense of native species, purely due to the preferences of sport fishers (apparently fishing for native trout and walleye is too ""boring"") - I mean. It's infuriating. But there's way, way more here, about invasive species and sewage treatment and canal building and water supply and agriculture and climate change -- Egan shows clearly that the fate of the Great Lakes is the fate of the entire continent. Worth a read for everyone, especially if you, like me, have come to love these amazing bodies of water."

The group pointed out so many issues and ideas in the book that I hadn't spent much time considering because I was so busy worrying about Asian carp and toxic algae blooms. Everyone present for the book club has lived and traveled in the Great Lakes in the US and Canada and thought we knew all there is to know.

That's kind of surprising considering that I literally live on the shores of Lake Superior. I loved this book AND it scared the crap out of me. I have lived in Michigan my whole life and one of the reasons I decided to live where I do is because of the beauty of the lake and the fact that I can afford to live on the most northern of the Great Lakes. Their health is important to me. The lamprey, the salmon, the Asian carp, the zebra then quagga mussel, the algae blooms, the lake levels, the rising water temperatures all conspire to shift the way the lakes function. The lakes are big, they're resilient, but they're not going to be able to handle everything that gets thrown at them. I felt like it ended on a hopeful note, which I really needed. Not that I'm lulled into thinking everything is OK, but it's nice to know that the lakes have been able to adapt to some of the changes. "

Also covers related changes in the rest of the country, including the Mississippi basin and Lake Mead. Very readable and interesting!Dan Egan is reporter for the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel, focused specifically on the Great Lakes. This book focuses primarily on the ecosystem, from pristine (famed lake trout) to heavily invaded (the ale wife and later quagga mussels) to some form of recovery (white fish evolving for a new food source). He also focuses on the history of canal projects to open up the lakes for commerce, or clean up Chicago sewage.While primarily an American story, the Canadian angle is also mentioned. The politics of multiple states and provinces trying to deal with ecological problems is daunting. Comparing the nuisance cost of porting goods or cleaning boats to the billions spent repairing the damage is shocking. Fresh water is a focus towards the end of the book, including water grabs by Atlanta, California and others. An excellent quote from the book, showing the scale of what we are talking about here:“Roughly 97 percent of the globe’s water is saltwater. Of the 3 percent or so that is freshwater, most is locked up in the polar ice caps or trapped so far underground it is inaccessible. And of the sliver left over that exists as surface freshwater readily available for human use, about 20 percent of that—one out of every five gallons available on the planet—can be found in the Great Lakes.”"

All of us residing and/or working in “The Great Lakes Watershed” should read this book to understand what is happening to our treasured and valuable Great Lakes. Egan describes the impact of international shipping compliments of the opening of the St. Lawrence Seaway in 1959 (front door), the reversal of the Chicago River in 1900 (back door) and the continuous dredging of the St. Clair River. He discusses the myriad problems involved in protecting the lakes with so many competing and varied agendas including those of 8 US States, 1 Canadian Province, USA, Canada, commercial and sport fishermen, shipping vessels, and many more. The stakes are high since the five lakes contain 20% of the world’s fresh water and serves as the main source of water for so many. "

247,0393355551,http://goodreads.com/user/show/16346692-art,5,"“This story picks up after the Cuyahoga River caught fire in 1969,” said Dan Egan, speaking to a surprisingly packed, standing-room-only crowd at Milwaukee’s largest indie bookshop on Friday night. The Cuyahoga River winds through downtown Cleveland before flowing into Lake Erie. Although it caught on fire a dozen times in a hundred years, the blaze of 1969 upset people enough that the incident transformed from an easy joke into the beginning of the Clean Water Act and related environmental action. The Clean Water Act of 1972 reduced the waste going into the lakes. The quick and dramatic recovery since then explains why lakefronts from Milwaukee to Toronto glimmer with sparkling condos and towers, writes Egan.This readable but thorough study of the Great Lakes uses science journalism to investigate invasive species and water diversion. Egan also conveys the vastness of the Great Lakes. Three percent of the world’s water is fresh, and, within that tiny fraction, the Great Lakes hold twenty percent of the world’s surface freshwater, making it an enviable asset for those outside the protected watershed.Going way, way back, these five inland seas trace their history to the Ice Age when glaciers receded about twelve thousand years ago, scouring out their basins. A normal lake ripples and may send a two-foot wave, while any one of the Great Lakes can swell to twenty-five feet. Fast forward to the nineteen fifties when the St Lawrence Seaway opened, which allowed ocean-going vessels to load and unload cargo on the Great Lakes at industrial ports, including Cleveland, Chicago and Milwaukee. What seemed like a good idea at the time brought with it some invasive species that would hitch a ride in the ballast water and make their homes here, away from their natural predators. Alewives, then lampreys and mussels invaded. Almost two hundred nonnative species live in the Great Lakes, according to Egan. The St Lawrence Seaway serves as a front door from the Atlantic Ocean to the Great Lakes for the invading species, while the Chicago River serves as the back door flowing from Lake Michigan, carrying these unwanted creatures to the Mississippi River drainage system, which serves forty percent of the country. Environmental issues occupy two-thirds of the book, while other matters close it out. Water diversion, for example. A Great Lakes water compact serves as a high point of regionalism, said Egan on Friday night. “This is one area where we’ve done everything right.” These governors protect the water and carefully weigh requests from those outside the watershed. While the Great Lakes hold twenty percent of the world’s surface freshwater, twenty percent of the United States population lives in the Great Lakes Megalopolis, stretching from Milwaukee, through Chicago, Detroit, Cleveland and Buffalo as well as Toronto and Montreal. I lived most of my life near Lake Michigan, born and raised in Chicago and now living in Milwaukee twelve blocks from the lake. Dad accepted a job in Cleveland during my high school years, so that made me familiar with Lake Erie. A short foray to Carmel during my nomad years put me a few blocks from the Pacific Ocean, but soon Lake Michigan called me back home. This book celebrates and carefully describes the bounty here and its threats. Pairs well with The Great Lakes Water Wars.

But the situation should be setting off alarm bells for everyone. The stakes are high: there isn't much fresh water in the world, the Great Lakes are the largest system we have, and the lakes are in trouble (for a variety of reasons). We need to take care of the lakes, and we need to do it now. It really is that simple.Dan Egan has written an excellent account of the dire situation the lakes face. Egan is a gifted reporter and stylist, and his story is fascinating and very readable. It's a thoroughly researched and very detailed book -- there's lots of scientific information and historical background. But it's also a very human story, and he shares the stories of many of the people involved and affected by this “slow-motion catastrophe.” And it's that human element that drives his narrative and makes it so affecting. Egan's book is the final result of years of reporting for the Milwaukee JOURNAL SENTINEL. And it sometimes reads like a collection of stories, with occasional awkwardness and rough edges. But for the most part, I thought it came together nicely as a coherent whole. He finds a nice balance between the ecology, history, and reportage. It's a very good book.This is a true reporter's book, and I have enormous respect for the work he has done. I don't want to proselytize on politics or the current state of America, but suffice it to say that Egan's book is a timely reminder of the value of a free and independent media. We should never take that for granted.(Thanks to W. W. Norton for an advance copy in exchange for an impartial review.)"

Thoroughly researched and written clearly, this is a must read for anyone who loves the Great Lakes. The book details the fragile ecosystem and other challenges of the largest freshwater system in the world. As someone who enjoys the beauty and majesty of the lakes, it is difficult to imagine the struggles that occur under the water. The book begins by explaining that with the construction of the Welland Canal and other inlets, the lakes have become vulnerable to a plethora of invasive species (through fish migration and ballast water) that have altered their course. Sea lampreys, alewives, and muscles are just a few examples. I also found interesting the section about Asian carp and the threat they pose to the lakes. The history behind the Chicago Sanitary and Ship Canal is another topic I found fascinating. There is so much information in this book that it is difficult to summarize in a short space. However, readers will be amazed not only at the incredible ecosystems of the lakes, but also the biology involved and the responses that researchers have had to combat the threats. Additionally, there are also sections on the specific struggles of Lake Erie (algae, pollution) and how the former Great Black Swamp of NW Ohio, SE Michigan, and NE Indiana (and the Maumee River) plays a role. I would highly recommend this book to anyone who is interested in learning about the Great Lakes. It combines history, current events, biology, and regional interests. Coming away from this read, you will realize the awesome power of the lakes, what an incredible resource they are, and what challenges they have faced (and which ones lie ahead)."
250,0393355551,http://goodreads.com/user/show/76921931-sandy,3,"Living a mile from Lake Michigan I am naturally interested in this review of man's interaction with the Lakes. Egan does an excellent job tracing the history of development on and near the Lakes and how this has impacted the Lakes in ways both intended and unintended. I had, of course, heard of zebra mussels and Asian carp, but the history of lampreys, quagga mussels, alewives and even chinook salmon in the Lakes was new and surprising to me. While I sometimes got lost in the science, Egan does not over-do the technical jargon and in general makes the explanations very readable. The ""tinkering"" we have done and continue to do to ""improve"" the Lakes, left me at times amused, at other times horrified. He also does an excellent of job of weaving in the historical context of the various Lake projects. I am glad I read this. It is a well-written and very timely reminder that water is the thing we take most for granted and yet the most vital resource we have. I like that Egan's ultimate conclusion is less hectoring and more hopeful: that if we respect the Lakes and stop trying to bend them to our will they will continue to sustain and delight us in ways both new and old in years to come.

It has an import focus, rather than export; dealing with what is being introduced into the system of North America's waterways, rather than what is washing out into the seas for the rest of the world to share. It reads like an informative fishing manual or travel guide. It is filled with info about fishing, fish behavior, and commercial and recreational fishing and water sports. It is a positively focused work that presents solutions being utilized today, and hoped for the future.""By 1985 Tanner was busy developing a super strain of salmon he hoped would grow to twice the size of the lake’s trophy chinook. The idea was to heat-shock fertilized chinook eggs in a manner that would give the fish three sets of chromosomes instead of two. The end product would be an adult fish that would never reach sexual maturity, which meant none of its energy had to be wasted on sperm or egg production. Everything would go into growth, and because its biological clock was frozen, the fish would not be shackled to the salmon’s three-year lifecycle, enabling it to grow for up to a decade or longer.""Egan explains carefully the exact systems of canals, in the order they were added. One after another, new exotic species make their way into the Great Lakes, like a dramatic fishing show. The same inventiveness that looked for ways to introduce international shipping into the middle of the continent, and was embraced by both countries, worked to find solutions to each problem as it arose. But by the second half of the book, things become more problematic. The lesson learned is that when man changes nature, his work is not done. He must work to maintain that artifice. His design is never his own permanently. ""...in the ocean these early returners, referred to as “jacks,” are almost always males... the first full class of coho returning by the tens of thousands to their “native” waters. In 1967 Michigan expanded the stocking program to include chinook salmon, similar to coho but substantially bigger.""Many invasive species are described in the most intriguing manner, such as lampreys and zebra mussels. Hatchery raised Salmon are artificially introduced into the Great Lakes, and soon create a fisherman's paradise... for years. The book reveals how individual lives were made, changed, and remade by environmental decisions of the government. Regardless of the decision made in the intervening decades, man seems little qualified to change the course of the seas. “As humans, we always want to be in control, but we can’t control the Great Lakes,” said John Dettmers, a biologist with the Great Lakes Fishery Commission. “We changed it, but we didn’t necessarily control it.” From the St. Lawrence Seaway, to the Welland Canal; Canada has moved in tandem with the USA to divert the waters of the Great Lakes. Both countries will have many issues to resolve in the future with dwindling freshwater supplies in metropolitan areas. The book covers many water supply issues in various places, including Atlanta, Georgia. And, it describes how Chicago accidentally built a superhighway for Great Lakes invasive species to fan out across North America when they 'flushed' their sewage problems into the Mississippi and the Gulf. ""Although the Great Lakes have more than 10,000 miles of shoreline—more than the United States’ Pacific and Atlantic Coasts combined—the region is uniquely positioned to stop biological invasions because of one incredible geographical fact: every overseas freighter that sails up from the East Coast into the lakes must pass through a single pinch point: the first lock on the St. Lawrence Seaway. Put a screen on this door, and your next “fly” problem is solved—for the Great Lakes, and for the whole continent. Yet essentially every day during the Seaway’s nine-month shipping season this door swings open to overseas freighters, and to god-knows-what they might be carrying in their ballast tanks.""I read this book for my stop in Canada on my Journey Around the World in 80 books for 2019. My next stop will be across the 'pond' to Wales. I enjoyed the Kindle format with the not-whisper-synced Audible narrated by Jason Culp. Both formats were very well done and I saw no errors. It was Scientifically accurate and limited itself to the known facts. I highly recommend this in either format for anyone interested in fishing, the Great Lakes, or North America in general.

255,0393355551,http://goodreads.com/user/show/61115-kimber,4,"This book is a good basic overview of the history of the Great Lakes, with a heavy emphasis on invasive species that have entered the lakes over the years, or are close enough to the lakes now to be a threat. The reader learns about how the lakes were formed, how locks were created to make the lakes accessible to international freighters, and how this opening up of a previously closed off system allowed invasive species in. A good part of the middle of the book devotes a chapter to each invasive species, how native species of fish nearly died out, and how the populations might recover over time. Toward the end of the book, the changing water levels of the Great Lakes are addressed. I found this part particularly interesting because we are currently experiencing the highest Great Lakes water levels since the 80s – wind and waves are taking a toll on the sand dunes, which are shearing off, making waterfront yards shorter. Some homes have fallen into Lake Michigan.Holland State Park, in my hometown, has a pier that goes out into Lake Michigan, and a concrete boardwalk with a picnic table or two that runs along a channel and out to the pier. This past year during some heavy storms, the wind and waves washed out the sand in that area, and the boardwalk crumbled. The picnic tables that fell have been removed, but the broken boardwalk is still there.This book looks at the ecology of the lakes, and what humans have done to devastate the natural balance. Some of it I knew, but I learned a heck of a lot. The book was published just a few years ago, so the information in it is pretty up to date.

In fact, it takes over half the book to cover all the different invasive species, “biological pollution,” as the author calls them, that have been introduced to the lakes as a result of people either not caring or not thinking about the consequences of their actions as they manipulated nature to suit their interests. To be fair, I don’t think people in the past could have predicted every consequence, but after decades of problems, we should all be learning from past mistakes and doing better. The last chapter offers some small hope, as the author talked about fish evolving and adapting their diets to include mussels. On the other hand, the segment about the daughterless gene project just made me nervous. Hopefully the legal battles mentioned by the author will be won sooner rather then later. I wish I had read this when it was the Go Big Read selection. The book discussions were probably really good. I’ll get my discussion in the online classroom, which should be pretty good too. "

Upsetting, but there are also some glimmers of hope - it's amazing how quickly ecosystems can recover if you just, you know, LEAVE THEM THE F*CK ALONE. This book definitely makes the case for the utter destructiveness of the sport fishing and luxury boating lifestyles of the lakefront wealthy; the idea that you would continually stock the great lakes with nonnative Pacific salmon at the expense of native species, purely due to the preferences of sport fishers (apparently fishing for native trout and walleye is too ""boring"") - I mean. It's infuriating. But there's way, way more here, about invasive species and sewage treatment and canal building and water supply and agriculture and climate change -- Egan shows clearly that the fate of the Great Lakes is the fate of the entire continent. Worth a read for everyone, especially if you, like me, have come to love these amazing bodies of water."

This book provides an interesting history and geography of the Great Lakes region and so much I never knew about the complexity of the water system and all the variables affecting the lakes. Also I can’t believe a book that had so much to say about fish and fishing was this good."

The group pointed out so many issues and ideas in the book that I hadn't spent much time considering because I was so busy worrying about Asian carp and toxic algae blooms. Everyone present for the book club has lived and traveled in the Great Lakes in the US and Canada and thought we knew all there is to know.

That's kind of surprising considering that I literally live on the shores of Lake Superior. I loved this book AND it scared the crap out of me. I have lived in Michigan my whole life and one of the reasons I decided to live where I do is because of the beauty of the lake and the fact that I can afford to live on the most northern of the Great Lakes. Their health is important to me. The lamprey, the salmon, the Asian carp, the zebra then quagga mussel, the algae blooms, the lake levels, the rising water temperatures all conspire to shift the way the lakes function. The lakes are big, they're resilient, but they're not going to be able to handle everything that gets thrown at them. I felt like it ended on a hopeful note, which I really needed. Not that I'm lulled into thinking everything is OK, but it's nice to know that the lakes have been able to adapt to some of the changes. "

Also covers related changes in the rest of the country, including the Mississippi basin and Lake Mead. Very readable and interesting!Dan Egan is reporter for the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel, focused specifically on the Great Lakes. This book focuses primarily on the ecosystem, from pristine (famed lake trout) to heavily invaded (the ale wife and later quagga mussels) to some form of recovery (white fish evolving for a new food source). He also focuses on the history of canal projects to open up the lakes for commerce, or clean up Chicago sewage.While primarily an American story, the Canadian angle is also mentioned. The politics of multiple states and provinces trying to deal with ecological problems is daunting. Comparing the nuisance cost of porting goods or cleaning boats to the billions spent repairing the damage is shocking. Fresh water is a focus towards the end of the book, including water grabs by Atlanta, California and others. An excellent quote from the book, showing the scale of what we are talking about here:“Roughly 97 percent of the globe’s water is saltwater. Of the 3 percent or so that is freshwater, most is locked up in the polar ice caps or trapped so far underground it is inaccessible. And of the sliver left over that exists as surface freshwater readily available for human use, about 20 percent of that—one out of every five gallons available on the planet—can be found in the Great Lakes.”"

All of us residing and/or working in “The Great Lakes Watershed” should read this book to understand what is happening to our treasured and valuable Great Lakes. Egan describes the impact of international shipping compliments of the opening of the St. Lawrence Seaway in 1959 (front door), the reversal of the Chicago River in 1900 (back door) and the continuous dredging of the St. Clair River. He discusses the myriad problems involved in protecting the lakes with so many competing and varied agendas including those of 8 US States, 1 Canadian Province, USA, Canada, commercial and sport fishermen, shipping vessels, and many more. The stakes are high since the five lakes contain 20% of the world’s fresh water and serves as the main source of water for so many. "

277,0393355551,http://goodreads.com/user/show/16346692-art,5,"“This story picks up after the Cuyahoga River caught fire in 1969,” said Dan Egan, speaking to a surprisingly packed, standing-room-only crowd at Milwaukee’s largest indie bookshop on Friday night. The Cuyahoga River winds through downtown Cleveland before flowing into Lake Erie. Although it caught on fire a dozen times in a hundred years, the blaze of 1969 upset people enough that the incident transformed from an easy joke into the beginning of the Clean Water Act and related environmental action. The Clean Water Act of 1972 reduced the waste going into the lakes. The quick and dramatic recovery since then explains why lakefronts from Milwaukee to Toronto glimmer with sparkling condos and towers, writes Egan.This readable but thorough study of the Great Lakes uses science journalism to investigate invasive species and water diversion. Egan also conveys the vastness of the Great Lakes. Three percent of the world’s water is fresh, and, within that tiny fraction, the Great Lakes hold twenty percent of the world’s surface freshwater, making it an enviable asset for those outside the protected watershed.Going way, way back, these five inland seas trace their history to the Ice Age when glaciers receded about twelve thousand years ago, scouring out their basins. A normal lake ripples and may send a two-foot wave, while any one of the Great Lakes can swell to twenty-five feet. Fast forward to the nineteen fifties when the St Lawrence Seaway opened, which allowed ocean-going vessels to load and unload cargo on the Great Lakes at industrial ports, including Cleveland, Chicago and Milwaukee. What seemed like a good idea at the time brought with it some invasive species that would hitch a ride in the ballast water and make their homes here, away from their natural predators. Alewives, then lampreys and mussels invaded. Almost two hundred nonnative species live in the Great Lakes, according to Egan. The St Lawrence Seaway serves as a front door from the Atlantic Ocean to the Great Lakes for the invading species, while the Chicago River serves as the back door flowing from Lake Michigan, carrying these unwanted creatures to the Mississippi River drainage system, which serves forty percent of the country. Environmental issues occupy two-thirds of the book, while other matters close it out. Water diversion, for example. A Great Lakes water compact serves as a high point of regionalism, said Egan on Friday night. “This is one area where we’ve done everything right.” These governors protect the water and carefully weigh requests from those outside the watershed. While the Great Lakes hold twenty percent of the world’s surface freshwater, twenty percent of the United States population lives in the Great Lakes Megalopolis, stretching from Milwaukee, through Chicago, Detroit, Cleveland and Buffalo as well as Toronto and Montreal. I lived most of my life near Lake Michigan, born and raised in Chicago and now living in Milwaukee twelve blocks from the lake. Dad accepted a job in Cleveland during my high school years, so that made me familiar with Lake Erie. A short foray to Carmel during my nomad years put me a few blocks from the Pacific Ocean, but soon Lake Michigan called me back home. This book celebrates and carefully describes the bounty here and its threats. Pairs well with The Great Lakes Water Wars.

But the situation should be setting off alarm bells for everyone. The stakes are high: there isn't much fresh water in the world, the Great Lakes are the largest system we have, and the lakes are in trouble (for a variety of reasons). We need to take care of the lakes, and we need to do it now. It really is that simple.Dan Egan has written an excellent account of the dire situation the lakes face. Egan is a gifted reporter and stylist, and his story is fascinating and very readable. It's a thoroughly researched and very detailed book -- there's lots of scientific information and historical background. But it's also a very human story, and he shares the stories of many of the people involved and affected by this “slow-motion catastrophe.” And it's that human element that drives his narrative and makes it so affecting. Egan's book is the final result of years of reporting for the Milwaukee JOURNAL SENTINEL. And it sometimes reads like a collection of stories, with occasional awkwardness and rough edges. But for the most part, I thought it came together nicely as a coherent whole. He finds a nice balance between the ecology, history, and reportage. It's a very good book.This is a true reporter's book, and I have enormous respect for the work he has done. I don't want to proselytize on politics or the current state of America, but suffice it to say that Egan's book is a timely reminder of the value of a free and independent media. We should never take that for granted.(Thanks to W. W. Norton for an advance copy in exchange for an impartial review.)"
279,0393355551,http://goodreads.com/user/show/26195174-russ-marcinek,5,"As someone who grew up and lives near Lake Michigan, I found this to be an extraordinary work. Thoroughly researched and written clearly, this is a must read for anyone who loves the Great Lakes. The book details the fragile ecosystem and other challenges of the largest freshwater system in the world. As someone who enjoys the beauty and majesty of the lakes, it is difficult to imagine the struggles that occur under the water. The book begins by explaining that with the construction of the Welland Canal and other inlets, the lakes have become vulnerable to a plethora of invasive species (through fish migration and ballast water) that have altered their course. Sea lampreys, alewives, and muscles are just a few examples. I also found interesting the section about Asian carp and the threat they pose to the lakes. The history behind the Chicago Sanitary and Ship Canal is another topic I found fascinating. There is so much information in this book that it is difficult to summarize in a short space. However, readers will be amazed not only at the incredible ecosystems of the lakes, but also the biology involved and the responses that researchers have had to combat the threats. Additionally, there are also sections on the specific struggles of Lake Erie (algae, pollution) and how the former Great Black Swamp of NW Ohio, SE Michigan, and NE Indiana (and the Maumee River) plays a role. I would highly recommend this book to anyone who is interested in learning about the Great Lakes. It combines history, current events, biology, and regional interests. Coming away from this read, you will realize the awesome power of the lakes, what an incredible resource they are, and what challenges they have faced (and which ones lie ahead)."
280,0393355551,http://goodreads.com/user/show/76921931-sandy,3,"Living a mile from Lake Michigan I am naturally interested in this review of man's interaction with the Lakes. Egan does an excellent job tracing the history of development on and near the Lakes and how this has impacted the Lakes in ways both intended and unintended. I had, of course, heard of zebra mussels and Asian carp, but the history of lampreys, quagga mussels, alewives and even chinook salmon in the Lakes was new and surprising to me. While I sometimes got lost in the science, Egan does not over-do the technical jargon and in general makes the explanations very readable. The ""tinkering"" we have done and continue to do to ""improve"" the Lakes, left me at times amused, at other times horrified. He also does an excellent of job of weaving in the historical context of the various Lake projects. I am glad I read this. It is a well-written and very timely reminder that water is the thing we take most for granted and yet the most vital resource we have. I like that Egan's ultimate conclusion is less hectoring and more hopeful: that if we respect the Lakes and stop trying to bend them to our will they will continue to sustain and delight us in ways both new and old in years to come.

It has an import focus, rather than export; dealing with what is being introduced into the system of North America's waterways, rather than what is washing out into the seas for the rest of the world to share. It reads like an informative fishing manual or travel guide. It is filled with info about fishing, fish behavior, and commercial and recreational fishing and water sports. It is a positively focused work that presents solutions being utilized today, and hoped for the future.""By 1985 Tanner was busy developing a super strain of salmon he hoped would grow to twice the size of the lake’s trophy chinook. The idea was to heat-shock fertilized chinook eggs in a manner that would give the fish three sets of chromosomes instead of two. The end product would be an adult fish that would never reach sexual maturity, which meant none of its energy had to be wasted on sperm or egg production. Everything would go into growth, and because its biological clock was frozen, the fish would not be shackled to the salmon’s three-year lifecycle, enabling it to grow for up to a decade or longer.""Egan explains carefully the exact systems of canals, in the order they were added. One after another, new exotic species make their way into the Great Lakes, like a dramatic fishing show. The same inventiveness that looked for ways to introduce international shipping into the middle of the continent, and was embraced by both countries, worked to find solutions to each problem as it arose. But by the second half of the book, things become more problematic. The lesson learned is that when man changes nature, his work is not done. He must work to maintain that artifice. His design is never his own permanently. ""...in the ocean these early returners, referred to as “jacks,” are almost always males... the first full class of coho returning by the tens of thousands to their “native” waters. In 1967 Michigan expanded the stocking program to include chinook salmon, similar to coho but substantially bigger.""Many invasive species are described in the most intriguing manner, such as lampreys and zebra mussels. Hatchery raised Salmon are artificially introduced into the Great Lakes, and soon create a fisherman's paradise... for years. The book reveals how individual lives were made, changed, and remade by environmental decisions of the government. Regardless of the decision made in the intervening decades, man seems little qualified to change the course of the seas. “As humans, we always want to be in control, but we can’t control the Great Lakes,” said John Dettmers, a biologist with the Great Lakes Fishery Commission. “We changed it, but we didn’t necessarily control it.” From the St. Lawrence Seaway, to the Welland Canal; Canada has moved in tandem with the USA to divert the waters of the Great Lakes. Both countries will have many issues to resolve in the future with dwindling freshwater supplies in metropolitan areas. The book covers many water supply issues in various places, including Atlanta, Georgia. And, it describes how Chicago accidentally built a superhighway for Great Lakes invasive species to fan out across North America when they 'flushed' their sewage problems into the Mississippi and the Gulf. ""Although the Great Lakes have more than 10,000 miles of shoreline—more than the United States’ Pacific and Atlantic Coasts combined—the region is uniquely positioned to stop biological invasions because of one incredible geographical fact: every overseas freighter that sails up from the East Coast into the lakes must pass through a single pinch point: the first lock on the St. Lawrence Seaway. Put a screen on this door, and your next “fly” problem is solved—for the Great Lakes, and for the whole continent. Yet essentially every day during the Seaway’s nine-month shipping season this door swings open to overseas freighters, and to god-knows-what they might be carrying in their ballast tanks.""I read this book for my stop in Canada on my Journey Around the World in 80 books for 2019. My next stop will be across the 'pond' to Wales. I enjoyed the Kindle format with the not-whisper-synced Audible narrated by Jason Culp. Both formats were very well done and I saw no errors. It was Scientifically accurate and limited itself to the known facts. I highly recommend this in either format for anyone interested in fishing, the Great Lakes, or North America in general. ""The year after The Lorax was published the United States and Canada agreed to work together to throttle the amount of phosphorus pumping into the lake."""
285,0393355551,http://goodreads.com/user/show/61115-kimber,4,"This book is a good basic overview of the history of the Great Lakes, with a heavy emphasis on invasive species that have entered the lakes over the years, or are close enough to the lakes now to be a threat. The reader learns about how the lakes were formed, how locks were created to make the lakes accessible to international freighters, and how this opening up of a previously closed off system allowed invasive species in. A good part of the middle of the book devotes a chapter to each invasive species, how native species of fish nearly died out, and how the populations might recover over time. Toward the end of the book, the changing water levels of the Great Lakes are addressed. I found this part particularly interesting because we are currently experiencing the highest Great Lakes water levels since the 80s – wind and waves are taking a toll on the sand dunes, which are shearing off, making waterfront yards shorter. Some homes have fallen into Lake Michigan.Holland State Park, in my hometown, has a pier that goes out into Lake Michigan, and a concrete boardwalk with a picnic table or two that runs along a channel and out to the pier. This past year during some heavy storms, the wind and waves washed out the sand in that area, and the boardwalk crumbled. The picnic tables that fell have been removed, but the broken boardwalk is still there.This book looks at the ecology of the lakes, and what humans have done to devastate the natural balance. Some of it I knew, but I learned a heck of a lot. The book was published just a few years ago, so the information in it is pretty up to date. I started out reading this book in print, but it was slow going and the delivery is a little dry. I switched to audio and it went along a lot more smoothly.

The history of the Great Lakes is as fascinating as it is troubling. I was expecting the book to be mainly about pollution and climate change. In fact, it takes over half the book to cover all the different invasive species, “biological pollution,” as the author calls them, that have been introduced to the lakes as a result of people either not caring or not thinking about the consequences of their actions as they manipulated nature to suit their interests. To be fair, I don’t think people in the past could have predicted every consequence, but after decades of problems, we should all be learning from past mistakes and doing better. The last chapter offers some small hope, as the author talked about fish evolving and adapting their diets to include mussels. On the other hand, the segment about the daughterless gene project just made me nervous. Hopefully the legal battles mentioned by the author will be won sooner rather then later. I wish I had read this when it was the Go Big Read selection. The book discussions were probably really good. I’ll get my discussion in the online classroom, which should be pretty good too. "

Upsetting, but there are also some glimmers of hope - it's amazing how quickly ecosystems can recover if you just, you know, LEAVE THEM THE F*CK ALONE. This book definitely makes the case for the utter destructiveness of the sport fishing and luxury boating lifestyles of the lakefront wealthy; the idea that you would continually stock the great lakes with nonnative Pacific salmon at the expense of native species, purely due to the preferences of sport fishers (apparently fishing for native trout and walleye is too ""boring"") - I mean. It's infuriating. But there's way, way more here, about invasive species and sewage treatment and canal building and water supply and agriculture and climate change -- Egan shows clearly that the fate of the Great Lakes is the fate of the entire continent.

I’m a little embarrassed that I’d never thought much about the Great Lakes prior to reading this book, even though I’ve been to two of them and lived in Wisconsin for 24 years. This book talks about some important shit (spoiler alert: the Great Lakes are way more important than you think!!!) and I’d highly recommend it to everyone. "
291,0393355551,http://goodreads.com/user/show/29714586-dana,5,This is a Very Important Book. The sheer amount of time and research that went into this book is mind-boggling. The writing is engaging and without the hyperbole frequently found in popular science writing. EVERYONE NEEDS TO READ THIS. Mandatory reading for adult American humans. Read it.
292,0393355551,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2199404-andy,3,"This is well-written. It just had more detail than I cared for about fish. The human element about a predicted, preventable disaster was very interesting. "
293,0393355551,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3350146-courtney-smith-atkins,5,Really great book full of facts and information. He tells the story of the great lakes without being politically forceful and allows the reader to take the information and have their own opinions. I wondered about a lot of these things when I was a kid. I finally got it all explained to me!! Slow start for sure on this book but it comes together.
294,0393355551,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3861150-marta-kate-jackson,4,"A must read for Great Lakes residents with an interest in environmental science, wildlife, and fisheries. A depressing, but realistic look at the human impact on the Great Lakes since the opening of the St. Lawrence Seaway via the Erie & Welland Canals. The author's experience as a journalist leads to a page turning read, complete with witty transitions & dramatic flair."
295,0393355551,http://goodreads.com/user/show/28255179-susan-morris,5,"What a fascinating read! I’m far from a science geek, but I love to find an author who can write about a scientific topic in a way I can understand & enjoy. This in-depth investigation of the Great Lakes and what we humans have done to them is fascinating & scary. In some ways they seem to be adapting & in other ways it seems hopeless that they can recover. I highly recommend this book! (Library)"

Death and Life of the Great Lakes provoked an excellent discussion. The group pointed out so many issues and ideas in the book that I hadn't spent much time considering because I was so busy worrying about Asian carp and toxic algae blooms. Everyone present for the book club has lived and traveled in the Great Lakes in the US and Canada and thought we knew all there is to know. We were surprised at how much we learned, and how nervous and enraged it makes us. We are all watching and listening a little closer and are more mindful stewards of our watershed. Thanks Dan Egan!"
297,0393355551,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2014051-morgan,3,"Equal parts fascinating, frightening, and boring (just being honest). Required reading for Great Lakes neighbors, IMO. I listened to the audiobook, which I wouldn’t recommend. I found it difficult to pay attention at times."
298,0393355551,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10794227-mary-jo,5,Wow!! Fascinating and disturbing. I had intended to skim it. Instead I read every word. Well written and well researched with an amazing history of mankind's horrible treatment of these beautiful lakes. It should be required reading for politicians.
299,0393355551,http://goodreads.com/user/show/57881852-kristen,5,"If you have any interest or connection to the Great Lakes this is a fascinating read. Great pacing, tons of information and organized thoughtfully. "
