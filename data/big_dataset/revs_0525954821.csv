Manny has asked us to review Sean Carroll's new book. I trust you've all read it?LUCRETIUS: Say, how come we're writing this for him? What's going on, Plato?PLATO: I owe Manny a little favor. Fellow-seekers after wisdom, we have eternity ahead of us. This won't take more than an aeon or two. Who's first?LUCRETIUS: Okay, I didn't like it much.PLATO: Would you care to elaborate, dear Lucretius?LUCRETIUS: Well, it's a cheap rip-off of De Rerum Natura.HUME: Modest as ever, I see.LUCRETIUS: Look, he's just updating my formula! Fear not the Gods, fear not death, there is nothing but atoms and void--LAPLACE: Quantum fields.LUCRETIUS: Whatever. He's done a good job on the philosophy, I grant you that. But come on guys, he calls it ""poetic naturalism"" and where's the poetry in his book? LAPLACE: Where's the naturalism in yours?HUME: Touch√©!LUCRETIUS: Now Pierre-Simon, you know that's not fair. I was writing in the first century B.C.LAPLACE: Well, you could have read Aristarchus. Or at least Hipparchus. Sean's naturalism is state of the art. [General murmurs of approval]PLATO: With all due respect, brother Lucretius, I think Pierre-Simon makes a fair point. If one wishes to defend naturalism, an understanding of nature is required. It is evident that Sean understands these -- ah -- quantum fields very well. And he has a gift for explaining them.LUCRETIUS: But the hexameters--PLATO: Sean maybe lacks a feeling for the poetics of words. But he sees the poetics of geometry.LAPLACE: I enjoyed his geometric demonstration that there can be no occult forces.PLATO: Yes, his use of the -- what was it called? --LAPLACE: Feynman diagram.PLATO: That was it. By turning the Feynman diagram through a right-angle, we see that all forces must already have revealed themselves. Very elegant. I must remember to show it to Eudoxus. Now, who else has comments?THE REV BAYES: It is unworthy of me to say this, but I was touched that he believed more in my little rule than in God.LAPLACE: You did well there, Tom.THE REV BAYES: Perhaps too well. I fear people like Sean may be disappointed when they find out that--ALL: Shhh!THE REV BAYES: I'm sorry, I forgot we were still live. Charles, you look like you want to say something?DARWIN: Well, I was also flattered that he took me so seriously. But remember, I always left open the question of how life originated. That ""warm little pond""--HUME: It's true, I did feel at times that Sean's protestations of rigorous scepticism were not entirely justified. I liked the kind things he said about me too. Though when he told us he was certain that science would soon understand the emergence of life, it almost sounded like--THE REV BAYES: Faith? There's nothing wrong with that, you know.HUME: Yes, but he says science isn't faith. I'd have felt reassured if he'd quoted Iris Fry's book. There's a woman after my own heart. But she's not even mentioned.WEYL: And the same story with the universe's low initial entropy. I wasn't afraid to compare it to a miracle in my book. But despite the fact that Sean constantly refers to the Past Condition, there's hardly a word about why the world might have started in this extraordinary state.PLATO: Gentlemen, gentlemen, please! Remember, it's easy for us to nitpick. Sean's just mortal. DARWIN: True. Well, he's better than Richard Dawkins. VOLTAIRE: And Christopher Hitchens.WEYL: And Victor Stenger.THE REV BAYES: Not to mention A.C. Grayling.[Elaborate facepalm from VOLTAIRE]PLATO: So, all in all, we don't think he's so bad.LUCRETIUS: No, no, his heart's in the right place. As Pierre-Simon said, he does a good job of explaining the atoms and void.LAPLACE: Quantum fields.LUCRETIUS: Whatever. I still can't forgive him for taking out my hexameters. But maybe that's just me. PLATO: Thank you Lucretius. Then, I hope that--HUME: Wait! If Sean's correct about the finality of death, then what are we all doing here?[A moment of general consternation]WITTGENSTEIN: Relax, everyone. We're only a figure of speech.PLATO: Ludwig, I don't know what we'd do without you. So, we're giving him a pass? All those in favor--EVERYONE EXCEPT HUME: Aye. Aye. AyeHUME: With the caveats already mentioned.PLATO: Duly noted, David. Now thank you again, gentlemen, you've all been very kind. The first round of ambrosia is on me."
1,0525954821,http://goodreads.com/user/show/155663-david,5,"This is a wonderful book about the meaning of our universe, and of life. Sean Carroll is an active theoretical physicist, and he brings some fresh new ideas to philosophy. He coins a new term, Poetic Naturalism. It stems from a quote by Muriel Rukeyser, The universe is made of stories, not atoms. While naturalism is the idea that only natural laws and forces (not supernatural or spiritual) operate in the world, poetic naturalism says that the way we find meaning to life does not naturally emerge from a purely scientific approach. Poetic naturalism encourages extending discussions into what is right and wrong. It integrates scientific reasoning methods into our purpose-seeking and meaning-making, with emphasis on Bayesian techniques.In 2003, a Dutch pediatric nurse was sentenced to life imprisonment for the murder of four children under her care. The case became a media sensation because, as it turned out, the case rested on the misuse of statistical reasoning. Infant mortality had actually been higher before she started working at the facility. The real cause of her conviction was psychological: People believe that infant deaths could not be random; someone must be to blame. Leibniz coined the Principle of Sufficient Reason: ""For any true fact, there is a reason why it is so, and why something else is not so instead.""But this Principle of Sufficient Reason is not necessarily true. A cancer survivor sells empathy cards that read, ""Please let me be the first to punch the next person who tells you that everything happens for a reason."" And, by the way, I fully support the thought behind these cards!Some things have reasons, while others do not. For example, the question, ""Why is there an accordion in my bathtub"" has a reason. But, ""Why is a proton almost 2000 times more massive than an electron might not have a reason or an answer.I rarely hear the true description of the big bang, but Sean Carroll writes that the big bang was a moment in time, not a location in space. It was not an explosion of matter into an empty void. It was the beginning of the entire universe, with matter smoothly distributed throughout space, all at once. The big bang really marks the end of our theoretical understanding. We understand what happened after it, but it is a label for a moment in time that we don't currently understand.On Earth, there is an up and down. In space, all directions are equal. In the everyday world, time has a definite direction. But really, both directions in time are equal. It is just that we live in the aftermath of the big bang. Physical motions are reversible. Of course eggs break and never unbreak. The real question is why eggs were unbroken in the past. There is an interesting chapter on why we remember the past and not the future (very relevant to the recent movie, ""Arrival""), that is why the arrow of time points toward the future. It is because of the increase in entropy since the big bang, and the second law of thermodynamics. There is a difference between reversible laws of physics and the concept of cause and effect. Laws of physics predict what will happen. They do not, however, dictate a cause as responsible for later events. Events are simply arranged in a certain order. No particular event is a cause.Sean Carroll writes that it is okay to doubt everything. He writes about ""planets of belief"", which is a wonderful metaphor. Science does not presume naturalism. Science concludes that naturalism is the the best available picture of the world.Sean Carroll wrote that no scientist working on the origin of life points to a particular process and says, ""Here we need some supernatural intervention."" And, some people say that evolution occurs too slowly for an experiment to observe. However, David Bartel and Jack Szostak performed an interesting experiment in 1993. They started with a random RNA molecule consisting of trillions of molecules in a random sequence of nucleotides. They picked out a fraction of them hat held higher rates of catalysis, and made copies of them. Random mutations occurred during copying. After ten iterations, the last pool of molecules was 3 million times better at catalyzing reactions than the original sample.The key to life is the set of instructions for chemical reactions that gets copied. Mutations in the instructions allows life to evolve with natural selection. In an experiment in 1988, Richard Lenski grew E. coli bacteria in flasks, along with specific nutrients. Every day he managed six generations of the bacteria. Over time, over thousands of generations, the bacteria evolved to better use the nutrients in the flasks. Michael Behe, a critic of natural selection, is an advocate of intelligent design. He introduced the concept of ""irreducible complexity"". And he used the example of a mousetrap. Every part of a mousetrap is essential; if any part is missing, it cannot work. However, Carroll points out that actual mousetraps were not designed overnight, but their design evolved over many years.A very interesting part of the book discusses the so-called ""Fine-Tuning"" argument for theism. The argument states that since many of the fundamental physical constants seem to be finely tuned for the development for galaxies, stars, planets, and chemistry that can support life, there must be a creator who ""designed"" these constants for this purpose. Sean Carroll admits that fine-tuning is the best argument for God's existence. However, it is still not a very good argument. It uses what Carroll calls ""old evidence."" It uses evidence that life exists, that we know already is true. The argument is not predictive.Carroll uses Bayesian reasoning to sort out how much credence one should give to naturalism versus theism, given that life requires the chemical reactions we observe in nature to occur. His argument against theism is that many aspects of nature are unnecessary for life. Two heavier families of elementary particles are not needed for life. All the billions of galaxies are unnecessary. Theism predicts that they should not exist.Carroll has an interesting approach to understanding whether we have free will. He describes how the so-called paradox of free will is really just an incompatibility between the languages of quantum mechanics (atoms and physical laws) and the human-scale world. When Carroll sums up his discussions, he writes that the majority of philosophers and scientists are naturalists today. But in the public sphere, religion and spirituality are most prominent. Our values need to catch up with science.I enjoyed this book so much! It is beautifully written, and well thought-out. Sean Carroll has a lot of new, interesting philosophical and scientific arguments, and makes many analogies and metaphors that help to explain his reasoning. He boils down a lot of the uncritical thinking of the past to the incorrect application of Bayesian reasoning, or no application at all. To my knowledge, this is a new idea; the application of Bayesian reasoning to philosophy should be very prominent in the future."
2,0525954821,http://goodreads.com/user/show/44487975-dannii-elle,4,"I received this on a read to review basis from NetGalley. Thank you to the author, Sean Carroll, and the publisher, Dutton, for the opportunity. A brief overview of this fascinating non-fiction can be written no more aptly than in the synopsis itself - ""In short chapters filled with intriguing historical anecdotes, personal asides, and rigorous exposition, readers learn the difference between how the world works at the quantum level, the cosmic level, and the human level--and then how each connects to the other.""The extensive research and knowledge put into this book is unparalleled to anything I have read before. This could very easily have become a dense and 'stodgy' feeling read, but the light, conversational tone led this to become, instead, a fascinating and understandable insight into the physics underlying the universe, the world and ourselves. The subject matter is dense and complex but it is approached using comprehensible anecdotes, simple analogies and a breaking down of the scientific laws to a layman's level. I found this was also a wonderful subjective and psychological insight into how human beings assign ourselves an importance, despite the briefness in the longevity of our existence, and attempt to bring order and understanding to the chaotic and incomprehensible laws of the universe."
3,0525954821,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2531665-charlene,5,"After having a countdown for this book, which spanned months, I woke up at 5 am on May 10th and thought, ""It's finally here!"" I opened my Audible library and it was better than Christmas. In the quiet of the morning, I began to listen to this deeply philosophical book and immediately fell in love with it. It felt like a Poetic Naturalist's version of Christmas- material gifts replaced by the gift of trying to understand the nature of our vast universe and the world in which we live. Those who have wanted to read Sean Carroll but didn't want to wade through the science will be happy with this book. In the spirit of Alexander von Humboldt, Carroll tucks much of the complex science away in an appendix for those who would like more detail. But, that doesn't mean this book is light on the science. To the contrary, Carroll, as usual, takes some of the most complex issues science has to offer, and packages them in a form that even people with little or no scientific background can understand. In fact, this book in particular is aimed at those who might have little education in the sciences and and even less education about heuristics. It welcomes everyone to join in a thoughtful conversation about understanding what we know about our world and the wider universe. Does it have a purpose? Does its design imply any type of creator? Instead of insulting those who say that it does (I am guilty of this myself), Carroll provided a real way to put our beliefs to the test. He was very willing to consider the views of those who believe in God and provide a detailed method, which is both kind and built on logic, that can help us figure out whether a belief is true. If the preceding paragraph suggests to you that those with extensive education in the sciences (including cognitive science) will be bored or find nothing new, then I have represented the book poorly. Even people whose undergrad and grad career consisted of many of the following courses will find new ways of thinking about that information and connecting it to the Big Picture. Samples of related course material:Intro to Cognitive Science (including Kahneman's heuristics)Cognitive Neuroscience Biochem (including chemiosmosis)Evolution (including environmental modification of genes)Origin of life research (including Martin, Russell, and Lane's work on bioenergetics and others working on RNA world)Philosophy of Mind Carroll opened the door for *everyone* to think about and discuss what evidence we would need for any belief to be validated. Instead of dismissing ideas of belief outright, Carroll employs a very gentle, yet fiercely logical style of problem solving. The result was powerful and reminded me of the deep humility and unfailing logic with which Darwin wrote his many books, including his autobiography. Prior to this book, if anyone had asked me if I wanted to read yet another book on creationism vs. science or the hard problem of consciousness (involving Chalmers unrealistic and pseudoscientific zombies), the answer would have been a resounding, ""NO!"" I feel as if too much of my thinking time has been wasted by these concepts that serve only to anchor our progress. I want to push past all of that. I want to never again allow that type of scientific sabotage to ruin the progress I might make in understanding the universe in a real and more complete way than my current view allows. Often reading about the efforts of those who wage war on evidence based knowledge leaves me frustrated, often wishing I could get that time back. That was not the case with this book. The whole time, even though I was reading things I thought I was tired of reading, my neurons were flooding my brain with wonderful dopamine bursts. Reflexive ""Wows"" kept reverberating from my brain. The book fits into the category ""MINDGASM!""In a book, which includes such topics as:how we know what we knowthe forces that govern the universe properties of elements in relation to other elementsquantum mechanicsemergence and complexityhow we gather and evaluate scientific evidenceCarroll, in his usual relatable fashion, seamlessly included discussions about today's relevant issues in society such as transgender rights, marriage equality. I recall reading E.O. Wilson's book Social Conquest Of Earth and feeling somewhat confused about the organization of the book. He kept social issues separate throughout the book and then bombarded the reader with a litany of important social issues. I love both Wilson and his book, but the social issues didn't fit and felt as if they should be in another book. Carroll's humorous (yet serious) approach when discussing such issues makes me feel as if I am reading a 20 something university student with his finger on the pulse of the upcoming generations, while at other times, when he is discussing concepts that take a long time to learn, I feel as if I am reading a book written by a scientifically minded Zarathustra. In a crazy way, this writing style really works. Parts One, Two, and Three (the first half of the book) were basically an excellent summary of and entire 4 year experience as a major in Cognitive Science. After introducing such concepts as understanding cause and effect, understanding how things move and how momentum is conserved, and understanding how we come to adopt our belief systems, Carroll examined the many heuristics we employ when trying to understand how we know what we know. To figure this out, he introduced a sort of ""best of"" collection of thinkers. Marrying Cog Sci 101 (with a strong emphasis on Baysian reasoning) with Epistemology and Philosophy 101, he tried to understand what thinkers such as Descartes and Princess Elizabeth of Bohemia, and Kahneman thought about the nature of reality. The main questions scholars have been asking are, ""How can I know what I know? How can I know what exists? How can I know if my beliefs reflect reality?"" A take home point from Section Two is that people are all entitled to have their own prior beliefs. However, they are not entitled to have their own likelihood. There is an objective likelihood to be discovered, and it takes solid reasoning, and not tightly held belief, to make that discovery. **** see note at end. While discussing heuristics, Carroll gave a shout out to one of my favorite books -- Mistakes Were Made, but Not by Me. I love that book and am often disappointed that not too many people I have talked to seem to appreciate it in the way I do. I love that it got the recognition it deserved. Many books like it are sort of self-help oriented and veer too far from the science. Many authors fail to question if they are using the very heuristics they are writing about. Still others fail to question the methods to the studies they choose to include, brining down the overall quality of the book. But, Tavris and Aronson did much better than most avoiding these pitfalls. They deserved some recognition, not from the self-help crowd, but rather from a scientists who is celebrated for his keen logic. In Part 4, Carroll related a humorous story about ending up on a plane, seated next to origin of life researcher Mike Russel. That was a great lead in to explaining Darwinian evolution, cellular formation, emergence, complexity (his complexity research sounds great! I am definitely going to read everything I can get my hand on concerning that), and ATP synthase (my very favorite protein channel!). If you are a bit fuzzy about what Free Energy is, this section will clear that up and relate it to exactly how your very own body works. (What a delicious section. I was too excited to see what came next. So I did not stop to listen again or take notes on this section. As soon as I am done writing this review, I am going to listen to this entire section again.) Theodosius Dobzhansky said, ‚ÄúNothing in Biology Makes Sense Except in the Light of Evolution‚Äù. Thanks to scientists such as Sean Carroll, Mike Russell, Jeremy England, and others bridging the gap between living and non living systems, it will soon be said that Nothing in Biology or the larger universe Makes Sense Except in the Light of Thermodynamics. If you want the best possible summary of how thermodynamics fits into the story of living systems (including how those systems likely came into being and how they evolved), then you will love this section. In Part Five, Carroll took on the philosophy of mind debate. You may have taken courses or read extensively about The Chinese Room, Mary, What it's Like to Be a Bat, Eliminative Materialism, and The Hard Problem. Even if you are extremely familiar with all of this, I would recommend reading Carroll's summary. Wow! I was engaged in a way that surprised me. He breathed new life into these debates. I was a tiny bit sad that he left out Andy Clark's work (especially in relation to Chalmers), but considering this book was more than 17 hours long (Audible), I understand that he didn't have time for everything. It's just that Clark's work (along with the Churchland's work) is what made Philosophy of Mind so great for me. Carroll ended the book with what I can only say was a beautiful essay I didn't know I needed to read. If you are unfamiliar with the Is vs Ought problem, you can find out in this section what it is and why should you care. If you are well familiar with this question, you will enjoy the discussion provided on Carroll about morality. Deeply satisfying! A+! He ended on a more personal note than any thing I have read by him to date. It was truly a lovely book, from start to finish. I think Carroll will be remembered along side of Copernicus and Darwin for providing us with gentle but clear evidence that we are not special. Far from being a depressing nihilistic view of the world and universe, Carroll showed his reader (even if you read with your ears) how reality is actually more special than any false belief about being special. Understanding can be the deepest religion of all (idk if Carroll would put it quite like that, but it's my takeaway message). ****I was going to include in this review a bit about Sean Carroll's ""planet v black hole belief system,"" but I posted about it on Facebook and butchered what was an excellent analogy. I can only say that you need to read it for yourself. If you get the analogy, you will forever ask yourself, ""Am I being a black hole right now? ""Am I following the evidence or am I fooling myself and holding tight to heuristically driven fallacies?"" I can see a new viral way of thinking springing from this analogy -- e.g. insults or memes that include the statement, ""Stop being such a black hole!"" "
4,0525954821,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6100646-brian-clegg,3,"Most popular science books either focus in on a specific bit of science, or explore the work of a particular scientist. However, every now and then, authors get the urge to go large - to take on life, the universe and everything. It‚Äôs what you might call the science writer‚Äôs midlife crisis - and this title typifies the genre.Of itself, this isn‚Äôt a bad idea, though it can be a struggle to decide how to organise such a vast subject matter, and the ‚Äòbig book‚Äô syndrome frequently rears its ugly head. Because this is a big topic, either the publisher or the author often feels it has to be a big book. This translates into a painfully long book, something this certainly is, at over 400 pages. The result is page after page of waffle, which in a subject that naturally inclines the author to philosophy can be more than a little deadening. So, for instance, although Sean Carroll does actually put quite a lot into his opening section, it can feel like he‚Äôs spent 80 pages saying ‚Äòthings do or don‚Äôt have a cause, depending on what they are and what you call a cause.‚Äô And there‚Äôs only so much you can take of that kind of thing.At the book's heart is the concept of poetic naturalism, which Carroll presents as the best scientific approach to universal topics. This amounts to having a clear naturalist approach (nothing is supernatural, everything can in principle be explained by reductionist means), but building on it the storytelling aspect of our understanding that takes us beyond the fundamentals like quantum theory to add on emergent aspects reflecting the world as we understand and experience it. The poetic naturalist knows that it's all particles and fields underneath, but accepts that we need the higher level stories to relate to the universe. Carroll covers this at great length in his six sections: Cosmos, Understanding, Essence, Complexity, Thinking and Caring.At page 159 we finally get away from philosophical hand waving, but given that, so far, Carroll has been hammering out each point at great length it's unfortunate that when he is on more familiar ground, he leaps into assumptions about what his readers understand. So we are told, for instance, that an electron in a hydrogen atom only gives off 'certain discrete wavelengths'. It's a shame that, while philosophical jargon was given pages of explanation, a word like 'discrete' which isn't commonly used the way physicists employ it, isn't given a brief explanation. When get onto the serious science bit, after acres of pages telling us about the difficulty of being certain of everything, it‚Äôs a wave of the magic wand and physics has all the answers (admittedly to a small subset of questions). It‚Äôs not that there‚Äôs anything wrong with the physics presented here, but the way it is described there seems a danger of falling into the trap Carroll himself identifies of declaring that nothing much new will emerge as we pretty well know it all. And after all the philosophical justifications and exploration, it feels unsatisfactory to be presented with the physics on a ‚Äòthis is how it is, and you have to believe it because I say so‚Äô basis. This comes across particularly strongly in the description of crossing symmetry. The lack of explanation and justification here is disappointingly different from Carroll‚Äôs lucidly explanatory From Eternity to Here.The good news is that in the next section (Complexity) things finally get both interesting and better explained. As we move into biology, Carroll continues to keep the writing interesting and delivers significantly more than he has to date. Unfortunately, this doesn't last and we head back to the philosophising and logic-chopping as Carroll makes one of several attempts to provide a logical consideration of the existence or non-existence of God, saying that the fine tuning of the universe is probably the best argument for theism, but it proves to be a weak one. There's something dated about attempts to make logical and/or Bayesian arguments for or against a deity and it just doesn't do a lot for the reader. This is followed by a long, occasionally interesting, philosophical discussion of the nature of consciousness.Towards the end of the book, interest is re-kindled with some thoughtful material on ethics and we finish with an absolutely lovely chapter, where Carroll relates his move from his early Christian beliefs to a naturalist viewpoint. This is the best writing in the whole book - simple yet personal, and far more effective as a flag carrier for atheism than any of Dawkins' raging.Overall it's an odd book and one that has way too much philosophising and meandering for me to have enjoyed it. Interesting nonetheless."
5,0525954821,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8079403-max,4,"Physicist Sean Carroll goes well beyond the ordinary bounds of his discipline in this wide ranging exposition. He begins with ontology, the fundamental nature of everything, and ends with how humans can derive meaning living in a world that is not transcendent. Along the way we get explanations of quantum field theory, quantum mechanics, entropy, Bayes Theorem, abiogenesis, evolution and consciousness. Much of the material does not represent new thinking, but one discussion stood out to me.In his excellent book, From Eternity to Here, Carroll explored the relationship between entropy and time in detail. Carroll shares his expertise in entropy in this volume. How does one explain the emergence of complex structures (planets, people, etc.) in a universe going from low to high entropy? He points out that these are vehicles for creating high entropy. They convert free (useful) energy to disordered (waste) energy. Whether through photosynthesis, fermentation or cellular respiration, living organisms are converting free energy from the sun to disordered energy in the ATP to ADP cycle they use for internal energy. As one of Carroll‚Äôs associates put it, ‚ÄúThe purpose of life is to hydrogenate carbon.‚Äù This idea of life as a process tied to the universe‚Äôs direction and fate through entropy was new to me. As Nobel Prize winner Albert Szent-Gyorgyi put it, ‚Äúlife is nothing but an electron looking for a place to rest‚Äù. Life becomes a solution to the problem of liberating free energy, something the universe is hell-bent to do. Needless to say there are other ways to look at life.Carroll proposes what he calls poetic naturalism, a scientific view of the world that is open to describing it on many levels at the same time. Thus we have the physicist‚Äôs view of particles, forces and fields, but equally valid are operational views of emergent states. Human beings and human behavior are emergent states from the underlying physics. Biology and psychology provide objective views of emergent states while morality and esthetics provide subjective views. The fundamental reality of physics is not the reality we experience. Our conscious decision making and human relationships are best evaluated in their own terms. Every theory has its own domain of applicability. Thus mixing, for example, psychology and quantum mechanics in the same description is likely to lead to gobbledygook. Throughout Carroll defends his views from the common attacks of religionists, creationists and others with supernatural beliefs. Unfortunately, these people are unlikely to read his book or be convinced by his arguments. For those of us that accept science and nature as it is, this is space Carroll could have used for something more productive. For example, Carroll points to the conservation of momentum to explain that the universe does not need a mover. It operates on its own. I doubt this science based logic will change any minds. Carroll covers a lot of ground presenting his poetic naturalist vision. He takes us from his home ground of physics to biology and even morality. I found little to disagree with but also little new with some notable exceptions such as the relationship between entropy and life. I am struck by the need of some brilliant people like Carroll (Richard Dawkins also comes to mind) to defend so hard against inane beliefs. It seems like a hopeless task, but it is understandable given the relentless attacks on science in America today. Carroll also clearly felt the need to show that one could have values, embrace morality and live a meaningful life without belief in the supernatural. I applaud him in that effort."

7,0525954821,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4947834-dave-ciskowski,2,"A disappointing book; despite its potential, I can‚Äôt recommend it. Carroll‚Äôs tenet ‚Äî the idea he calls ‚Äúpoetic naturalism‚Äù ‚Äî is appealing to me and would be worthy of a good exploration. Unfortunately, Carroll spends most of his time exploring the ‚Äúnaturalism‚Äù side of his philosophy, which amounts to knocking over cardboard opponents. The early phases of the book (where Carroll is on his most certain scientific ground) read as an interesting tour of the current state of cosmology and the Standard Model, and why they leave no room for non-physical influences. It‚Äôs no accident that the firmest parts of his argument are where he‚Äôs essentially focused on the ‚Äònaturalism‚Äô side of ‚Äòpoetic naturalism‚Äô. I was intensely interested in the later sections, where Carroll tackles more complex phenomena such as consciousness, intelligence, free will, and ethics. Sadly, these chapters are far less illuminating, as he basically spends them in tiresome arguments against dualism ‚Äî neither philosophically interesting nor rhetorically convincing.One example, just because it‚Äôs near to my heart. Carroll spends most of a chapter attacking John Searle‚Äôs Chinese Room argument. The issue isn‚Äôt necessarily the argument itself ‚Äî though Carroll treads no new ground there. The problem is that he spends his time criticizing a view that Searle did not hold (property dualism) and in so doing, attacks the Chinese Room in its weakest and least interesting form. Whether or not Searle is right, the interesting question that he raises ‚Äî whether a computer program of sufficient complexity would be necessarily conscious ‚Äî is left unaddressed by Carroll. It‚Äôs exactly these questions that ‚Äúpoetic naturalism‚Äù could have had the most interesting insights to offer; instead, Carroll knocks over yet another straw man on his march to conclude his exercise.The later sections, dealing with how we can develop ethics and meaning from a purely physical world, are well-written as articulations of his personal ethos, and I appreciated his enthusiasm. Yet I did not find any fresh insight or new perspective here either. Perhaps another reader, struggling with these questions, would take inspiration from them ‚Äî they truly are movingly written. But I wasn‚Äôt that reader.These are difficult questions and I certainly wouldn‚Äôt fault Carroll for not having answers for them. But he doesn‚Äôt even fully engage with the questions. A book-length argument for naturalism doesn‚Äôt say anything useful: those who agree with him won‚Äôt find much new to consider, and those who disagree won‚Äôt abandon their faith. If he had more to say for the poetic side of his account ‚Äî how multiple levels of theory and examination are necessary for explaining the world we inhabit ‚Äî I‚Äôd be much happier with the book. I‚Äôd love to have a beer with Carroll and get his thoughts on these more interesting questions; my guess is that he feels on less firm ground here and didn‚Äôt want to risk a more ambitious discussion. The reader, though, suffers as a result."
8,0525954821,http://goodreads.com/user/show/25360918-blair,2,"Poetic Naturalism: Not a Good Way of TalkingThe ‚ÄúBig Picture‚Äù is an attempt by a physicist to explain our universe, up to and including culture. It begins with naturalism, the concept that there is a single, objective reality that follows a set of laws. We can discover those laws by observing that reality using scientific method. The author extends that (or dilutes it) to something he calls ‚ÄúPoetic Naturalism‚Äù. This means, in his words:1) There are many ways of talking about the world. 2) All good ways must be consistent with each other and with the world.3) Our purposes in the moment determine the best way of talking.As I explore this book, I will try to explain why it is not is a very good way of talking about science. I also question what it has to do with poetry.Emergence: More Than a Just Another Way of TalkingHow can all the complexity that makes up life arise from only a few fundamental particles or forces? This requires the concept of emergence, meaning that complex systems have properties not found in their underlying components. In my opinion this is one of the most fundamental ideas in science, which is often ignored or only mentioned in passing. At least this book considers it in some detail.The example of emergence he uses is air. At the microscopic level it is composed of individual molecules. But we can think of it as a fluid, with properties such as temperature that emerge from the underlying chaos of molecules flying around. But this example does not really support his conception that levels of emergence are completely separate. He tells us,‚ÄúWithin their respective domains of applicability, each theory is autonomous. Organisms can be alive, even if their constituent atoms are not. Animals can be conscious even if their cells are not.‚ÄùThe vital concept missing here is a bridging theory that links the different levels of emergence. In the air example the bridge is clear: the temperature of the fluid is the average speed of the individual molecules. There are bridges from quantum mechanics to chemistry to biology to neurology. On the other hand, the bridge to being alive or conscious is not so clear. This is the mystery I would love someone who knows that they are talking about to explore. I am still waiting. It seems this author would rather indulge in vague language than build bridges.‚ÄúSo the fluid and molecular description are two different ways of talking about air.‚ÄùWhile trivially true, it obscures the reason why the descriptions need to be different. The real problem begins with the following idea that is repeated throughout the book:‚ÄúThere is only the quantum wave function. Everything else is a convenient way of talking.‚ÄùI take this to mean that any science about emergent properties, meaning anything other than physics, is second rate, just a different way of talking about what the fundamental quantum wave functions do. It is curious that the term reductionism is mentioned by name only once in this book, where he appears to dismiss it out of hand. Yet how else can one interpret the following?‚ÄúUnderstanding what quantum fields and particles are and how they interact with each one another is a crucial part of comprehending what it means to be human.‚ÄùThis flatly contradicts what he has just told us about the meaning of emergent properties. We do not need to know anything about fields or atoms to understand humans. Unfortunately, such contradictions are characteristic of this book.The Universe and Beyond‚ÄúSo the big bang does not actually mark the beginning of our universe; it marks the end of our theoretical understanding.‚ÄùWhat a beautiful way to express the limits of what science can explain! If only he would keep that in mind. Since we don‚Äôt know how our universe began, what does it mean to conjure up other universes?I think of the multiverse as a kind of cosmic attic ‚Äì a place where we put the stuff we don‚Äôt know what to do with. Why do particles end up in specific places when they come from a wave that is everywhere? Lets invent a new universe for every place they could appear. Is it a problem that string theory makes a gazillion contradictory predictions? Not if we make each one of them true in a different universe. It couldn‚Äôt be a problem with the theory itself. We are told that when you apply the uncertainty principle to the theory of the early rapid expansion of the universe, you get ‚Äúeternal inflation‚Äù and an infinite universe. Could this be a sign that the theory is broken? Not when it gives us the logical equivalent to a multiverse - what a great place to put all the string theory universes! Never mind that cosmic inflation was developed from general relativity rather than string theory.Perhaps the reader should be informed that these are three independent types of hypothetical multiverse, not multiple lines of evidence supporting a single multiverse theory. Oh well, I suppose all the multiverses let us be pleasantly diverse and inclusive with all our incomplete theories.Disorderly Thinking About Time‚ÄúIt is the tendency for entropy to increase that is responsible for time‚Äôs arrow.‚Äù The second law of thermodynamics states that any system will tend to become more disordered (or have higher entropy) unless external work is done on it. There is another view that this ‚Äúlaw‚Äù, rather than being fundamental, amounts to a tautology: the most likely future path of a system is the path that is most probable. Perhaps entropy is simply an emergent property of discrete objects appearing in the universe. Just as temperature emerges from the speed of the air molecules of a gas, entropy emerges from their distribution. If entropy drives the emergence of time, one might expect that time flows at different rates depending on the local entropy, which we do not observe. Another view is that if general relativity is valid, space and time are intimately connected, and an expanding universe means that space-time itself is expanding. This predicts that new time will be created at the same rate everywhere in space.Instead we are given a strange theory of how increasing entropy somehow leads to the development of complexity, apparently derived from observing cream poured into coffee. [I am not making this up.] But remember the part about external work reversing entropy? That work is done by gravity. However universe started, after the emergence of matter led to hydrogen atoms scattered around in a highly disordered state. Gravity pulled the atoms together to form stars, and eventually planets that can support life. Gravity is the fundamental anti-entropy force in the universe that makes stars, planets and life possible. How could he leave this out?Scepticism and AuthorityScepticism is the fundamental attitude required for scientific thinking. It does not mean to conveniently reject what you disagree with. It means question everything. There is no unquestioned authority, but there is relevant expertise that should be respected.In the above paragraphs this amateur has questioned the authority of an accomplished expert in quantum physics. I have no right to an opinion in that subject. However, it is legitimate to observe that other equally good experts have differing views on these questions. While I have no right to decide which is true, I must conclude that these are still open questions, more open than this book suggests. There are a lot of open questions in science.I think it is a common problem that scientists are used to advocating their viewpoints to other scientists who already understand the range of scientific opinion. When writing for the general public, they often forget the need to explain the competing viewpoints and the degree of scientific consensus about them. But here, it seems he is leaving out other viewpoints entirely.A Bad Premonition: The End of Psychic PowersHis treatment of psychic powers is so heavy-handed that it resembles what one finds in pseudoscience. What do I mean by that?A standard pseudoscience trick is to misrepresent the theory under attack. For example, the theory of evolution presented by Creationists bears little resemblance to the actual theory. Here he constantly refers to psychic powers as spoon bending. As far as I know, there is only one person claiming to be able to bend spoons with his mind. Contrary to this straw man, the usual claim of psychics is that information can flow from one person to another over great distances. Information is much lighter than spoons.There is another pseudoscience technique that I call immunization. Spell out the fallacy you are about to employ, claim that you understand all about it and of course you would not do such a thing. Then liberally employ the trick. Now watch it in action:‚ÄúWhat we know about the laws of physics is sufficient to rule out the possibility of true psychic powers. That is a very strong claim. And more that a little bit dangerous: the trash heap of history is populated by scientists claiming to know more than they really do, or predicting that they will know almost everything any day now.‚ÄùHe then gives a number of historical examples of scientists doing exactly that. But,‚ÄúMy claim is different. I am claiming we know some things, and those things are enough to rule out some other things ‚Äì including bending spoons with the power of your mind.‚ÄùAgain, rather than bending spoons, psychics claim they are transmitting or receiving information. I do not see how a theory that claims its fields permeate the entire universe can rule this out. If quantum time really is a superposition of all moments, as he tells us, then even clairvoyance can look somewhat within the realm of possibility.I do not claim to understand his technical explanation about why quantum field theory rules out other forces. I rather doubt that it can rule out life after death, as he claims. No theory can rule out what is outside that theory. That amounts to a claim of clairvoyance.The reason to be sceptical about psychic powers is that they are difficult to demonstrate in a repeatable experiment. If we could reliably replicate psychic spoon bending, we would then have to modify quantum field theory. That is how science works ‚Äì evidence first, theory follows.Who Am I? Or, What Could I Possibly Be Thinking?We just saw an example of scientific overreach ‚Äì making a statement with a certainty that cannot be justified. Now we suddenly encounter the opposite, where scientific method gets tossed out the window when it comes to human beings. A remarkable (not in a good way) chapter titled ‚ÄúWho Am I?‚Äù addresses the currently popular transgender issue.‚ÄúFor many people, the concepts of ‚Äòmale‚Äô and ‚Äòfemale‚Äô are deeply rooted in the fabric of the world. Poetic naturalism sees things differently. Categories such as ‚Äúmale‚Äù and ‚Äúfemale‚Äù are human inventions ‚Äì stories we tell because it helps us make sense of our world. The basic stuff of reality is a quantum wave function. Everything else is an overlay, a vocabulary created by us for particular purposes. Therefore, if a person has two X chromosomes and identifies as male, what of it?‚ÄùA quantum wave function is also a ‚Äúhuman invention‚Äù. Categories such as male and female are ‚Äúhuman inventions‚Äù that encapsulate our best description of how reproduction in all complex life is fundamentally different from that of bacteria. In science, words have specific meanings. If a person has two X chromosomes, she is by definition genetically female. If you want to talk about the relationship between gender and behaviour, then find the appropriate language without changing the meaning of existing words.I will quote the next few paragraphs in full so you can see how he mixes subjective and objective thinking for yourself:‚ÄúThis can sound reminiscent of the old postmodern slogan that reality is socially constructed. [Yes, it certainly does.] There is a sense in which that is true. What is socially constructed are the ways we talk about the world, and if a particular way of talking involves concepts that a useful and fit the world quite accurately, it is fair to refer to those concepts as ‚Äòreal‚Äô. But we cannot forget that there is a single world underlying it all, and there is no sense in which the underlying world is socially constructed. It simply is, and we take on the task of discovering it, and inventing vocabularies with which to describe it.‚Äù‚ÄúPeople who think that transgenderism is a violation of the natural order sometimes like to use a slippery slope argument: If gender and sexuality are up for grabs, what about our basic identify as human beings? Is our species socially constructed?‚Äù[A better term for ‚Äúslippery slope‚Äù is false dichotomy. On one side there is an arbitrary and rigid definition of what gender roles should be, and on the other the idea that gender is an arbitrary construction and we can be whatever we want. But now he slides us all the way down that slippery slope.]‚ÄúThere is, indeed, a condition known as ‚Äòspecies dysphoria‚Äô. It is analogous to gender dysphoria but is characterized by a conviction that the subject belongs to a different species. Someone might think that, despite their nominal human form, they are actually a cat or a horse. Others go further, identifying with species that do not actually exist, like dragons or elves.‚Äù‚ÄúSo poetic naturalism does not automatically endorse or condemn someone who thinks they are a dragon, or for that matter someone who thinks they are male or female. Rather, it helps us understand what questions we should ask: What vocabulary gives us the most insight into how this person is thinking and feeling? What helps us understand how they can be happy and healthy? What is the most useful way of conceptualizing this situation? We can certainly imagine thinking through these questions in good faith, and at the end concluding with ‚ÄòSorry, Kevin. You are not a unicorn.‚Äô ‚Äù[Then why not, ‚ÄúSorry, Kevin, your Y chromosome means you are not a woman.‚Äù]‚ÄúThe real lives of people whose self-conceptions do not match those that society would like them to have can be extremely challenging, and their obstacles are highly personal. No amount of academic theorising is going to solve those problems with a single gesture. But if insist on talking about such situations on the bases of outdated ontologies, chances are high that we will end up doing more harm than good.‚ÄùYes, actions have consequences. We should indeed be sceptical about ‚Äúoutdated ontologies‚Äù while remembering that traditional morality is the product of centuries of social evolution and may contain some truths based on long experience. We should therefore be even more sceptical about modern, constructed ontologies that are not based on evidence. They also have consequences and can do harm.I suppose his writing might seem to be balanced and reasonable. I disagree. I think it is a false balance, slipping in ideas that are hostile to the spirit of science. He chooses to use the loaded term ‚Äúsocial construction‚Äù which really means an arbitrary arrangement, usually imposed by the ruling elite to maintain their power over society. It is an explicit claim that the only reality is about relationships of power. This is the philosophy of subjectivism ‚Äì the idea that we can believe whatever we want to believe to achieve our social goals. While he insists there is an underlying reality, one gets the impression there is no way to address emergent reality scientifically, so all we can do is ‚Äúconstruct‚Äù ways of talking about it. The reader is left to cross the thin line to the next step, to construct any reality that conforms to their social world view.What Happened to Scientific Method?Scientific method is not a specific technique; it is a way of thinking that can be applied to any aspect of reality. It means challenging everything based on the best evidence available, recognizing uncertainty, and knowing when the evidence is insufficient to draw firm conclusions. Humility is (or should be) at its core. Unfortunately, scientists do not always live up to this standard. At least, when they do not, there is an objective way to challenge them. There is no way to challenge a subjectivist, as any opinion is arbitrarily constructed.Human beings are not an arbitrary construction, or a blank slate. We have evolved over time to adapt to a changing environment. Our distinctive feature is our ability to cooperate, to behave as a social organism. Morality is how individuals modify their behaviour to make social cooperation possible. It has a genetic base with a culturally learned overlay. For those of us for whom evolutionary theory is not just another way of talking, this means there is an objective basis for morality that can be understood using scientific method.That does not mean science can give us a complete and authoritative theory of morality that can be tested in a laboratory. It means we should question all moral concepts, including modern ones, and try to understand their consequences on the basis of evidence as much as possible. Using critical thinking rather than believing what is socially convenient means avoiding the following:‚ÄúDeciding how to be good is not like solving a math puzzle, or discovering a new fossil. It is like going out to dinner with a group of friends. We think about what we want for our individual selves, talk to others about their desires and how we can work together, and reason about how to make it happen.‚ÄùDinner with like-minded friends is a recipe for groupthink. I suppose he picked up his moral relativism from his academic dinner mates.I Have No Need For This Way of TalkingLet me mention one last logical fallacy: transfer of authority. An expert in physics is not necessarily an expert in philosophy or morality. In this case I often felt I was reading a guy who has read the same books I have. But he failed to pick up the message that there is no room for subjectivism in science. It is as if he has made a deal with the devil to let him keep the integrity of physics, but all the other emergent sciences (or ‚Äúdifferent ways of talking‚Äù) get thrown under the relativist bus.Ideas and language have consequences. For example, if biology is just a way of talking, the benefits of immunization are simply a social construction. If you do not like this kind of thinking, then do not use the language that leads there. There is another word for the constructionist fallacy:‚ÄúAlternative Facts‚Äù The other side has learned to play the game. After all, it is just another way of talking. Although there is much of value here, I find it difficult to recommend a book that sells out the very integrity of science. He is a good writer, and I would happily read a book that sticks to his field of expertise. However, I will take my naturalism without the poor excuse for poetry, thank you very much."

It's a little too much too long too high-level philosophy, re-iterating the same things over and over again, and just overall meh. Someone else less familiar with physics might like it.EDIT: I accidentally read this book again forgetting that I already had. I have to start by saying that I actually love Sean Carroll and adore his presentation/teaching ability. That said, I had to skip over a bunch of it because the book is primarily a work of philosophy and history, and a concatenation of the first 2 paragraphs of popular science articles on topics of physics. The part I actually loved was the Appendix, where he discusses the Core Theory in quite a lot of detail. If that 2 page explanation was expanded into the length of this book it would be an easy 5/5."

Sean Carroll is a cosmologist and physicist at the California Institute of Technology, and his previous books dealt with that subject. Carroll‚Äôs new book is about an even bigger topic ‚Äì everything. What Carroll attempts to do is give the big picture of our existence, and he does a fine job. He combines science, philosophy, religion, psychology and other subjects, to show why no one explanation works. There can be no general theory of everything. Carroll explains how our understanding of how things functions depends on the domain of what we‚Äôre describing. So, explanations of the unseen world quantum mechanics do not explain everyday human behavior.

11,0525954821,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9590631-mark,4,"Can meaning and purpose be found and explained within a non-theistic (vs. an atheistic - related, but different) worldview? Sean Carroll argues that not only is it possible, but the only reasonable perspective. He creates a new paradigm, which he calls poetic naturalism to explain how he joins science, philosophy, and a naturalistic worldview with one that also allows for wonder, mystery, joy, purpose, and meaning in life. Poetic naturalism contends that we have different ways of talking about reality depending on scope and context. We use different vocabularies when we talk about stuff at the quantum level than we do at the level of a complete human organism. We use different vocabularies when we move on to the universe and the cosmos. Poetic naturalism borrows the language of poetry to tell different stories at each different level. Each story makes sense and is meaningful within proper contexts. The problem that often occurs in discourse about naturalism, science, worldviews, philosophy, and life is that words used in one domain don't mean the same thing when used in another. Carroll argues that even though at the atomic level, discussion of meaning and purpose makes no sense, at increasingly more macro levels meaning and purpose become increasingly emergent. We can talk about purpose of simple organisms; we can talk about purpose of more complex ones; and we can finally talk about purpose at the human level. We use the same word, yet at each level the semantics are different. In this book Carroll provides evidence and argument against any kind of outside force or influence being involved in the universe as we currently observe and know. He provides comprehensive arguments against commonly used theistic arguments in favor of Creationism (of any kind) - this includes the ""watchmaker"" argument, intelligent design, and more. This book is for the mainstream public, but I think understanding it is easier if the reader is already familiar with physics, quantum physics, astrophysics, cosmology, higher mathematics, biology, neuroscience, philosophy, and religion. I think it is important for theists to examine the arguments and reasoning found in this book. They may discover that what they've assumed about arguments for theism aren't nearly as strong as they've thought. Or that non-theists possibly can't have meaning, purpose, ethics, or morals is a myth; and conversely that belief in God is required for ethics and morals. They may also discover that what they've been taught about science and naturalism looks quite a bit different than what it actually looks like within today's scientific theories.For naturalists Carroll provides avenues for more nuanced dialogue about science and how it shapes their worldview. It elevates storytelling as a more effective means of communication than a mere offering of raw data, facts and theories. He provides common ground in which all can strive to work toward a better world. (This review based on ARC provided by the publisher through NetGalley.)"

There is very little evidence, based on the initial dozen chapters, that Sean Carroll really is a theoretical physicist at Cal Tech. While he most likely is, this book is just an unlistenable mess that I started skipping through after a few chapters, and then gave up on about halfway through. "

I would recommend this book who doesn't know Dr. Carroll from the interwebs and I think he is a good writer and I like his grand work here but I think i like his earlier works better. Still I like this synthesis of science and philosophy a lot and I think he gets his picture right.February 7, 2017,  Upon doing a much more careful listening on Audible I have gotten a lot better appreciation for this book and Carroll's understanding of poetic naturalism. I can sign on to 99% of what Carroll endorses in terms of the science and philosophy of the book. I might fight him on his interpretation of consciousness and the status of philosophical zombies but as for the rest of his vision of poetic naturalism I find it satisfying and beautiful and more importantly probably the closest to the truth.

Not the ideas themselves, something else - the attempt to cover everything? The lukewarm philosophy? Still, highly admire the author, and can only recommend his blog"
15,0525954821,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1339246-gendou,5,"Carroll introduces a philosophical idea he calls ""poetic naturalism"" in which the ontology includes objects which are useful in talking about the world at a given scale or levels of detail. For example, we can talk about people when it's useful to do so, and not worry that people are just made up of atoms and without getting distracted by questions like which is the last atom that's part of ""me"" on the tip of my finger.The book takes the reader from the beginning of science with Newton's laws of motion up to modern day quantum field theory. This is structured like a survey of physics so as not to let any novice readers get lost. He does a great job of explaining why psychic powers can't be real, why ""qualia"" and ""philosophical zombies"" are dumb, etc. He introduces a cool analogy of a ""planet of belief"" which represents all the things a person believes. Every person has a different ""planet of belief"", and they can be stable or unstable, etc. He smacks down the idea that science, like religion, requires ""faith"". He tackles the hard and soft problems of consciousness. He says the soft problem is really hard, and the hard problem is a misunderstanding.There's a whole lot of talk about god in this book. I'm not sure why. He does say its important because so many people believe in god. The topic is approached with a lot of caution which seems to me an attempt to avoid turning away theists. That's nice, but I felt like he was treating religious ideas with kid gloves and that's not too fun for me to read. It's also boring. I want to hear that space stuff!Here are some claims in the book which I consider mistakes.* He claims ""there's nothing about quantum mechanics that necessarily invalidates determinism."" Um, what about the part where observations are random?! He invokes the MWI and says the ensemble (multiverse) is deterministic. But this doesn't work because you don't do quantum mechanics using the ensemble. You use the same maths using MWI to make the same non-deterministic predictions about what's likely to happen when you make a measurement. A theory is deterministic, by my reading, if there's an unique prediction when evolution forwards in time given fully specified initial conditions. This is true for Newtonian mechanics, and untrue for Quantum Mechanics. If you look at MWI as providing an unique solution evolving forwards in time, you do so at the cost of all predictive power, because we have no way to tell which path down the infinity of branching universes our reality has taken.* He claims there's nothing in the practice of science that excludes supernatural explanations from the start. Actually, there is. The word ""supernatural"" generally means a force beyond scientific understanding or the laws of nature. So it's unscientific by definition! But even if we grant the most charitable definition of ""supernatural"" as being merely inconsistent with known laws of physics, we still have a problem. Scientific theories must be falsifiable. A supernatural claim is one of an exception which has been found to the laws of physics. If this exception is explained by some new hypothesis, we must test that hypothesis. If found true, this new hypothesis is added into what we mean by ""the laws of physics"". So a supernatural claim, when unsupported, shouldn't be believed at all, and is rightly rejected by anyone practicing the process called science. And as support for the claim's truth becomes available, it *must* become consistent with the other laws of science. This process can be gradual or rapid, depending on the nature of the evidence, but at no time is any natural explanation ""supernatural"", and at no point is any ""supernatural"" explanation necessary much less allowed in scientific discourse!* He claims the universe could be just a bit larger than what we observe. His point here is that we should remain skeptical about unknowns, and not assume the way the universe looks here matches how it looks elsewhere, or even assume there is an elsewhere! This is subtly incorrect. We actually do have some knowledge about that which lies outside our observable universe! If spacetime were curved such that the size of the universe were finite and on the order of the observable universe, we'd expect an enormously positive value for the curvature of the universe. Which we don't see. Also, if the universe relatively close to (but outside) the horizon of our observable universe were significantly anisotropic, we'd notice the impact of this anisotropy on objects close to (but inside) the horizon. The isotropy of the observable universe is very precisely known. So, he's made an overly naive claim because it ignores important lines of evidence about what lies outside the horizon of our observable universe, where that evidence can be gathered from right here within the horizon."

18,0525954821,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2209582-ross,3,"Quite interesting philosophical discussion of what we know, what we can know, and what we can't know. The author is a professor of physics and begins with a review of the history of what we have learned about the laws of physics He then launches into a discussion of philosophical belief systems contrasting those of theism and atheism. He describes his belief in a system termed ""poetic naturalism."" The naturalism part is that there are no gods, no creators, no life after death, etc. In other words, ""what you see is what you get."" The poetic part refers to a deep appreciation of the great beauty of our natural world. He discusses the fact that we can't really know, or prove, which system of belief is actually true. It is just a question of what is most likely given what we can see and measure. Some people believe the universe started last Thursday; maybe but not likely. Same with souls and spirits."

Having read 33% of it, an investment of several irreplacable hours of my life, I have found precious little science, and chapter after chapter...after chapter...of philosopical preaching about the foolishness of those who put any credence in the supernatural. I surrender!Look, I have no problem with atheism! It is a perfectly reasonable way of looking at the world, particularly from a physicist. But whether you are pontificating about religion or atheism, after awhile it becomes condescending! It is like, ""Okay, I get it! The universe functions fine by itself! Now to the science of how!"" But no! The philosophy lesson coninues!The last 67% of the book might be wonderful, and filled with wonders of the universe I will now never learn, because I can't take any more preaching! "
20,0525954821,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6593669-whitney-milam,5,I finally have a term to sum up my own personal philosophy toward life (which was certainly deepened and expanded by reading this book): poetic naturalism. 
21,0525954821,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2492588-katie,4,"I bought this at an airport bookstore, mostly because I admired the audacity of someone who would write a book about life, meaning, and the universe and slap it all on the cover. I'm pretty much the audience for this book. I like science but have zero formal training in it; I like books that are overly ambitious in their scope. I also went into this book (without realizing it) already having essentially the same philosophical and religious views as the author. That made for a somewhat satisfying read, if never a particularly challenging one. Carroll is a decent writer - nothing spectacular, but always clear and approachable. He's one of the rare science writers I've come across that shows a regular respect for historical thinkers who were clever but also wrong. He's also quite good at deploying analogies to explain difficult concepts (I especially liked this discussion of time and entropy). That said, I'd imagine this book is a bit of mixed bag for actual, trained scientists. It's relatively light on hard science and if you're not already on board with Hugh Everett's multi-world explanation of quantum mechanics, this is certainly not going to convince you. But that's okay. That's not really what this book is trying to do. It's fitting that the books' last chapter is called ""Existential Therapy"" - Carroll's book is really designed as a philosophical statement, as a gentle ""it'll all be okay"" to people who look at quantum mechanics with existential dread. I was already pretty much on board before I started reading it, so I can't say how effective it'd be at convincing non-believers. But it's still an interesting, engaging book, filled with clever analogies and a broader, humanistic view of the world. "
22,0525954821,http://goodreads.com/user/show/69500282-hamid,5,"Sean Carroll speaks of a new idea called poetic naturalism. The poet Muriel Rukeyser once wrote, ‚ÄúThe universe is made of stories, not of atoms.‚Äù The world is what exists and what happens, but we gain enormous insight by talking about it‚Äîtelling its story‚Äî indifferent ways.Naturalism comes down to three things:1. There is only one world, the natural world.2. The world evolves according to unbroken patterns, the laws of nature.3. The only reliable way of learning about the world is by observing it.Essentially, naturalism is the idea that the world revealed to us by scientific investigation is the one true world. The poetic aspect comes to the fore when we start talking about that world. It can also be summarized in three points:1. There are many ways of talking about the world.2. All good ways of talking must be consistent with one another and with the world.3. Our purposes in the moment determine the best way of talking.A poetic naturalist for example will agree that both Captain Kirk and the Ship of Theseus are simply ways of talking about certain collections of atoms stretching through space and time.Here's some quotes from the book: - To understand time, it helps to start with space. Here on the surface of theEarth, you would be forgiven for thinking that there is an intrinsic differencebetween the directions ‚Äúup‚Äù and ‚Äúdown,‚Äù something deeply embeddedinto the fabric of nature. In reality, as far as the laws of physics are concerned,all directions in space are created equal. If you were an astronaut,floating in your spacesuit while you performed an extravehicular activity,you wouldn‚Äôt notice any difference between one direction in space and anyother. The reason why there‚Äôs a noticeable distinction between up and downfor us isn‚Äôt because of the nature of space; it‚Äôs because we live in the vicinityof an extremely influential object: the Earth.Time works the same way. In our everyday world, time‚Äôs arrow is unmistakable,and you would be forgiven for thinking that there is an intrinsicdifference between past and future. In reality, both directions of time arecreated equal. The reason why there‚Äôs a noticeable distinction between pastand future isn‚Äôt because of the nature of time; it‚Äôs because we live in the aftermathof an extremely influential event: the Big Bang.- Among the small but passionate community of probability-theory aficionados, fierce debates rage over What Probability Really Is. In one campare the frequentists, who think that ‚Äúprobability‚Äù is just shorthand for ‚Äúhowfrequently something would happen in an infinite number of trials.‚Äù If yousay that a flipped coin has a 50 percent chance of coming up heads, a frequentistwill explain that what you really mean is that an infinite numberof coin flips will give equal numbers of head and tails.In another camp are the Bayesians, for whom probabilities are simplyexpressions of your states of belief in cases of ignorance or uncertainty. Fora Bayesian, saying there is a 50 percent chance of the coin coming up headsis merely to state that you have zero reason to favor one outcome over another.If you were offered to bet on the outcome of the coin flip, you wouldbe indifferent to choosing heads or tails. The Bayesian will then helpfullyexplain that this is the only thing you could possibly mean by such a statement,since we never observe infinite numbers of trials, and we often speakabout probabilities for things that happen only once, like elections or sportingevents. The frequentist would then object that the Bayesian is introducingan unnecessary element of subjectivity and personal ignorance intowhat should be an objective conversation about how the world behaves, andthey would be off.- Prior beliefs matter. When we‚Äôre trying to understand what is trueabout the world, everyone enters the game with some initial feeling aboutwhat propositions are plausible, and what ones seem relatively unlikely. Thisisn‚Äôt an annoying mistake that we should work to correct; it‚Äôs an absolutelynecessary part of reasoning in conditions of incomplete information. Andwhen it comes to understanding the fundamental architecture of reality,none of us has complete information.- The progress of human knowledge has bequeathed to us a couple of insightsthat, taken together, suggest a world that is profoundly different fromthe picture we construct from our everyday experience. There is conservationof momentum: the universe doesn‚Äôt need a mover; constant motion isnatural and expected. It is tempting to hypothesize‚Äî cautiously, always withthe prospect of changing our minds if it doesn‚Äôt work‚Äî that the universedoesn‚Äôt need to be created, caused, or even sustained. It can simply be. Thenthere is conservation of information. The universe evolves by marching fromone moment to the next in a way that depends only on its present state. Itneither aims toward future goals nor relies on its previous history.- Following Aristotle, the fact that the universe exists is often cited asevidence in favor of the existence of God. The universe is specific and contingent,the argument goes; it could easily have been otherwise. So theremust be something that explains the universe, and then something thatexplains that thing, and so on through the chain of reasons. To avoid divingdown a rabbit hole of infinite regress, we need to invoke a necessary being‚Äî onethat must exist and could not have been otherwise, and therefore requiresno explanation. And that being is God.Poetic naturalists don‚Äôt like to talk about necessities when it comes tothe universe. They prefer to lay all the options on the table, then try to figureout what our credences should be in each of them. Maybe there is anultimate explanation; maybe there is an infinite chain of explanations;maybe there is no final explanation at all. The progress of modern physicsand cosmology has sent a fairly unequivocal message: there‚Äôs nothing wrongwith the universe existing without any external help. Why it exists the particularway it does, rather than some other way, is worth exploring."
23,0525954821,http://goodreads.com/user/show/13244359-donna,4,"This is nonfiction science. It was very science-y which is not my thing, but I liked this one. If every physics teacher could be like this author, more kids would leave high school having enjoyed science, as a whole. Some of this was completely over my head, but not once did the author ever make me feel like I was in the weeds. He took his time and described everything so well. This author posed a lot of ""big  picture"" questions, but instead of letting the reader ponder them, he stepped in and gave you answers. That approach worked with this book, but sometimes I wanted to ponder some of the questions. "
24,0525954821,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6243880-gary-beauregard-bottomley,5,"All popular science books should take a clue from this book. There is no 'one scientific method' there are just many different possible ways we determine our justified true beliefs.This author is never afraid at talking above the listener. He's perfectly comfortable at using the appropriate terms that our needed, and he takes a stand on many of the issues within the Philosophy of Science. As the author says, science before Galileo thought in terms of causes and purpose (teleology), and afterwards started thinking in terms of patterns and laws (rules).I would say the book is essentially divided into two parts. The first part lays the foundation for the nature of science and introduces the listener to the nature of being, the study of ontology, and the foundations that are created which we use in order to explain. He'll actually get into some deep discussions on possible building blocks for the universe (monads, dyads, substance, forms,....). The importance of emergent properties because of the different regimes that are created by our ""domains of appropriate applicability"". Anti-realist v realist, the entailing of different theories by other theories, Bayesian statistics and why it's so necessary to understand what it is, and most of the other standard topics from the philosophy of science.There's multiple ways to understand the world. Sometimes we have to get at the particular before we can understand the whole or the universal, and other times we must understand the whole before we can get at the particular. The judgement we use by subsuming the particular under a universal rule gives us the bridge from reason to understanding.I saw the second half of the book as a refutation for all of the classical arguments for the existence of God. He doesn't frame them that way but uses the argument as a departure point in order to educate the listener on how to think about the world and ourselves such that we are a part of nature not apart from nature and how everything that can be explained (understood) can be thought of in 'poetic natural' terms. (Look, he's an incredibly gifted writer, but I think he could have done a better job on his 'fine tuning' counter-argument. But his refutation on the prime mover argument, that 'nothing is not a state of being' was superb).Science is always underdetermined. The scientific facts that we have can be explained by multiple theories. Just read any issue of Scientific American and you'll see an article on a new scientific phenomena such as Dark Energy and you'll see a statement such as that there are three different explanations for the phenomena under consideration (e.g. gravity changes over distance, a dark energy field exist similarly as the Higgs field does, or the vacuum energy of space creates it). ""Grue', green before a date and blue after a date, is my favorite color for a reason. It quickly shows that science will be underdetermined. I mention this because I think that the graveyard is full of scientist who makes such a claim as he does in the book that the ""bending of a spoon by mental telepathy is not possible because our current theory would never allow it"". It is wrong to make that statement. There can always be a different ontology that will entail the current one but allow us to realize different perspectives.I really like the book a lot. He merges the nature of science with understanding science as nature. I saw the bibliography on this book before it came out. I read over 2/3s of the books mentioned in it and knew before I read this book it would be fairly redundant and it was. I slowed down reading popular science books because most of the ideas in popular science books I read I have read elsewhere. Even in this book it mostly consisted of things I've read elsewhere. But, he does something that I wish all pop science books would do, he understands the issues in the Philosophy of Science and he knows how to relate that to the science that is being told. "
25,0525954821,http://goodreads.com/user/show/17511973-p-wilson,3,"This a good book if you're looking for a reasonably clear synopsis of modern physics. It also has an excellent section on scientific reasoning, including a useful description of Bayesian probability and abduction (as distinct from deduction and induction). It is marred, however, by the what I would call the author's evangelical atheism. His alternative, ""poetic naturalism,"" is best described by one reviewer as ""not even wrong."" (Robert Crease)Poetic naturalism, the author's coinage, are the stories we use to talk about ""macroscopic"" phenomenon that emerge from the underlying, and ironclad, physical realities. He too easily dismisses the sticky question of ""consciousness"" by saying it's just the way we have of talking about cognitive processes that make it seem as if we have a non-physical soul. My question: if consciousness is so easy to dismiss, could you please explain electricity? It seems to be an emergent phenomenon that is physical, but undefinable. Poetic naturalism is also invoked to describe the unproven, and unprovable, idea of the ""multiverse."" According to Carroll, this controversial idea is ""just a way of talking.""Carroll's insistence that the laws of the universe are now clearly understood is undermined by his acknowledgement that we can't reconcile general relativity with quantum mechanics, that physics is a ""mess,"" and that we don't know what dark matter is, even though it seems to fill most of the universe. Moreover, in a recent article in the New York Review of Books, Steven Weinberg, one of the world's leading theoretical physicists, argues that it might be time to reconsider the whole idea of quantum mechanics based on its shortcomings.The last part of the book, in which Carroll argues for an ethics based on ""poetic naturalism,"" reads like a New Age poster written by a California surfer dude. His ""Ten Commandments"" are trite, to say the least.Carroll does skim across a lot of interesting philosophical territory, but to me his coverage seems Wikipedia deep. "
26,0525954821,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2422285-james-murphy,5,"Carroll's book is ambitious, and ultimately it's impressive because he achieves--at least as far as I can determine--what he set out to do. The big picture is the nature of reality explained by contemporary science. He describes how the universe works in every scale from the cosmic to the quantum and how the current understanding of such elemental foundations make clear concepts like the arrow of time and entropy and unite in our heads as consciousness and language and even notions of morality.Intended for the layperson, like me, some of his book is necessarily spent explaining how to think about the science and the phenomena he describes. Many of these ideas are head-splittingly knotty. The diagrams and charts are helpful, sometimes even clarifying a text too difficult for my knowledge and experience to grasp. Working forward and downward from the Big Bang and cosmic scale to the mysteries of quantum mechanics he details existence as we know it today. Sometimes it was like trying to understand magic. Existence may be a human perception, but Carroll still had to explain how consciousness is a physical process defined by the activity and motion of quantum particles and how ultimately all of it affects such philosophical ideas as determinism, causality, and free will.This was a difficult read for someone like me who doesn't have a background in science. But I rode this beautiful, muscular animal of a book, clinging to it, refusing to be bucked off. And by the time Carroll got to consciousness I felt like I knew how to ride a little bit. I may not have tamed the complete picture of reality, but I learned a lot, and I learned I want to read more. "
27,0525954821,http://goodreads.com/user/show/19403634-h-lio-steven,5,"At some point in life, we all end up wondering about our place in the cosmos. For a lot of human history, it was thought we were at the center of all action, and that the universe was way smaller than it actually is. Given the epistemic/scientific limitations of much of our history, one can't say it wasn't all that unreasonable to hold such a view. Plus, it probably was somewhat reassuring, making more vivid the idea that we were somehow special in the big scheme of things. What's not to find attractive about this picture? Alas, we now know better, and Sean Carroll's The Big Picture attempts to show just how much of a dramatic change our knowledge about the world has been subject to. Carroll's book is not only a decent survey of what philosopher Wilfrid Sellars calls the contemporary ""scientific image"" of the world, but is also a defense of a metaphysical stance called naturalism. Although there's no consensus on what the term exactly means, the basic idea here is that objective reality is nothing but that revealed to us by the sciences -- or, to put it in Carroll's terms, the basic idea is that there's only one world: the natural world as revealed by the sciences. Naturalism can come in different forms, the most famous of which probably being the reductionistic one. Roughly speaking, reductionistic naturalism claims that the only real things are those revealed by fundamental physics, and that everything else that is studied by special sciences (also known as ""higher level phenomena"") can be reduced to fundamental physics without loss. Aware of this variety of forms naturalism can take, Carroll is careful to specify just what kind of naturalism he subscribes to, which he's labeled poetic naturalism. The ""poetic"" qualifier is motivated by the idea that there are different ways to talk about the world, many of which are useful given certain purposes. This qualifier is not as innocent as it might seem at first, for Carroll uses it to differentiate himself from the redutionistic brand of naturalism. By emphasizing that there are different useful ways of talking about the world, Carroll wants to say that so called higher level entities and phenomena are derived categories that deserve to be called real. To put it in more prosaic terms, just because in fundamental physics there are no such things as ""chairs"" or even ""time"" or ""causes"" it doesn't thereby follow that these things don't really exist -- they do exist insofar these terms are useful descriptions of our macroscopic reality. Where reductionistic naturalism seeks to eliminate high level phenomena studied by the special sciences, poetic naturalism tries to reserve some space for them in the big picture.The other motivation for describing this variety of naturalism as ""poetic"" is that, even though our current scientific worldview reveals us an impersonal, careless universe, there's still room for meaning and purpose for human life. More specifically, Carroll argues that there's plenty of place for morality and meaning in life even though these things aren't part of reality in the same sense that, e.g., photons are. In other words, life can be meaningful and there can be moral progress even in the absence of objective, mind-independent standards to ground either meaning or morality.As it should be clear by now, this book is ambitious. So, how does Carroll go about defending poetic naturalism? He proceeds by showing us what the contemporary scientific image reveals to us about the natural world. To keep it terribly short, Carroll argues that our current scientific picture shows that the universe is causally closed, self-contained and that we have every reason to believe that everything in it can be accounted for without resorting to any outside entity or phenomena.Of course, we can't be absolutely certain about our scientific worldview. But then again, as Carroll goes on to argue, knowledge needs no absolute certainties. The tremendous successes, in terms of predictive and explanatory powers, of our contemporary well-established scientific theories have utterly displaced the old Cartesian idea that knowledge requires certainty provided by unshakable foundations. Granted, we are fallible beings and we could always be wrong. However, mere possibility of being wrong should not be taken as identical to ""we're probably wrong"". With this problem in mind, Carroll explains that our claims of knowledge should be based on Bayesian reasoning: we should update our credences (i.e., the degree of belief that something is the case) in a given thing according to the evidence we find. So, for instance, if you believe that you can bend spoons with the power or sheer thought, repeatedly trying and failing to bend spoons through sheer thought should make you decrease your credence that you can actually do that, and this process will eventually make your credence so low that you simply give up believing it's really possible to bend spoons with the power of the mind. As this example illustrates, another important aspect of Bayesian reasoning is that everyone has their priors -- i.e., everyone attributes initial probabilities that something is the case. While this might be a problem, as Carroll himself acknowledges, the important thing to note is that if people engaged in a truth-seeking enterprise are really honest and open-minded, Bayesian reasoning assures that these people will tend to converge to the same set of beliefs even if they start with very different priors.With this Bayesian toolkit at hand, Carroll shows us how our contemporary scientific image ends up enormously increasing our credence in naturalism. In the process he makes clear how metaphysical claims can be subject to empirical scrutiny, and it's precisely this possibility that allows us to build a solid case in favor of naturalism. To illustrate, consider the existence of God. Determining whether God exists is a metaphysical matter, but there are many ways one could either try empirically supporting or weakening the thesis that God exists. The fine-tuning argument for God's existence, for example, crucially depends on empirical input. And since that is the case, assessing our available evidence and trying to figure out what naturalism and theism, for instance, predict about it in the end will make us increase our credence in one of those thesis while simultaneously decrease our credence in the other in the same proportion. Many philosophers will easily agree with what I have just said, but will go on to say that there is at least one other way to assess the plausibility of metaphysical theses: a priori reflection. Indeed, the traditional philosophical approach is, to a great extent, to advance a priori arguments and thought experiments and test them against our intuitions. This is what epistemologists would call ""rationalism"". Carroll explicitly eschews the idea that we can know about objective reality by pure thought by claiming this is not a reliable methodology. He doesn't provide much support for this claim, though, and so I would completely understand if someone with a good epistemology background complained about it. Moreover, he doesn't address contemporary rationalism, which is more sophisticated than its ""classical"" variety. However, Carroll hints at how an argument to support such a view can be developed by mentioning cases of metaphysical principles (e.g., ""for every effect there is a cause"") that were held to be known by a priori intuition and that were cast on doubt by scientific findings. For a better articulation of this kind of argument, I strongly recommend reading the first chapter of Ladyman and Ross's Every Thing Must Go (2007) and Kornblith's ""The Impurity of Reason"" (2000). So, summing up, Carroll believes that some sort of empiricism is the best way to know about objective reality, and this belief is partly based on the view that rationalism's methodology isn't reliable. This is important because it helps motivate naturalism: if our best way to know about the objective reality is in the end through scientific means, then given our best scientific worldview it seems that naturalism is probably true. Someone might complain that this is not right, because science subscribes to methodological naturalism, according to which scientific explanations should not posit supernatural entities or phenomena, and so basing naturalism in science is in the end question-begging. Not so fast, says Carroll. He argues that science is actually committed to methodological empiricism, according to which our we acquire knowledge about the world throuh empirical means. Thus, naturalism is a conclusion supported by what we have come to know through methodological empiricism, not some sort of dogmatic assumption embraced by science. None of the above is to say that absolutely everything about our scientific knowledge is evidence in favor of naturalism. One of the most satisfying features of the book is that Carroll is pretty honest about naturalism's shortcomings and about how some of what we know are more probable under theism than under naturalism (such as, e.g., the amazing regularities we observe in the universe). We don't need to have every piece of evidence being more likely under naturalism in order to subscribe to it; rather what is needed to stick with naturalism is that our total available evidence renders naturalism more probable than its competitors, and that is just what the book tries (successfully, I submit) to show. Now, I have said before that Carroll differentiates himself from reductionists by emphasizing that there are different useful ways of talking about the world, and that what is described by these ways of talking deserve to be called real. But what exactly does it mean? Unfortunately, Carroll is not as clear as he could have been on this. However, given the context where he usually resorts to this expression, what Carroll has in mind by ""useful ways of talking"", as far as investingating objective reality is concerned, is probably along the lines of what I call the non-redundancy clause, according to which some phenomena studied by some special science can be considered to be real if they can't be explained and predicted by fundamental physics alone or in conjunction with other lower level special sciences. Carroll's reliance on the notion of multiple realizability of many coarse-grained theories in special lends excellent support to this interpretation, and this is certainly distinct from reductionism. Moreover, in the best spirit of naturalistic philosophy, it's motivated by how science is actually conducted, not by intuitively appealing first principles. Very well. But is this non-redundancy clause an epistemological stance, or an ontological one? This is important, because reductionism can be understood either epistemologically or ontologically. One can agree that several special sciences theories resist straightforward intertheoretic reduction because of our epistemic limitations and at the same time maintain that the phenomena and entitites described by the special sciences are ultimately ontologically reducible to fundamental physics. Someone who holds both of these views can be said to be an epistemological nonreductionist while also being an ontological reductionist. While Carroll can be easily said to be an epistemological nonreductionist, it's harder to tell whether he is also an ontological nonreductionist. Throughout the book he seems to oscillate between these two ontological stances, and not even after I have finished the book was I sure about which ot the two he actually subscribes to. Although this is not that much important on general metaphysical grounds, in that in the end both positions are entirely naturalistic and this dispute does not bear on whether naturalism itself is true, it's important both for the sake of understanding the nature of objective reality and also to see just how Carroll's variety of naturalism eschews mere ""poetic license"" when it comes to talking about ontology.Maybe it's easy to agree that all is well for naturalism when it comes to fundamental physics, but one may find it harder to go swallow the naturalist pill after confronting the question of how naturalism accounts for things like intentionality and consciousness. Intuitively, it seems that these things are just stuff above and beyond quantum fieds, collections of cells and all of what is described by science. How on earth can naturalism explain consciousness, for example? How does naturalism respond to famous thought experiments against physicalism about consciousness, such as Frank Jackson's ""Mary's room"" or David Chamlers' ""philosophical zombies""?Carroll argues that both of these thought experiments fail. He correctly points out that Jackson's thought experiment has a pretty slippery notion of knowledge. If, as Jackson says, Mary knows every physical facts about color, and if this knowledge includes having certain synaptic connections that correspond to having the experience of, say, red, then Mary doesn't learn anything new when she goes outside. Now, by stipulation Mary has not yet experienced seeing red, and so those synaptic connections never took place in her, and thus she definitely learns something new when she goes outside. But then, given this stipulation, it's very doubtful whether we can say Mary truly did know all the physical facts about color there was to know. As Carroll notes, Jackson seems to have introduced an artificial distinction between kinds of knowledge understood as synaptic connections.As for Chalmers‚Äô p-zombies, the problem is basically that the thought experimente is ultimately question-begging. Chalmers simply assumes that being able to conceive of p-zombies means that they are logically possible, and that being logically possible in turn suffices to show that consciousness isn't physical. But this is something a naturalist would call into question. If p-zombies are physically identical with conscious human beings, then, a naturalist would argue, contra apparent conceivability, p-zombies are actually just as conscious as human beings. P-zombies, a naturalist could go on, are thus just modal illusions: we think they are possible because we think we can conceive of them, but really once we understand that consciousness is a completely physical phenomena we can see that we can't actually conceive of p-zombies -- they are impossible.Now, one can easily notice that responding to these thought experiments does nothing to provide a positive account of consciousness in naturalism. True, and Carroll by no means depends only on responding to challenges against naturalistic accounts of consciousness to conclude that consciousness is a natural phenomena. He mentions a variety of evidence that strongly indicates that consciousness is a physical process through and through, and correctly notes that, while we don't understand a lot about consciousness, cognitive science has been making significant advances in the direction of understanding more and more about it. It's worth highlighting how Carroll describes consciousness qua physical process, because it's the same basic strategy he uses to naturalistically account for things like purpose and even free will. Terms like that refer to emergent phenomena whose underlying regularities can be best described with the vocabulary typical of higher level special sciences. We can make best sense of certain patterns of behavior in cognitively complex animals, for example, by resorting to terms like ""beliefs"" and ""wantings"". Here Carroll's notion of ""useful ways of talking"" about emergent phenomena is central. And an important point associated with this discussion is that there's no in principle reason to think it's simply impossible that very complex machines would be capable of genuinely thinking. Granted, this is all pretty counterintuitive for a lot of people, given how much at odds it is with our folk notions of consciousness, purpose and the like. But being counterintuitive by itself hardly suffices to show that a given scientifically informed position is false. While intuitions in many cases might serve as a good start to theorizing about the world, it should by no means be the final word, and we should be ready to abandon them if our best available theories are at odds with them.I have said that one of Carroll's motivations for using the qualifier ""poetic"" is that his variety of naturalism seeks to defend that we can have meaning and morality even in the absence of objective standards as guides. How does he defend it? Keeping it short, Carroll defends that meaning in life and morality are both human inventions, but that acknowledging it should not make us shy from seeing these things as important to our lives. Not only that, he also defends that there can be such thing as moral progress despite the absence of objective standards. Carroll subscribes to a meta-ethical theory called constructivism, according to which morality is ultimately dependent on human's desires and attitudes, but that it's possible to engage in fruitful moral discussions and that there are good and bad arguments in favor of a particular moral claim. Roughly, fruitful moral discussions are possible because, as matter of fact, people have some widely shared moral values, and certain values might be in tension with one another. Thus, insofar as people wanna behave according to their values and also wanna have an internally coherent system of values, it's possible to persuade other people to abandon one particular moral stance or another by showing how they are logically incompatible with other deeply held values, for example.This approach might seem unsatisfactory to many people, especially to those who gravitate towards moral realism. But once we recognize that naturalism is probably true, and that mind-independent, objective morality violates naturalistic ontological constraints, then I guess we can appreciate that this might be a good enough approach to ethics. But it's important to note that constructivism is not the only meta-ethical theory compatible with naturalism, and that there are other compatible and interesting meta-ethical theories available. The Big Picture is an ambitious and beautifully written book. It has its shortcomings, of course, and there are many things with which I disagree and some arguments I found very wanting, but it succeeds in showing how naturalism can be rationally motivated and just how our current scientific worldview justifies attributing a pretty high credence to its truth. Carroll is a theoretical physicist, but he gets his philosophy straight where many other popular naturalists fall short (I‚Äôm looking at you, Sam Harris and Lawrence Krauss et al) and is well aware of how naturalism can be hardpressed. He acknowledges the many puzzling and unresolved questions naturalists must face and that much of our scientific understanding is still incomplete. The most important thing to be emphasized here is that, despite all of the existing problems and puzzles, naturalism has theoretical resources to deal with them. (In order not to be too vague here, let me quickly illustrate: we don‚Äôt know exactly how life began, but we have both different, plausible hypotheses to account for it and some evidence that supports some of them to a certain extent.) Finally, he also tries to inspire us to see that just because we are in charge of coloring the world with values and meaning in an impersonal and indifferent universe it doesn‚Äôt mean that we can‚Äôt make a beautiful, satisfactory piece of art. And speaking of art, Carroll should be praised for showing how it‚Äôs possible to paint such a big picture with fairly broad brushstrokes and have as and end result such a beautiful and elegant image."
28,0525954821,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3323455-jeremy,4,"As ambitious as its title suggests, this is a book meant to lay out a particular worldview. If we accept the universe as physics presents it, a vast panorama of elementary particles and quantum fields born in a fiery Big Bang and destined for a thermodynamic heat death, how are we to see ourselves? Can we simultaneously accept human beings as swarms of simple particles, organisms produced by random variation and natural selection, and as conscious and intentional beings with choices and a purpose? Sean Carroll thinks so, and he thinks that we can have such a world view without invoking God or immaterial spirit. He calls this Weltanschauung ""poetic naturalism.""Carroll is a good writer and a good physicist, and he has more respect and appreciation both for philosophy and history than some book-writing scientists. The physics material in the book is often fascinating and sometimes provocative (to the general nonscientist reader, anyway). Some of the interesting physics that he tackles will be familiar to readers of his previous books and his blog: the thermodynamic arrow of time and the ""past hypothesis"", the Everettian ""Many Worlds"" interpretation of quantum physics, the Core Theory of Physics, et cetera. Unsurprisingly for a physicist, he considers evolution and natural selection primarily as an algorithmic process, and the brain in terms of electrical processes and networks of neurons. There's a lot of interesting intellectual meat to chew on here, in terms of both information and food for thought.The best thing about the book, though, which is entirely in harmony with its goal, is to lay bare the chain of reasoning that builds his naturalist view of the world into a worldview that meshes with his sense of human life and purpose. He takes as his guide an epistemology based on Bayesian reasoning and a conviction that the emergent features of the universe - from chemistry to the human mind to the rules of basketball to morality and ethics - are just as real as the quantum fields and elementary particles that they are made of. You don't have to agree with all of Carroll's conclusions to find a lot of value in following his argument. And you would be well served to look in the Further Reading section to continue the journey he starts you on. "
29,0525954821,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4461733-paperclippe,4,"This was more of a philosophy book than I was expecting it to be, having read many of Sean Carroll's previous books, but I ended up liking it more than I thought I was going to for more than a couple of reasons.First, it's rare that I come across any sort of ""speculative"" book (I know that that's not the right word, but that's how it's sticking in my mind at the moment) that I agree with more often than not, and I did find myself agreeing with Carroll's positions much of the time. Now, I will amend this statement by saying that Sean didn't take too many hard positions (except in the case of things that were one hundred percent absurd or factually disprovable), instead favoring a pretty balanced view (which was also nice after what felt like a spate of pop sci books that too a more ""hard and fast"" approach without acknowledging evidence to the contrary. I'm lookin' at you, Brian Greene and Lee Smolin). Second, and this might sound silly, but I really enjoyed how short the chapters were (and the compulsive part of me also very much enjoyed that there were exactly 50). It's almost as though Carroll (or his editor, perhaps) knew that the information could get dense and overwhelming, so they broke it up into nice, bite-sized portions that were easy to wrap your head around and let you take a little break every so often, even if that break was just the time it took to turn the page and absorb the blank header space at the beginning of a new chapter. Now, I know formatting isn't everything, but it's nice.And third, the cover has glitter on it. 'Nuff said."
30,0525954821,http://goodreads.com/user/show/31053607-amaan-cheval,5,"The Big Picture is the best book I've read so far. It aims to address some extremely difficult questions, and surprisingly enough, it does do them justice and address them well. Sean Carroll pulls in research from several avenues to build as comprehensive a picture as possible, including logical and well-structured arguments for what he believes and why that makes sense.The book is very thought-provoking and it feels like it does a great job at peeling apart several layers of the human experience and examining them in detail.I've gained at least a dozen new models of thinking from the book, which are refinements on ideas / views I've held for a long time. This may well be the reason I enjoyed the book so much - because, for the first time have I had so much confirmation bias in one place, and not only in confirming, but also building on top of these ideas and explaining them in much simpler and logical methods.The book can also be quite inspiring and if nothing else, I'd urge everyone to at least read about poetic naturalism (a worldview which prides itself on ""real"" being whatever is a useful way of speaking about things - regardless of it being a human construct or not) and emergence (a phenomenon explaining how something can be larger than the sum of its parts, roughly).After reading the chapter on emergence, I had to go back and watch Robert Sapolsky's brilliant lecture on emergence and complexity, which does make for a fascinating complementary lecture:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_ZuW..."
31,0525954821,http://goodreads.com/user/show/76105804-rick-wilson,2,"It felt like this book was a response to a question that I wasn't aware of. Sean wore me out early on with mental gymnastics on his treatise on the ‚Äúunknowability of anything.‚Äù It felt like a cartoon episode where each time a layer of certainty was peeled back, the characters look and say ""but can we go deeper?"" again and again until the joke is no longer funny or even comprehensible. By the time we got into Quantum Mechanics, I was cross eyed and drooling. Just not the right book for me at this time. I‚Äôm sure there are those who would enjoy this immensely, I can see how at another time I might enjoy taking a hit of acid and listening to the audiobook while feeling myself dissolve into a cloud of unknowable cosmic dust. As of December in 2019 I did not find myself to be in that mood. "
32,0525954821,http://goodreads.com/user/show/26706153-j-earl,4,The Big Picture by Sean Carroll is a very accessible addition to the category of science books for the general public. As is usually the case this incorporates contextualizing the science within the more philosophical parameters of daily life. We may not think of our lives as philosophically driven but our actions and ideas are indeed so in the broadest sense. Carroll uses the concept of ‚Äúpoetic naturalism‚Äù to bring the discussion from the hows of science to the whys of the humanities.I found his discussions quite enjoyable and his arguments well grounded both scientifically (of course) and philosophically. That isn‚Äôt to say I agreed with every use of every term but he did not grossly misuse any terms to make a concept fit his paradigm. This is often where books at the boundaries between disciplines begin to falter; that does not occur here.I would recommend this to anyone who generally likes these books as well as anyone looking for a substantive discussion of naturalism using the latest science as part of the case-building. An enjoyable read with very few instances which should require extensive background.Reviewed from a copy made available through Goodreads First Reads.
33,0525954821,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7645507-jason-schneeberger,5,"Very broad and expansive material for the mind! This book is basically a Humanist look at the universe, life and existence through the lens of physics, ontology, biology, Astro physics and quantum mechanics.I can't fool myself into believing that I grasped everything this book lays out for its audience, but it is supremely inspiring and only furthers my thirst to learn more about science. I really enjoyed Sean Carroll's respectful approach to religion. He is admittedly an atheist and very clearly lays out hard to argue claims against creationism and nearly every other argument that religious types tend to have against science, but he does so in a very respectful manner and never once comes off as condescending or full of himself. It was a refreshing and much needed approach for a book like this. You don't convince people by beating them over the head at 'how smart you are, and how dumb they are' for believing in things that are dated, can be factually debunked through science etc. No, you will have much better results by coming to the debate the way Sean does in this book! I absolutely loved this inspiring, fresh, motivating, and educating look at how the things in our universe, earth and life existence, came into being!"
34,0525954821,http://goodreads.com/user/show/18847122-stany,3,"This book started with strong 5 stars, but as it got longer and longer it digressed from what it should have been about and lost two stars on the way. The parts on fundamental theory of nature, cosmology, the origin of life and complexity were generally very good (albeit with very little new in there). The description of poetic naturalism (what a poor name) is good. Had the author focused more on this, and in particular developed more the ideas of Bayesian statistics on these subjects and how it applies to our credences, I would have kept 5 stars. But suddenly the book suffers a phase transition and becomes a kind of self-help book, talking about caring and feeling, including a list of ‚Äú10 considerations‚Äù to a better life and ending with an anecdote of pancakes with strawberry syrup. So my suggestion is that you read the first 300 pages and the rest you relegate to the self-help shelf."
35,0525954821,http://goodreads.com/user/show/26188-jafar,3,"I feel bad for talking down this book, but there‚Äôs hardly anything new in it. Sean Carroll is a fine theoretical physicist who also happens to be very well-read in my other areas. In this large book he gives you a summary of modern physics and the naturalistic explanations of things like consciousness and morality, etc. Nothing that you can‚Äôt find elsewhere. His own bit of original contribution is his insistence on what he calls ‚Äúpoetic naturalism‚Äù: that we can have different narratives for the same thing, e.g., consider it a collection of elementary particles subject to the laws of quantum physics, or consider it a human with free will, and these two narratives are not contradicting each other.

Some of it did go way (WAY) over my head but that is hardly the authors fault. So how do I judge the book in the form of a review? The book made me want to read other ""thinkers"" books, so that alone makes this a very good book. The author is able to write in such a way that I was able to enjoy it if not fully comprehend it. "

Thanks to both for fine reviews.I spent more time trying to understand Sean Carroll's ""Something Deeply Hidden: Quantum Worlds and the Emergence of Spacetime"" and ultimately gave up on that one too.

The title of the book really says it all - you really get the big picture and find out more about philosophy of science, how the brain works, etc. It gives a lot of little bits of information that might inspire you to look into some of the topics covered in the book more deeply."
39,0525954821,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4153215-rusty,4,"When I finished this book, I made this loud horse-snort sound as I exhaled. You know, where your lips flap and there‚Äôs that, uh, horse-snort thing I just mentioned. And if I knew how to spell the aforementioned sound, that‚Äôs what I would have put down as my first line here. [horsesnort]Not a bad sort of one, by the way, but one that I made because I‚Äôd been thinking so much as I read it. It was a lot to take in, a lot to think about. The past few months for me have been a bit of a whirlwind. It‚Äôs not been bad, just busy. As such, I‚Äôm coming out of a months long stretch of the least amount of reading I think I‚Äôve done as an adult. And what I have been reading, honestly, has been almost entirely non-fiction. The desire to read fiction just went away with a big giant whoosh. I‚Äôm sure it will come back. I‚Äôve got a tbr pile with hundreds of books on it, and half are fiction. I‚Äôll read whatever I want to next, and at some point, the mood will strike again. So anyway, I‚Äôm in the midst of a pretty hardcore attempt by some family members to convert me to their religion. And I mean, really hardcore. I honestly enjoy the conversations, so it‚Äôs not a burden for me. I enjoy pointing out the logical fallacies (as I see them) in their arguments and occasionally realizing I might need to rethink a position of my own (that latter part doesn‚Äôt happen very often, but this conversion thing has been going on with me for the better part of two years now, I‚Äôve realized I‚Äôve not quite got everything figured out). I do find it occasionally frustrating that when we touch on a topic, once their argument appears to be exposed as flawed they tend to move on to a different topic (as opposed to conceding the point). The reason I get frustrated by it is because they‚Äôll want to bring up the same argument again in a later conversation, or worse, use it as an axiom on the next point they want to make. So, whatever. As I‚Äôve seen it, arguments for converting to their faith (when it‚Äôs not just bible-quoting) falls into two main domains:‚Ä¢	Cosmological (look at the beauty/complexity/wonder of nature‚Ä¶ Therefore, I should convert to their faith)‚Ä¢	Moral (how can you know right and wrong without God to point it out? I should totally convert now)Now, I‚Äôm not saying they do this on purpose, it‚Äôs just something I‚Äôve noticed. And It‚Äôs also fine, those are valid questions to ask. This book, much to my surprise, is sort of a take on the second category of questioning. I wasn‚Äôt entirely sure what I was getting when I picked this book up. Sean Carroll is a physicist who described a near death experience he had in the opening pages of the book. This book appears to be his means of sort of figuring out his (and our) place in the universe. It‚Äôs a systematic look at what we think we know about how the universe works, how we know it, how reliable that knowledge is, and what the implications mean. He makes some bold statements, and seems willing to stand by them (essentially, he states we can confidently rule out the supernatural as a real thing, and no future discoveries will invalidate that stance ‚Äì he does this fully aware of how the hubris of scientists making other proclamations has been a source of embarrassment later). But he holds fast to that, nonetheless. He then works into how we can derive morality without there being an objective Godlike entity making it clear. So, that‚Äôs basically the book. It‚Äôs big, and he takes small bites in each chapter to build his arguments. I think it was well thought out, and clearly written. It wasn‚Äôt a page turning read, but I was always interested. And when someone asked me what the book was about when I was two thirds of the way through it, I had to honestly say that I wasn‚Äôt sure, but it was great. It didn‚Äôt become clear to me until I was nearly done where he was heading with all this (maybe if I‚Äôd read the jacket on the book cover first). This is written in the spirit of Carl Sagan, and upon finishing it, it made me want to go back and re-read some of his more seminal works. Carl did, after all, shape my worldview more than any single person on this planet ‚Äì aside perhaps my mother. So, I ordered one of Carl‚Äôs books off the internet (I gave away all my other copies) and will probably be revisiting that soon."

But I'm gonna give this +1 more star than I gave the Grand Design simply because it was more engaging and I think I learned much more from this one and researched far more shit than the other one. Oh well..  Not that THIS one was the easiest thing ever, while I was indeed searching for words and meanings on a bunch of stuff cuz English is not my native language (duh), everything was clearly explainable and understandable as easy as possible. This is what's inside basically:Modern science can't yet explain everything about the universe or the human mind (duh-doy) there's a bunch of shit we do know (DUH) because of science (DUUUUHHHH). The laws of physics and a bunch of other scientific shit have given us a great deal of insight and explanations to nearly everything around us, from why the Earth orbits around the sun, to why pseudo-scientific theories, like telekinesis (yaaay Jean Grey) or teleportation *BAMF* or a bunch of other superhero stuff are just bullshit. But well, if we zoom out and look at the bigger picture , by applying scientific thinking we can also shed light on questions that have baffled us for ages. Like how time works, how complexity arises out of order and what the mind is made of. What I liked was the chapters about the theoretical Particle X, was a nice brain-scratcher and with a bunch of what-ifs, and well sure that was all imagination and shit but true to theory and understandable.And the chapter about Aristotle was quite good and true to the source, from what I can remember about reading Aristotle back in the days of wanting to read about our people of yore. But yeah, Aristotle basically said what scientists are saying in the last couple of years, with a simple example (taken from the book) ""if you put a book over a table, the book itself cannot move by itself unless there's a force that makes it move"". That basically tells us that nothing that's stable can move on its own or create something by itself, and Aristotle's theory was that, when we push something or react to something ( the author here uses the term causality formula which is taken from a scientific term of course ) we create something out of it, which is how the world came to be. That something made someone do something so that's how evolution came to be. Someone had to do something, something made the homo-whateverous to stand on his feet, to go hunt to eat to shit to fuck to go out of the water and stop being amphibious or whateverious.SO... we come to the conclusion that SOMETHING had to HAPPEN for the universe to just START. Someone HAD to make SOMETHING for the universe to be created, and well, Aristotle's theory was that THAT something/someone was simply.. yeah you guessed it... God. Anyway, nice book and yeah, I wrote a lot for a review. Fuck. What the hell is wrong with me. I'm going to read some Batman now to clear my head from all this nonsense. "
41,0525954821,http://goodreads.com/user/show/16886290-irma-ravkic,4,"This book is tricky to review because there are so many ideas in there. What I love about it is that it talks about the everyday phenomena of human life and the universe, but at a different angle, of a poetic naturalist. Poetic naturalism is a type of naturalism which encourages a variety of ways to talk about the world, using language dependent upon the aspect of reality being discussed. It acknowledges that the methods and terms used within one domain may not be coherent with those of another domain, yet both can be considered valid representations of reality. It gives this different view of nature combining all of the science, statistics (Bayesian reasoning) and neuroscience - showing how they sometimes seem to disagree, but at a deeper level just represent different ways of talking about things. One of the main topics of the book is that we have the world we currently have because of the way the universe was initially created: the principle of increasing entropy. That principle is visible in all the aspects of our lives: birth, living, dying. This process is not present only on Earth, but in the entire Universe. What I also liked is the discussion of so-called emergence. We often attribute purpose and meaning to our human nature. The traditional view is that the universe is created FOR us. (The book also discusses the emergence of religion). But then he analyses how universe is just there, its processes are determined in the early age of the universe, and everything else is emergent from those processes, including us and our consciousness. The human is a side story relevant only to us and from the view of the Universe, we're just helping to increase its entropy. This he views as something positive and nothing to be depressed about. We should be lucky we're here despite all odds. One nice quote in the book explains that attitude. It was written for Sceptical Inquirer by Carl Sagan's wife Ann Druyan, after he died. This excerpt is a personal note at the end of the piece ‚Äî as good a summary of how naturalists view the preciousness of life as you‚Äôll find anywhere:""When my husband died, because he was so famous and known for not being a believer, many people would come up to me-it still sometimes happens-and ask me if Carl changed at the end and converted to a belief in an afterlife. They also frequently ask me if I think I will see him again. Carl faced his death with unflagging courage and never sought refuge in illusions. The tragedy was that we knew we would never see each other again. I don‚Äôt ever expect to be reunited with Carl. But, the great thing is that when we were together, for nearly twenty years, we lived with a vivid appreciation of how brief and precious life is. We never trivialized the meaning of death by pretending it was anything other than a final parting. Every single moment that we were alive and we were together was miraculous-not miraculous in the sense of inexplicable or supernatural. We knew we were beneficiaries of chance. . . . That pure chance could be so generous and so kind. . . . That we could find each other, as Carl wrote so beautifully in Cosmos, you know, in the vastness of space and the immensity of time. . . . That we could be together for twenty years. That is something which sustains me and it‚Äôs much more meaningful. . . . The way he treated me and the way I treated him, the way we took care of each other and our family, while he lived. That is so much more important than the idea I will see him someday. I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôll ever see Carl again. But I saw him. We saw each other. We found each other in the cosmos, and that was wonderful."""
42,0525954821,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6309342-bruce,4,"I‚Äôm fascinated by the idea that we‚Äôre here and we don‚Äôt know why. The Big Picture delves into the big questions of life, the universe, and everything from the perspective of a physicist. Sean Carroll is one of my favorite physicists, and I have read some of his other books and listened to many of his lectures on particle physics and the cosmos. Carroll attacked the big question from the viewpoint of particle physics, molecular biology, astrophysics, and mathematics. He employed bayesian reasoning, including a long chapter detailing the statistical method which I mostly skipped over. He challenged the religious idea of a soul or a spirit by referring to Rene Descarte, who believed the soul was located in the pineal gland. He wasn‚Äôt making fun of religion. Rather, he was illustrating the question seriously as a scientist. If there is a connection between human beings and another realm, how does that connection work? Where in the body does that connection take place? Carroll promoted an idea he calls poetic naturalism. Sure, we are simply a collection of protons, neutrons, and electrons that obey certain physical laws. The purpose of life might be to oxygenate carbon, but we can describe such reactions in beautiful and poetic language. I dunno. If you‚Äôre looking for the latest in physics, math, and biology, this book is very good. If you‚Äôre looking for answers on the big questions, not so much. In the end, The Big Picture doesn‚Äôt really offer anything for my original question. I‚Äôm probably pretty silly for thinking it might. "
43,0525954821,http://goodreads.com/user/show/49311671-kauther-a,4,"The book is very interesting and thought provoking. It delves into the majority of philosophical questions with which mankind has been struggling. They key element of this book is that it looks at this questions from the perspective of scientist, combining empirical evidence, logical argumentation, and Bayesian thinking‚Äîculminating in poetic naturalism.Overall, I learned a lot from this book, and I found it delightfully stimulating at many points. My only qualm about the book is it has parts that are not so engaging, giving too many examples, or taking too long to make a point. I would not describe it as a superb piece of writing, but it is definitely worth the time and effort."
44,0525954821,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6036690-mack-hayden,2,"At times, this book feels like Sean Carroll‚Äôs imitation of Icarus flying. He jumps from subject to subject, discipline to discipline, making his case for his so-called ‚Äòpoetic naturalism‚Äô as an all-encompassing worldview or something close to an admittedly temporary theory of everything. On that front, I‚Äôd say he kind of blew it. Poetic naturalism comes off as a pretentious turn of phrase instead of anything more substantive. He also sets up tons of straw men throughout the book when he disagrees with some school of thought or some thinker in particular. With that said, he‚Äôs clearly still a competent scientist and mostly clear communicator so there‚Äôs plenty of great information to glean here. In other words, the trees are all lovely, it‚Äôs the forest that‚Äôs unsightly."
45,0525954821,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2770066-glynn,4,"This is an excellent book that hearkens back to the early times when philosophy was the only science. The author tries to explain all the amazing new theories of life, the universe, and everything in the most scientific terms but with a philosophical twist. He says a better way to think about the universe is that it is made up not of things, but of stories, and that there are ‚Äúplanets of belief‚Äù where our beliefs are like planets aligning to each other in the void. He expounds on the principle of ‚Äúemergence,‚Äù where things take on new and different aspects and meaning as we look at them at higher levels; and phase transitions (like solid ice melting to liquid form and then boiling off as a gas.) The author tells us about these things citing many scientists and philosophers from the past and present. The book is written in short chapters which makes it easier to contemplate, with big sections. The last 2 sections (Thinking and Caring) contemplate the nature of consciousness, and expound on a philosophy of living life. I enjoyed this book even if I struggled with the deep science. The one thing I don‚Äôt think the author accomplished (he may not have been trying to accomplish it, it‚Äôs hard to tell) is to convince a religious person that the universe is devoid of God. Other than that, this is a fantastic book well worth the effort."

47,0525954821,http://goodreads.com/user/show/14234350-darren,0,"First let me say this is the best book I have read in a while. I admit to already being a Sean Carroll fan, having read his very eloquent books ""From Eternity To Here"" and ""The Particle at The End Of the Universe"", as well as taking his Video Courses on 'Dark Matter Dark Energy', 'Modern Mysteries of Physics - Time', and 'The Higgs Boson and Beyond'. I have also watched many of his talks and lectures on YouTube, and I follow him on Twitter and frequently read his blog site Preposterous Universe (http://www.preposterousuniverse.com/b...).In his new book The Big Picture, Sean Carroll encapsulates the human journey of discovery of the natural world, the epistemology of how we know what we know, the effectiveness of using the scientific method to test hypothesis and develop and strengthen our theories, and how it all affects us as conscious creatures travelling on a little dot in the cosmos.No stone is left unturned as Carroll discusses the entire gambit of human intellectual pursuit: physics, chemistry, biology, neurology, cosmology, psychology, religion, consciousness, free will, etc... all the while updating the reader on the latest developments in each discipline. This book basically outlines the educational journey I have taken in the past few years reading strictly non-fiction science-themed books to learn about these topics and how they apply to the ""meaning of it all"". Carroll says we as humans have a strong predilection to assign agency and meaning to the universe and the happenings within (the guiding force behind organized religions), but he concludes that the only real ""meaning"" in life is intrinsic and we only have an average of ""3-billion heartbeats"" to determine what the meaning is before we are gone (and yes, Carroll joins me in the belief that death is final, and ""now"" is all we have).Through an approach he coins ""Poetic Naturalism"", Carroll lucidly shows how discoveries and enhancements in the past couple of hundred years has changed how we view our world:""Naturalism is a philosophy according to which there is only one world ‚Äî the natural world, which exhibits unbroken patterns (the laws of nature), and which we can learn about through hypothesis testing and observation. In particular, there is no supernatural world ‚Äî no gods, no spirits, no transcendent meanings. I like to talk about a particular approach to naturalism, which can be thought of as Poetic. By that I mean to emphasize that, while there is only one world, there are many ways of talking about the world. ‚ÄúWays of talking‚Äù shouldn't be underestimated; they can otherwise be labelled ‚Äútheories‚Äù or ‚Äúmodels‚Äù or ‚Äúvocabularies‚Äù or ‚Äústories,‚Äù and if a particular way of talking turns out to be sufficiently accurate and useful, the elements in its corresponding vocabulary deserve to be called real.""The best part about this book is it is ENJOYABLE to read. You don't need a degree in theoretical physics to understand the concepts (but Carroll does include an appendix that breaks down what he calls ""The Equation Underlying You and Me""). However, a lot of ground gets covered. In Part One he sets the stage, seeing how discoveries in science have revealed a universe that runs under unbreakable, impersonal laws of nature. In Part Two he thinks about how to conceptualize such a universe: how to learn about it (Bayesian inference, abduction) and how to talk about it (emergence and overlapping theoretical vocabularies). In Part Three he gets down and dirty with quantum mechanics, the Core Theory, and effective field theories. In Part Four he starts down the road of connecting to our macroscopic world, seeing how complexity and life can arise due to the arrow of time. In Part Five he discusses the leading challenge to a physicalist worldview: the existence of consciousness. And in Part Six he recognizes that the universe isn't going to tell us how to behave, and acknowledges that the creation of meaning and purpose is ultimately our job.I loved this book. Carroll takes his reader by the hand, explaining how we know what we know about the natural world by telling the story of human scientific discovery and why it matters today. This book should be added as mandatory reading in our educational curriculum and belongs among the great scientific intellectual works of Carl Sagan, Stephen Hawking, Lawrence Krauss, Daniel Dennett, Michael Shermer, and Richard Dawkins to name a few. Five stars... Highly recommended!"
48,0525954821,http://goodreads.com/user/show/38819471-marek-winiarz,4,"Book Review The Big Picture by Sean CarrollThis was my first genuinely philosophical book in many years, albeit based on physics and the observable universe. It is an ambitious book, a book about life, the universe and everything . (Of course Douglas Adams answered this question in his groundbreaking book ""Hitchhiker‚Äôs Guide to the Galaxy."" The answer to life, the universe and everything is 42. Carroll tries to go a little deeper.)In keeping with the spirit of the Unified Field Theory ‚Äì naturalism ‚Äì it postulates that the entire universe can be fully described by quantifying the state of every atom in the universe. That may be literally true, but it‚Äôs not a practical or even a possible exercise. And since atoms do not have consciousness or emotions, this kind of description misses a large portion of our experience entirely. Hence the concept of ‚Äúpoetic naturalism‚Äù. The poetic part adds those descriptions that are undoubtedly true cannot be quantified by atoms alone: feelings, colors, life, consciousness‚Ä¶ This is where philosophy gets added in.Parts of the book are easy to accept even if some of the quantum physics is difficult to comprehend. Let‚Äôs say that we understand the physics after the Big Bang and the subsequent universe expansion. (There is even an equation for the Core Theory in the appendix ‚Äì with the caveat that it‚Äôs still incomplete, blah, blah, blah).The middle of the book, where understanding and essence are considered, is fascinating. What is real, what is beliefs? Is any of it real? Much of ‚Äúperceived reality‚Äù has changed ‚Äì such as oft-cited example of whether the earth revolves around the sun. And yet the naturalist universe has not changed at all.Some aspects are truly revolutionary. Evolution theory and adaptation are well accepted, supported by empirical observations that can be reproduced. But if correct, why did life begin in the first place? If atoms don‚Äôt have emotions, why do they care if they exist as a collection of inert particles, or coalesce into biological organisms with consciousness and reasoning?This is the first time that I read something that even remotely makes sense on the level of fundamental science. Keep in mind that when asking eternal questions it is unreasonable to expect crisp answers - and to verify their veracity. But some theories are tantalizing, like Michael Russell's that life's purpose is to hydrogenate carbon dioxide. Not the answer you'd expect. (Strictly chemical - no soul). But it fits with basic physics of increasing entropy and reducing energy. (Physical systems seek the lowest possible energy state, that‚Äôs why a golf ball drops into the hole). Examples of other spontaneous organizations in nature are provided.And so it goes. Examples of thought experiments on consciousness and recognition, establishing rules, constructing goodness, and existentialism close the book. These are much more along the lines of ‚Äúclassical‚Äù philosophers, many of whom are cited.To credibly write a book about everything takes courage, I think. The point is not answers to eternal questions, but something for the ‚Äúinner life‚Äù. Indeed I have often wondered what good are philosophical books anyway? These are concepts and ideas to think about as you ponder the incredible you and the universe around you. I found this book fascinating."
49,0525954821,http://goodreads.com/user/show/43249479-mitch-lindgren,3,"I think I'd need to read through The Big Picture twice to fully absorb all the information in it, but the likelihood of that ever happening is very low given how long it is. I did enjoy it overall, but it covered a lot of complex topics in only cursory detail, and therefore not all of the topics were given the attention they deserve. In particular, I think Carroll was a little to quick to dismiss philosophical positions he disagreed with, and failed to explore their nuances. This is probably inevitable given the scope of the book, and I do think there's value in a book that tries to tie these complicated topics together rather than exploring each in detail but in isolation from the others. However, I think it worked better in the chapters on physics (Carroll's professional expertise) than in the chapters on philosophy. Still, I do think that this is a good book, and with how selective I am about what I read/listen to these days, the fact that I actually finished it despite how long it is is a testament to that."

In this remarkable book, Sean has shared with us some useful wisdom, on how to go about creating our own purpose in this silly place.

The book is great nearly through and through: a fascinating and hugely thought-provoking tour of...just about everything. It's only the very last chapters -- to do with the human experience, including ethics and the good life, that disappointed (seeming facile and forced). Not that I disagree with anything they had to say; they were simply enormously less compelling than the rest of the book. Nonetheless, I commend the author for painting on the widest possible canvas, and for the overall brilliance of his exposition. This book is manna for anyone who loves science and ideas. Terrific read."
52,0525954821,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6953429-elazar,1,"This book is boring, has nothing new to offer, and the author seems to desparately and unsuccessfully prove his personal beliefs."
53,0525954821,http://goodreads.com/user/show/61557581-behrooz-parhami,5,"I listened to the unabridged MP3 audiobook version of this title (read by the author, Penguin Audio, 2016). A shorter version of this review, posted on May 8, 2018, was expanded three days later, when I found my misplaced notes on the book. The title of this book seems at first to be pretentious and overambitious, but Carroll delivers on its promise. A theoretical physicist by training, Carroll undertakes the nearly impossible task of explaining deep scientific findings, alongside their connections with complex philosophical thoughts about choice, morality, and happiness, in a way that opens up new vistas for the readers/listeners. Carroll, recognized as one of the greatest humanist thinkers of his generation, discusses a wide range of topics in terms of three key concepts of entropy, complexity, and time-arrow, as he takes the reader/listener on a fantastic journey through all that is known about our physical world and spiritual existence.Growing up in a traditional family who went to church every Sunday, Carroll actually enjoyed the minimally invasive religious traditions and rituals. Later, he became a naturalist owing to a couple of important encounters. In this book, Carroll covers a lot of ground, switching effortlessly between discussion of microbiology or information theory, on the scientific side, and entropy, the nature of time, and Bayesian belief theory in philosophy. He reiterates Feyneman‚Äôs contention that almost no one in the world understands quantum physics in full, yet the theory is quite useful in shaping our understanding of the universe. A recurring theme in this book is that we need models at multiple levels of abstraction to make sense of the world around us and to think/talk about it. Trouble arises when we mix these levels and start talking about several of them at once. For example, in the morning, we may go to our clothes closet and ‚Äúchoose‚Äù what to wear to work. We would get in trouble if we simultaneously think about that ‚Äúdecision‚Äù at the atomic level. In a similar vein, we can talk about a gas in terms of the atoms comprising it or we can resort to high-level ‚Äúemergent‚Äù properties such as temperature, pressure, and density. These emergent properties allow us to discuss gases, without dealing with the enormous complexity we would encounter in an atomic-level model. It is in the same sense that talking about emotions, moral values, and free will makes sense, despite the fact that everything is essentially pre-determined. Pascal famously said that what seems like a human-being's free will is really God‚Äôs will, manifesting itself in our decisions. Modern science has replaced ‚ÄúGod‚Äù in Pascal‚Äôs formulation with ‚Äúphysics‚Äù or ‚Äúnature.‚ÄùCarroll emphasizes what he calls ‚Äúpoetic naturalism.‚Äù Naturalism implies the supremacy of nature and its laws, whether known or as yet undiscovered, with no need for God(s) or super-natural phenomena. The ‚Äúpoetic‚Äù qualifier arises from the belief that there are many ways of talking about nature, involving different levels of abstraction and artificially defined notions that have no natural embodiments. When we discuss the world at one of these abstraction levels, there may be problems in connecting things to other levels, but these should not be alarming, as long as the model is internally consistent and serves a useful purpose by offering accurate predictions. So, even though, at a fundamental level, everything is composed of atoms, themselves formed of sub-atomic particles, the artificially created higher-level concepts of stars, planets, and galaxies are quite useful. We can talk about, or even accurately predict, the motion of these massive bodies, without a need to constantly refer to the behavior of many many trillions of atoms that constitute them. Given the laws of physics, we should be able to determine the next state of the universe from its current state, what LaPlace claimed a ‚Äúdemon‚Äù could do, given enough computational resources. And herein lies the paradox: The required computational resources are so immense, that the theoretically possible eventuality is unlikely to materialize.A good chunk of the book‚Äôs later parts is concerned with the nature of, and connections between consciousness, free will, and morality. Carroll imparts ideas in these complex domains through simple and compelling examples. Consider, for example, Mary, a scientist who is confined to a monochrome life, but she isn‚Äôt color-blind and has studied all relevant theories of color and color perception. Now, if Mary is suddenly allowed to go outside and see colorful flowers for the first time, does this experience add something to her knowledge of the world? Carroll argues that even though seeing flowers adds new abilities and memories to Mary‚Äôs life, it does not follow that the universe is more than its physical attributes.So, how do we find meaning in a seemingly purposeless universe? Carroll‚Äôs answer is clever, though perhaps rather unsatisfying. The way in which our lives matter isn‚Äôt a scientific question but can be understood by compiling a list of ‚ÄúTen Considerations‚Äù (in lieu of Commandments). We are free to shape life‚Äôs meaning, individually or collectively.Here is Carroll‚Äôs 63-minute book talk at Google: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x26a-..."
54,0525954821,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2270881-ken-rideout,4,"A big ramble of a book which really does measure up to its title as he dives deep into just about everything. He claims to be advocating for a new philosophy called ""poetic naturalism"" but it seems to me that he just is expanding on standard naturalist humanism but in a kindler, gentler way. He doesn't deny theism, he just points out systematically that it is a statistically unlikely explanation of how we came to be.Some insights that really struck me:-Science and religion should not be treated separately. If science is about seeking the true nature of the universe, then religious claims should be thought about and considered just like all ideas of how the universe works. Looking for answers where there are none is most likely just the result of how we have memories of past events enabling us to construct a chain of apparent cause-and-effects due to ""the second law of thermodynamics and in particular to the fact that entropy used to be low in the past."" [indeed that is the answer to why time has a direction] (p. 59)-In thinking about a Universe that has a beginning in time and perhaps came from nothing, consider this amazing fact: all the conserved quantities (e.g. energy, momentum, charge) actually sum to zero as best we can tell! (p. 200)-In science, we tend to focus on what we don't understand but, in actual fact, we understand so much of how the universe works (and have tested our theories about how particles interact so thoroughly) that there is really no room for supernatural effects. Even if and when our Core theories (quantum field theory + general relativity) are superseded by a better theory in the future, our current model will still hold up in our domains of space and time because experiments tell us so. ""The laws of physics underlying everyday life are completely known."" (p. 191).-We have an answer to what underlying reality is made of: ""the fermion and boson fields of the Core Theory."" (p. 176) -I never understood the natural relationship between entropy and complexity before: ""That's us. Ephemeral patterns of complexity, riding a wave of increasing entropy from simple beginnings to a simple end. We should enjoy the ride."" (p. 236) He uses the metaphor of stirring cream into coffee and how the intermediate, mixing state is the interesting, complex one rather than the beginning or end states.- Why we remember the past but don't remember the future if the direction of time is a construct: Since entropy was lower in the past we can pin down the past: ""When a feature of our current state implies... something about the past, that's a memory; when a feature of our current state implies something about the future, that's a cause of some future effect."" (p. 380) We are actually making decisions in a certain sense because our thoughts are so far removed from the predictability of the laws of physics: In principle our decisions are predictable, but none of us knows the exact state of all the particles in our brains: ""The unavoidable reality of our incomplete knowledge is responsible for why we find it useful to talk about the future using a language of choice and causation."" (p. 380)-Consciousness is not an illusion but neither is it anything so special; our intuition tells us that consciousness must be more than a purely physical process but our intuition ""as science keeps reminding us"" leads us astray (p. 354). Our mental experiences are ""not separate things, but instead are useful parts of certain stories we tell about ordinary physical things...""-Over and over again, he points out that much confusion arises from our muddy use of language from one domain (say quantum mechanics) to another (like human thought). To each domain its own language. The existence of quarks does not negate the utility of the chemist referring to an object called a 'nucleus'. -Life is a process, not a state. That's why it's central to life (and the universe) to be born and to die. Processes have beginnings and ends. (p. 420) Seeing the universe as it actual is takes hard work but better to concentrate on having a good story to tell at the end of your life rather than trying to be in a state of happiness all the time (p. 426). Although the universe doesn't give it to us, we can bring ""meaning and mattering into the world"" (p. 431) so the lack of an afterlife or a divine purpose need not be a downer. "
55,0525954821,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2167338-david-agranoff,5,"I was overdue for reading this book, earlier in the year I discovered Sean Carrol's podcast Mindscape. I enjoy the podcast quite a bit. It is basically this super smart Caltech theoretical physicist talking to other smart people. The episodes are hit or miss for me depending on the guest but when I saw the title of this book I knew I have to read it. I love cosmology and the big picture, I know I understand these things better than I should. One of the highlights of my year was when Dr. Brian Keating in my Dickheads interview with him told me I had missed my calling as physicist. Yeah the whole sucking at math thing prevented that, but I love thinking about these cosmic issues. Dr. Keating himself called this book ""Poetry for Physicists"", and the writing is indeed very deep and profound. Carrol tackles the meaning of life from basic thought to the creation of the universe. To say this book is mind expanding is really selling the experience short. It is funny to me that books that explore history, culture and politics are often called must reads, and yet most books that explore the very existence and meaning of life from a scientific perspective rarely are. Brief History of Time by Stephen Hawking might be the last time, but unlike that book I think the Big Picture is much easier book to get a handle on. This book has better chance to be understood if people give it the chance. Sean Carrol not only explains the science, but gives it relatable human meaning. ‚ÄúPoetic naturalism is a philosophy of freedom and responsibility. The raw materials of life are given to us by the natural world, and we must work to understand them and accept the consequences. The move from description to prescription, from saying what happens to passing judgment on what should happen, is a creative one, a fundamentally human act. The world is just the world, unfolding according to the patterns of nature, free of any judgmental attributes. The world exists; beauty and goodness are things that we bring to it.‚Äù Keep in mind that the chapter on Poetic Naturalism begins with a discussion of the Richard Matheson written episode of Star Trek the Enemy Within and the ethic of cloning via the Transporter. That is more fun than sticking to straight forward academic theory. That was the first of several parts that took the book to a different level for me. Some times it is something fun like that then other times it was intense ideas.Even when I disagreed with him I liked that he got me thinking... ‚ÄúThe trick is to think of life as a process rather than a substance. When a candle is burning, there is a flame that clearly carries energy. When we put the candle out, the energy doesn‚Äôt ‚Äúgo‚Äù anywhere. The candle still contains energy in its atoms and molecules. What happens, instead, is that the process of combustion has ceased. Life is like that: it‚Äôs not ‚Äústuff‚Äù; it‚Äôs a set of things happening. When that process stops, life ends.‚ÄùWhen the candle flame is put out the smell of the wax often floats in the room, I refuse to believe that when the process of our bodies stops that the things that make up our spirit ends. I like that this book prompted me to think so intensely on the subject. After all this science the Big Picture ends with a very human chapter. ‚ÄúThe idea of ‚ÄúTen Commandments‚Äù is a deeply compelling one. It combines two impulses that are ingrained in our nature as human beings: making lists of ten things, and telling other people how to behave.‚Äù So instead Carrol ends with Ten Considerations number 9 really struck a chord with me. ""We can do better than Happines."" Creativity, art, knowledge, activism. Your existence in this massive universe is kinda of a miracle, and there is nothing spiritual about that. I am talking cold rational science. You are damn lucky to be here, and damn lucky to have a cool book like this to prompt how you think about that universe. Yeah read this one."
56,0525954821,http://goodreads.com/user/show/24846552-ruth,4,"Review of ‚ÄòThe Big Picture‚ÄôThis book deals with the questions I've always had myself, and I found it very engaging. They are big questions, and it may seem presumptuous to want to answer them, but I am glad he took the trouble to try.That said, I did feel often that the author was a little too sure of everything he posited. It's quite bizarre to see him quoting a long list of people from history who all said that now we knew nearly everything and then were proven wrong, only to continue to say that this time we really do know nearly everything. So I'm not all that impressed with the answers he provides, but he did a good job explaining all the questions and pitfalls, laying out the landscape of what we need to take into account if we want to speak sensibly about reality and meaning. The book lays out this landscape of where the questions lie, in six parts: Cosmos, Understanding, Essence, Complexity, Thinking and Caring. All parts composed of several chapters explaining the questions one might have on these topics, and background information on what others have already said about them. All very informative, and lively written. Sean isn't afraid to be personal and share his own journey through these questions, I appreciate that. Part 1, Cosmos, deals with the nature of reality, and time, and questions about what causes things. It‚Äôs a bit introductory, he explains his own vision of ‚Äòpoetic naturalism‚Äô. I nearly stopped at the first chapter, because this was the most presumptuous in my opinion, stating things like ‚Äòwe now know nearly everything‚Äô.In part 2, about Understanding, he engages in the questions of how we can know what we think we know. A question that has always bothered me as well. Especially his chapter ‚ÄòPlanets of Belief‚Äô explained beautifully how we can build a whole consistent system of thoughts, feeling safe there, and then, all of a sudden (or slowly growing) we can find that there is some inconsistency, making us feel as if our foundations are shattered. I found the recognition in this chapter very comforting.Part 3, Essence, deals with body and soul. Very intriguing topic, but here I felt that he broke his own rules, and mixed the various layers of meaning. He was too obviously out to prove that no such thing as a soul can exist. However I did really appreciate the background information he gave on the correspondence between princess Elisabeth Palatinate and Descartes.In part 4, about Complexity, he engages in depth with the various arguments that have been brought forward by the advocates of ‚Äòintelligent design‚Äô. This part was especially convincing to me, since he uses arguments from the field of computer algorithms, which is a topic I know very well. These chapters were eye-openers to me, making me ponder once more what (if any) is the difference between our soul and artificial intelligence, and how I would go about describing that.Part 5 deals with Consciousness, which is the most interesting topic in my point of view. He explained how some people have called this ‚Äòthe hard problem‚Äô, but if I understand him correctly, he himself thinks it isn‚Äôt a problem at all, since consciousness isn‚Äôt a real thing. (Here I disagree)Part 6 deals with Caring, this is the part that becomes most personal and less consistent with the rest of the book, I think. But I appreciated that he tackled this topic as well.So, with this ‚Äòbig picture‚Äô in mind, I now have some new starting points in my own thought process, especially on the topic of consciousness, which is indeed (I think), the hard problem. As I said, I think I disagree with the author, but I‚Äôm at loss for words on how to explain where exactly I differ. I do think that whether or not you believe in consciousness is very much related to your faith in God. I think it is no coincidence that Augustine called our consciousness God‚Äôs Image in us. As a first, more personal, reaction I wrote a prayer to God with my questions raised by this book. It's on my blog: Dear God."

The finitude of life lends poignancy to our situations. Each of us will have a last word we say, a last book we read, a last time we fall in love. At each moment, who we are and how we behave is a choice that we individually make. The challenges are real; the opportunities are incredible.Humanity has always imagined ways that life might continue on after our bodily deaths. None of them holds up very well under close examination. What the stories fail to account for is that change, including death, isn‚Äôt an optional condition to be avoided; it‚Äôs an integral part of life itself. You don‚Äôt really want to live forever. Eternity is longer than you think. Life ends, and that‚Äôs part of what makes it special. What exists is here, in front of us, what we can see and touch and affect. Our lives are not dress rehearsals in which we plan and are tested in anticipation of the real show to come.

If we admit that we can always be mistaken, it makes sense to open our minds to our fellow human beings to hear what they have to say. We all have our biases, so getting a bit of outside perspective isn‚Äôt a bad thing. If purpose and morality aren‚Äôt out there to be discovered, we might be able to learn something from our compatriots in the ongoing creation of meaning.our lives are to have meaning and purpose, we are going to have to create them. And people are different, so they‚Äôre going to create different things. That‚Äôs a feature to be celebrated, not an annoyance to be eradicated. Much of what has been written about the quest to lead a meaningful life has been produced by people who (1) enjoy thinking deeply and carefully about such things, and (2) enjoy writing down what they have thought about. Consequently, we see certain kinds of virtues celebrated: imagination, variety, passion, artistic expression. And these are all worth celebrating. But a fulfilled life might alternatively be characterized by reliability, obedience, honor, contentment. Some might find fulfillment in devoting their efforts to helping others; others will concentrate on their own daily practice of being.We Can Do Better Than Happiness.The mistake we make in putting emphasis on happiness is to forget that life is a process, defined by activity and motion, and to search instead for the one perfect state of being. There can be no such state, since change is the essence of life."
58,0525954821,http://goodreads.com/user/show/98125252-vincent-sels,5,"If only everyone on the planet read this book... :)Carroll introduces 'poetic naturalism' as a framework of thought, to construct a coherent, open-minded, critical world view (or 'planet of belief' as he calls it), based on the scientific method and Bayesian inference; which allows room for higher-level concepts where such abstractions make sense, such as 'love', 'goals' or 'free will'. Get the gist of it on his blog: https://www.preposterousuniverse.com/... or on Wikipedia: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Big...I've always shared this world view, without knowing whether there was a name for it. I think it's actually incredible that there wasn't a name for it yet before Carroll coined this *poetic* naturalism, as I think it'll be difficult for anyone to disprove it; i.e. you could say this worldview is really the only sensible one - I'd be really interested in discussing this!Throughout the book he applies this philosophy to all aspects of reality and lays out the consequences.If you've heard his podcasts and/or read his blog, there won't be that much new in here for you. In fact, if you've read a bit about all of the touched upon domains and 'layers of emergence' (physics, biology, philosophy, psychology, morality), Carroll probably won't introduce a lot of new concepts or ideas that you haven't heard of before. He doesn't go much further than the classic real-life or thought experiments.But at sketching the big picture, the book is sublime. It's incredibly well written, with a lot of humor, well-structured in 6 parts, 50 shorts chapters, divided in paragraphs, which allow you to process through it quickly. Sketching a 'theory of everything' in 430 pages will always be challenging indeed, and he inevitably had to make some choices which will disappoint some people. For instance, I'd have loved it if he had gone into a bit more detail on how the scientific method works; whereas I think he might have gone on a bit too often about Bayesian inference. Or, I think that in the part about morality, chapters on politics, ideologies and maybe even economy wouldn't have been misplaced. He chose not to mention any of those concepts.I really wonder though if the book would be able to convince anyone who's not already convinced of poetic naturalism. As he finishes his book: it does take a bit of courage and effort to be open to it. One has to fight through quite some cognitive dissonance to fundamentally update his or her world view. It would be interesting though to see how religious or spiritual people react to the book... I'm definitely planning on putting it to the test! ;)"
59,0525954821,http://goodreads.com/user/show/22113748-dierregi,3,"Given the subject matter (everything) the structure of this book is the first thing to praise: each topic is explained in short paragraphs that compose short chapters and make the rather difficult content easier to digest.Carroll explains that his approach is based on ""poetic naturalism"", those most relevant feature is accepting that there are different narratives of the world, the terms of one domain not necessarily coherent with another, but all valid representations of reality.I find it easy to go along with this approach and equally easy to accept that the universe exists without any ""reason"". Also that life is compatible with some of the universe physical structure, again for no particular reason.However, I would have liked a clear explanation of the arrow of time. Given that it is an unsolved general physic question, perhaps a good explanation is difficult to provide. Unfortunately, after having finished this book, I know as little as before. On the other hand, I got plenty of explanations about the Core Theory and quantum physic.Everything can be explained by quantum physic and what cannot be explained now will probably be, at some stage in the future. Which is perhaps true, but very similar to saying ""have faith in quantum"", when faith is definitely out of the picture.Once we move from the universe to humankind - and especially to the problem of consciousness - things start to crumble. Apparently, quantum cannot explain why we think about thinking, the best theory being that life is a dynamic process moving towards entropy (read: death) and a living organism conscious and in motion has better chances of spreading its genes... Carroll is very clear about the fact that consciousness is still to be understood, just like the reasons why there's so much variety of life on Earth are unclear. We just have to accept that those are the facts.One of the last chapters tackle the sticky problem of ethics and it is the part I liked better. Carroll rejects moral relativism in favour of moral constructivism. The fact that moral rules are invented by humans does not make them any less real, just like the rules to play football. If we all agree to follow the same rules to play our game together to the best enjoyment and results for everybody, the world could be a better place - perhaps...Finally, Carroll is not a rabid atheist, explaining that he had a mild religious upbringing and eventually decided that a godless universe made more sense. That is refreshing, compared to many atheists who tend to be quite fanatic with their non-belief. To me this just proves that human nature is tragically tribal and at present that the""atheist"" tribe is strong enough to start its own Inquisition. That could be poetic naturalism's irony.Despite some sparkles here and there I did not enjoy this book, nor I found it particularly useful. However, I acknowledge the amount of work, the structure and the divulgative attempt, hence the three stars. Perhaps the picture was just too big to tackle..."
