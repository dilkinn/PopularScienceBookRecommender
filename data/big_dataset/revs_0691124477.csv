0,0691124477,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2105523-bob-nichols,3,"De Waal sets up his ethical argument by describing what he calls veneer theory: humans are basically bad (self-oriented), and civilized behavior is superficial and fragile. De Waal’s theory in contrast is that we are by nature good. Drawing from his work with primates, he anchors moral behavior in our natural inclinations and desires. (1) To this De Waal adds a cognitive layer, empathy, which enables us to “adopt the other’s viewpoint,” leading us to assist others by following golden rule-like precepts. Because we are good natured, we seek to help when we recognize that others are in need. (2) Here, de Waal draws on Mencius’s example of our natural tendency to help, without any thought of reward, a child who has fallen into a well as the “distress at the sight of another’s pain is an impulse over which we exert little or no control.” In other words, altruism is pure. De Waal correctly outlines our cooperative and other-regarding social nature. He goes on to acknowledge that this is “very much an in-group phenomenon,” and writes that “Universally, humans treat outsiders far worse than members of their own community.” This where de Waal gets stuck. He offers no argument for why or how we might transcend our tribalism. How might de Waal’s theory be extended beyond the in-group? A good many people are other-regarding by nature, just as de Waal believes. In contrast to de Waal, though, compassion (caring for others) can extend to non-group members, to humankind, and even, for some, to life itself. This can be validated, daily, in our own lives. With these individuals, an argument can also be made that the motive force is, in the end, self-interest as “pain” (broadly construed as caring) is experienced as one’s own pain. (3) For those who don’t feel the pain of others in this way, they can nevertheless act in an other-regarding way toward non-group members because they see that it’s in their interest to do so. This is a good form of utilitarianism. The motive force is not the good, caring nature as de Waal would have it but, rather, a pragmatic recognition that it’s in our interest to respect others. When the social order unravels through a free for all, the interest of each is compromised and harms our own interests in the long run. This is also the point of the Golden Rule that de Waal mentions. It can and should govern our social relationships in a trans-tribal way because in the end, and over all, it is good for us. A third category of behavior, though, undermines de Waal’s fundamental premise that we are inherently good, and this is a chronic source of intra- as well as inter-group conflict. De Waal charges that veneer theorists do not have an explanation for our clearly evident good, social nature. But the same argument can be made about de Waal’s perspective as well—how to explain our equally clear “bad” nature, as seen daily and throughout human history. There are a good many who are neither compassionate by nature nor motivated to restrict their own behavior out of deference to others (within the group as well as outside the group). These are the egoistic people who are willing to assert themselves at the expense of others if that’s what it takes to get to success. (4) In the end, it could be that the dichotomy that de Waal sets up--that we are either good natured or bad natured--is false. Humankind is both. We see both poles at work and everything in between. And both poles, it can be argued, are consistent with the (genetic) variation that lies at the heart of Darwinian theory and each has their own strong survival benefits. (5)The book ends with comments by various theorists on what de Waal has put forward. The main counter-argument comes from Christine Korsgaard who argues that only humans can be moral beings since moral beings act on principles that are cognitive by nature, which is missing in animals. In making her case this way, she eliminates a biological foundation for ethics. With Kant, she asserts that we should respect others as Ends. A counter question is, “Why?” and the answer to that question, it can be argued, can be traced back to biology: it’s in our own self-interest to respect the freedom of others (their ends) because the alternative is a free-for-all and social disorder that compromises the freedom of all. To bolster her argument, Korsgaard calls opposing theories and perspectives “laughable,” “absurd,” and “rather silly.” These are rank words and they are annoying to see in what should be a serious and respectful discussion.(1)	De Waal contrasts his perspective with that of Hobbes and Rawls who, he believes, argue that our social nature occurred only by a social contract whereby each agreed to restrain the self’s freedom in deference to the freedom of all. A social contract, de Waal writes, is a “rational decision by inherently asocial creatures.”(2)	De Waal writes that “Reciprocity is of course…at the heart of the Golden Rule, which remains unsurpassed as a summary of human morality.” Against de Waal, it can be argued that understanding another’s situation through empathy does not lead ipso facto to a desire to help alleviate their situation. In fact, some argue that empathy cuts both ways as the capacity to understand another’s situation enables one to better manipulate others. (3)	De Waal endorses the more or less standardized explanation among evolutionary biologists for other-regarding behavior in his discussion of kin-selection (we favor our kin in our actions to promote our common genes) and reciprocal altruism (since we obviously favor non-kin as well, other-regarding behavior is explained in terms of tit-for-tat benefits). But de Waal strikes me as ambivalent on the motive force for other-regarding behavior. He sees our social tendencies as naturally altruistic, devoid of self-interest. But he also relies on “reciprocal altruism” as the theoretical foundation for extending other-regarding behavior to non-kin group members, even though “reciprocal” altruism has by definition a fundamental self-interested component. Kin selection and reciprocal altruism are better viewed as products that flow from a much deeper evolutionary need that ties the individual to the group. And an argument can be made that both of these have a self-interested component because, as Darwin highlighted about the origins of our tribal nature, individual survival occurs via the group. Within a group, the individual survives; without a group, the individual dies. Ultimately, the motive force for social behavior in de Waal’s sense is the self’s survival and de Waal himself implies this when he writes of Darwin that “Evolution favors animals that assist each other if by doing so they achieve long-term benefits of greater value than the benefits derived from going it alone and competing with others.” But de Waal cannot put “self-interest,” broadly construed, at the core of “altruistic and sympathetic” tendencies because he believes that these are inherently “other-regarding.” De Waal, rather, relies on these purified tendencies as the motive force underlying good (social) behavior.(4)	And the implication of this view is that protecting one’s self-interest through the application of power against those who abuse their freedom is necessary, as much as we wish it would not be the case.(5)	To be a member in good standing within a group promotes survival – in a “good for one, good for all” way. Being self-oriented at the expense of others within a group, when combined with deceit, manipulation, power, etc., also has survival value."

The book is finished with a series of exchanges between philosophers (like Peter Singer for instance) so basically like a conversation in essay form about the subject of evolutionary ethics among other things. De Waal critiques what he calls ""Veneer Theory"" which posits that human morality exists as a thin layer on top of our amoral core. According to de Waal, and I agree, this model just doesn't add up when we look to the empirical evidence provided by evolution and the rich sources of information we currently have on animal behavior studies. Anyway, I suggest that people check it out. It argues very well for the idea that nature and culture, human nature and moral reasoning are not at odds but rather are so intertwined that the Veneer Theory (culture as a layer on top of biology) just breaks down and falls apart. It's really interesting and has some great descriptions of non-human primate behavior and non-primates (such as dolphins with their relevant presence of higher levels of cognition). One very moving and interesting story is an account of a bonobo attempting to care for an injured bird and help it fly again:""Here is another story about Bonobo empathy: Betty Walsh, an animal caretaker, observed the following incident involving a 7 year old female Bonobo named Kuni at Twycross Zoo in England. One day, Kuni captured a starling. Out of fear that she might hurt the bird, the keeper urged Kuni to let it go. Kuni took the bird and gently set it on its feet, right side up. When it didn't move, Kuni tossed it in the air. However, it returned to sitting on the earth, probably because it was too stunned or terrified to fly. Kuni then picked it up, climbed to the highest point on the highest tree, wrapped her legs around the trunk so that she had both hands free and carefully unfolded the bird's wings and spread them wide open on her palm and then threw the bird into the air as hard as she could. Unfortunately, it was still too stunned to make it over the barrier, so it sat on the edge of the moat where Kuni guarded it for a long time from the juveniles until it finally flew away.""-an excerpt from from another review of the book"
2,0691124477,http://goodreads.com/user/show/347152-graham,4,"Richard Dawkins and others have fallen into the trap that somehow Biological Evolution leads to Social Darwinism. In the same vein, these biologists claim that morality is a construct unique to humans and we use it to counter our selfish animal tendencies. Animals less sophisticated than humans allegedly allow natural selection to take out the weak. Not only is the quote ""Survival of the Fittest"" mis-attributed to Darwin, but so is the concept of such brutal views of natural selection. De Waal is one of the most respected primatologists second to only Jane Goodall. In Primates and Philosophers, De Waal uses several accounts of primate behavior to show that morality is as continuous with other Great Apes, Chimpanzees and Bonobos in particular, as is our genome. It turns out these primates most close to us genetically, show a myriad of the building blocks for morality. They are capable of empathy, sympathy, reciprocity, peacemaking and retaliation. Quick to answer charges of anthropomorphism, De Waal convincingly argues that any other answers for these behaviors would be more cognitively complicated and therefore less plausible. Unique to humans however are two qualities. The impartial spectator that Adam Smith describes, and the ability to reason and judge between two conflicting moral decisions. While significant, it hardly amounts to the gaping hole between our social behavior and that of wild animals that others have suggested. An excellent read for anyone pondering the origins of morality or the true implications of Darwinism on a social species.  "
3,0691124477,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5963979-jim-razinha,4,"Thought provoker, but then de Waal tends to do that. I finished this a couple of days ago and still don't know if I can do this review justice, but... The basis of this is his criticism (and dismissal) of the Hobbesian view that morality is a layer (a veneer) overlaying the baser, brutish animal that humans really are. This Veneer Theory, as dubbed by de Waal, has advocates and opponents (de Waal being one) and his leading essay here outlined his positions as to why the veneerists are wrong...in his view. No, humans are not moral ""by choice"" as Hobbes, Huxley and, it seems, Dawkins would have...rather, morality evolved from social constructs evidenced by some of our primate cousins. Four essays respond to his, and then he responds to them...an interesting format. A civilized debate; a food network throw down for people who actually think. They want to address ""why don’t we think it is good to be bad?"" And none of the five feel ""that there is any reason to suppose that humans are different in their metaphysical essence from other animals, or at least, none base their arguments on the idea that humans uniquely possess a transcendent soul."" See? For people who think.The editors observe that all five share the understanding that moral goodness is something real, about which it is possible to make truth claims. Goodness requires, at a minimum, taking proper account of others. Badness, by the same token, includes the sort of selfishness that leads us to treat others improperly by ignoring their interests or treating them as mere instruments. The two basic premises of evolutionary science and moral reality establish the boundaries of the debate over the origins of goodness as it is set forth in this book. This means that those religious believers who are committed to the idea that humans have been uniquely endowed with special attributes (including a moral sense) by divine grace alone are not participants in the discussion as it is presented here.Emphasis mine. Some of the counterarguments call out de Wall for anthropomorphizing his studies (more on that), but he has long observed enough behavior that he justifies well his ""scientific anthropomorphism"" (as distinguished from the Peter Rabbit-ish writings.)  The point is that de Waal’s evidence, quantitative and anecdotal, for primate emotional response is based entirely on observations of actual behavior. De Waal must base his account of primate morality on how primates do in fact act because he has no access to their “ought” stories about what moral reason might ideally demand of them, or to how they suppose they ought to act in a hypothetical situation.So there seems to be a risk of comparing apples and oranges: contrasting primate behavior (based on quantitative and anecdotal observation) with human normative ideals.(their emphasis) Important distinction. There is no anthropomorphism in that. Humans want to project ""ought"" and it is the duty of the impartial scientific observer to maintain a distance.So, to frame the argument, de Wall saysHobbes and Rawls create the illusion of human society as a voluntary arrangement with self-imposed rules assented to by free and equal agents. Yet, there never was a point at which we became social: descended from highly social ancestors—a long line of monkeys and apes—we have been group-living forever. Free and equal people never existed. Humans started out—if a starting point is discernible at all—as interdependent, bonded, and unequal.Our evolution didn't spontaneously pop out a ""moral"" product. For a human characteristic, such as empathy, that is so pervasive , develops so early in life, and shows such important neural and physiological correlates as well as a genetic substrate, it would be strange indeed if no evolutionary continuity existed with other mammals. The possibility of empathy and sympathy in other animals has been largely ignored, however.I don't know how anyone can deny that some animals have empathy and either it developed independently (which has happened for multiple many features) or has passed down from some earlier species. de Wall argues that Veneer Theory ""lacks any sort of explanation of how we moved from being amoral animals to moral beings. The theory is at odds with the evidence for emotional processing as driving force behind moral judgment."" de Waal: If human morality could truly be reduced to calculations and reasoning, we would come close to being psychopaths, who indeed do not mean to be kind when they act kindly.Extreme? perhaps, but it bears thought. He notes this on morality: It should further be noted that the evolutionary pressures responsible for our moral tendencies may not all have been nice and positive. After all, morality is very much an in-group phenomenon. Universally, humans treat outsiders far worse than members of their own community: in fact, moral rules hardly seem to apply to the outside.This is lost on so many people! Racism, xenomisia, nationalism...hello!Morality likely evolved as a within-group phenomenon in conjunction with other typical within-group capacities, such as conflict resolution, cooperation, and sharing.The first loyalty of every individual is not to the group, however, but to itself and its kin. With increasing social integration and reliance on cooperation, shared interests must have risen to the surface so that the community as a whole became an issue.This makes sense, no? de Waal:Obviously, the most potent force to bring out a sense of community is enmity toward outsiders. It forces unity among elements that are normally at odds. This may not be visible at the zoo, but it is definitely a factor for chimpanzees in the wild, which show lethal intercommunity violence. In our own species, nothing is more obvious than that we band together against adversaries. In the course of human evolution, out-group hostility enhanced in-group solidarity to the point that morality emerged. Instead of merely ameliorating relations around us, as apes do, we have explicit teachings about the value of the community and the precedence it takes, or ought to take, over individual interests. Humans go much further in all of this than the apes, which is why we have moral systems and apes do not.Still. the fringe elements supported and promoted by the current US administration seem to have a closer connection to the cousins...Journalist (and sociobiologist/evolutionary psychologist) Robert Wright picks at de Waal's use of anthropomorphic language in his writings and arguments. He says There are two broad categories of anthropomorphic language. First, there is emotional language: We can say that chimpanzees feel compassionate, outraged, aggrieved, insecure, et cetera. Second, there is cognitive language, language that attributes conscious knowledge and/or reasoning to animals: We can say that chimpanzees remember, anticipate, plan, strategize, et cetera.His beef with de Waal seems to be that ""It isn’t always clear from the behavioral evidence alone which kind of anthropomorphic language is in order."" and that de Waal seems to prefer cognitive anthropomorphism. de Waal does tend to impart a more human reasoning to explain some of his (many) observations of simian behavior, the cognitive anthropomorphism, but then he does have decades of behaviors observed!Philosopher Christine Korsgaard sides with de Waal in arguing against Veneer Theory in her essay:There are a number of problems with Veneer Theory. In the first place, despite its popularity in the social sciences, the credentials of the principle of pursuing your own best interests as a principle of practical reason have never been established. [...] In the second place, it is not even clear that the idea of self-interest is a well-formed concept when applied to an animal as richly social as a human being.[...]So the idea that we can clearly identify our own interests as something set apart from or over against the interests of others is strained to say the least.And yet even this is not the deepest thing wrong with Veneer Theory. Morality is not just a set of obstructions to the pursuit of our interests. Moral standards define ways of relating to people that most of us, most of the time, find natural and welcome.[...]It is absurd to suggest that this is what most human beings are like, or long to be like, beneath a thin veneer of restraint.But it is also absurd to think that nonhuman animals are motivated by self-interest. The concept of what is in your own best interests, if it makes any sense at all, requires a kind of grip on the future and an ability to calculate that do not seem available to a nonhuman animal.She then looks at de Waal's consideration of intent as he establishes the primacy of the bases for the evolution of our morality. The question of intention is a question about how an episode in which an animal does something looks from the acting animal’s own point of view, whether it is plausible to think that the animal acts with a certain kind of purpose in mind. I think there is a temptation to think that the question whether we can see the origins of morality in animal behavior depends on how exactly we interpret their intentions, whether their intentions are “good” or not. I think that, at least taken in the most obvious way, this is a mistake.She has a point - interpretation is necessary, as we cannot (yet) know what animals are thinking, so care must be taken to normalize that interpretation.Peter Singer, philosopher, in his response essay ""Morality, Reason, and the Rights of Animals"" points outOnce we recognize that nonhuman animals have complex emotional and social needs, we begin to see animal abuse where others might not see it [...]I didn't pull much from his counter, but I thought that worth sharing. In de Waal's response to the responses, he asksSo, we need to distinguish intentional selfishness and intentional altruism from mere functional equivalents of such behavior. Biologists use the two almost interchangeably, but Philip Kitcher and Christine Korsgaard are correct to stress the importance of knowing the motives behind behavior. Do animals ever intentionally help each other? Do humans? I add the second question even if most people blindly assume a affirmative answer. We show a host of behavior, though, for which we develop justifications after the fact.I submit that Daniel Kahneman answers that. Our emotional brain reacts first, much as we rational beings hate to admit it, and that emotional brain developed much earlier than the human primate overlay.Okay, I veneered the second half of the book (first half, too, really, but...) I need to read more de Waal, but my confirmation bias thinks he's right, whether he uses the appropriate descriptive language or attributions."

I just finished reading a book about the same subject: The Quest of a Moral Compass by Keenan Malik, and the author does not mention primates nor any other animal, his quest took a different path altogether, he looked in the Bible, in Religion and Philosophy, no wonder he could not find any morality there, anyone that reads the history of the Popes gets the message very clear, they were not guided by morality.My feeling is that De Waal is in the right track, but I was hoping for a more clear path, perhaps is my lack of scholarship that did not grasp all that is in the book. However, I did find many sections very enlightening and very well worth reading."

7,0691124477,http://goodreads.com/user/show/35789244-paul,4,"This is an interesting book that deals with the question of whether morality is inherent in primates. The author cites humans, bonobos, and dolphins as capable of moral behavior. Chimpanzees, on the other hand, have no sense of morality, and one particularly rascal female chimp at his primate research center will see visitors, go get a mouthful of water from a spigot, then spray the visitors from her mouth. Clearly no morality there. On the other hand, I once wrote a story on two dolphins in Hawaii who were being taught English word recognition. The dolphins resided in a pool that had a step-down enclosure outside the pool for observation. When I went down there, one of the dolphins swam over and spit a huge spray of water over the side of the pool, drenching me. Now I question whether dolphins have any inherent moral sense.I will say for human beings, however, never in my work life have I had a colleague fill his mouth with water and then come over and spit it all out on me. So I agree that humans have an innate sense of morality, but as far as I'm concerned, the jury is still out on dolphins. I've never interacted with bonobos, so this remains an open question."

Throughout the book, de Waal presents 5 essays and rebuttals by other prominent thinkers. This creates a nice balance to the analysis of morality - specifically traits we think are very unique such as altruism and empathy. In general the conclusion is that we are not as unique in terms of moral characteristics as we like to think and more importantly how we define morality is mostly ambiguous and self referential. (our only reference to demonstrated moral behavior comes from our own exhibited behaviors and how that balances with our executive function of our frontal lobes) This is the basis for the Veneer Theory which is explored in great depth. Veneer Theory proposes that culture is a layer overtop of our biology. In the end moral reasoning and human nature are not at odds but complimentary. Further, this is also found and demonstrated by looking at our fellow primates and the complex social structures and complex behaviors they exhibit. In the end, we are not alone in our moral behaviors as a species.I'll admit I just pushed through some sections regardless of whether I fully comprehended the arguments being proposed. This made for some tough slogging and skimmed sections. Based on that reason alone, this would be a great primer for Normative philosophy class."

And related to, and in some sense underlying this question: why we are here? What is life's purpose? Are we alive simply because (as The Selfish Gene seems to teach us) our genes needed a medium to allow them to reproduce? Are we no more than utility optimizers, who are constantly calculating how to act in order to maximize our reproductive success, and is it true that, at bottom, we only help others if and when we think it to our advantage? Or are we more than that, because through sheer luck, we have become capable of influencing the course of our lives? And if this is the case, are we the only ones who can do this, and who have this freedom, or do we share this ability with other animals? And, finally, if this is true, what does that tell us? Does it mean that we can claim to be the only moral animals?One way in which one might find answers to this jumble of interrelated questions is by looking at what other animals, and especially nonhuman primates, are capable of, as this might tell us which parts of our behavior are unique to humans, and which are more widely shared. To do so, we might thus turn to the work of ethologists and primatologists -- like Jane Goodall, and Frans de Waal. Because De Waal especially has spent much of his career trying to answer this question. And as he is both a prolific and a fairly gifted writer, he has told a broad public of his findings.Among his readers we also find philosophers, and a few of them have agreed to participate in the writing of this book, which is about the question to what extent ethical theories are compatible with the empirical evidence (and the question what other evidence scientists like De Waal need to gather in order for their accounts to become even more compelling). This book, then, is divided in three parts. After an introduction by the editors, we get De Waal's main essay, then four responses (by, among others, Christine Korsgaard and Peter Singer), and then a conclusion by De Waal.In his opening essay, De Waal sets out two aims. The first is to criticize what he calls ""Veneer Theory,"" which is the (roughly Hobbesian) position that human beings are inherently bad, and purely self-serving, and which assumes that we only act in praiseworthy ways because we are indoctrinated and frightened into doing so. De Waal finds this Hobbesian picture of human nature as inherently self-serving scientifically dubious as well as harmful, and shows that not only are humans capable of engaging in social or good behavior, but that this ability to do so is also found in other animals, and especially in nonhuman primates. And not only are they capable of this, but it is also true that they engage in such behavior when they stand to gain nothing from doing so. For instance, Goodall (cited in the book) tells of a case in which a Chimpanzee drowns in an attempt to save a baby chimp from the water. This is his second goal: to show that nonhuman animals are just as capable of engaging in social behavior as humans are, and that a lot of the behaviors that we praise when we find them in humans can also be found (in somewhat simpler form) in other animals.De Waal invokes the work of Adam Smith and David Hume as an indication of the king of moral theory he feels is more on the right track. He does this especially because of the central role empathy (or, as Hume called it, sympathy) played in both of their works, which De Waal also considers key. So, to show that humans aren't the only animals capable of engaging in social, caring behavior that comes at a (steep) personal cost, and that this is in fact behavior that can be found in animals more generally, he discusses two (ethically rather dubious-sounding) experiments, one in which rats show a (transient) capacity for empathy, and the other in which ""rhesus monkeys refuse to pull a chain that delivers food to themselves if doing so shocks a companion. One monkey stopped pulling for five days, and another one for twelve days after witnessing shock delivery to a companion. These monkeys were literally starving themselves to avoid inflicting pain upon another."" (It should be noted that this tendency was stronger when the monkeys were acquainted or related.)The last point De Waal emphasizes is the fact that apes also possess what is called 'theory of mind': the ability to guess how others are feeling. He here discusses examples of how, after fights, chimps who did not participate in the fight (that is, who weren't acting simply to reestablish a working relationship with the loser) go over to the losers, and try to console them, by putting an arm around their shoulders.These are all important building blocks for our ability to engage in social or moral behavior. And, as we see, they can also be found in other animals. Therefore, it is therefore highly dubious that the intention to act in moral(ly right) ways is new to humans (which is not to say that it isn't more strongly developed in humans), and it is especially dubious to try to argue that people only act morally because they have been 'shackled' and indoctrinated by a social contract of a Hobbesian or Rawlsian make. Additionally, it would seem that the idea that all our motivations are necessarily 'selfish' is also nonsense. But although these points are well worth emphasizing, what frustrates me about this approach is that Veneer Theory is a fairly uninteresting target, which is demolished fairly easily by De Waal. Because once he has done so, he doesn't really have anything else he has to argue his way towards. And this is problematic because there is still quite a lot more that could be said about morality in general, and about the relationship between moral functioning and moral judgment in particular, about which animal or primate observations could possibly tell us much more than it has so far. Moreover, because of this choice to argue against VT, the other contributions are also less interesting than they could have been (though I mostly blame the others for this, as they are all trained philosophers, capable of going beyond mere reactive arguing, and of reframing the discussion a bit to make it more interesting).Having said that, I would now like to turn to the responses. I should start by noting that I found none of them particularly interesting or thought-provoking, though Kitcher's response was probably the most constructive of the lot, even if still flawed. I am making this judgment as someone who is already already somewhat familiar with the field (though an amateur compared to the likes of Singer), but I suspect that anyone who ponders the book a bit will feel roughly the same way. Especially the first two responses, and to a lesser extent Singer's response struck me as fairly defensively written, in that they contain repeated assertions to the effect that we should see human and nonhuman moral behavior as being qualitatively different, without the authors offering much more than intuitive arguments as to why we should accept those claims. Now, while I wholeheartedly agree that there indeed important differences, and that human morality is rather more complex than nonhuman primate moral behavior can be (if only because other primates cannot speak, and thus cannot defend or criticize their own or others behavior, making it much harder for all involved to learn which behaviors are and aren't appropriate, and making it nigh-impossible for them to allow for the amount of cultural variation that human modes of organization allow for), it seems to me that the authors do the reader an injustice by making such lazy arguments.Let me start by saying something about the first, and least interesting contribution, by Richard Wright. This contributor seems to have been included mostly because De Waal spends some time criticizing his book The Moral Animal as being a prime example of Veneer Theorizing. In it, Wright -- who appears to be an old-school evolutionary biologist (of the 'everything reduces to self-interest' variety). In his response, he suggests that we should distinguish between ""emotionally"" and ""cognitively"" motivated actions, and that we should think of all nonhuman animal motivation as being purely emotionally motivated. To defend this, he invokes something akin to Occam's Razor (the idea that simpler explanations are always correct), which he calls the ""principle of anthropomorphic parsimony"". Furthermore, he suggests that emotions should be understood as ""proxies for strategic calculation,"" and that only purely rationally motivated actions may be understood as belonging to the realm of the ""purely moral"" -- a term which he doesn't bother to define except in this way. The problem with all of these moves is that they are pretty question-begging: it is not clear to me at all why he thinks it more likely that animals act ""purely emotionally"" (instinctually?), if only because emotions are usually already fairly complex things, which by definition already have a cognitive component. (And note that the idea that we can neatly separate emotional and cognitive aspects of a thought in humans is hardly universally accepted either.) The second, and more telling issue with this text is that Wright keeps pushing the idea that all motivations are based on self-interest narrowly defined, and that even emotions should primarily be understood as calculative.The second response is by Christine Korsgaard. She is an important contemporary defender of Kantianism, which means that she places a rather heavy emphasis on the question whether actions were motivated by the right intentions. Now, if you have to judge someone's actions, or choose how to act in a given situation, thinking carefully about your intentions and whether or not they are appropriate to have is very important. Furthermore, it also seems fair to say that humans are the only animals who try to reconcile their beliefs with each other (""If I am a vegetarian, does that mean that I should also be against slave labor?"") And, as Korsgaard correctly notes, it seems somewhat of a stretch to say that animals are capable of going through the same reflective processes, and through the same processes of belief revision that humans do. Therefore, a number of issues that are important for human moral functioning are probably not present in animals. However, while this is correct insofar as it goes, what Korsgaard ignores is that it is equally true that human actions are just as often unreflective. However -- and this is a crucial point -- it is not true that those actions which are unreflective in this way are therefore im- or amoral. That is, it is probably the case that the majority of the actions that we judge good or bad were not taken by people who carefully considered the pros and cons of acting in this way; rather, they simply acted. And the problem with Korsgaard's perspective is that she is technically not allowed to call those actions moral, since affixing that judgment requires active and conscious reflection. This point, it seems to me, is one of the more interesting consequences following from the perspective offered by De Waal, but Korsgaard -- sadly -- carefully avoids having to comment on it. Because if we can justify calling automated or 'instinctual' (that is, thoroughly internalized taught behavior) human actions moral, then why can't we do so when talking about the actions taken by other animals? This question is currently left unanswered.The third response is, as I've already suggested, in some ways the most constructive, in that it simply notes that De Waal should've chosen a position more nuanced than Veneer Theory to argue against. Apart from that, Kitcher makes two points worth mentioning. First, that it makes a huge difference that humans can plan ahead, since it means that humans have the ability to create much longer-term alliances than other primates, which has enormous implications for social organization. Second, that aspiring ethicists should beware what he calls the Hume-Smith Lure, which is the tendency to think that once we have social behavior, and once we understand why people are willing to cooperate, nothing more need be said about morality. Now, while I think that this suggestion does little justice to Hume (who, in my opinion, most certainly did think about the question how moral behavior relates to issues of normative justification), it certainly is a fair observation to make, as it is indeed easy to forget that morality is about more than simply good behavior and cooperation.The fourth reply is by Peter Singer, and it falls into two parts, the second of which I will ignore. Singer here tries to give a twist to the 'Veneer' discussion, by suggesting that we might also understand 'Veneer Theory' as referring to the fact that so much of morality is evolutionarily new, and a cultural development. The problem with that suggestion is that it ignores De Waal's actual (and, in my opinion, quite valid) criticism of Veneer Theory: his complaint is not that Veneer Theorists take the specific moralities that we have developed to be cultural, but rather that they assume that good behavior only came with those additions, and that they take self-interest arithmetic to be the only source of motivation. Singer simply ignores that critique, even though it seems to me fundamental (perhaps because he himself is also a utilitarian, and because he is also very much into constant calculation of pluses and minuses, good and bad?). And this is why I think it a fairly forgettable (if telling) contribution.Anyway, in sum I would say that this book would've been more interesting if De Waal had chosen a more interesting target to criticize. Having said that, reading this book will still tell you quite a bit about the shortcomings of both De Waal's grasp of the finer points of the meta-ethical literature, and of the philosophers who have to come to grips with these findings (and who have largely failed to do so). As such, it seems to me that it is mostly the latter who are found wanting."
14,0691124477,http://goodreads.com/user/show/73419547-doctor-moss,4,"In this book, Frans de Waal takes on what he calls the ""Veneer Theory"" of morality. Veneer theory, which de Waal most identifies with T.H. Huxley, treats morality as a separate layer of human behavior and conscious experience that sits over and controls a lower animal layer. After de Waal's argument, several moral philosophers critique de Waal's claims, and de Waal responds in the book's final chapter.Veneer theory resonates with some traditional theories of morality. Both social contract theory and Kantian morality can be read as suggesting a kind of veneer theory. Social contract theory, at least in its Hobbesian flavors, explicitly treats morality and political order as rational, intentional agreements to counter a state of dog-eat-dog nature. Kantian moral theory identifies morality with reason, distinguished from and at least at times opposing ""inclination.""I think that, knowing what we know now of animal behavior (partly owing to de Waal), almost no one would deny that animals, especially higher primates, exhibit complex social behavior, or that that social behavior includes actions taken out of concern for others and actions taken to build and maintain group identity and order. Some may deny true altruism, arguing that apparently altruistic actions are either not fully intentional or that they are really disguised pursuits of self-interest (e.g., arrangements in which present assistance is traded for future reciprocation).And nature isn't quite so dire as a stark veneer theory would have it. It's not ""dog eat dog"" -- in fact, so far as I know, dogs don't routinely eat other dogs. Animals do behave with regard for the lives of others, and de Waal gives lots of examples from his research with primates. De Waal is right, I think, in so far as he gives us reason to reject veneer theory as a theory that supposes all animal behavior to be base and morality to provide, exclusively for human beings, the ability to rise above and control those base behaviors.But part of the attraction of veneer theory is that treating morality as separate from our animal natures provides for a struggle between morality and self-interest. Our conscious lives are full of that conflict -- should I tell a white lie to avoid an unpleasant situation or just say ""to heck with it"" and do whatever I want?I think that struggle is important to our understanding of human morality. We do struggle to be moral, and part of being moral is succeeding in that struggle. We struggle both to determine what is the right thing to do, and then to do it. In trying to do the right thing, our ""better natures"" fight to overcome our ""baser natures"", just as the veneer theorists would have it.But where they are wrong is in supposing that only one is truly our ""nature"" while the other isn't. De Waal successfully shows that at least some of the foundations of our better nature are shared with other animals, especially higher primates.Oddly, it may be that this struggle between morality and self-interest isn't shared with those primates. Nothing, so far as I can see, in the research that de Waal presents here, provides evidence that the same kind of struggle -- struggle either in determining the right thing to do or in overcoming inclinations not to do it -- occurs in the conscious life of apes. Hard to know, certainly, but I'd be interested in knowing what de Waal thinks about that question.In any case, our closest animal relatives are not mere creatures of self-interest, and our own evolutionary ancestors are accordingly not. There is no absolutely discontinuous evolutionary gap or separation between human morality and the lives of our ancestors. That is the mistaken view that de Waal seems to rightly reject.None of this, I think, decides the issue of how we should treat apes, something that Peter Singer raises prominently in his critique of de Waal. Singer, a long time advocate for extending our moral ""circle"" beyond our fellow human beings, is concerned of course about use of chimpanzees and other apes and monkeys in medical experiments and other research. He rightly points out that it matters more simply that apes suffer in such experiments than that they are in some sense on a par with us as moral creatures. I do think however that the more that we perceive them as ""like us"" the less we are likely to countenance their suffering."
15,0691124477,http://goodreads.com/user/show/45259248-yasmina,4,"Before people proceed to criticize de Waal for any part of his work, I think it's important to remember that he is primarily an ethologist and biologist (also a professor of psychology), but he is not a philosopher. De Waal makes the case for ""temporarily taking morality out of the hands of philosophers and into the hands of biologists."" He achieves this purpose well and, for that, this book deserves praise.  This book was largely regurgitative and lacked much-needed evidence in Part I. I really wish de Waal used more primate behavioural evidence and neuroscientific/neuropsychological evidence to make his points. I will be reading his book, Chimpanzee Politics, in the future just to become more familiar with his work on primate behaviour because not nearly enough observational evidence was used in this book.I like how de Waal incorporated the critical writings of others in Part II of his book and proceeded to respond to them in Part III. It showed maturity, a respect for the ideas of others, a commitment to self-improvement, and intellectual integrity. I really enjoyed reading each writer's perspective on Part I of his work; they each bought something different to the table that was not previously accounted for. They brought up important criticisms and insights, and this is especially true because de Waal is himself NOT a philosopher and thus not fully proficient in the jargon of moral philosophy.And now, for my BIGGEST CRITICISM OF THE BOOK: De Waal didn't address the possibility that we can potentially access ""moral truths,"" outside of influence from our emotions, through our ability to reason abstractly. For example, our ability to reason may allow us to arrive at abstract mathematical truths (if such truths exist), so why could it not do the same for moral truths (IF abstract moral truths do exist). Some of our emotions are vaunted as good and moral (e.g. empathy), while others are deemed the opposite– as emotions we have to overcome through reason and control (e.g. envy, jealousy, or hate). De Waal does not address this paradox himself: how can our evolutionarily derived emotions both be independently ""moral"" and ""immoral,"" and what distinguishes whether we label an emotion as one or the other? Singer brought this crucial point up in his comments, but de Waal either created a 'straw man' out of his argument to quickly dismiss it, or completely misunderstood its essence. Reason undeniably plays a role in human morality; we can have lengthy moral deliberations about an issue or can rationally choose to reject the influence from some emotions (e.g. envy) while embracing and affirming the influence from others (e.g. empathy). "
16,0691124477,http://goodreads.com/user/show/96414711-the-bean-of,4,"This book was deeply thought provoking. Morality is a topic which has always fascinated, especially its mysterious foundations. Frans De Waal is probably the leading voice on primate behavior. Jane Goodall gets more acclaim, but I think De Waal is ultimately better positioned to commentate on primate morality. I could be wrong, though. The opening extended essay by De Waal is characteristically well written and full of delightful and illuminating anecdotes. But, this isn't a merely a book about cute animals and ""look, see!! they're helping each other"", De Waal has to seriously defend his claim that 1) morality is evolutionarily grounded; 2) this means we share much more in common with great apes; 3) ultimately, we are good natured at our core. He lambasts Veneer Theory as per usual. But, I agree with the respondents that VT seems stupid and antiquated. Do people still countenance this view? That's an empirical question for which I lack an answer. De Waal is a undoubtedly honest and good-intentioned man. However, especially by the end of the book, I couldn't help but feel he was advancing an agenda albeit in quite a subtle way. It felt like it pained him to admit that humans are unique in meaningful ways that really do distinguish us from chimps, especially regarding morality. Every time he had to concede such a point, he'd follow it up with a ""don' forget, though, morality originated with chimps!!"" This struck me as a bit odd. Each of the four responses had their strengths and weakness. Robert Wright made a case for ""naturalistic veneer theory"", claiming that, yes, morality is evolutionarily rooted but it still serves a special, and crucial, role in suppressing certain instincts/desires for humans which can't be said about chimps. Wright draws on the different way reason and emotion in guide our moral behavior. He doesn't claim that they can be neatly disentangled, but that one can still talk about them separated in a meaningful way, at the very least for the sake of argument. He doesn't have a big problem with anthropomorphizing, but in certain instances, the intention/motivation of a chimps ""altusitic/moral behavior"" is so unknown to us that we shouldn't even conjecture like de Waal does. "
17,0691124477,http://goodreads.com/user/show/13459886-yhc,4,"Are we born with morality? or the morality is learned and passed down as part of cultures?This is a very interesting question discussing in this book. de Waal brought up why Veneer theory (he is against; ""a cultural overlay, a thin veneer hiding an otherwise selfish and brutish nature"".  The idea of the veneer theory goes back to Thomas Henry Huxley) is not fitting in his ideas. 3 levels of morality.1. moral sentiment: also exists in other primates.2. Social pressure: less systematic in other primates.3. Judgement and reasoning. Only exists in Human.He was against T.H. Huxley and Dawkins, and was quite provocative so there are 4 critics in this books: ROBERT WRIGHT; CHRISTINE M. KORSGAARD; PHILIP KITCHER; PETER SINGER, they don't totally agree with him and not totally against Veneer theory. Therefore he also answered back to them.I like this kind of interaction intellectually between these scientists. After i read this book, i have to say that given so many observations of chimps and other primate's behaviors, of course they seem to have basic morality, and seem to behavior altruism, but the motivation is really deep down the same consciousness like we humans or more like natural in their genes? Bees, ants also behave altruism, but obviously it's more mechanical than reason.One thing these scientists discuss in this book is we, homo sapiens, are the fully aware of morality and still capability to do the contrary such as wars, genocide and massacre, we think animals are brutal, cruel, but that is because they don't grow same kind of consciousness like we do, they behave naturally, hunting for surviving. But we evolve into a very different kind of animal that we behave greedily, look what we have done to this planet. After i read this book, i am truly ashamed that we don't think to do better according to what we have evolved into. "
18,0691124477,http://goodreads.com/user/show/30924713-kramer-thompson,3,"I think de Waal makes a fairly compelling argument for the case that human morality is continuous with the sorts of social affect and behaviour that characterises much primate life. But I was already quite convinced of this.For me, the most interesting parts of the book were the responses by Wright, Korsgaard, Kitcher, and Singer. Wright's discussion of the right way to use ""anthropomorphic"" language was illuminating. I also enjoyed Korsgaard, Kitcher, and Singer's arguments that there is a significant gap between primate proto-moral life and human morality, because morality is grounded in an impartial use of reason, which is something primates (almost entirely, if not entirely) lack.I will just note that the worst parts of this book were any time de Waal attempted to make some claim about morality itself, or ethics, or any sort of philosophical topic. It became apparent on the second page of the book (when he suggests that Rawls thinks that society has, in fact, been founded on the principles he suggests it should in A Theory of Justice) that de Waal doesn't understand philosophy at all. This embarrassment was repeated, and magnified considerably, in Appendix C where he discussed his views on animal rights, which was a shambles of confused reasoning and sneering rhetoric.Still, excluding de Waal's philosophical buffoonery, this was an interesting read, and probably worth checking out for anyone interested in evolutionarily-informed ethics."
19,0691124477,http://goodreads.com/user/show/46170186-j-g-m,4,"The book comes as a good epilogue for E. O. Wilson statement (and de Waal reprises this in his conclusion), “time has come for ethics to be removed temporarily form the hands of philosophers and biologicized.” To my appraisal, like the chemists (cherished) takeover of alchemy.This is clear upon noticing that it is composed of de Waal’s data and facts in his two (4,5-stars worth) essays and the other contributors fashionable duixhuitièmistes guesses and authority-driven (thus unproven) prejudices, which are classically one-star worth. Morality, as it is an animal behavior, is an object to ethology neuroscience, and naturally subject to evolutionary parsimony. Conversely, fossils still exist of a previous navel-wondering and semantic quibbling of since-the-19th-century-already-pretty-much-useless class of “but Kant/Mill/etc said and I won’t bother proving” professionals (which wrote half of the book, almost par grâce). No wonder they chronically lack funding for selling cure-all snake-oil, with some ancient authority glued to it. It is a pitiable resource for avoiding pressing questions on “ought” that need ethereal reckoning. Withal, with Pinker’s enlightened pragmatism we might be at The End of Ethics. But here I digress.As de Waal’s data shows, and thus he concludes, morality is a tower inhabited by many animals that share many of its features. I was left wondering about the case of microbial cooperation, which connects to “Life at the Edge of Sight”‘s wondering and sociomicrobiology, but I concede that it is OK for the purposes of this book.It would be too much tarnishing to this book’s true value to do some arithmetic and fix 3 stars, since de Wall’s part is indeed illuminating and he writes really well. So, 4 stars."

Then a bunch of philosophers, such as Peter Singer and Robert Wright, helps clarifying this issue of morality and its evolution. The dialectical structure of the book frames the concept of morality in the light of De Waal's studies, and offers a balanced conclusion that should push us to improve especially our ethics toward animals."

29,0691124477,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5893735-joseph-sverker,0,"De Waal has a very interesting outset to explain human morals. The editor states in the beginning that De Waal is not interested to debate those who argue that morals has a divine origin. And it is obvious that the main focus in this book is to debutt what he has named the Veneer Theory. De Waal shows that there certainly are similarities between how the greater apes acts and how human acts. He is in a way able to explain altruism in a way that I find is lacking in for example Dawkins. He is arguing, if I understand him correctly, that morals are based in the emotive part of the human (and the apes). This comes from the fact that people are often acting on a gut feeling when they act morally, or intervene in something they are upset by. However, as Singer points out, the question is if they react morally correct when using the emotional response to a situation. I also would like to raise C.S. Lewis critique to those who argue that morals are instinct. We might have competing instincts, what is it that decides for us to follow one instinct over an other? Furthermore, I wonder why certain instincts/emotions then should be called moral and other not. Why is it moral to save a child from drowning if it is simply an emotional response? Is it moral to start crying when Paul Potts is surprising the judges by his singing as well? I think Kant has a point when he is arguing that for an act to be moral, or for you to be held accountable to something, you also need to have been able to do something about it - ought implies can (even though there is discussion of whether Kant argued this). If morals are so thoroughly based in emotions, in what way can we then say that we could have done differently?I find myself agreeing with the critics to a much higher excitant than De Waal. It is however a challenging and interesting book to read, particularly for me as a Theologian and Christian. De Waal is taking ethics and morals from the hands of Theists and trying to show that it can have a evolutionary explanation. I'm not quite sure that he fully succeeds, but it is nonetheless an attempt well worth reading!"
30,0691124477,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4140662-andrew,3,"An interesting book with enlightening cross-disciplinary dialogues, but I would have liked to have seen more attention to:1) The primacy of affect in moral judgment, and its evolutionary continuity. Frans de Waal discusses only one study, involving fMRI scans of subjects contemplating ""trolley problems"". Many of De Waal's critics' objections to his thesis center on our species' ability to make cognitive moral judgments. I felt the book largely ignored the fact, attested to by a rich and expanding literature*, that most people still make moral judgments affectively, and only turn to cognition to rationalize beliefs already held. Ironically, this would seem to support a sort of ""veneer theory"" of human morality, though not precisely the sort that De Waal attacks. See Pinker for a more thorough discussion: http://www.nytimes.com/2008/01/13/mag...2) The behaviorist perspective, which was (unfairly, I think) cast aside with little discussion. De Waal notes that, given the evolutionary continuity between our own species, non-human primates, and non-primate animals, we must abandon double standards (i.e. using behaviorism to account for non-human animal behavior, and cognitive psychology for human behavior). I'm not convinced that this dilemma is best resolved by abandoning behaviorism, especially since the best argument advanced for this is that using it to explain human moral behavior 'just feels wrong'.*Zajonc 1982, Greene & Haidt 2002, Young & Koenigs 2007, etc."

For, as de Waal states in the conclusion of this work ""The debate with my colleagues made me think of Wilson’s (1975: 562) recommendation three decades ago that 'the time has come for ethics to be removed temporarily from the hands of philosophers and biologicized.'"" (2006) So there you have. You can either go by the moralists who believe that morality is only a human affair, or go the biological way and realize that as with everything else, in what concerns morality, we are again the tip of the iceberg in evolutionary terms. If you are interested in delving deeper into these kind of debates, you'll definitely love this book. There's plenty of academic nitty-picking inside, so you have to measure how much committed you are to these issues before opening the book. Again, quoting de Waal, ""While making for good academic fights, semantics are mostly a waste of time. Are animals moral? Let us simply conclude that they occupy several floors of the tower of morality. Rejection of even this modest proposal can only result in an impoverished view of the structure as a whole"" (2006). In any case, de Waal's essays are rich and insightful as everything he has written thus far. So you won't waste your time if you just read his contributions to the volume. "
32,0691124477,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4565825-sarah-myers,4,"This book contains a paper by Dutch primatologist Frans de Waal, arguing that morality is more genetically rooted and continuous between humans and other animals than has usually been held by what he considers the mainstream among people such as Thomas Huxley and Richard Dawkins (whom he calls ""veneer theorists""--holding that morality is a cultural veneer laid on a fundamentally ""selfish and brutish"" nature).

See Pinker for a more thorough discussion: http://www.nytimes.com/2008/01/13/mag...2) The behaviorist perspective, which was (unfairly, I think) cast aside with little discussion. De Waal notes that, given the evolutionary continuity between our own species, non-human primates, and non-primate animals, we must abandon double standards (i.e. using behaviorism to account for non-human animal behavior, and cognitive psychology for human behavior). I'm not convinced that this dilemma is best resolved by abandoning behaviorism, especially since the best argument advanced for this is that using it to explain human moral behavior 'just feels wrong'.*Zajonc 1982, Greene & Haidt 2002, Young & Koenigs 2007, etc."

(2006) So there you have. You can either go by the moralists who believe that morality is only a human affair, or go the biological way and realize that as with everything else, in what concerns morality, we are again the tip of the iceberg in evolutionary terms. If you are interested in delving deeper into these kind of debates, you'll definitely love this book. There's plenty of academic nitty-picking inside, so you have to measure how much committed you are to these issues before opening the book. Again, quoting de Waal, ""While making for good academic fights, semantics are mostly a waste of time. Are animals moral? Let us simply conclude that they occupy several floors of the tower of morality. Rejection of even this modest proposal can only result in an impoverished view of the structure as a whole"" (2006).

Frans de Waal's paper is followed by a series of critical responses by other philosophers and behavioral scientists, with a final comment by de Waal. While I tended to agree with Christine Korsgaard's Kantian response, arguing a more fundamental discontinuity between human morality and animal behavior, (c'mon, you really haven't demonstrated a sense of justice in chimps until you show that the chimp can be interested in justice for another chimp besides himself), I still appreciated de Waal's insights on man's social nature as biologically rooted.

De Waal notes that, given the evolutionary continuity between our own species, non-human primates, and non-primate animals, we must abandon double standards (i.e. using behaviorism to account for non-human animal behavior, and cognitive psychology for human behavior). I'm not convinced that this dilemma is best resolved by abandoning behaviorism, especially since the best argument advanced for this is that using it to explain human moral behavior 'just feels wrong'.*Zajonc 1982, Greene & Haidt 2002, Young & Koenigs 2007, etc."

And although the philosopher commentaries are sometimes a tough (or rather dull) read, it remains (in my opinion) a good read."

(Having read The Selfish Gene, which de Waal construes as opposite his viewpoint, I think he must have misunderstood it.) But his observations and experience with non-human primates are interesting, and probably what most - including me - read the book for."
184,0691124477,http://goodreads.com/user/show/145087-jennifer,0,"So far it's very interesting. The argument discusses whether morality is an elevated level on the evolutionary chain or if it is in fact a human construct uniquely our own and not something that comes naturally.Interesting animal bits, camels, monkeys and others exhibiting suprising behaviors..."
185,0691124477,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1085208-bennett,5,This is an amazing book that studies our closest genetic relatives!! We have so much to learn about ourselves from the chimpanzees and bonobos. I whole heartedly recommend this book to everyone. I traded it away on a road trip and I hope it is still traveling and being enjoyed.

187,0691124477,http://goodreads.com/user/show/806462-lboylan,4,Lots to think about in terms of morality in the animal world with insight into humans.

189,0691124477,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10616766-christiane-andries,3,The division between nature and men is artificial and so De Wael is absolutely right.

191,0691124477,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6250187-xiaozhen-fu,4,"the argument is based on Darwin's evolution theory. He didnt argue that animals have morality but claimed that we humans may have the same foundation for morality as that of primates. quite expected. never want to deal with morality again, after learning so much about metaethics."
