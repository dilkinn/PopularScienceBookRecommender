0,0465023932,http://goodreads.com/user/show/16160897-warpdrive,5,"Let me start with a one-sentence summary: this is a thoroughly enjoyable little book explaining, in a beautifully intuitive and holistic way, the main core features of Einstein's relativity, without getting bogged down into too much mathematical detail. The target audience of this book is the interested layman with high school mathematics knowledge and a passion for physics: it falls into the particularly tricky (from a pedagogical standpoint) grey territory between popular science and real science. And Feynman manages, almost in a magical way, to strike a reasonable compromise, within so little space, between accuracy and level of detail on one side, and accessibility on the other side. Now, I have read more comprehensive works on relativity, with much more emphasis on its mathematical foundational underpinnings; and I can tell you that, if you are looking for something significantly beyond the introductory level, you will not learn much from this book. However, having said that, I would still recommend this book even to a more intermediate level reader, as the way how Feynman manages to get to the core of things with lucid rigor, and simplicity, and how he manages to holistically connect all the different aspects of the physics he is explaining, is something magic and a great pleasure to experience. Feynman is a wonderful teacher, who can get right to the core of topic with amazing clarity, and he has the gift to make even the potentially most complex concepts seem like the most obvious and commonsensical thing. Because of this, this book is highly recommended to whoever has a minimum knowledge of maths and wants to start looking at relativity from a more detailed perspective than what offered by many generic popular science books.To make the book perfect, I would have loved to see at least some treatment of the mathematical underpinning of relativity, which would have probably made, in my opinion, some critical parts of the book more clear and rigorous: for example, there is no mention of the 4-dimensional Minkowski vector space, and its tensor (metric) whose expression is represented by equation 3.9 of the book, (which is presented in the book as a ""given""). And I would have loved at least a brief introduction to the concept of geodesics and of the stress-energy tensor (and of tensors in general), which would have allowed at least a qualitative treatment of Einstein's Field Equations.And, to be honest, I do not see much value in the first two chapters of the book, which are not much more than a very cursory introduction to mathematical objects that anybody should have learned in high school anyway (apart maybe from the concept of ""symmetry"")- maybe this space could have been used more efficiently by getting into some more detail in other areas. But I realize that there is a very delicate balance between mathematical complexity and accessibility and clarity, so it must be said that it would be extremely difficult to improve on Feynman's pedagogical approach in his book. In summary, this is a jewel of a little book that I thoroughly enjoyed and which deserves a full 5-star rating. Highly recommended. I loved it.  "

All of our ideas in physics require a certain amount of common sense in their application; they are not purely mathematical or abstract ideas.
It is difficult to review these books, as their titles are so descriptive. This book, as well as its companion, Six Easy Pieces, is a book that can judged by its cover. But this is a book reviewing site, after all, so review them I must. As you probably know, this book, like its predecessor, consists of excerpts from Feynman’s legendary Caltech lectures. The first book is aimed at the layperson; this book is aimed at the mathematically inclined layperson. Because the books originated in a serious physics course, but have been selected for accessibility, they fall into that vague territory that lies between popular science and science proper. Owing to their short length and numerous omissions, they are not meant to give the reader a rigorous introduction to the subject; nor are they, on the other hand, mere titillating anecdotes or strained analogies. The best way to think of them are as Feynman samplers; you will not be able to eat your fill, but the books leave a pleasant taste in your mouth. I don’t mean to suggest that you won’t learn anything from this book; far from it. Feynman is a wonderful teacher. He has no patience for formalisms or conventions; he is anything but pedantic. His mind leaps past all of the inessentials and arrives right to the core of topic; he doesn’t so much simplify, as clarify. Perhaps the best example of this is his explanation of simple machines in the first volume; he jumps past all the rules we learn in grade school, and explains it all in terms of conservation of energy. But even though he often relies on such abstract things as conservation or symmetry laws, he manages to be thoroughly concrete in his explanations. He gives you the general principle, and then walks you through an example. With Feynman, you can always literally ‘see’ the point. Feynman is also quite a showman. He has a keen sense for the dramatic, and will unveil a physical principle like a magician pulling a dove from a hat. But, unlike the magician, as soon as Feynman reveals the dove, he explains exactly how and why the dove was in the hat in the first place—and he’ll explain it in such a way that it will seem like the most obvious and commonsensical thing in the world that the dove was in the hat. This is beautifully illustrated in this little volume. In just shy of two hundred pages, none of which is particularly hard to read, Feynman will make relativity—one of the oddest theories we’ve ever come up with—seem as plain as the nose on your face. You will by no means be given a rigorous understanding of relativity from this book; but Feynman does, in his inimitable way, give you a “feel” for it. If you know a bit of calculus, and you know what a vector is, then I can’t think of a better place to start learning relativity. As a parting thought, I’d also like to add that it’s people like Feynman who make me occasionally proud my country. Sure, we produce a lot of duds; but occasionally someone like Feynman will come along that makes it seem all worthwhile. Some American qualities do, it seems, run deep. I can’t help but compare Richard Feynman with two other American greats: William James and Ernest Hemingway. Like those two, Feynman manages to be brilliant in three syllables or less. He is a populist in the best sense of the word, in that he thinks, not that we ought to dumb down our subject to reach as many people as possible, but that people will be interested and understanding if only we stopped putting on airs and spoke clearly. I look forward to spending some more time with him."
2,0465023932,http://goodreads.com/user/show/22976975-kevin-lopez,5,"Feynman is, as ever, utterly ingenious in his ease of explication here, especially given that the concepts covered in this volume are more advanced than those covered in the previous one, “Six Easy Pieces” (as cheekily indicated by the title, “Six Not-So-Easy Pieces”)In this collection of transcribed lectures, once again taken from the fantastically popular series of undergraduate lectures he gave at Caltech in the early ‘60s (just a few years before he won the 1965 Nobel Prize for his work on quantum electrodynamics and path integrals), Feynman focuses almost exclusively on relativity, beginning with Galilean and Newtonian relativity before moving on to Einsteinian relativity—first the special and the then the general theory. He covers Special Relativity with brilliance and lucidity, enumerating the history of scientific thought underpinning Einstein’s revolutionary leap—from Galileo and Huygens, to Faraday, Maxwell, Lorentz, and Mach—and then moving on to the contemporaneous experimental results (such as the famous Michelson-Morley experiment) which by the end of the 20th century had revealed serious fissures in the foundations of physics. The most notable of these fissures (for the development of relativity, at least) was the incompatibility between Newtonian mechanics and Maxwell’s electromagnetic field equations, which—unlike Newton’s ideas, enshrined in his “Principia Mathematica,” which had taken on an aura of almost divine infallibility in the roughly two centuries since its publication—had only been completed about fifty years previous. As anyone who reads popular science books know, all of this is extremely well-tread ground in the ever-expanding world of mass-market physics writing—from the bestselling books of Stephen Hawking to the irresistibly fun and witty works of Neil deGrasse Tyson, to the brilliantly evocative, almost poetically imagistic writing of Carlo Rovelli. Where I found Feynman to be refreshingly different, though, is in his willingness to dig into the actual mathematics behind the science, demonstrating, for example, how the formula for Galilean transformations led directly to the far more accurate (both theoretically and experimentally) equation for the Lorentz transformation; or how the formula for Newton’s Second Law (F = d(mv)/dt) was brilliantly tweaked by Einstein, who corrected for Newton’s inaccurate assumption that mass is a constant when he came to the (stunning) conclusion that the mass of a body increases with velocity. Feynman gives us Einstein’s corrected formula, in which m has the valuem = m[0] ➗ [the square root of] (1 - v^2/c^2), “where the ‘rest mass’ m[0] represents the mass of a body that is not moving.” In my experience, most contemporary popular science writers are utterly allergic to putting equations in their books—unless they’re buried in the footnotes way in the back (I remember one such writer saying something to the effect that for every equation he put in one of his books, its sales were cut in half). Because Feynman makes a point of using equations, not as off-putting esoterica to be avoided at all costs, but as an essential part of his teaching toolkit, he’s able to show much more clearly the evolution of Einstein’s thinking, presenting it for what is actually was: a meticulously thought-out scientific and mathematical conclusion—one which he drew from centuries of thought about the nature of relativistic motion, as well as the more recent discovery of the electromagnetic field equations and the finite velocity of light—not some sort of divine revelation, as is all-too-frequently implied (and which, I must admit, has an alluring quality to it, as it makes for an easier, neater story). Presenting the reader with the actual mathematics allows Feynman to dispel this myth and to show, step by step, the crucial thought processes that led to the incredible intellectual breakthrough that was Special Relativity. No matter how many clever analogies one is presented with—or, for that matter, illustrations of train cars and light clocks and so forth—one can’t fully grasp the many steps that lead to the real scientific theory until one can understand the equations which underpin it. Which isn’t to say that analogies aren’t useful, necessary tools—they are. Not only when trying to gain an understanding of a concept whose mathematics are utterly beyond one’s ken (the general theory, for example, requires a much higher level of mathematical understanding—or quantum mechanics, which, for most mere mortals, is an area of almost breathtaking abstruseness), but also, crucially, for the many modern scientific theories—including the Special Relativity—that go completely against the grain of our intuition. In terms of the basic formulae, though, with Special Relativity all one needs is an understanding of high school-level math to apprehend the steps that Einstein took to arrive at the conclusions he did. And by giving the actual equations—at least in the case of SR, where the underlying mathematics, if not the fairly mind-boggling conclusions drawn from it, are at least relatively (ha!) simple—Feynman is able to peel away the ornamentation of analogy to reveal the substructure beneath. I have to say that as I read this book, I found myself wishing that more of today’s science writers would take Feynman’s approach—forget whatever their publishers might be telling them about their book sales and respect the intellect of their readership. The publishers might just be in for a surprise.As brilliant as Feynman’s chapters on Special Relativity are—and they really are quite brilliant—the chapters on General Relativity are truly inspired. As the mathematics are far, far more advanced for the general theory (differential geometry, Riemann curvature, etc.) than for the special theory, and because these lectures were designed for an undergraduate audience, Feynman has to rely much more on analogies than equations here. Regardless of your level of mathematical proficiency, though, the concepts of General Relativity are not ones that human brains are evolved to understand intuitively. Just look at Einstein himself. After discovering the special theory in 1905, it took Einstein a full decade of wrestling with the extreme subtlety of the mathematics and all of its bizarre implications before he was finally able to complete the general theory (and this is Einstein we’re talking about, the guy whose name is a synonym for genius!). And to this day, many still view General Relativity as the single greatest achievement of human creativity and intellect. Needless to say the conclusions of the general theory, far more than those of SR, fly directly in the face of common-sense intuition and everyday experience. And here is where Feynman’s brilliance as a teacher really shines through. His analogies are concise, his explanations sparkling. He reminds me of no one so much as Carlo Rovelli, the Italian physicist whose books (“Seven Brief Lesson on Physics,” “Reality Is Not What it Seems,” “The Order of Time”) are more like Feynman’s than any other contemporary author I’ve come across, including such luminaries as Hawking, Roger Penrose (who, incidentally, wrote the introduction for “Six Not-So-Easy Pieces”), Leonard Susskind, Brian Greene, and Sean Carroll. (I would put Janna Levin in this class, too, though the only book of hers that I’ve read so far is “Black Hole Blues,” which is partly, if not mostly, also a narrative history of LIGO and the search for and ultimate discovery of gravitational waves.) Every science reader, of course, has their own favorite science writers. To me, what writers like Feynman and Rovelli (as well as Einstein himself, for that matter) seem to share that sets them apart is an intense artistic sensibility (for example, Rovelli begins each chapter in “The Order of Time” with a verse from Horace’s “Odes,” and Feynman, well—just read his memoir or one of the many biographies of the guy!), and stylistically a kind of poetic pithiness that makes reading their work such a unique experience. They’re simultaneously brilliantly lucid and poetically succinct; concise, compact, and perfectly cogent, while not avoiding or sacrificing any of the more difficult material or underestimating the intelligence of their readers.Feynman was not just a one-of-a-kind physicist, but also a one-of-a-kind person, and I highly recommend his memoir “Surely You’re Joking, Mr. Feynman,” which catalogues his many picaresque adventures, as well as his profound creativity in all areas of life.As quoted in the preface, Feynman wonders aloud whether, if he can’t explain a concept to an undergraduate student, he even understands the idea himself. Going by this standard for comprehension—and if his explanations here are any indication—he understood the concepts of modern physics better than almost anyone, before or since."
3,0465023932,http://goodreads.com/user/show/23888196-rama,5,"Learn Relativity from the maestro Richard Feynman himselfIn the introduction to this book, Roger Penrose, another great theoretical physicist of our times, states that ""Relativity is not airy-fairy philosophy, nor is space-time mere mathematical formalism. It is a foundational ingredient of the very universe in which we live."" On that note, it is encouraging for many readers that this book offers a great opportunity to take that extra step to learn the mathematical constructions for the effects of Lorentz transformations, Einstein's equations, relativistic dynamics; equivalence of mass and energy, Lorentz contraction and transformation of time. It requires undergraduate level physics, but comes with easy to follow instructions from the great maestro himself. Frequent references to his three volume book, Lectures in physics is valuable for readers who are familiar with his work. Position and time measured in one frame of reference (one observer) is different from another frame of reference (another observer). Therefore Lorentz transformation must be examined to understand physical reality. When we look at an object, we find that it has an apparent width and depth, but they are not fundamental properties of the object, because if we look at it from a different frame of reference it would look different. In Lorentz transformations we see is a mixture of space and time. An event (physical reality) is defined by both space and time because the position of an object is characterized by the time. The description of the object also depends upon the frame of reference (observer). If the observer is travelling at the speed of light, his perception of the object would be different from someone in a stationary state. The difference between spacetime, and space and the interval provides interesting sense of reality. For example, anything happening to Sun ""now"" will affect earth only after 8 minutes (that is how long light takes to reach us.) Thus an event ""right now"" can not be defined, it is a mystery, because we are not affected by it right now, but can be affected later after eight minutes. The ""now"" is an idea or a concept of our mind, it is not physically definable at the moment, and we have to wait to observe it separated by distance in (light) time. The example of page 64 establishes that simultaneity is not a unique thing in the universe, because it means different things to different observers. Relativistic dynamics; objects moving at high speeds (during forward motion) comparable to the speed of light shortens its physical length, and also time slows down (time-dilation) for the stationary observer, but the time remains the same for the moving astronaut. Thus for an observer moving under uniform velocity will not know he is in motion. The uniform velocity can not be detected without looking from outside, but the uniform rotation about a fixed axis can be detected without looking from outside. As noted earlier, the moving objects become heavier proportional to the speed given by the famous Einstein's equation, and at close to the speed of light the mass becomes enormous, and hence sufficient energy is not available to move anything beyond the speed o light. There are many websites that explains the transition from Newtonian mechanics to the theory of relativity to explain physical reality. Some of them are referenced below, but is great to read Richard Feynamn, because he did not like scientific ideas without a good physical foundation, and his approach is strikingly original. His efforts are strenuous in teaching and making the reader understand the basic concepts. I especially recommend chapters 3 and 4 for a quick appreciation of the subject: Highly recommended to all readers interested in physics of reality. "
4,0465023932,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2446389-upom,4,"Pretty aptly titled book. In contrast to ""Six Easy Pieces: Essentials of Physics Explained by Its Most Brilliant Teacher"", there was a lot more mathematical formalism that was a little tough to follow, but with patience could be understood. The six lectures are put together so you can better understand Einsteins' special and general relativity. The book really made me appreciate the power of mathematics and interpretation to determine the nature of the real world. I actually found out how they determined E=mc^2! The book also had Feynman's characteristic humor and crazy imagination to illustrate really tough physics and mathematics. I really wish Feynman's entire lecture set wasn't so expensive :-(."
5,0465023932,http://goodreads.com/user/show/46917424-rami,5,"I really loved this book.I have studied relativity in university, and afterwards, read several books on the subject, including Hawking books, but I have not really felt that I have started to grasp what general relativity's consequences are, until I read this book.The meticulously crafted analogies and examples gave a new meaning to symmetry in physical laws, the physical consequences of relativity, and the geometry of space-time when it comes to how I think of them.There were a few locations where I felt sudden jumps over ideas, but I guess that is natural, as this book is selected chapters from the complete Feynman Lectures, which I am hoping to go through in whole someday."
6,0465023932,http://goodreads.com/user/show/85852005-sato,5,"The principle of Conservation of Momentum, to me, is the most stunning nature of physics, and I guess the way Feynman understands and explains physical principles is the next stunning nature of physics! Having a high school knowledge of physics and mathematics can give you a delightful time through the pages of this book and give you the chance to cherish understanding Einstein’s relativity in six-not-so-easy pieces. "
7,0465023932,http://goodreads.com/user/show/25360918-blair,0,"This book is aimed at teaching Special Relativity to students who have high school algebra (thus can handle a co-ordinate transform) and Newtonian mechanics. The introduction promises us an innovative approach to understanding physics. The first innovation appears to be the concept of relativistic mass. OK, this was written in 1963, and maybe before that students were simply told to memorize the Lorentz transformation matrix. If you have just learned Newton’s Laws, you can use the same equations with mass increasing as velocity approaches the speed of light. Simple enough, but almost every physicist today says relativistic mass is misleading, and he himself admits that it “surprisingly enough, is rarely used.”For example, he tells us that the Caltech synchrotron requires a magnetic field 2,000 times stronger than would be expected on the basis of Newton’s laws to deflect the increased mass of a rapidly moving proton. Well, the strength of a magnetic field depends on its frame of reference, and the field the proton feels is much weaker. Really, the only value of this part of the book for me was the challenge of reformulating his explanations in more modern terms.However, the chapter on Curved Space was superb. I found it interesting that the curvature of a sphere is the same as for a disk with a temperature that gradually increases out from the centre, which causes anything on it to expand accordingly. Later, he considers the best path to move a projectile between two points in a fixed amount of time, using only relativity theory. The rate of time flow in a gravitational field increases, so we should send the projectile as high as possible. But to do that we need to move the projectile up quickly, which slows down its time. Calculating the optimum rate generates the Lagrangian for the difference between kinetic and potential energy, from which we can derive the laws of classical mechanics.Oops, now we are supposed to know what a Lagrangian is to understand the significance of what he has done, generating classical mechanics purely from optimizing proper time in relativity.I generally suggest avoiding this book and its outdated approach to Special Relativity. However, the last chapter made the time spent well worthwhile for me."
8,0465023932,http://goodreads.com/user/show/23258105-dileep-n,4,"This has a few marked differences in comparison with its sister volume, The Six Easy Pieces. It's at higher level than a pop-sci intro and so it expects its readers to have seen some physics before and it has quite a few equations which means you will need some knowledge of vector algebra along with basic integral and differential calculus to fully appreciate the content. This book deals exclusively with Einstein's theory of relativity (both special and general) along with a brief detour into the topic of symmetry of physical laws. Although Feynman does a brilliant job of explaining this unintuitive and fairly involved topic with the aid of helpful albeit quirky examples and analogies, I only got a vague sense of Relativity and its consequences. I felt the book was too short to include all of the 'whys' and 'hows', which made things a tad confusing for me. This is after all bits and pieces of Feynman Lectures strung together to introduce a wide audience to Einstein's groundbreaking ideas, so don't expect to understand the topic well enough to be able to explain it to someone else. That being said, I do think reading this book will stand you in good stead when you move onto more technical and thorough (including the complete Feynman Lectures themselves) books on the topic. Recommended for Physics enthusiasts."

The treatment is involved; not at an unreachable technical level but one needs to take some paper with pencil to enjoy the content as Feynman explains some profound and extraordinary physics.In a time of excessive work, night reads like this give a glimpse of something far more eternal and magnificent than what can be seen in normal life.

Hopefully though continued exposure I absorb just a little at a time. Did have some fun re-revelations about relativity."
12,0465023932,http://goodreads.com/user/show/14502950-manish-mishra,5,"The book like its successor is an amazing introduction to the wonders of physics. However, due to the subject of this book, it does demand a certain aptitude and effort from the reader (it is not-so-easy as the name honestly suggests). If you have a background in Science, you can really reap the benefits of this book if you are willing to scribble a few equations onto your notebook. But even if you aren't able to understand the mathematics of the concepts discussed, the consequence of the theories discussed is spectacular and it is worth knowing about the weird ways in which nature works. "
13,0465023932,http://goodreads.com/user/show/61033954-m-r,4,"Great book. Feynman is as enigmatic as usual and his descriptions are vivid and inspiring. He begins discussing atoms and shows us how we can understand the world around us using the simple concept of 'jiggling' atoms. I found this to be a profound and exiting way of understanding how things truly work, for example, why does tea cool down when we blow on it? Well, we cause some of the atoms (well molecules in reality) of the tea to get so excited and jiggly that they break away from the liquid and fly off into the air. The more jiggly they are to start with, the more likely they are to break off, thus the tea gets less jiggly and jigglyness is equivalent to heat. Hence the tea gets cooler. The sections on conversational energy, Gravitation and Quantum mechanics are a little basic but interesting nonetheless (after all these are the easy pieces)!"
14,0465023932,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2431689-ben,4,"For all of those who took introductory college level physics courses once upon a time, and wish to know more about the development of the science during the 20th century, this is a very authentic introduction. A basic understanding of calculus is important, even if it was acquired some years ago and partially forgotten, to comprehend the various mathematical explanations that go along with any serious study of physics. If that doesn't scare you, or if you have the will and the patience to give it a try anyway, Feynmann's presentation is imaginative, entertaining, and for the most part accessible. Part of his original ""Lectures on Physics,"" written and delivered for an audience of undergraduate college students, this shorter work covers some of the most important ideas and discoveries of modern physics including Einstein's special theory of relativity, space time, and gravitational equivalence. Persistent references to other parts of the original work sometimes leave information wanting, but generally the concepts covered are well explained in a creative but direct manner intended to shed light on difficult ideas without being convoluted or contradictory. Despite it's small size, not many would consider it light reading, however, if one is genuinely looking to learn something about the wonders and intricacies of our universe and how it operates, Feynmann remains an excellent teacher.

Feynman designed these lectures so that, he hoped, physics non-majors would be able to grasp the concepts, while majors would get a sense of the excitement of physics and maintain their interest.There is a lot of math in the book, but one can ignore most of it (as I did), and try to understand the ideas from Feynman's very clear and simple language. But, simple as Feynman's language is, these concepts are hard for even a smart person to get his or her head around. We have grown up in a 3-dimensional world that we understand somewhat, and it's not easy to grasp relativity, curved space, of space-time, let alone curved space-time. I did my best, and Feynman is always a joy to read, but I probably won't remember much about these topics tomorrow."

Requires, and assumes, knowledge of Std XII Maths and Physics- you'll be pretty lost if you don't know what the hell differentials and integrals are. Though written in Feynman's casual, conversational style, the book never fails to make your head spin, and it's fun to put the book down on your chest in the middle of a chapter and think about how your reality ain't so real after all, dude...I swear, science is drugs!"

He starts slowly, even simplistically with a discussion of symmetry and builds one upon the other taking the reader through some relativistic topics and finally concluding with a fantastic description of space-time geometry. In a few short lessons, he showed me what had taken months at university to understand. I wish there were more teachers like him today. "

The first two chapters took a while to understand, but I got there eventually. The chapters on Relativity and Space-Time (3 4 5) were real confusing though.Most memorable for me was his talk on symmetry (2). Left and Right being actual things in the universe is pretty damn cool.I found it hard to follow the equations stated in the book, especially the Lorentz transforms and other equations in Relativity. For me, the issue was that he didn't fully explain where the equations came from. He pretty much said this:There was an issue with Newton's laws, but this smart guy realized that if you changed them to include sqrt(1-(u/c)^2) then they were fixed. How did he come up with that? I say, either make a book completely rigorous or make it for the most basic of laymen.Or maybe I only understand equations if there's practice problems to do, and since I'll never do practice problems for a book I'm reading a book for fun, that's why I didn't get the equations.Anyways, it did get me (kind of) excited for physics and stuff!"

Half way through ""Not so easy pieces"" I realised I'd completely misunderstood relativity and Einstein's contribution. The beauty of this book is that Feynman doesn't over complicate or over simplify the mind-bending subjects but takes you through step by step. The mathematics in the book is not hard and serves to illustrate the ideas - though some prior familiarity with the Lorentz transformation would be useful. By the end of the book, I can grasp the ideas of space-time curvature and both the theory and the experiments that have demonstrated it. This is a rewarding and enlightening book which gives you a flavour of how lucky Feynman's students were. That said, ""not-so-easy"" is not an exaggeration."
26,0465023932,http://goodreads.com/user/show/19662137-nonethousand-oberrhein,4,"It’s all relativeUnlike the earlier publication, this selection of the Feynmann’s Lectures is focused on a single Physics “piece”. Chapter after chapter, in a crescendo of complexity, the reader is ushered into one of the most fashionable, while the less understood Physics subject. The author’s craftiness becomes evident as, starting from vectorial transformations, he demonstrates in an understandable and easy to remember way first the Special, then the General theory of Relativity. While the editorial work could not erase a couple of reference to some of the Lectures’ chapters, the book is self consistent and works well both as a student support or as a pleasing recreational read."
27,0465023932,http://goodreads.com/user/show/63934887-ruby-and-ted,4,"Insight for non-mathematiciansI've often wanted to understand how mathematics has been used to define laws that are proven, or not, by experiment. I can understand how experiment can find the mass of an electron, for example. But how can a series of equations predict the mass?This book provides just such insight without a lot of heavy mathematics. You should brush up on basics of motion and the calculus of derivatives to make the most of the book, but it's really not required. "
28,0465023932,http://goodreads.com/user/show/30866944-almustafa-couch,3,"An interesting book about an interesting subject, but the fact that there wasn't any mention of the double slit experiment. It is much more detailed than ""Six Easy Pieces""but that was expected.It did further my comprehension of relativity. And much to Feynman's annoyance, unfortunately the book did show his disregard for philosophy, symmetry does make philosophical sense, and without the symmetry physics would break down. In spite of it containing the anti-philosophical chapter, and attitude, the book was enlightening as far as relativity symmetry and space time is regarded."
29,0465023932,http://goodreads.com/user/show/38008473-odyssey,5,"A very enjoyable book that is aimed at the physics enthusiasts.In many ways I have found this book easier to digest than Six Easy Pieces, just because of the use of math throughout. The concepts within this book however, are much harder than in the preceding one.Same as with Six Easy Pieces it sits firmly somewhere between popular science books and a textbook, so be warned and be prepared to do some figuring out when reading it."
30,0465023932,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3490365-benjamin-wallace,5,"Certainly, some difficult topics to wrap ones head around. Feynman does a marvelous job teaching these difficult to teach subjects. One can't help but wonder what the world would be like if we were able to grow up with professors such as he in our lives. Thankfully these books and his lectures exist. They are marvelous. I'm certain I'll return to this book over and over as I try to grasp the ideas on deeper levels. "
31,0465023932,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8742827-jack,5,"Remarkably well doneI’ve been reading pop physics books for a long time and this one has by far the best explanation of curved space and relativity I’ve seen. I recommend getting the hard copy (paperback) rather than the kindle version. The equations in the kindle version are impossibly small as are the graphics. The presentation detracts from the overall experience. Nonetheless, this is well worth reading"
32,0465023932,http://goodreads.com/user/show/27789943-glenn-bellamy,5,An excellent to the point explanation of the theory of relativity without getting into all the nuts and bolts. It’s not very easy reading and not very easy theoretical descriptions. I had to read several sections two or three times over before it finally sunk in. But I think that was probably due to me and not to his explanations. I’ve read several of his books and this subject was the most difficult to understand. 
33,0465023932,http://goodreads.com/user/show/49311671-kauther-a,5,"This is a very entertaining book by an amazing teacher. As a Physics student, reading this book gave me a great advantage while taking courses on modern Physics. The book is a series of lectures intended for second-year Physics students at Caltech, so do not despair if you cannot grasp every single idea in the book. I highly recommend reading it after reading Six Easy Pieces."
34,0465023932,http://goodreads.com/user/show/88716412-damian,4,"Very well written, albeit brief, but I suppose that's the point - to get to the point, quickly, leaving further study for those who are interested.However, don't let the good-natured title fool you. This book requires at least a little background knowledge before or after reading (and re-reading) to be understood to, at least, an appreciable extent."
35,0465023932,http://goodreads.com/user/show/14512863-mike,4,This is not easy reading if you're not a physicist or a mathematician. You can likely make it through it and learn things even if you have difficulties with the math. I found it worth the trouble even when it made my head ache.
36,0465023932,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5935582-dan-cohen,4,Writing this review many months after reading the book I find I can't remember how well it worked for me. The book has the same style and accessibility as its predecessor but the maths can be difficult to follow. I think I need to read it again!
37,0465023932,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5076380-connor-stack,2,"Just like the title says, not as accessible as the first book. I enjoyed the first two chapters about symmetry even if I didn't get all of the specifics. Then relativity required too much work for me right now. Maybe I'll come back to it when I have more motivation."
38,0465023932,http://goodreads.com/user/show/21680009-seth,5,The mere fact I was able to follow this book at all is a glowing testament to Feynman's explanatory process. He makes Einstein's deductions of the mysteries of spacetime seem as straightforward as beginner's algebra. 
39,0465023932,http://goodreads.com/user/show/113232064-maxim,4,"Feynman, Six Not-So-Easy Pieces - another six chapters from Feynman’s great physics textbook, quite a bit more technical than the “easy” pieces, but the reward is proper physical insight into special relativity, spacetime, and curved space. 4/5"
40,0465023932,http://goodreads.com/user/show/92555307-almodather-fathallah,5,"No one can give Feynman due credit for his lucid and flowing writing style. I personally think this book one his finest. In it, he went on explaining very complex topics in a really understandable style, intelligible to the layperson of modest background in science."

42,0465023932,http://goodreads.com/user/show/19000710-mark,5,This isn't as accessible as Six Easy Pieces (perhaps obviously) but it's still solid Feynman lecturing and a great read for anyone interested in the material.
43,0465023932,http://goodreads.com/user/show/14459488-kenny-parnell,5,"I listened to the audio, and it was very enjoyable. I'm ordering the paperback so I can go through it again."
44,0465023932,http://goodreads.com/user/show/77645452-omar,5,Honestly just an increasable book as an introduction to special and general relativity. Would recommend for people that are in high school that are quite advanced or undergraduate students
45,0465023932,http://goodreads.com/user/show/90875407-ashudza-uchiha,5,This book is good for those who want to know more about relativity

48,0465023932,http://goodreads.com/user/show/83934868-faris-jaar,5,Defently more complex than six Easy pieces and needs concentration while reading.

50,0465023932,http://goodreads.com/user/show/94050257-judith-gunn,5,"An introduction to quantum physics. Warning: there are a number of equations. The author, a Nobel Laureate in physics, also has written Six Easy Pieces and a full set of lectures on physics."
51,0465023932,http://goodreads.com/user/show/118384148-advait-dhingra,4,Very Informative
52,0465023932,http://goodreads.com/user/show/31336922-aaron,4,"It was both a challenging and exciting read, as I have zero background in Physics. Feynman does a great job of presenting the material in a digestible manner. I found the 'Symmetry in Physical Laws' & 'Relativistic Energy and Momentum' chapters most fascinating. I'm currently ordering the book that precedes this, 'Six Easy Pieces', which I probably should have read first but was unaware of until I just flipped to the back of this book and saw the advert. Oops!"
53,0465023932,http://goodreads.com/user/show/94225994-jason-judd,5,"This is six chapters from his Lectures on Physics, and Six Not So Easy Pieces is far more advanced than the work which preceded it. It is great if you've read QED and don't wish to try and get into the whole series of his Lectures on Physics."
54,0465023932,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6922605-greg,4,"Richard Feynman was a brilliant scientist. While there are many brilliant scientists, perhaps the term gets thrown around a bit too loosely. Feynman was an elite scientist, maybe one of the most influential and important in American history. What truly sets him apart, more than this, is he is also one of the best teachers. He has the ability to use thought experiments to explain complicated concepts, and in this book, he tries to explain some of the most difficult. Vectors, Physical Symmetry, the Special Theory of Relativity, Relativistic Energy and Momentum, Space-Time, and Curved Space are some of the mind-bending concepts out there. Feynman does a magnificent job in presenting them. On vectors and the symmetry in physics, Feynman begins to explain one of the simplest and most puzzling of physical and mathematical phenomenon. Herein lies Feynman’s genius, he starts with basic building blocks and definitions, and then weaves them, before you know it, into a study of the most intellectually challenging concepts. “They symmetries of the physical laws are very interesting at this level, but they turn out, in the end, to be even more interesting and exciting when we come to quantum mechanics. For a reason which we cannot make clear at the level of the present discussion—a fact that most physicists still find somewhat staggering, a most profound and beautiful thing, is that, in quantum mechanics, for each of the rules of symmetry there is a corresponding conservation law; there is a definite connection between the laws of conservation and the symmetries of physical laws. (29) After massive amounts of explanation, we arrive at the profound.As only Feynman can, he later links relativity with Newton through Maxwell. “Newton first stated the principle of relativity, and one quotation made in the last chapter was a statement of Newton’s. Why then did the philosophers not make all this fuss about ‘all is relative,’ or whatever, in Newton’s time? Because it was notuntil Maxwell’s theory of electrodynamics was developed that there were physical laws that suggested that one could measure his velocity without looking outside; soon it was found experimentally that one could not. (75)And then there are the puzzling phenomenon such as the concept of relativistic energy itself. “Astonishing as that may seem, in order for the conservation of momentum to work when two objects come together, the mass that they form must be greater than the rest masses of the objects, even though the objects are at rest after the collision!” Think about that for a little while.At each point, Feynman is comedic and thoughtful. Every sentence is designed to relate and to explain. Feynman truly was a unique teacher and physicist."
55,0465023932,http://goodreads.com/user/show/113463801-erik-larsen,5,One sentence takeaway: Knowledge of the basic principles governing the universe is essential (despite being seemingly unimportant to everyday life) to understand your environment.
56,0465023932,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2201886-mike,4,"Ah yes, the six not-so-easy pieces. Another winner!This book is more ""hard science"" than it's predecessor. Meaning that there is more math and mental effort required to follow along. But not a lot, as the bulk of the discussion is still textual. One can skip over the vector math sections and still get the ""gist"" of the topic: relativity. Thus, enjoying the way Feynman approaches and details how we see ""our world"" versus those stuck in a two dimensional one.The book is a treat (as are the other books I've read by him). If you read ""Six Easy Pieces"" and liked it, then I suggest that you grab this one and dive in even if you have no prior interest in ""dimensions"" and ""space-time"". In my case, I recently read several books that covered Einstein and/or relativity, so I was ""primed"" like the proverbial pump. I found it to be another fun romp through the mind of a truly original thinker.Note: While both ""Six Easy..."" and ""Six Not-So-Easy..."" were carved out of the same set of lectures, the publisher waited until the prior volume was a commercial success before bringing out this one. I have not, but I've read that the audio book version (as spoken by Richard Fenyman) is pretty fun to listen to."
57,0465023932,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5059927-zoffix-znet,2,"I've read this book right after I finished the first part, ""Six Easy Pieces"" and the differences between the books are vast. In the first book, you are just a person from a crowd whom Feynman educates on basic workings of the universe. The Not-so-easy Pieces makes you feel more of a student at a lecture, occasionally scratching your head and wondering if your math skills are good enough to fully understand the material. There is definitely quite a few of equations in this book, which is contrasting to the first book. If math is your friend, this book will be a breeze. The explanation of how space-time is curved is definitely superb. The reason I gave the book a somewhat low rating is not so much due to the overall content of the book, but rather due to its structure. One can definitely feel that authors were trying to scrape up some info to put in the book while attempting not to include too much. The result makes you wish you had the original ""Lectures on Physics"" handy as Feynman often makes references to what he said ""earlier"", but the part to which he refers is not actually included in this book."
58,0465023932,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4993854-andr-s-silva,4,"I have found this book much more interesting than the first part. In the first part I discovered that Feynman, as a popularizer of science, is not so good as it is said (in my opinion, of course). With that in mind, I was expecting a difficult read here and I've found it. However, this book contains a very good and complete description of many issues related to Einstein's relativity and other pluses, like an amazing chapter on symmetries. I still think that the easiest introduction to Einstein's is contained in the pages of ""Emperor's New Mind"", by Roger Penrose. However, if you want something more, with mathematical explanations and a good account of the transformations between 3D and 4D space geometries, this is your book."
59,0465023932,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5564491-garrett-mccutcheon,2,"Whereas Six Easy Pieces was a well-written physics primer for lay readers, Six Not-So-Easy Pieces reads like a poorly conceived text book. The introduction of vectors serves to form a foundation for the explanations which follow in the next chapters, but lay readers who don't already have an exposure to vectors aren't likely to learn them from this brief passage, and more experienced readers already have an in depth knowledge of the subject. This second volume loses or neglects everything which made the first volume good. Unfortunately, I can't really recommend this book to anyone; if you're a lay reader, look elsewhere for explanations of these topics, and if you're a student of physics, spend time reading an actual text book and learning the subject."
