0,1400069807,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1085121-stephanie-extremely-stable-genius,4,"I can honestly say I am one of the first people on the planet to have eaten a Chicken Mc Nugget. This is my dad a few years backHe is a mechanical engineer and a total genius. Before I was born my dad had to find a job to support his family (they already had my older sister). My parents wanted to stay near family, so dad started looking around in the Sandusky Ohio area……He got two job offers, one with NASA (yes….NASA) and one with Stein Associates, a brand new company that saw the need for mass food production…..processing it, if you will. They needed someone to design breaders and fryers that ultimately went to companies like Mc Donald’s, Tyson, and Mrs. Pauls, and my dad was the man (Stein offered 10 cents more, NASA lost). They were the only ones out there doing this and had a monopoly on the industry. If it’s been breaded and fried and you didn’t do this yourself, thank my dad. Dad loved his job was good at it. Really good, he has numerous patents and a Da Vinci Award (a big F’n deal). For years he stood at the end of the line taste testing the food. He brought it home for us as well….hey, anywhere you can save a buck with four kids to feed. He traveled the planet working with various companies to get their production lines working. Japan, The Soviet Union (where he was followed by KGB, he wanted to turn around and point out to them that they asked him to come, but he was wise enough not to), England…..pretty much everywhere. All of the travel resulted in bad eating habits not to mention the ‘taste testing’ took its toll. He gained weight and eventually became a type 2 diabetic, and has many other weight related health problems.I don’t know if working at NASA would have been better for his health or wallet, but it would have been way cooler. If I would have ended up with a skinny, healthy dad?…..even cooler.In Salt, Sugar, Fat the author calls out these big food companies. The CEO’s of companies like Kraft and Nabisco actually sat down one day after studies shown that Americans were getting fat, and it looked like it was their food that was causing the problem. On the chart (they had) showed a steady rise in the average Americans weight after 1980, while before that date we chugged right along at a normal weight. What changed? We didn’t suddenly lose control, in mass, for no reason. It was because of what was being done to the food…..don’t get me started on high fructuous corn syrup. So, these asshat CEOs thought about the problem, thought about making a change, actually tried and failed at a few ideas, and in the end they said “fuck it, let’s just make money”.The stuff they do to the processed food is done in such a way it actually causes a person to become addicted to certain foods. It activates the same part of your brain as heroin does. I can’t go into all the details about the subject; you’ll have to read the book for that.Moral of the story, don’t eat processed foods if you can get away with it. Don’t eat fast food like Chicken McNuggets. Shop the perimeter of the grocery store, and avoid all the bad things that taste sooo good.Reviewed on Shelfinflicted "
1,1400069807,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6797862-karen,5,"Probably like most of you, I thought Michael Moss's Salt, Sugar, Fat would be about how these ingredients are not good for us, how to eliminate them from our diets, and perhaps a few recipes to get us started. I was wrong. This book is far more fascinating than that. It's a well written, in depth look at the food industry, and how the products we all know came into being and developed over the years. It names companies like Kellogg's, Kraft, Campbell's and the soft drink giants that produce Coke, Pepsi, and even Dr Pepper, as well as other.Did you know that the amount of sugar and cheese that we each eat today has tripled since 1970? No wonder there is an obesity epidemic today. I was very interested in the story of how the US Government was responsible for the increase in cheese production, how the excess was stored, and how it finally made it's way into a lot of everyday foods as time went by.  There are stories about the science behind product development, and how advertising and product placement get our attention, and get us to buy more. One thing became very clear, and that is that processed foods could not exist without salt, sugar or fat. Even some of the people who used to work for these companies now know that in order to avoid these substances, they also have to avoid the very foods those companies produce. While I do a lot of my own baking, and seldom buy convenience foods, I'm starting to think the cans and boxes that are currently in my house may be greatly reduced in the future. I will likely make more of my own soups and salad dressings and maybe even bread in the future.I think this is an important piece of literature that will withstand the test of time, and will likely be a great reference book about the food industry for many years to come. It's a thick book (over 400 pages) but not difficult reading. It will be available for purchase March 12, 2013. Look for it when the time comes. I think everyone should read it."
2,1400069807,http://goodreads.com/user/show/13359689-jon-swartz,4,"I've read a number of books on food and the food industry (What to Eat, In Defense of Food: An Eater's Manifesto); this is one of my favorites. Rather than vilifying the food industry en-masse, the author takes the time to understand the point of view of industry insiders, especially the scientists that craft our processed food. These people do not come across as evil or uncaring, but just highly motivated to do their jobs well -- for reasons of personal pride, loyalty to their companies, and fierce competitiveness (Coke vs Pepsi, Kellog's vs Post). Unfortunately, the better they do their jobs, the more irresistible, addictive, and unhealthy our processed food becomes.Some memorable highlights:* The people who design our processed food products frequently abstain from them, choosing healthier alternatives for themselves and their families. ""There is a class issue at work in processed foods, in which the inventors and company executives don't generally partake in their own creations...People who work in these companies have very little in common with their audience.""* Neighborhood stores around urban schools are carefully designed to maximize sales from passing students. ""Soft drinks by the door, followed by rows of sweet cakes graduating into salty snacks and a jackpot of candy at the register. The average kid who walked through the door of these stores, researchers had found, scooped up chips, candy, and a sugary drink that came to 360 calories - all for just $1.06."" The stores get much of their needed income from students, so are unlikely to respond to parent's concerns.* American cheese consumption has tripled since 1970. Much of this increase is not due to explicit eating of cheese by itself, but rather to the insertion of cheese into processed foods and recipes. Cheese went from being a rare treat to an ingredient. To eliminate the growing surplus of milk and milk-fat from subsidized farmers, the industry and government has for years colluded (via shared marketing programs) to encourage more milk and cheese consumption.* Companies do sometimes make efforts to improve the nutritional profile of their foods, whether out of true concern for public nutrition or just for PR purposes. Whenever they do, however, their competition rushes in to steal shelf spaces with their more appealing (aka more sugar/fat/salt-ladened) food; profits slip, and Wall Street screams at the companies to stop this irresponsible behavior. Inevitably, capitalism ""succeeds"" in refocusing the companies on going back to what sells.j"
3,1400069807,http://goodreads.com/user/show/16254355-matthew,3,"This book has me torn. It does have a lot of in depth research and it makes a lot of interesting points. But, it demonizes some businesses and foods that I don't necessarily feel deserve it. I love food and I know some of it is bad for me (just like when I used to smoke - I knew it was bad for me the whole time). But, it was my choice and I was not kidding myself that I was doing my body justice. I like fast food and junk food, but I try and eat it in moderation and I exercise when I can. I know that the focus in this book is on people with kids who do not make smart choices and the businesses that take advantage of that. But, I think it is harsh to attack a business for trying to improve sales. Sometimes making food better means adding salt, sugar, and/or fat, but what can you do - it’s what people want!So, while I didn't completely dislike this book - I think it was very one sided. Also, I am not sure that very many of the people this book would need to reach (i.e. people who eat fast food 3 meals a day and snacks the rest of the time) are going to end up reading this book and changing their ways. 400 repetitious pages is a hard way to make a point like this one – I have a hard enough time getting people to read short e-mails.All this book made me want to do is eat more food!Update 5/27/2016 - Just noticed that I forgot to mention this is a Scott Brick audio - that made the experience worth it!"
4,1400069807,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2109885-literary-ames-against-gr-censorship,4,"Cynical people: it's worse than you can even imagine. Privacy infringements, systematic exploitation of children and African Americans, government corruption, and a willful disregard of consumers' health. Moss's three and a half years of investigative reporting for Salt Sugar Fat were well worth the effort, though his writing isn't concise, and boring when it came to describing the careers of food scientists he clearly admires, the points he makes are startling and incredibly important. Although America is the primary country talked about, the problems discussed are global issues.Children and people of African descent are the most vulnerable when it comes to salt, sugar and fat, because they're more prone to acquiring a diet high in all those things, and the food industry has been quick to take advantage by adding more and more SSFs to out compete other brands by appealing to people's taste buds instead of their health, keeping an eye on their bottom lines and not their customers' waistlines. Before reading, I believed it was your responsibility to eat healthily, but reading about America's neglectful and downright harmful governmental practices, allowing food companies to fudge the nutritional information on their products, stops the grocery shopper from making an informed decision about what they wish to put inside their bodies, and therefore food companies are indeed responsible for various serious health conditions, i.e. obesity, diabetes, hypertension, heart disease (cholesterol), and cancers. 'The top contributors to weight gain included red meat and processed meats, sugar-sweetened beverages, and potatoes' in all its forms.SSF addicts are referred to as ""heavy users"" by companies, though even their ex-presidents and CEOs (many of whom Moss personally interviewed) admit the harm they've caused, feel guilty about their part in it, and actively avoid consuming their own products. Jeffrey Dunn, ex-president of Coca-Cola, developed Dasani bottled water and stopped marketing in schools, but was ultimately fired, for which he was grateful, and now he only works with healthy foods.Privacy infringements abound: Coke data-mined customer loyalty cards; General Foods 'had mass-mailing lists composed entirely of the names and addresses of children, in order to better target them with promotions.'Insidious marketing strategies are plentiful: pushing comics like 'The Adventures of Kool-Aid Man' published by Marvel; multiple child-friendly websites pushing junk food; advertising to those who've over-indulged, targeting people with diabetes for their sugar-free products; adding vitamins or a smidgen of fruit for a false healthy image e.g. Capri Sun; or removing real ingredients that you'd think would be essential e.g. Cheez Whiz no longer contains real cheese.Parallels are drawn with the tobacco industry and the health crises surrounding it, and it just so happens Philip Morris, having made its dough in tobacco, now owns a cadre of food brands. Our food is handled by large conglomerates controlling hundreds of brands, who pump potentially harmful artificial additives and who knows what else (oh, wait horsemeat) into our food. Maybe it's time we invested in the little guys going it alone again, where the people in control know exactly what's in their food, and the distance between the guy on the ground floor and the one in the big office on the top floor, is a lot shorter.'Take more than a little salt, or sugar, or fat out of processed food, these experiments showed, and there is nothing left. Or, even worse, what is left are the inexorable consequences of food processing, repulsive tastes that are bitter, metallic, and astringent.'Moss suggests taxing SSFs before they're added to processed foods, though companies will probably pass on that cost to consumers. He also advocates the use of more herbs and spices, but again, since salt is so cheap compared to alternatives, they'd rather stick with what they know than spend more on higher quality, healthier alternatives. Or, we as a society, need to go back to eating the standard three (fresh) meals a day when we ate SSFs in moderation instead of snacking on convenience foods. Now it's becoming harder to peddle SSFs to the public in developed countries, they're despicably looking to exploit the Third World developing nations like India and Brazil.I started my first official diet with the help of MyFitnessPal.com just before reading SSF, and it's made me acutely aware of what I'm eating. Now I read the back of every item while grocery shopping, before deciding to buy it. My nemesis are grain-based carbs, potatoes, orange juice, and butter. I don't have a problem with salt and my 'bliss point' for sugar dropped considerably in my late teens, which is the last time I drank soda.Salt Sugar Fat is definitely a highly recommended read.SUGAR (a methamphetamine)✺ Cocaine acts on the brain in a similar way to sugar: '...researchers have conditioned rats to expect an electrical shock when they eat cheesecake, and they still lunge for it.' Drugs countering the effects of opiates curb the appeal of high fat, high sugar snacks.✺ Nearly every food contains some amount of sugar, naturally occurring in fruit, veg, and milk, so we have no need for 'added sugar'.✺ Sugar is an analgesic (a pain killer).✺ Americans consume '22 teaspoons of sugar, per person, per day', yet 5 teaspoons are recommended -that's half a can of Coke.✺ Fructose is sweeter than glucose and table sugar combined, and has been commercially available since the 1980s.✺ Sugar has a 'bliss point' - a Goldilocks amount, that creates the most pleasure. ✺ Sweetened foods make you more hungry, not less.✺ Sweet liquids bypass the body's controls preventing weight gain. Soda and fruit juice concentrates are liquid sugar.✺ Cereals contain up to 70% sugar, and some believe cereals over 50% sugar should be sold as candy.✺ The Cola War with Pepsi saw Coke inventing supersizing, endorsement deals, and combination deals (e.g. burger with fries), they even put Cokes into the hands of soldiers in WWII at a loss, all to encourage brand loyalty and addiction.✺ Coke's biggest ingredient is water, followed by sugar, then caffeine. Hypertention and diabetes in a bottle - Mmm, healthy.FAT (an opiate)✺ 9 calories per gram, twice that of sugar or protein.✺ Sugar masks and enhances the taste of fat, encouraging you to eat more.✺ No 'bliss point' for fat, the more the better.✺ Whole milk is only 3% fat.✺ American eat up to 33 pounds of cheese per year (60,000 calories), triple the amount in 1970s. It's the biggest source of saturated fat in American diets, followed by red meat, then cakes and cookies.✺ Industrialisation of cows bred indoors on a diet of corn and fat, has increased milk production but lowered the nutritious value of the milk.✺ When Americans moved to low fat milk, the excess fat was converted to cheese, and the American government protected the dairy industry by ludicrously buying up the excess cheese and beef. Cheese-products were made: mac & cheese, meaty pizzas, etc. Even celeb chefs were asked to promote cheese in cookbooks. On behalf of producers, the government aggressively marketed cheese and beef to the American public (and in Mexico).✺ ""Chilled prepared foods"" saw the introduction of Lunchables, containing a child's maximum daily allowance of saturated fat and salt, and more than a can of Coke's worth of sugar.✺ The Department of Agriculture has ignored experts in its Center for Nutrition and has conspired to get the public to eat more.✺ 'Lean meat' doesn't necessarily mean low fat.✺ McDonald's was the first to remove ""pink slime"" from its burgers.✺ When opening a package containing multiple servings, you're more likely to eat the whole thing.SALT✺ 'Sodium pulls fluids from the body's tissues and into the blood, which raises the blood volume and compels the heart to pump more forcefully.' This causes high blood pressure.✺ The least addictive of the big three.✺ We learn this addiction, it's not innate like sugar and fat.✺ Low salt diets increase taste sensitivity to salt, so less is eaten.✺ It's a preservative, masks bitterness, sweetens sugar, adds crunch to things like crackers.✺ 2,300mg recommended maximum per day.✺ England's Food Standards Agency set a limit on how much salt a product could contain and discouraged of salt substitute potassium chloride, effecting US-based companies the most.✺ Processed meats contain added salt e.g. bacon.✺ Cargill, one of the wealthiest privately-owned companies in the world, sells 17 types of sweeteners, 40 types of salt, 21 oils and shortenings.The Horsemeat ScandalThe below paragraph shows me how easy it would be for the European horsemeat scandal to spread to the US:'the Department of Agriculture is actually complicit in the meat industry's secrecy. [...] The burger that Stephanie [paralyzed by E.Coli] ate, made by Cargill, had been an amalgam of various grades of meat from different parts of the cow and from multiple slaughterhouses as far away as Uruguay. The meat industry, with the blessing of the federal government, was intentionally avoiding steps that could make their products safer for consumers. The E. Coli starts in the slaughterhouses, where feces tainted with the pathogen can contaminate the meat when the hides of cows are pulled off. Yet many of the biggest slaughterhouses would sell their meat only to hamburger makers like Cargill if they agreed not to test their meat for E. Coli until it was mixed together with shipments from other slaughterhouses. This insulated the slaughterhouses from costly recalls when the pathogen was found in ground beef, but it also prevented the government officials and the public from tracing the E. Coli back to its source. When it comes to pathogens in the meat industry, ignorance is financial bliss.'That's illegal in the UK under 'traceability' and 'safety'.*My thanks to Random House and Netgalley for the e-ARC in return for an honest review."
5,1400069807,http://goodreads.com/user/show/196884-nick,5,"Once you read this book a trip to the grocery store will never be the same. You will watch your fellow shoppers walk around the store an pick up items like mindless creatures; like your the only one who knows whats really going on, kind of like in the film ""They Live.""The section on fat is mostly about Phillip Morris's acquisition and then spin off Kraft Foods. As the author talks about the various executives, marketers, and product developers I can't help but think of the characters in Mad Men since some of the events take place at the same time.It also tells the story of Kellogs, Post, Oscar Mayer (and Lunchables), General MIlls, General Foods, Kraft, the dairy and meat industries' coziness with (read: heavily lobbied) the USDA and their tax payer funded scheme to make is all drink more milk (Got Milk?) and meat (Beef: Its Whats for Dinner) through programs called checkoffs.Four cheese! Sounds good, right? No, just a way to make you eat more cheese. Diet Coke? That's kind of like a filtered cigarette: it's healthy(er), so indulge!Main points:Most processed foods (bread, cheese, cereal, snacks, candy) tastes terrible without salt.When a food is labeled as having less sugar, it might have more salt and/or fat.When a food is labeled as having less fat, it might have more salt and/or sugar.When a food is labeled as having less salt, it might have more fat and/or sugar.When a food is labeled as having a large number of vitamins added, it is to compensate for the fact that it has large amounts of sugar and/or salt and/or fat.If you switch to low salt or low sodium versions of a food your sensitivity for salt will go down. You might notice it the first few times you eat it, but eventually it will taste like it has the same amount of salt. Processed food is loaded with salt since it helps extend foods' shelf life, so the industry has an intrest in keeping your tolerance hight, which is bad for you.“Real fruit juice” or “natural fruit juice” and “no added sugar” claim on drinks is a trick. The juice has had all of the fiber filtered from it, so it is all sugar. The fiber is what makes fruit healthy, so the benefit is lost. It is not too different from extracting high fructose corn syrup from corn, and then claiming “real corn juice.”“Diet” versions of bad food are “healthier” in the way that filtered cigarettes are “healthier.” Of course neither one is healthy. You’re tricked into picking the lesser of two evils.The tobacco company Philip Morris purchased Oscar Mayer, who used their cigarette-like marketing tactics to get kids to think Lunchables were cool. The daughter of the inventor Lunchables did not let her kids eat it. The inventor of Lunchables has regrets.Kraft created a council that tried to make their foods healthier. It included at least three people (industry insiders) that truly wanted to help reduce sugar, salt, and fat. They succeeded but once shareholders started to complain about the stock's performance, the companies, to the dismay of the three health conscious council members, reversed course and expanded into new geographical territories.A conclusion I came to that was not covered by the book after reading the book:Food that never contained gluten and that you would not think of as containing gluten will be labeled as gluten free, possibly to counter the perception of its large quantity of sugar, salt, or fat."
6,1400069807,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2228181-jill,5,"Several years ago I developed a candida infection; my doctor urged me to give up all sugar products for at least three months.Easier said than done. It didn’t take me long to realize that nearly everything in the grocery aisles contained sugar. And now I know why.Michael Moss, a Pulitzer Prize winning investigative reporter, has written a brilliant book that doesn’t scold, lecture, or patronize. Rather, it reveals the reasons why one out of four American children are at risk for diabetes and why high blood pressure and obesity is soaring out of control. The average adult today is 24 pounds heavier than in 1960.He brings us inside the industry game at companies such as Kraft, Kellogg, General Mill, Coca-Cola, Frito-Lay and Nestle. Surprisingly, John Ruff from Kraft gave up sweet drinks and fatty snacks; Luis Cantarell from Nestle eats fish for dinner, Bob Lin from Frito-Lay avoids potato chips like the plague and so on. Many of the executives of the most highly profiled companies go out of their way to avoid their own products.They are, of course, more “in the know” than the average consumer, who swallows whole the marketing ploys and behind-the-scenes science that turns us into their unwitting pawns. As one executive said at Kraft: “We don’t create demand. We excavate it. We prospect for it. We dig until we find it.”How? First, the companies locate the “bliss point” – that crucial point that identifies when consumers fall in love with a product without the need for the company to pay a penny more. Then, they follow the “better for you” formulation. It works like this: when people clamor loudly enough for healthier products, the companies provide a better-for-you-formulation: lower-fat potato chips or sugar-free ice cream, for example. If done right, they can boost sales or the original full-calorie and full-fat version by drawing more shoppers to the brand.To play it fair, Mr. Moss shows that it’s hard to really get the consumer on board for change. When the “big three” – sugar, salt and fat – are removed, “Corn Flakes taste like metal fillings, the Eggo rozen waffes like straw. Cheez-Its lost their golden yellow hue, turning a sickly yellow, and they went all gummy when chewed. The buttery flavor of the Keeber Town House Light Buttery Crackers, which contained no actual butter to begin with, simply disappeared.”Small wonder, then, that companies would not give these three up in any real way, without a major fight. Salt, sugar and fat are the foundation of processed foods and the American public clamors for convenience and taste, not health benefits. In a particularly unsettling chapter, Mr. Moss shows how the Department of Agriculture and the FDA are really looking out for the interests of the food industry, not the consumer. With a slew of bench chemists, behavioral scientists, package designers, food technicians, lobbyists, Wall Street executives and the government on its side, one can empathize when one executive tells Mr. Moss, “I feel sorry for the public.”This is an important book for any one who is concerned about obesity or diseases – any one who cares about the future of their children – to read. As Mr. Moss concludes, “We, ultimately, have the power to make choices…we decide what to buy. We decide how much to eat.” Becoming informed – and in an engaging manner – is a vital first step."
7,1400069807,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1-otis-chandler,5,"A fascinating in-depth and well researched look at the processed food industry. I recommend this for anyone who buys food at a grocery or convenience store (aka everyone). I read this book hoping to learn more about processed foods and how to avoid them, and I definitely got what I was looking for. Before reading this I was trying to avoid processed foods, and this book has helped increase that resolve, as well as educated me more on how to do it. It is absolutely amazing and frightening how many processed foods - some of which I remember fondly like Capri Sun - have enough salt/sugar/fat to easily account for a quarter or half of your daily recommended limit. This makes it super easy to go way over, and the result is unhealthy, fat Americans.One of the more powerful things of this book was that Moss went deep into the food industry to really understand the dynamics at play. He didn't just demonize them for making the US one of the fattest countries in the world. He interviewed dozens of insiders - current and retired, to get their perspectives. And the bottom line is scary. The food industry has zero incentive to produce healthier food. Because the high calorie food that they make that is stuffed with salt, sugar, and fat sells really well. It's tasty and convenient and cheap, and people buy whats tasty, and have no time or money to make or buy healthier options. And when the industry has tried to reduce the salt, sugar or fat, every time they find that it doesn't sell as well. Sure they have made some incremental improvements here and there, but by and large, the grocery store is a scary place if you don't want to vastly exceed your daily caloric intake. It seems clear to me that things will never get better without government intervention - something that Moss also concludes in the book. Trying to understand a food label is impossible for most people, as (1) you have to know by heart the daily recommended values for calories, salt, sugar, and fat, and (2) you have to do math to figure out how many servings you are eating. Doing both of these just won't happen for 99% of the population, and thus we are where we are. We cannot rely on the food industry to make healthier products - we have make them do so by choosing with our wallets. In my opinion, the FDA or someone in the government needs to get a good designer to fix food labels and get them to a state where any American can easily look at them and go ""oh my gosh this [can of pasta sauce] will account for [a quarter] of my daily recommended [caloric/protein/fat/sugar] intake if I eat it"". Maybe some startup can combine a phone camera and some image recognition to do this. The right organization to drive this is the FDA, but they are not acting.So why doesn't the government act to prevent the obesity epidemic (and yes, that word is appropriate)? Moss spends a bit of time in the book examining this question, interviewing people at the FDA and the Dept of Agriculture. His conclusion is that they aren't incentivized or enabled to act. The food industry is well capitalized and has - for some inescapable reason to me - been able to fight every report of how bad their products are. Regulation is a tricky subject in America, but it seems that even the role of getting information to Americans about how to protect their health is completely broken. One of the more interesting things I learned from the book is how sophisticated the food industry is in marketing their products. Their segmentation is impressive, and they find the right products, messages and mediums for each segment. They have learned to be on top of trends and perform slight of hand tricks with ease. For instance Americans initially loved their breakfasted cereals when marketed using the word ""sugar"". When people finally caught on that many of these were 50-70% sugar (!!!) the industry changed their marketing to promote other aspects, and removed the word sugar. Sugar Frosted Flakes became Frosted Flakes. Same thing for ""low salt"" or ""low fat"" or ""includes some vitamin or nutrient"" trends. This is good to know if you are in the grocery store, as they still use these tricks. If a product is ""low sugar"", it's probably high in fat and/or salt, and same for ""low fat"" or ""low salt"". Or they will pick a nutrient or vitamin and promote that to hide the high amounts of salt, sugar & fat - for instance Tang was marketed as having lots of Vitamin-C (but was and is really bad for you). One of the biggest trends that led to processed food in the past 40 years is summed up by the word ""convenience"". That's been a big part of the food industries marketing tactics, and it's worked. Life has become increasingly busy and complex, and we don't have time to go to work *and* shop for and cook a healthy meal. An aspect of this that I hadn't thought about is the rise of dual-working families - we have gone from 50% of women in the workforce in 1970 to 80% today. Families simply don't have time when both parents work to spend hours cooking when they get home. Thus, ""convenience"", or foods that are easy to buy and make, have risen drastically in that timeframe. Emotionally, I could see how this marketing worked on me as a kid. Hearing about products that I used to eat and remembered fondly was kind of sad. Capri Sun, lunchables, hot pockets are just a few such examples mentioned in the book, none of which is particularly good for you.The most damning evidence Moss finds is that none of the executives or insiders he talked to eat their own dogfood. In fact, they all have diets that explicitly prohibit it. I think that's very telling. Overall, I think book will open your eyes to the ""battlefield"" for space and attention that goes on in the grocery store, and to pay more attention to the labels. That's a big educational process, but one which everyone needs to learn how to do. We need to force the food industry to stop producing foods that are unhealthy by stopping buying them."
8,1400069807,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2679341-jane,5,"Where I got the book: my local library.Food is weird. At least, it is nowadays. Humans like variety; variety in food makes them eat more. Put science and industry at the service of variety, and you get:Be still my British heart.There are tens of thousands of different products in the average grocery store. One thing I learned from this fascinating book is that a successful strategy to increase sales is by line extensions, where, for example, you take a bestselling product like Oreos and come up with variations on the theme, until you reach thisand then you realize you've been keeping your researchers up at night for too long.And, because the food industry is big business, and big business has shareholders to keep happy, the food industry wants you to eat its food. Lots of it.GREED IS GOOD.Yes, my friend, Wall Street wants you to be a greedy pig. It WANTS you to eat the whole bag of chips because, dagnammit, you're supporting the economy! It is the American Way to crave a FourthMeal! A Giant Gulp is a patriotic gesture!But the trouble is...There's a price to pay. Obesity and its first cousins heart attack and diabetes are roaring along at record levels. And the food industry knows it. But the food industry is, first and foremost, an industry, responsible to its shareholders. As Michael Moss says, ""It is simply not in the nature of these companies to care about the consumer in an empathetic way.""Salt, sugar and fat are the food industry's weapons in the war to sell more food, gain bigger market shares and keep the Wall Street analysts happy. Moss goes into the science behind why, the more processed food you eat, the more you WANT to eat; these foods are painstakingly engineered to be, well, as addictive as possible. The addiction factor is supported by marketing campaigns that literally make your mouth water, and by careful product placement overseen by regular visits from food company employees.Yep, the checkout lane. That insidious piece of marketing we all accept as normal.Chances are that if you've picked up this book, you're already converted to the idea that processed food is bad for you. As I am, after years of weight gain and other symptoms, blooming in middle age into terrible (and socially awkward) gastric attacks and asthma attacks as my body tries to expel that xanthan gum that snuck into my soup or the polysorbate 80 in the cream. The last few years have been one long lesson about what I can and can't eat, label reading and an increasing adoption of the clean eating ethos.But enough about me. What will you find inside this book? Well, for one thing, absorbing entertainment and thought-provoking findings such as the very telling fact that the top executives in the food industry go out of their way to avoid eating the very foods they foist on the unsuspecting public (in America, but increasingly all over the world) BECAUSE THEY'RE UNHEALTHY. Moss doesn't hesitate to name names: in fact, one of the most fascinating aspects of Salt, Sugar, Fat for me is the way he engages with the personalities behind the products. He reminds us that the food industry isn't faceless; these are people who earn a living persuading us to eat more.Not all of them. There are renegades and prophets of doom; those who remind their companies of the moment when forty or so states rose up against the cigarette industry on behalf of their health care systems. Obesity costs money; what the food companies gain, the economy as a whole suffers because of rising health insurance costs and sick employees.There is a lawsuit waiting to happen; or, as Moss speculates, the solution may come in the form of government regulation. And he concludes with an appeal to the consumer: ""They may have salt, sugar, and fat on their side, but we, ultimately, have the power to make choices. After all, we decide what to buy. We decide how much to eat.""Except that ""healthy"" food is an industry all its own. Open up any magazine aimed at consumers who are trying to eat right and you'll find it full of ads for products made by the selfsame companies that bring you the 32oz soda and the candy bar. Every time there's an eating trend, the industry jumps all over it and produces a solution that's not a solution. Low fat products that have more sugar and salt to make them taste better without the fat. Low sugar products that have more fat and salt than the regular version. Oh, I could go on. There are so many goodies to feast on in this book that I could talk about it all day. Moss's journalistic style, while not always as fluent as I'd like, is that of the educated man on the street, and he appeals to a fairly well informed audience in his use of facts and figures and his incorporation of science. If you're starting to wake up to the power of food in your life and want to gain a better understanding of the role of the food industry in our global economy and everyday existence, you could do worse than to read this book."

Rather, he discovered, we are driven to eat by other forces in our lives. Some of these are emotional needs, while others reflect the pillars of processed food: first and foremost taste, followed by aroma, appearance, and texture.“If you eat food, you should read this book. Sugar Salt Fat: How the Food Giants Hooked Us caused a very conflicted reaction in me, because although American capitalism is founded on the principle of caveat emptor, the vast majority of people have never been given the tools and information to make informed decisions. And when the government, and by extension, public schools, align themselves with the food giants, surely it is unfair to put all the responsibility on the consumer. Yes, it is up to us what we eat–how we fuel our bodies. But without labels that reflect a real serving size, classes for every student on nutrition and cooking, and foods that a create repeat buyers, not daily nutrition, it seems like we are doomed. Moss gives the reader a crash course in modern packaged food development and the three cardinal points of salt, sugar and fat, its strong connection with marketing and consumerism, and its somewhat ethically challenged science (hello, Oppenheimer) that connects it with biology and craving. The long version, is, as always, at my site. Because it'll be there.https://clsiewert.wordpress.com/2014/..."
10,1400069807,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2018505-thomas,4,"In a nutshell: the food industry cares more about money than human health and well-being.Not in a nutshell: in his detailed and well-written book Salt Sugar Fat, Pulitzer Prize-winning reporter Michael Moss shows how the food industry has hooked Americans on salt, sugar, and fat. He exposes how scientists calculate the ""bliss point"" of sugar to seduce consumers into craving more, how companies reconfigure the chemical structure of fat to enhance its taste, and how the industry incorporates salt into a massive variety of processed foods. He includes a variety of perspectives, ranging from former bosses and employees of food companies, to researchers trying to crack down on how to understand people's propensities for salt, sugar, and fat.Moss has done extensive research here. My favorite part of this book centers on just how specific he gets. Moss delves into the scientific properties of these substances and their biological and psychological effects on humans with a confident and knowledgeable writing style. He consults with renowned researchers and former company executives to get a true insider's view of how the food industry targets its marketing to make its products irresistible. Moss's deconstruction of products like Lunchables and Tang impressed me, as he travels deep into the history and creation of these unhealthful foods. He accomplishes all of this without demonizing the food industry; while some of these folk may have hearts as cold as steel, others just want to provide jobs for their communities and income for their families. A quote I enjoyed about the nature of such companies:""It's simply not in the nature of these companies to care about the consumer in an empathetic way. They are preoccupied with other matters, like crushing their rivals, beating them to the punch. The most amazing thing about the secret 1999 meeting of food company CEOs to discuss obesity was that they got together at all. The grocery store, after all, is littered with the results of their war to outsell one another by arming their products with more salt, sugar, and fat. Witness what happened when Post started coating its cereal with sugar: Rivals came out with versions that went as high as 70 percent. Or look at what happened when Hershey introduced its mega-chocolate cookie in 2013: Kraft responded by rolling out a slew of fattier, sweeter Oreos.""I have a couple of minor qualms with this book. First, I felt that Moss could have incorporated some of the consumers' perspectives. He discusses the repercussions that salt, sugar, and fat have on people quite a bit, so the book may have been even more effective if he interviewed or spoke with some of these non-industry or research-oriented folk. The ending of Salt Sugar Fat also struck me as abrupt. Instead of Moss just writing ""now that you have all this info go ahead and be healthier people now!"" he could have provided more concrete ways to make more informed, nutritious decisions. He also could have synthesized his writings about each of the substances to integrate the information presented within every section.Despite these few issues, Salt Sugar Fat serves as a searing exploration into the food industry and its products. Would recommend to anyone interested in nutrition, marketing, and/or the role the food industry has in perpetuating obesity."
11,1400069807,http://goodreads.com/user/show/28266234-7jane,4,"There is now more obesity around the world than ever, and it all can be best blamed on these three things: salt, sugar and fat. Each of them is tackled separately in this book. The book is US-centric, yet it's quite easy to apply to other countries, some through brands that are international (Coca-Cola and such), and some through country-centric versions. Plus there are of course all those fast food chains. This book talks about the food companies, how they put profit before health - some a bit more reluctantly now, but in the end money matters the most.

12,1400069807,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3236194-caroline,5,"***NO SPOILERS***By now it’s pretty much common knowledge that processed food is horrible for one’s health. Salt, Sugar, Fat goes into that, but what author Michael Moss was really concerned with were the inner workings of the processed food industry and how it’s lured and fooled consumers. Salt, Sugar, Fat is part business history and part science. It’s also a warning and gigantic wake-up call. The industry is smarter than the consumer. It knows humans are wired to love sugar and fat from birth. It knows precisely how to make them crave salt, a taste for which is not present at birth. It knows how to make a product just sweet enough (what it calls the “bliss point”) to keep consumers compulsively eating and that foods can never be too fatty. It doesn’t care. Its goal is to make the tastiest foods so people keep eating through their processed food quickly and run back to buy more and more. An exact understanding of how people operate is how these companies have been successful for so many decades.A large chunk of this book is devoted to marketing tactics, which involve the most elaborate, unbelievable deception. In their insidiousness, the marketing campaigns are ingenious. These range from changing a product’s name (as in Kellogg’s changing “Sugar Smacks” to “Honey Smacks” when sugar consumption became a health concern) to introducing just enough doubt in scientific studies questioning nutritional content. Also fascinating is how companies positively slave to create each new food. All major companies employ cream-of-the-crop marketers and also hundreds of scientists, technicians, and a few psychologists. I give Moss a lot of credit for how much work he must have put into Salt, Sugar, Fat, but I give him extra credit for going one step further by interviewing former industry insiders. These were people who left when they could no longer ignore their nagging consciences. I lost count, but two that stood out to me were from Coke and Frito-Lay. Tellingly, all of these insiders eschew the food they helped produce and live lifestyles filled with whole foods and regular exercise. The processed food industry will never go away, but Salt, Sugar, Fat empowers. As waistlines grow ever larger and health care costs from heart attacks and strokes continue to soar, this is crucial reading. "
13,1400069807,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1166663-carol,5,"The Hook - Salt, Sugar, Fat: How the Food Giants Hook Us has been on my radar since its publication. Since my retirement my eating habits have slipped. Fortunately I haven’t gained any weight and my blood pressure and cholesterol levels remain stable. I felt it was time to take my daily diet back. No better place to start than here. The Line – Like potato chips that you can’t resist, it’s hard to choose one line that stands out when there’s so much to choose from.”Salt, sugar, and fat are the foundation of processed food, and the overriding question the companies have in determining the formulation of their products is how much they need of each to achieve the maximum allure.”The Sinker – Which is to blame for the fattening and declining health of our nation, salt, sugar, or fat? If I had to choose from these, sugar seems to be the most manipulated by the food industry. You may come up with a different villain but none are without blame. If it has done nothing else for me, it has got me reading those food labels more closely once again. I’m amazed at what I’m finding. Without standing on a bandwagon or sounding preachy I am going to let you come to your own conclusions. Moss’s book is a real eye-opener."
14,1400069807,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3749410-aaron-arnold,4,"This is one of those Rorschach books, with parts that will resonate differently with you depending on your prior views of the processed food industry. Looking around at reviews of this book, I found basically two different reactions to Moss' research and analysis, both pro- and anti-industry. I'll go over both of them, because, to paraphrase Trotsky, you may not be interested in the food industry, but it is very interested in you, and an accurate understanding of what it does and how it works is essential if you're someone who likes to eat healthy and avoid swelling into a greasy party balloon like so many of our fellow Americans (and fellow humans in general, if you look at the depressing upswing in global obesity trends).A defense of companies like Kraft, Nestlé, or Cargill might go something like this: food companies, in many if not all cases, are simply responding to consumer desires by using innovative research techniques and the latest in food technology to feed people by providing them with a large variety of foods that offer low costs, plenty of calories, convenient preparation and storage, and endless levels of customization for even the most discriminating palate. If people didn't want this stuff, they wouldn't buy so much of it. Furthermore, even much-derided food products like Kraft cheese product were typically not developed to ensnare obtuse, obese rubes but to solve entirely legitimate problems of food preparation and distribution; in Kraft's case, how to distribute cheese in the days before refrigeration. The modern obesity epidemic isn't the companies' fault because consumers are the best judges of their own preferences for the amount of fat, sugar, or salt they ingest. Besides, obesity can be just as easily linked to things like modern patterns of car-centric transportation, more sedentary modes of employment, people's changing eating habits, or government intrusion into the agricultural market via methods like price supports than to processed food products on their own. If children find products like Lunchables so delicious they won't eat fruits and vegetables, maybe it's because they're actually good, and besides, you're the parent here. Stop trying to write your Congressman and grab a refreshing Coke instead, you'll feel better.There is some truth to all of those statements, and hence the opposing case is a bit more complicated. Processed food companies aren't simply responding to consumer demand, they are creating demand: nobody was out petitioning for Big Gulps filled with Mountain Dew: Code Red, PepsiCo unleashed that sugary, fattening concoction on the market to make a quick buck, using advanced research to determine exactly which segments of the population would be most susceptible to its lure. Processed food products claim to offer guilt-free indulgence and convenience, but the mentality of ""hey, we're just selling this stuff"" is identical to the logic used by purveyors of more harmful products like tobacco companies (many of which are in fact identical to processed food companies, e.g. RJR Nabisco or Phillip Morris and Kraft). Food companies have aggressively fought efforts to make their foods healthier or their ingredients or serving sizes more comprehensible, actively lobbied for federal subsidies to support their businesses, and have behaved in cartel-like fashion in markets such as the one for breakfast cereal. Since food is necessary, its advertising to children, which can shape lifelong patterns of consumption, can't be compared to theoretically harmless advertising for other types of products. If processed food is so benign, why do the developers and executives of food companies invariably never feed their own children their products? Big Food - more like Big Fat.In between these two reactions, each of which is valid in its own way (though I agree with the latter much more strongly), lies a bunch of interesting history and research. You'll become familiar with famous names like Betty Dickson (AKA Betty Crocker), John and Will Kellogg, and James Kraft, as well as less-famous names like Howard Moskowitz, Al Clausi, and Geoffry Bible, who worked in the industry and did a lot to shape our modern tastes and palates. I knew that people who drank diet soda often didn't actually lose weight, but I learned that a taste for salt is something that can be developed and not inborn, as opposed to fat and sugar, which everyone loves. Myth busted: Tang was not actually invented specifically for the space program. The big lawsuits against tobacco companies, along with public health efforts designed to reduce smoking, have many parallels with efforts by mayors like Michael Bloomberg of NYC to reduce obesity.Ultimately it's hard to be very sympathetic to big food companies, even if they're merely exploiting neurochemical loopholes that we all have due to our recent emergence into a landscape where hunger has been banished (at least in the first world). I'm by nature skeptical of faddish diets (e.g. Atkins, no carb, paleo), but the effects of too much salt, sugar, and fat on people are unambiguous, even if a great deal of food that people prepare for themselves is scarcely any healthier. Moss doesn't really offer a plan to cure ourselves of our addiction to terrible foods, but this is a good history, and will hopefully help people to really think about what they eat. Calvin & Hobbes' famous Chocolate Frosted Sugar Bombs are no joke!"
15,1400069807,http://goodreads.com/user/show/350233-casey,4,"Go into a typical American grocery store, and you won't find that they stock much food. The real food lines the edges: produce, meat and seafood, dairy. If you want real food that was produced locally and sustainably, with care paid to proper animal-husbandry practices, you're probably out of luck entirely. The interior of the store is filled with food products: mostly nutrient-poor corn and soy based ""foods"" engineered to make you keep reaching for just one more. These products are heavily marketed towards children.Let's take a look at the ingredient list for Cheetos, which is available online but are not able to be copied and pasted because Frito-Lay seems to want to keep this information as secret as possible. Spoiler alert: this stuff is pretty much poison. My comments on the ingredients appear as footnotes.Enriched Corn Meal [1] (Corn Meal, Ferrous Sulfate, Niacin, Thiamin Mononitrate, Riboflavin, and Folic Acid), Vegetable Oil [2] (Corn, Canola, and/or Sunflower Oil), Cheese Seasoning (Whey, Cheddar Cheese [Milk, Cheese Cultures, Salt, Enzymes], Canola Oil [3], Maltodextrin [Made From Corn] [4], Salt, Whey Protein Concentrate, Monosodium Glutamate [5], Natural and Artificial Flavors [6], Lactic Acid, Citric Acid [7], Artificial Color [Yellow 6] [8]), and Salt.Cheetos were the first food product I could think of, but many food products have similar ingredients. Seriously, the crap that lines the grocery store shelves is mostly corn with artificial flavorings. I wouldn't feed most of these products to anyone, but millions of people are buying them for their children. How the hell did this happen?Salt Sugar Fat attempts to provide an answer, by detailing a historical account of processed food. The first section, Sugar, explains how we've gone from healthy breakfast standards like eggs, bacon, and sausage, to eating bowls of glorified sugar for breakfast. It's incredibly disturbing, especially when you hear how food companies go about creating and marketing these products. Unbelievably, many cereals make claims about their ""healthy whole grains""(which aren't even particularly healthy) even though their cereals are pretty much 50% sugar.Case in point: the insane claim that Frosted Mini Wheats ""boost brain power."" Check it out. This is all based on in-house studies, and they didn't even do a good job biasing the studies because the data don't support the claims, but that didn't stop the food companies from marketing sugary wheat as a health product. Seriously, you can't make this shit up.The fat section is a bit more uneven than the sugar section. See, sugar is something that pretty clearly has no nutritional value and shouldn't be a major part of anyone's diet. Fat, on the other hand, is more complicated. Moss writes based on the misconception that polyunsaturated fats are healthy and that saturated fats should be avoided at all costs, which is outdated (the true story is much more nuanced than that, and really depends on whether you're getting your saturated fat from grass fed cows or from processed foods). This grated on me. However, the kinds of fats he's talking about are processed fats, so my nit-picking isn't terribly relevant, because no one thinks processed cheese and trans fats are healthy.I didn't realize how much cheese people were eating. See, Americans have decided that whole milk is, like, super bad for them; apparently, they've traded milk consumption for seriously excessive amounts of cheese consumption. Moss outlines how cheese turned from something to be enjoyed in moderation with a little charcuterie and wine, to an ingredient that can be used in a ton of different products (on the cheap, of course). This is mostly due to some incredibly insane government subsidies that lead to more milk being produced than the market needed, or even wanted. You'll never look at that box of Mac and ""Cheese"" (really, cheese product) again. The final section, Salt, deals with the truly insane amounts of salt put into processed foods. People seem to know that salt can be damaging in large quantities, but the ""solution"" has been removing the salt shaker and eating bland food at home. Truth is, if you're making food from scratch, you don't really need to worry about the amount of salt you're consuming. The major issue is the sodium in processed foods, which contributes to the texture and covers up off flavors, like the ""warmed over flavor"" that comes from oxidized food products. Without salt, processed foods taste completely disgusting, so don't expect to see truly low-sodium versions of these foods in the future. I'm subtracting one star, because processed foods are deeply connected to science, which Moss does not write about well. As a scientist myself, it pains me to see descriptions like this one about ""brain imaging, which allowed [Nestlé] to perform nifty experiments like wiring the scalps of its human test subjects to EEG machines in order to see how, say, Dreyer's ice cream…excites the brain's neurology"" (emphasis added). Read that again, because it's terrible. EEG measures electrical signals that indicate neuronal activity in the brain. Neurology is a brach of medicine that deals with nervous system disorders. The book includes many errors like this, although more often Moss fails to include any sort of methodological information at all. Of course, if Americans were more science literate, we wouldn't need books like this in the first place.My criticisms aside, I would definitely recommend this book, especially for people who are newer to healthy eating. [1] Made from genetically modified corn, although they don't have to say that on the label on the label, and grown in a monoculture that's incredibly harmful to the environment[2] A chemically extracted, terribly unhealthy oil that's been touted as healthier than good old-fashioned butter (if this sounds surprising to you, I highly encourage you to check out this debunking of the China Study, as well as the wonderfully accessible book Real Food, which explains the sound nutritional advice of the Weston A. Price Foundation. Besides being horrible for you, most vegetable oils are genetically modified.[3] Why Canola oil would be added to cheese, I have no idea, as cheese naturally contains a fair amount of milk fat[4] Maltodextrin is a type of sugar[5] Yep, that's MSG[6] Both ""natural"" and artificial flavorings are created in labs; ""natural"" products aren't particularly natural, but they're made from things you might find in nature, ish. This Scientific American article explains it well.[7] Lactic Acid and Citric Acid both act as preservatives[8] This is manufactured from petroleum, and is a carcinogen. Yummy."
16,1400069807,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2906120-vanessa,5,"Wow, wow, wow. I cannot say enough wonderful things about this book. I feel I have been forcing this book into conversations I've had with people all week. I literally cannot shut up about it. It is one of the most interesting, engaging non-fiction books I've read in years. Ever wonder how Coke and Pepsi came to be enemies? How a grocery store is strategically designed to pray on innocent shoppers? How General Foods literally put their own people in Home Ec classes around America to promote convenience over making healthy food from scratch? It's all in here and loads more.These sort of encapsulated histories of big industries can be interesting at first... but you quickly tire of being inundated with thousands of mundane facts and statistics (at least I do). Salt Sugar Fat never once bored me. It was endlessly fascinating, horrifying and enlightening. I highly recommend listening on audio (done by Scott Brick) at the gym and while grocery shopping. That's what I did, and I was shocked at how much of the book I was able to confirm with my very eyes on the shelves of my local store.The last passage summed up my entire takeaway. That we ultimately have choices when we shop and while this book should not serve as a moral scolding, it should empower the reader to understand what is truly behind all the labels in advertising so we can make educated choices. And that is exactly what this book did for me. I pledge to put this in the hands of at least 10 other people by end of the year. "
17,1400069807,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5196292-miriam-downey,4,"You can find my full review here: http://mimi-cyberlibrarian.blogspot.c... My granddaughter aged 20 months, sits in her highchair. Her lunch is some strawberries, some carrots, and a hotdog with cheese in the middle. She pokes a few strawberries in her mouth and drops all the carrots on the floor. Then she eats one slice of the hotdog with cheese. With a smile on her face, she looks at me and says, ""Umm, delicious!"" In an instant, the hotdog slices are gone. Another child lost to ""salt, sugar, and fat.""In his book with the same name, Salt, Sugar, Fat, Michael Moss has created a highly readable study of the food industry and its drive to create ever more edible concoctions to please the palate and the pocketbook and keep you coming back for more. Food scientists strive to ""optimize"" their products to maximize our cravings for them. You all remember the slogan, ""betcha you can't eat just one,"" for Lays potato chip. Well, that was a food scientist at work, creating a product with just the right amount of salt and fat to make you want to eat those chips until the bag is empty. And then there is the ""bliss point"" for the soft-drink industry--the point where you open up the can and go ""Ahhh."" Combine the right amount of sugar, the right amount of salt and a whopping dose of fat and you have food science in a nutshell (with salt on it of course.) The whole reason for adding things to food is to optimize products to maximize cravings. Moss says: ""These are the pillars of processed foods, the three ingredients without which there would be no processed foods. Salt, sugar and fat drive consumption by adding flavor and allure. But surprisingly, they also mask bitter flavors that develop in the manufacturing process. They enable these foods to sit in warehouses or on the grocery shelf for months. And, most critically to the industry's financial success, they are very inexpensive.""The preface of the book is very enlightening. In the late 1990s when the epidemic of obesity was just being recognized, a group of food industry leaders, including CEOs of many of the food giants, gathered together to discuss business strategy. The leader of the meeting was trying to impress upon the businessmen that they were most likely going to need to change their strategies if they were going to weather the coming storm of criticism about their industry regarding obesity. At the end of the meeting, no one was convinced that they wanted to change any strategy, and most went back to their companies and added more salt, sugar and fat to their already laden products. Moss's book is very well researched, and he also acts like a journalist doing many interviews. I found the book very helpful as my husband and I continue to rid our lives and our pantries of the junk that has weighted us down all our lives. Our mothers were part of the 1950s when convenience foods were just coming into their own. Mixes, frozen foods, packaged cookies, TV dinners and chicken pot pies. My oh my! The scourge of our generation. After reading Salt, Sugar, Fat, I renewed with vigor my nutritional quest. I am now reading nutritional information on every single item I buy, shopping only the outside aisles of the store, and emptying my cupboards of snacks. If I don't eat one, I will never eat the whole bag. I am proud to say that we are making good progress.The grocery chain where I shop, Meijers, has a big promotion every couple of months where they offer dozens of items on a 10 for $10 sale with the eleventh item free. Last week for the first time they had nearly as many fresh items on the sale as they did processed items. So for every can of Spaghetti o's, there was an avocado; for every bag of cookies, there was a bag of lettuce. I am proud of the company for making the decision to promote fresh items. My challenge for this year is to try to not buy any processed food items when I go to the grocery. Is it possible? Hope so!You might also like to read Taste What You're Missing by Barb Stuckey.

18,1400069807,http://goodreads.com/user/show/185835-yulia,4,"This book does not vilify food manufacturers, nor does it make excuses for them: what it does is make one realize what one is up against every time one enters a grocery or convenience store or looks at a vending machine. In sections devoted to the role of salt (and sodium), sugar and fat in processed foods, Moss lays out the series of techniques that food scientists, advertisers, package designers, financial officers and sellers use to discover, shape and give consumers exactly what they want. Moss shows that individuals in the food industrial complex can try to do the best by their customer, but still struggle to change an industry driven by stock prices and profit margins. Unfortunately, processed foods will not become healthier until consumers stop buying them in their current forms. The book becomes a bit repetitive in the salt and fat sections, but it still manages to be a page-turner. In the course of the book, Moss brings up the existence of a bliss point in enjoying sugar, the effect of sugar on dulling our awareness of fat, the heightening of our salt cravings and our ability to resensitize our palate, the Coke and Pepsi wars (and how no side loses), the ability of minimally edible foods like Lunchables to attract children, the advertising of pure fructose as ""made from real fruits,"" and the limited role of the USDA and FDA in shaping food policy. Together, these stories reveal the true cost of convenience and unimpeded capitalism on the consumer: food addiction, obesity, and heart disease. What can the consumer do? Read the nutrition label and list of ingredients (or ask someone with better vision to read them for you), write down a grocery list before shopping and stick to it, be especially careful with what you give very young children, and try to be mindful about what you consume without developing orthorexia. Good luck!"

It takes a special writer to craft a piece of nonfiction that is not only informative, but engaging. Michael Moss is not that author, at least not in this book. It is evident that he did his research and spent a lot of time gathering his facts over the years, and that may be part of the problem. He seemed so invested in the time he spent, that he included too much information in the book, and it simply became repetitive. Worse, Moss attempted to turn his factual information in some small narratives, which failed miserably. Rather than simply creating characters out of the real people in this book based on their actions within the food industry, Moss instead used cliche, lazy, and unrelated information in regards to his stock characters - i.e. ""a brawny former athlete who hated to lose more than he loved to win."" Furthermore, the actual information in this book was beyond uninformative. People seem to be shocked by the information here. I thought this book would explain more of the science behind created processed foods, but instead, Moss simply would relay a boring anecdote about ""a brawny former athlete"" and end it with, ""and so they added more sugar."" He thinks he is groundbreaking by trying to popularize the term ""bliss point,"" but Malcolm Gladwell you are not. And the majority of this book simply explained that these major food companies spend billions on advertising to sell us the foods laden with salt, sugar, and fat. If it is groundbreaking to you that the reason you eat many of these processed foods stems from advertising for them, then you are an idiot and you did enjoy this book."
20,1400069807,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3144198-elizabeth-moeller,5,"I received this book as a Goodreads giveaway. I thought this book was amazing! I consider myself to be a fairly healthy eater. I like fruits and vegetables and try to stay away from too much processed food. However, after reading this book I have even more of a commitment from staying away from any food that was developed in a laboratory. The author is not preachy. He is not advocating for a certain diet. I have been turned off by other authors such as Michael Pollan who seem to be pushing eating rules on people that are not practical. Instead, Moss has set himself the task of investigating how the processed food giants, including Kraft, Kellog's and others, have relied on the three pillars of Salt, Sugar and Fat to seduce people into eating the maximum amount of processed foods. The author is the journalist who first cracked open the ""pink slime"" meat scandal and the depth of his investigative journalism is really impressive. It seems that he has spoken with scores of researchers, marketers and financial officers of the processed food companies in order to learn about things such as the invention of the Lunchable, as a way to sell more processed meats, and the growth of cheese from a food meant to be savored on its own into an ingredient that is shoved into a million different kinds of food. I would highly recommend this book to anyone who is interested in nutrition, or in the business of food. I would also recommend it to anyone who is looking for a push to close up the bag of chips or give up a soda habit. "
21,1400069807,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3727168-teresa-lukey,4,"Salt, Sugar, Fat (the book-that is) is a healthy read about the unhealthy industry of processed foods. Although a little long-winded at times (the only reason for the 4-star rating, otherwise it would have received a 5-star rating)this book will be a healthy addition to your diet.In my home I work really hard to make as much as possible from scratch, but I also work full-time and feel like I am literally going out of my mind trying to keep up at times. This book reinforces the importance of not relying on processed food from day-to-day making what I do rewarding in the long run.I am always ranting about how things really took a turn for the worse, when mothers started to work in the late 40's, early 50's and this book is just more re-enforcement for that theory of mine. Processed food really came out of that time period due to working mothers needing quicker ways to provide meals for their families after a long day of work.The most disturbing part is that their seems to be no morality in what the food manufacturers are doing, they are so driven by profit that the greater good keeps getting pushed aside. But, fear not, I see a movement happening amongst my fellow humans and I do believe that something better must be around the corner.My recommendation is to eat simple foods-steamed veggies, baked or grilled lean meats, rice, fruits (you will be amazed by how much better you feel and surprised when some of those ailments clear up)-just do not buy those boxed items, then the food manufactures will have do do something to meet the new demands of the more health conscience consumer."

I checked the ingredient list and limited myself to one serving. Thank you, Michael Moss, for a riveting, illuminating, horrifying, scandalous read. It's been a long time since I looked at a Hot Pocket, but I'll certainly never look at one the same way again (over 100 ingredients listed in the calzone...um, what?). A fascinating look at genius marketing tactics, the pressures of Wall Street, the processed food industry corporate machine, food engineering, human psychology, and the ugly aftermath of unchecked consumption."
23,1400069807,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8668007-anna,5,"This was an absolutely fascinating read. There are many books on the state of our food supply, and many of them are equally interesting, but what differentiates this one from the rest of the pack is that it uses this Pulitzer prizewinning investigative reporter's skills to present a history of processed food in America. Michael Moss has gone *deep*, digging up sources from the big food processors, making freedom of information requests from the government and he has found an amazing story. Not only do we get to read the science of salt, sugar & fat, why they are so addictive both to food consumers and to food producers, we also get to sit in at corporate meetings where the struggle between making money and being responsible members of society takes place. Spoiler alert, making money always wins in the end. In fact it becomes clear from the histories of various companies' attempts to make their food healthier without losing market share that the only countries where this has worked at all, are those where governments have strictly regulated the levels of sugar, salt and fat in their nation's food. Without that level playing field every company that tries to cut back on sugar, salt and fat quickly has their market share eaten up by their competitors and then Wall Street investors demand that said company add more sugar, salt and fat back into their foods in order to improve profits. The story of Kraft's heartfelt attempt to improve nutrition was particularly enlightening. They really tried. Their parent company, Phillip Morris, had just had to pay out hundreds of billions of dollars as reparations to state health services for damage caused by smoking, and they really, seriously, didn't want to end up doing the same for damages due to obesity. And even with all that market muscle they still couldn't pull it off. Our food supply is in an appalling state. We have a system where the only food most people can afford (both in terms of money & time) to eat is highly processed, and that highly processed food is actively dangerous to their health. As a volunteer at my local food bank I see this play out all the time. Twice a week I run an emergency food pantry there. We often have healthier options like brown rice, wild game, fresh veggies & lentils, and some people take advantage of that, but other people are working three jobs while raising kids and just don't have the time either to cook from scratch, or as is more likely, to learn how to cook from scratch, because no one ever taught them how. And no matter how much I try to teach them new ways of eating, they are at a low point in their lives, tired & scared and it is really hard to learn new things in that state. So they happily choose cans of beef stew, cold cereal and boxes of mac and cheese because it tastes good, it's easy, it's familiar, and that way they don't starve. But that food, as the research presented in this book makes clear, is really very dangerous for them. And the fact they they don't know how to cook? That's not a coincidence. This book documents the food processors' successful campaign to undermine the USA's network of home economics teachers, turning the profession from teaching kids how to shop thriftily & cook from scratch to teaching kids how to be good consumers of pre-processed product. The problem the food companies have is that there are only 7 billion people on this planet, so there is a finite market for their goods. Unless of course they can get people to eat more of them. Coca Cola for example doesn't talk about consumers, or coca cola fans, they talk about ""heavy users"". Their aim is to create more heavy users and get existing heavy users to drink more coca cola because that increases their market share in the most efficient way. The research that goes into turning people into heavy users of processed food is awe inspiring, I found the scientific sections of the book to be the most interesting. For example, it turns out there is a bliss point at which people find sugar to be the most pleasing. Less sugar isn't as tasty and more sugar is also suboptimal. But where fat is concerned people don't seem to have a bliss point as such, or at least not one that has been found yet. People stop eating fat when they think they've had enough - unless the fat is mixed with sugar in which case people are amazingly bad at realizing that there is any fat in what they are eating at all. Adding sugar to your fatty foods or vice versa is a great way for food processors to overcome the human body's inbuilt defenses against over eating & thus sell more product. If any of this sounds interesting to you I strongly suggest checking out this excerpt from the book at the New York Times and then deciding if you want to get the whole book. "
24,1400069807,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5208303-maxine,5,"I have always thought my eating habits were, if not great, not really terrible either. I don't drink pop, I rarely eat red meat, and I don't add much salt to my food. Turns out I've been wrong. The yogurt I eat has just as much sugar as the ice cream it was meant to replace; I replaced red meat with cheese, one of the worst offenders in the junk food catalogue, according to author, Michael Moss; and not adding salt to my food, in many cases, only means I'm not adding insult to the injury of the already salt-laden processed foods I eat. Turns out what I thought was a relatively good diet was a lie, much of it fostered by the processed food industry, a kind of smoke-and-mirrors magic show but the amazing illusions it has created can kill us. Stephen King couldn't have written a better horror story.In Salt, Sugar, Fat, Moss talks about his three year journey through the processed food industry and what he found was truly frightening. The three ingredients in the title are the pillars of the industry and to say the industry uses them liberally is like saying hockey can be a little violent at times. The amount of these ingredients used is shocking and has led to the epidemic of obesity, Type-2 diabetes, and other health concerns which are taxing our health and the health care industry. Nor is the industry unaware of the problems it is creating. Moss spent a great deal of time talking to the scientists who are responsible for the creation of many of the worst offenders, many of whom have at least tried to make healthier changes. But, as Moss points out, this is an industry more beholden to its shareholders than its consumers. If they can't show profits, Wall Street will want to know why and it won't take 'health crisis' for an answer.And the industry does its best to comply. Children's shows are inundated with commercials pushing cereals with enough sugar to take down an elephant; guilt-ridden working moms are told that fat-laden lunchables are a healthy and fun way to make the kids happy; and who doesn't like cheese on their easily prepared frozen pizza, lots and lots of cheese, something the whole family can enjoy. And the industry keeps the price low so that these processed foods are cheaper than healthy foods and they make sure they are placed at eye-level in supermarkets while real healthy choices like fruits and vegetables are pushed to the side. Poor neighbourhoods, where there are no supermarkets, are an especial target. And even reading labels to isn't always the answer since sugar, salt, and fat can come in different varieties, with different names. Unless you recognize all these names among the dozens of ingredients listed, you are not likely to realize the real amount of each within, say, that granola bar the commercials tell you is a great healthy substitute for fruit at breakfast.So what can the consumer do? As Moss points out, very little. The FDA tends to be more of an aid to the industry rather than a watchdog for the consumer and we all saw what happened when Michael Bloomberg tried to outlaw huge soda cups in New York. The backlash was heard throughout the nation - how dare he curtail our freedom to kill ourselves with sugar - and his well-intentioned law was quickly struck down. The consumer, according to Moss, has only one choice - take responsibility for what you put into your body and that of your children. Changing your eating habits won't be easy, processed food is one of the hardest addictions to break (and it is an addiction), but it can be done. Reading this book is a great place to start."
25,1400069807,http://goodreads.com/user/show/446562-amy,3,"The first thing I want to say about Salt Sugar Fat is that it felt like it was rushed to market, and that a little more time spent editing it would have made it a better book. At least my Kindle edition is riddled with grammatical errors and typos (at least one of which is pretty significant--a reference to ""congenital"" heart failure rather than ""congestive"" heart failure, which is clearly what the author meant). The narrative is frustratingly repetitive, and we are introduced to several characters and events more than once. All this is too bad, because the story of processed food that the book tells is actually pretty interesting. I figured that I would be as horrified as I have been reading other exposes of industrial food (which I was, at times) but the author, perhaps inadvertently, presents a rather multifaceted picture of the industry. A lot of this sympathy comes in the parts where he meets with food scientists and food company executives and finds them, apparently contrary to expectations, to be human beings, not rapacious fat-pushing ogres. Oddly enough, I found myself fascinated by and even a bit admiring of the complex psychological and biological science produced by food companies in their attempts to engineer the ultimate processed food, and I came to understand why cutting the fat, sugar, and salt out of those foods isn't as easy as it might seem. There is some attention paid to the role of government nutrition policy and subsidies for beef and dairy, and I still can't get over the story of the government's enormous Strategic Cheese Reserve. All in all, not a bad book, but I don't think it stoked the outrage it meant to, even in a sympathetic reader like me (I'm on a big Pollan-inspired ""real food only"" kick lately)."

I'd recommend this book to EVERYONE. It's not a diet book. Not a how to eat healthy book. It's more about the history of the processed food marketing business. Obviously most people know that much of the processed food we eat is not the healthiest choice, but for convenience and taste we use it. What is very eye opening to me is that those companies know exactly what they are doing and the role they are playing in the relatively new epidemics of obesity, heart disease and type II diabetes, but they justify it by saying they are just giving the customers what they want. Which is true, but on the next page you find out that these same companies are actively creating addictions to thier unhealthy ingredients. Read the section on how undesirable it is for a product to offer, ""sensory specific satiety"". Basically we are being manipulated to feel like we haven't eaten anything after a bag of chips, can of soda or a cookie . Come to think of it, I swear that's what happens when I eat Girl Scout cookies. The passage on high fructose corn syrup and the ""contains real fruit juice"" claims, really shocked me. It's pretty clear that the food industry thinks consumers are idiots and the more healthy a product sounds, (vitamin water for example) the worse it is. But consumers will feel good about buying it 'cause we're stupid. Btw vitamin water has as much sugar as soda. This book could and has produced many rants in my house. My kids would like to burn it. No kidding. And that's just the first section. Stay tuned..."

29,1400069807,http://goodreads.com/user/show/576203-sera,5,"Moss does a nice job describing in laymen's terms how the food companies in the US use science to learn how they can manipulate the human brain to crave or become addicted to eating many different types of processed foods. Although the food companies appear to have the upper hand when it comes such manipulation, they have also backed themselves into a corner, because they cannot make processed foods healthier without sacrificing taste, texture, convenience and shelf life. Therefore, the food companies have resorted to such tactics as making it appear that a food is healthy when it is not. For example, putting ""25% less sugar"" on a Go-Gurt package when the amount of sugar still remaining in that package is too high for a child to intake in one sitting.Here are some other interesting things that I learned:Young children who drink sugary drinks, such as Kool Aid or sodas, teach their brain to believe that when drinking a beverage, that that beverage should have a certain level of sweetness to it.Eaters are turned off by food that has too much sugar or salt, but since the brain or taste buds cannot measure the level of fat within a product, we tend to eat more without thinking about it. There is nothing to signal to the brain - enough!Baby boomers are unhealthy eaters, tending to skip meals because they are too busy, which leads them to eat more snack foods because of their convenience. It also makes them responsible for the introduction of many unhealthy food products that the food companies had developed to target to them.There's a bunch of useful information in this book that should make readers think hard about what they are putting in their bodies, but the best outcome for me is how reading this book led to a series of discussions with my daughter about what the book was about. She is like most kids where she likes to eat nuggets and fries, candy, etc. Thank goodness for the one saving grace that she has no desire to drink any soda or juice products loaded with sugar. She was never offered these products as a toddler so her brain didn't learn that all drinks should be as sweet as soda or certain juices. I told my daughter about the book as I was reading it, and after a couple of conversations, she went from being merely curious to morally outraged. I explained how the food companies learned how to trick our brains so that we would crave unhealthy foods. I also told her that the people who worked at these companies didn't eat the food that they made; nor did they serve it to their kids. Well, this really ticked her off. She didn't like the fact that the food companies would make something for children to eat that could make them sick over time, but then shield their own children from the possibility of that same fate. She officially boycotted Lunchables as a result of the pages in the book explained how that product is loaded with sugar, salt and fat. She is also making better choices, by asking questions about the content of these ingredients in foods. Don't get me wrong - she still wants her nuggets and fries, but now she is starting to understand that foods such as these should be considered a treat rather than a staple in the family diet.This book is great. Pick it up and read it. If you aren't conscious of how bad processed food is for you, this book will certainly shed much light on the subject. Plus, it gives the reader many reasons to view many of the top food companies in the US to be the bad guys here."

Not the way that the medical profession or society at large would have you believe.At least part of your spare tire — and the cause of the obesity epidemic generally — is because the processed food industry has engineered it for their own needs. That is the central theme of Salt, Sugar, Fat: How the Food Giants Hooked Us. This comprehensive look at the food industry by Michael Moss is a brilliant bit of journalism.Through the manipulation of the key ingredients of sugar (which our brain reacts to in ways that are similar to cocaine), fat (which we’re hard-wired to crave) and salt, the processed food industry has beefed up their own profits while increasing the gross tonnage of the population at large.Of course, it’s the profit motive that drives the industry, not some evil desire to turn us all into Fat Albert. Moss’s examination of the industry is at times extremely positive. It’s clear that he admires the creativity, ingenuity and business acumen of many of the central players in this drama that is promising to shorten the life spans of our children. His reportage is scrupulous, fair, and peppered with insight. I’m not surprise he’s already won a Pulitzer. He should get one for this book too.At times the book seems repetitive, but that is a minor flaw, given how comprehensive and wide-ranging his reportage into this secretive industry is, and how generally readable the narrative is.The other major theme that I pulled out of the book is that while the food giants have hooked us on sugar, salt and fat, they have also hooked themselves on the profits those key ingredients generate. They are going to fight tooth and Tootsie-roll too keep our foods laden with them, and work against any efforts to make their foods more healthy. And now that the North American markets are saturated (pun intended), they’re looking to other countries. I found one of the anecdotes about an ex-Coke executive walking around a bario in Brazil kind of heart-breaking and enraging at the same time.“The people here need a lot of things, but a Coke isn’t one of them.”Yet the company has created smaller serving bottles for poor neighborhoods in countries like Brazil, so that everyone can afford the 20-cents they need to get a taste of “the real thing.”While the book is informative, it is not a self-help book. There are no prescriptions for how to use this information to save your own waistline, except for the obvious one:If your food was made by a food processing company, you probably shouldn’t be eating it!Via The Skwib"
31,1400069807,http://goodreads.com/user/show/13779-k,4,"I recently saw a quote which apparently appeared on a sign in a movie: ""Fast, good, cheap: pick two."" If we're talking about food, I might paraphrase and say, ""Tasty, convenient, cheap, healthy: Pick two (three max)."" Sadly, there doesn't seem to be a way to get all four. Especially as our tastes and preferences are apparently being corrupted by food manufacturers who want us to crave their foods, obesity be damned.With doom forecasting books like ""Salt, Sugar, Fat"" you always have to worry about sensationalism and shock value. I will say, though, that the author presented pretty convincing evidence for most of his arguments. My listening to this on audio with some distractions may have limited my ability to analyze his data critically, but for what it's worth I found it pretty persuasive. I also found the book entertaining and highly readable (listenable), which is not always the case for non-fiction books with educational value. I've always been a snob about processed foods, so I felt validated as I listened to this. On the other hand, even a snob like myself can't avoid processed foods completely -- far from it. And although I might feel sanctimonious as I sit at the cutting board with a pile of fresh fruits and/or vegetables, I must admit that my recipes too contain salt, sugar, and fat.Ambivalent kudos to this book for making me feel too guilty to reach for a processed snack as I rushed between work and other errands.

33,1400069807,http://goodreads.com/user/show/395599-shannon-giraffe-days,5,"Health experts, school teachers, politicians, parents and anyone with half an eye has known that there has been an obesity epidemic going on since the 1980s. And like with cancer and the tobacco industry, the links between obesity and processed food is well known - not just by concerned health officials or scientists, but by the food industry itself. In fact, as Michael Moss explains in Salt Sugar Fat: How the Food Giants Hooked Us, they have long been researching and studying these three key ingredients and how they make us eat more. And getting consumers to eat more means they're buying more, which means more profit for the food giants.Moss sets the scene well in his prologue: for the first (and only) time ever, on the 8th of April 1999, representatives, company presidents and CEOs from all the major food giants in America gathered together at a secret meeting at the headquarters of Pillsbury in Minneapolis. They came to listen to the vice-president of Kraft, Michael Mudd, a ""seasoned fixer"" who was ""attuned to public sentiment"" and an advisor with the boss's ear. He made a good case for linking obesity to the food people ate, the food that the people in the room made a lot of money from making, and he put it to these CEOs that they all, collectively and in agreement, take action now to contribute towards solving the problem rather than denying their responsibility and going on as before, while America's waistlines - and health costs - kept enlarging. He stressed that the food industry alone couldn't solve the problem, or that it could be solved quickly. What he wanted the CEOs to commit to was to ""make a sincere effor to be part of the solution. And that by doing so, we can help to defuse the criticism that's building against us. We don't have to singlehandedly solve the obesity problem in order to address the criticism. But we have to make a sincere effort to be part of the solution if we expect to avoid being demonized."" [p.xx]But the CEOs of the food giants - including Kelloggs, Mars, Coca Cola, Nestlé, General Mills, Nabisco, Procter & Gamble as well as the two big companies that sold the salt, sugar and fat to the processed food industry, Cargill and Tate & Lyle - disagreed. ""Consumers are fickle,"" said the CEO of General Mills, Stephen Sanger, ""whose $2 billion lineup of sugary cereals, from Count Chocula to Lucky Charms, was now drawing more fire from consumer advocates than soda."" [p.xx] Sanger went on to declare, ""Don't talk to me about nutrition. [...] Talk to me about taste, and if this stuff tastes better, don't run around trying to sell stuff that doesn't taste good."" There was no way one food giant could make any kind of nutritional changes if the others weren't going to follow suit (which Kraft learned when they tried), so the meeting failed.So why is it so hard for these companies to reduce their reliance on salt, sugar and fat? You'd think it'd be easy, that cutting back on sodium or saturated fat or sugar in its many forms wouldn't make that much of a difference. And you're probably thinking of all those products in the supermarket that boast ""35% less salt!"" and so on, as proof that it's not that difficult. But as Moss shows throughout this book, full of detailed research into both the science of food, the history of these companies, and the research being done as well as the economics and marketing strategies used to hook consumers and make them crave beyond the needs of their bodies, the food giants are just as hooked on salt, sugar and fat as we the consumers are. Take the sugar and salt out of Kellogg's cornflakes, as the food scientists did for Michael Moss, and they taste like metal from the food processing plant, with the texture of cardboard. And try and take any of the saturated fat out of cheese - which is what cheese is, really - and it tastes disgusting. No one wants to buy it or eat it, and if the food companies can't make any money off it - or they lose money - then they'll pull it.In tracing the path of processed food - this being any pre-made or pre-prepared food stuff sold in supermarkets and elsewhere, from junk food to processed cheese, salad dressings to canned soup, frozen meals and pasta sauces to soda and synthetic juice - Moss brings these companies to life, digging deep within their very secretive walls by finding people who worked there - some retired, some who have moved on, some who are still there - who are quite happy to talk about it openly. He skilfully combines a very fascinatig science lesson on what salt, sugar and fat does to our brains - why we crave it so - with a thorough understanding of how these food giants operate, the economics of it and the marketing strategies. As he says in the epilogue, his real aim is in giving us, the consumer, the tools we need to make informed decisions on what we buy and eat:The most crucial point to know is that there is nothing accidental in the grocery store. It is, perhaps, not unreasonable in this scenario to think of the grocery store as a battlefield, dotted with landmines itching to go off. And if you accept this, then it becomes all the more apparent why the food industry is so reliant on salt, sugar and fat. They are cheap. They are interchangeable. They are huge, powerful forces of nature in unnatural food. And yet, for us, knowing all this can be empowering. You can walk through the grocery store and, whil the brightly colored packaging and empty promises are still mesmerizing, you can see the products for what they are. You can also see everything that goes on behind the image they project on the shelf: the formulas, the psychology, and the marketing that compels us to toss them into the cart. They may have salt, sugar and fat on their side, but we, ultimately, have the power to make choices. After all, we decide what to buy. We decide how much to eat. [p.347]After all the evidence Moss presents that show that the food giants know exactly what to put into their food to make us addicted to sugar, salt and fat - to their food, in other words - it is indeed empowering to have that reminder from Moss, that we can beat the cravings. That we aren't at their mercy. It's not just a matter of will power, but a matter of self-education. This is more important than you'd think, because these days it's not the food technicians who invent the food that we see on the shelves, it's the marketing departments. And as much as the food companies tell themselves that it's all about listening to the public, the consumer, and supplying what they - we - want, it's abundantly clear that it doesn't work that way in reality. Yes new products have bombed because they didn't do the marketing first to see if they would be well-received, but these companies have also learned that combining aggressive marketing strategies with lots of salt, sugar and fat will turn any cheaply-made processed food into the newest must-have.Even though this book is focused solely on America, America's obesity epidemic and American food companies and products, so many countries around the world are struggling with the same health crisis, and these are global companies. Who hasn't heard of Coca-Cola or Mars or Cadburys? Many of the products Moss discusses - Count Chocula and Cap'n Crunch and Lunchables and Tang - were largely unknown to me (though I happened to notice that in the last few months, I've read several - let's say five - American books where a main character mentioned their love for Cap'n Crunch), but many aren't and it certainly makes you think about the products in your own country. One area that it doesn't really help you on is public policy and government regulation. As Moss explains, America doesn't have a great deal of regulation, and in fact the Department of Agriculture - which deals with meat and dairy, the two things highest in saturated fat - tends to work more on promoting these as healthy, nutritious foodstuffs that we should eat more of, not less. It bothers me that I don't really know what my own two countries, Australia and Canada, are like when it comes to regulating the amount of salt, sugar and fat companies can add to their food, or what work they've done in the area of promoting nutrition education and better eating. I know that in Australia we've long promoted lean meat - our animals are all farmed outdoors, except for battery hens and pigs - and low sodium, but I'm skeptical at how much regulation we actually have.In the section on sugar, we learn that we are born liking sugar. That it instantly lights up our brain like it's high, that kids prefer things sweeter than adults do (and there are even differences along ethnic lines), and that researchers and scientists have spent a lot of time and effort in trying to locate the ""bliss point"", beyond which too much sugar turns us off food. I think my own bliss point must be a lot lower than the average Americans', based on the food we eat - I find the junk food here in Canada, which is largely American, sickly sweet and very artificial tasting and textured. Funnily enough, there's a lot more variety of junk food in Australia than there is here, and I do think it tastes different. This is certainly true of Cadburys, no matter how much they deny it: the Cadburys chocolate is different in Canada to how it is in Australia, and everyone says it's different again in the UK (Australia has the best Cadburys, but it's pretty rubbish here in Canada). They use slightly different ingredients, different ratios, and different kinds of fillings. Mr Big is absolutely not the same as Picnic, even though they look like they should be and have the same description (I tried a Mr Big once, it was nasty.)This anecdotal evidence of mine seems to be supported by this book. As Moss talks to one of the scientists working on the bliss point, Julie Mennella, she explains how she ""has become convinced that our bliss point for sugar - and all foods, for that matter - is shaped by our earliest experiences.""But as babies grow into youngsters, the opportunity for food companies to influence our taste grows as well. For Mannella, this is troubling. It's not that food companies are teaching children to like sweetness; rather, they are teaching children what foods should taste like. And increasingly, this curriculum has been all about sugar. [p.15]You can see that quite clearly, in children, how they grow to expect a certain level of sweetness - one that's very high and unhealthy - and don't like food that doesn't meet that expectation. Something else we can control, as parents. Sugar is also used as an additive to prolong shelf life and makes water inaccessible to bacteria. Fat is different. As the scientists Moss talks to explain, fat is like a conductor. It coats the tongue and makes everything taste better, like salt does only differently. It provides what they call the ""mouthfeel"". Think of chocolate and how amazing it feels in the mouth.Fat also performs a range of culinary tricks for food manufacturers, thanks to another of its extraordinary powers. It can mask and convey other flavors in foods, all at the same time. This can be seen in a dollop of sour cream, which has acidic components that, by themselves, don't taste so great. Fat coats the tongue to keep the taste buds from getting too large a hit of these acids. Then, this same oily coating reverses direction, and instead of acting as a shield, it stimulates and prolongs the tongue's absorption of the sour cream's more subtle and aromatic flavors, which, of course, is what the food makers want the taste buds to convey to the brain. This act of delivering other flavors is one of fat's most valued functions. [p.147]I'm glad I don't eat hamburgers (I've never liked them, even the homemade ones my mum makes), because Moss's explanation of what goes into them would quickly have turned me off. In fact, learning about what processed food is like before all the additives are included is off-putting - as it should be. We're not talking about natural food here. This is food that is designed to sit in a warehouse, then a truck or a ship, then a supermarket's shelves, then in your own pantry, for months on end, sometimes more than a year. And as anyone who's ever bought a fresh vegetable knows, food just isn't supposed to last that long.The price for convenience is turning into a high one. As Moss turns his astute investigative eye onto salt, which the food manufacturers are possibly even more addicted to than sugar and fat, the stakes get even higher. Now it's not just obesity but heart disease (though of course obesity can lead to numerous heart problems too) - you don't have to be obese or overweight to think about cutting back on processed food. According to the American guidelines, which apparently are fairly lax and under consistent pressure from the food industry, the average, basically healthy adult can have as much as 2,300 milligrams of sodium, while those with diabetes and other health problems should only have a much as 1500 milligrams of sodium. When you look at one of those big bottles of vegetable juice, a single serving (a cup) has 480 milligrams of sodium - the company was very proud to have lowered this from about 640 milligrams - you start to see how quickly you can exceed these limits, and from food or drink that you wouldn't expect to be high in sodium. Or take this example, about Nestle's Hot Pocket, a microwavable snack that the company acquired in 2002 for $2.6 billion ""and now counts as a prestigious member of its Billionaire Brands Treasury.""In its promotional literature, Nestlé describes the Hot Pocket as a ""fully enrobed sandwich that allows you to eat on the go with no mess!"" But it's food on the go that comes with a price. The Pepperoni & Three Cheese Calzone version of the Hot Pocket that I picked up at my local grocery store, for instance, contained well over one hundred ingredients, including salt, sugar and fat in several configurations along with six permutations of cheese, from ""imitation mozzerella"" to ""imitation cheddar."" A single, eight-ounce calzone delivered 10 grams of saturated fat and nearly six teaspoons of sugar, 600 calories, and, for the retailer's convenience, enough preservatives for a shelf life of 420 days. [p.335]I don't watch TV commercials (I mute and turn to my book, if I watch TV at all), but I have seen these kinds of Hot Pocket things advertised specifically to young men, especially high school students. With all that crap in them, there's no way they're getting the nutrients their growing bodies need, and instead they're getting a lot of crap they definitely don't need. The same can be said for pretty much everything these companies sell. One of the things Moss does in this book is separate the marketing and advertising tricks and strategies from the truth of what's really in this stuff. And with whole chapters with an astute eye on companies like Coca-Cola, they're stripped right down to their superficial packaging. Now it's true that the basic message of this book is ""preaching to the converted"" with me: I don't eat much processed food at all. I detest Kraft cheese and don't even consider it to be real cheese (not sure anyone does but they certainly advertise it that way). I don't eat breakfast cereal except for the plain, healthy flakes made from things like flax that you find tucked away on the very bottom shelf (and I don't add milk because I don't like it soggy!) - after reading this book I actually looked at the cereal aisle for the first time, and felt ill at all the dessert-like choices available. But I've never liked cereal like that, and the one time I tried Froot Loops as a kid I thought they were disgusting and artificial-tasting. I don't buy ready-made pasta sauces (it's easy to make your own) or salad dressing (I eat my salads plain) or soda - in fact I really really hate all fizzy drinks with the exception of lemonade (like Schwepps or the local Australian brands), but I haven't drunk it in years and should avoid it, not just for the sugar but because carbonation leaches the calcium from your bones, which is a particular concern for women, as we're prone to osteoperosis. That makes me sound like a super-boring person I'm sure, but the truth is I prefer to make my own food from scratch. And I certainly do have a sweet tooth, it's just easily satisfied (though not for long - I do have a sugar addiction which I've been working had on conquering, and I certainly do crave unhealthy food - chocolate being my biggie). I love cheese, just good quality (read: expensive) cheese. But I have this weird thing where I love eating chips - especially Barbecue, or Sea Salt and Pepper, or PC's General Tao's Chicken, or Twisties - but a lot of the time they also make me feel ill. No doubt from over-indulging: I felt like I needed some salt, then the other ingredients make me keep eating long after my body's had enough. And I do still buy things that have been made or prepared by food manufacturers - some of them, like puff pastry sheets, being things I can't reasonably make myself, and others, like canned tomato, because it's just not the same if you use fresh dice tomatoes (the amount of liquid perhaps? no skins?) - and I still, even after reading this book, feel ill-equipped to navigate a supermarket. Michael Moss gave me the insider look into how the processed food industry works, but I still look at the nutritional information on the label without really knowing how to interpret it.In Canada and Australia, they go by grams and also the daily percentage, or value - like, this product contains 6% of your daily intake of salt in one serving. Two big problems with using percentages: everyone has a different daily intake amount based on age, health, weight, gender, and whether you're trying to lose weight; and no one ever actually adds them up. Oh, and the other reason would be that no one ever eats just a single serving: you eat the entire pack. When they done studies on a wide range of people who think they eat healthfully, they've found that they're way way way over the daily limits, and didn't even know it. Australia also measures the kilojoules (energy, or calories) of the different parts of a food. I rather wish that our governments - or someone - would put out a handy booklet that showed how many calories (units of energy) you should eat based on your age, ethnicity, gender and Body Mass Index, how much salt, sugar and fat you can get away with eating, and how to read that country's nutritional label. Because it varies a lot, making the nutritional labels almost meaningless to most of us. (The Australian government does provide information on reading food labels, but it seems to be written with a completely ignorant person in mind, explaining what the ingredient list is and what food additives are - not how to actually read and understand the information on a given food product!)I learnt a lot from this book. The marketing strategies are always fascinating to read about (one of my favourite programs on CBC Radio 1 is ""Under the Influence"", a 30-minute feature all about marketing, it's absolutely fascinating and hugely entertaining - you can listen to the podcasts or download the whole lot from iTunes), and the personal stories from people who have worked in these food companies is equally interesting, as is the research and scientific studies being done. But it's the new-to-me information on our relationship with salt, sugar and fat that really lit up my brain.

34,1400069807,http://goodreads.com/user/show/14011226-rob-slaven,4,"To begin with my by-now rote preamble, I received this book from a GoodReads drawing. Despite that kind and generous and typical consideration I give my candid opinions below.The premise of this book can be summed up very simply. Food companies are creating products that while not intended to kills us, nevertheless are doing so. By using science and marketing (in some cases derived from research done by that purest of evils, cigarette companies) big foods can manipulate us into eating more and more of their products until we drop dead. While we think the government is trying to protect us from such evils, in fact most of the time the feds are helping and subsidizing the efforts of food companies to shove more and unhealthier food down our throats to line their pockets. I’d say that about covers it.Michael Moss’s definitive tome on food marketing is exhaustive, at times daunting and the best book on this topic I’ve read since “Fast Food Nation” so many years ago. Moss has covered the basics with a wealth of detail and reasoning that should be abundantly terrifying to those who find themselves putting frozen pizzas and Hot Pockets into their cart at the grocery store. He paints a picture that is stark and, sadly, a bit hopeless. While our author does spend a tiny bit of time on the efforts of food companies to stop killing us softly with salt, sugar and fat, he doesn’t really seem to hold out much hope. He closes with a chunk on liquid foods designed for people after they have bariatric surgery. The image of people tube-feeding themselves from a plastic container is pretty haunting but that seems to be what we’re coming to.This book is wonderfully researched, eruditely and well written and I hope against hope that it’s somehow unbalanced. Moss’s picture is grim indeed but his arguments are so well constructed that one doesn’t really have the heart to argue with them. As a book it can sometimes be a bit daunting and is best taken, I think, in 1-hour chunks. On one level this lets the argument settle in over the course of several days and make you subconsciously examine what YOU’RE eating. The book is very helpful and specific in the foods and products it chooses to excoriate. A conscientious reader will find themselves at least slightly changed for the better. On another level, taking the book in small pieces dampens a bit the somewhat repetitive cadence of the whole thing. Here’s a type of food. Here’s why it’s bad. Here’s the history of it. Here’s who I talked to about it and what they had to say. Lather, rinse, repeat. Taken in long sittings this is probably much less effective. I stretched this one out over a week and felt myself well served and well-educated.In summary, this is the sort of book that leaves you changed at a fundamental level. Like books before it, you never quite see the world the same way again. On the whole, I feel pretty good about my diet even before, relative to how Moss describes the typical American diet but there’s always room for improvement and this book is one that gives a not so gentle nudge in the right direction. It’s also the sort of book you want to pass around to everyone you know; it should be subtitled, “Read this before the next time you open your mouth.” "
35,1400069807,http://goodreads.com/user/show/19088953-satya-ananthu,4,"This book is a looooooooooooong one. I would have abandoned this book had I read it, I managed to finish this because I listened to it during commute.The first encounter I had with the inside stories of American processed food was watching Food Inc. documentary. I got to see horrific stories about meat plants, tactics and control that food giants exercise over farmers etc. This book is a more detailed text and tries to expose the food giants naked of their hypocrisy and indifference to welfare of their customers. Simply put, as the author describes, as companies they are doing what they are supposed to do - make money.First of all, I feel blessed to be born in a culture that ridicules processed/packaged food and craves for home-made food from fresh ingredients. And I am lucky to have two great cooks at my home - my mom and my wife - after all, bread baked with love is the greatest and tastiest one. And I love the spicy food they prepare with fresh ingredients and that keeps my family mostly away from processed food.When I moved to the US two years back and had to shop groceries myself, I was taken aback by the amount of processed, ready-to-eat food in grocery stores that's full of sugar and cheese. And I never knew salt was being used in such high quantities in processed food. This book only makes me feel worse about the food and distances me a little more from the beautifully packaged ""disgusting"" food. Now, I completely understand why I started craving those oat cookies and why my kid craves Oreo cookies.After reading this book, I stopped buying Oreo cookies, and reduced the supposedly good for you 'Oatmeal cookies'. I will try to stay away from processed food as much as possible. Thanks Michael Moss for this long, enriching investigative text.The British apparently said to America (in Too big to fail movie), ""we don't want to import your cancer"", about the sub-prime bonds. Processed food is also like cancer, read obesity. Don't pay for it and import it unnecessarily to your home.Watch out India (and developing world), don't fall for this sugar-coated food. Stay away from this, our food is the best!"
36,1400069807,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3026195-esther,4,"The top players in the processed food industry -- Coca-Cola, Frito-Lay to name a few -- don't even eat or drink their products anymore. So why do we? Because these companies have gotten us dependent on their (disgusting) amounts of salt, sugar and fat and clever marketing tactics for decades. This book is not what I expected, in a good way. It's incredibly well researched but not bogged down with facts that it gets boring. I've cut out a lot of the processed food that I used to carelessly eat and/or binged on (NOT easy) and this book is just a validation that I need to continue to evolve my eating habits. "
37,1400069807,http://goodreads.com/user/show/38240230-dawn,3,"3.5 stars. A well-researched and in-depth look at the food industry. The book is a self-proclaimed 'wake-up call' to consumers on how the food industry makes, packages, and markets their products to increase sales, at a huge cost to nutrition and health. The 'bliss point' is something food manufacturers aim for when finding the right amounts of sugar, fat and salt in our foods. I never would have actually read this book, as the details were fascinating but it contains so much information it reads like a text book. Listening to the audiobook, read by Scott Brick, was a better way for me to digest the info while I drove to and from work. Pun intended. "
38,1400069807,http://goodreads.com/user/show/216258-sean,4,"Stop eating, it's going to kill you."
39,1400069807,http://goodreads.com/user/show/27250071-vimal-thiagarajan,5,"There are all kinds of people-people who are conscious of and scrupulous about the nutritional content of the food they eat, people who have always been wishing that they choose healthier foods but do not actually get to it, hedonic people who see tasty food as the ultimate human pleasure,people who think life is too precious and too short to worry about the food they eat, people who think-too many foods too little time, people who willingly put ambition over health, and on and on and on. And then there are businessmen, men who really know each and every kind of these people, and leverage that psychological knowledge to dish out 'what people really want' and make some serious bucks out of it. Ironically none of these businessmen ever choose to eat any of these foods that they themselves make,promote and sell.This book is about these people,these businessmen,these foods and the complex and dynamic interplay between them.And the author is someone who'd make one wonder what's wrong with the Pulitzer committee-why did they give him just one?.Michael Moss drills into confidential documents of the processed food industry(hundreds of them-coke,Kraft,pizza hut,Nestle,Cadbury,Oreos,Lays,Kellogg's,Pillsbury and many more),interviews hundreds of industry insiders ranging from food technicians to marketing executives to package designers to CEOs,their family members,behavioral psychologists,biologists,nutrition scientists,bench chemists,government officials and regulators,lobbyists and countless others to string together a page-turning narrative of unbelievable depth and intensity which lays thread bare of what has really been going on in the processed food industry(US companies and their global franchises spread across UK,India,Brazil,Mexico and all over the world)over the course of several decades. The techniques used in quality investigative reporting have always fascinated me, but the fascination reached reverential proportions in the one month that it took me to read and absorb every detail contained in this veritable work. I really doubt if any other book would come close to matching the vividness of the dog-eat-dog picture that has been presented in this book, where food companies use salt sugar and fat to create countless concepts like mouth feel, bliss point and sensory specific satiety and use numerous psychological tools in marketing slogans and shopper density maps, ultimately aimed at getting the greatest stomach-share of the consumer and if possible make him/her a 'heavy user' of their products. The health of the consumer isn’t even in the equation or even if it is factored in, the dynamics of the industry make it impossible to do anything at all to promote that cause.At the end if the day, to be really mindful of what a person eats is purely a matter of personal choice. And all this staggeringly deep-researched yet humble sounding book does is to present every data that ever is, for people to make an informed choice."
40,1400069807,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5899462-andrew-schirmer,4,"Salt, sugar, and fat. Essential sources of nutrients (the first) and energy (the last two), that when combined in cunning ways flood the brain with pleasure. Most foods contain these components to some degree or another. But what happens when large corporate interests decide to treat these compounds like they did nicotine? It shouldn't really be surprising that the companies responsible for that devilishly clever nicotine delivery system known as the cigarette would also be responsible for everything from the Ritz cracker to a chocolate-cream cheese spread called ""Philadelphia Indulgence."" Two tablespoons of this chocolate cheese contains a quarter of a day's maximum for saturated fat and half a day's maximum for sugar. Is is possible to drift further leftward as one gets older? The cliché holds that the transformation occurs the other way around, and I'd be interested to hear from others who've noticed their political convictions adjust themselves likewise. I majored in economics at university--most of us were convinced of the superiority of the American model of (relatively) unfettered capitalism over state-planned economies. The models and the math were sound! Science proved it! Now, to the book at hand. It is another salvo in what should be a snowballing pushback at any notion that the American economic system is superior to anything. First and foremost, it is a planned economy in many ways, full of the sorts of market distortions that make the Soviet Union seem positively laissez-faire. This is not even taking into account the enormous influence the large food companies have on public policy regarding nutrition and health. To take (simplifying, of course) one example from this incredible work of muckraking: U.S. dairy farmers have been heavily subsidized since the 1930s, when milk was deemed strategically important for the health of the nation. Thanks to increased awareness of the role of saturated fats in cardiovascular diseases, milk consumption declined. Much of this excess milk was turned into cheese, which then had to be put to use by the food companies, who dreamed up a myriad of ways to get Americans to eat more cheese. That is how you get from a simple Italian specialty to a Domino's pizza which has cheese actually infused into the crust. One of the fascinating things about this book is the running observations on the class divide between those who run the food companies and their targeted consumers. Most of the C-level characters, wealthy men (a few are women) are well aware of the detrimental effects their products have on health. But they exercise and eat healthfully and avoid processed foods. "
41,1400069807,http://goodreads.com/user/show/35205135-alopexin,3,"Okay, I'm pretty divided about this book. I liked it overall, but I'm disappointed in some aspects that took away some enjoyment.- First of all, it's misleading. Maybe it's my own fault for not reading the blurbs, but this book seemed like it's a science book and turned out not to be that, not exactly. Sure, it reports on science facts, but that's all it is: this is journalism, and this book is a long article of report. There's a clear tendency of journalism: the author preferred to name CEOs of food companies, quoting them extensively and reporting on their experience with their respective corporations. The interaction the author had with scientist, however, is minimal, and researches and studies are cited in the most general terms (maybe, with foot notes that nobody would look at). There are long paragraphs like ""I met such and such in a crisp autumn morning and he was wearing a blue suit"" that have nothing to do with the facts that I'm hoping to get.- This book is as much about the power of marketing than that of salt, sugar and fat. This, while I still think is misleading, is not necessarily a bad selling point. In fact, by analyzing the marketing strategies, the author delivered just what he promised on the book: telling us exactly how food corporations 'hook' customers and sell their products.- The focus is very heavy on sugar. Half of the book is on this, and the other two pillars share the rest of the book.- Now this is my main beef with this book: Huge structural problem. In an attempt to make the book entertaining and easy to read (which it is), the author employs something like story telling technique while it is not at all compatible to a factual book. There are many instances where the author would bring up a thing (for example, one marketing campaign by Kraft) only to loop right back to the beginning, explaining the start of Kraft, unrolling things out until the marketing campaign comes up again. This is super annoying, as you have to scramble to keep up with what's going on. And he doesn't do this just once either, which is more and more annoying as the book goes on. I'm not looking for prose or a dramatic plot twist in my non-fiction. I want facts, and in the most logical way possible.That said, the book delivered on its promises. It sure convinces me to start to read my processed food labels from now on."
42,1400069807,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2651785-heather-in-fl,5,"Ugh... What *can* I eat? :-) It's funny... I listened to this, and I had only really seen the title of the book, not the tag line. When the narrator first said it, I thought he said ""How the Food Giants F*cked Us"". And honestly, that's not too far off. I get it... it's hard, if not impossible, to make tasty food that will sit on the grocery shelf without spoiling without using sugar, fat, and/or salt. And apparently high levels of them. But there's something really wrong when study after study has proven how harmful these substances are in the quantities used in processed foods, they've correlated the rise in heart disease, obesity, diabetes, cancer, and any number of other health issues to the rise in processed foods, and yet the food companies seem only interested in making a profit and being number one in their respective grocery aisles. It seems there's no corporate responsibility. It's pretty telling when the heads of those food companies and the scientists creating the foods avoid the types of food they sell or make. I also found it interesting that the tobacco companies who purchased food processors along the way were able to draw a correlation between what tobacco did to the body and the resulting public backlash and how food processors were going to have to deal with obesity or possibly face the same consequences. Things that make you go hmmmm... (Oh, and apparently the food companies are still in denial.)It was also really interesting (and very sad) to see how food processors have manipulated the US (and world) diet to their advantage. They've also manipulated the governmental agencies that I thought were supposed to work for the good of the people, not the good of the farmers or the good of the food processors. There was tons of information in this book. The overriding message I got out of it is that I need to make my own food as much as possible. It's the only way to truly control what goes in my body and those of my family. Of course, in today's busy culture, it's hard to not rely on processed foods to some extent. But it's making me look hard at what I eat, the ingredients on the products I buy... definitely an eye-opening book."
43,1400069807,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7795855-jamie,5,"I won’t lie. It took me awhile to get through this book. Not because I was not interested but because there was a ton of information, all of it documented to the hilt. And if I am nothing, I am an uber-nerd for good research. While this book as a whole is a great-big downer, as far as the food industry and their manipulation of the consumer, I took away from it more than that. I mean, we all know processed food is bad for us, right? That was not a surprise. What has stuck with me though, and the author alludes to it at the very end of the book, is that so many of our food choices (not all but many) come from a socioeconomic point of view. Wouldn’t it be great if we could all afford and have access to organic, range-free and totally chemical free foods? Of course it would. Is that possible? No it is not. When a low-income child can walk into a “convenience” store and purchase a “meal” for close to $1 because there are no alternatives in his/her neighborhood, then there is a huge problem. This is an example the author actually used toward the end of the book. I don’t always stay away from processed foods or those with high levels of Salt, Sugar or Fat, but I at least have access to fresh and high quality foods and I am educated enough to know how to discern whether something is good, bad or worse. I feel bad for people that might not have the knowledge or ability to make good choices. I feel like people should walk away from this book feeling empowered. I learned a lot of the tricks the food industry uses. They won’t fool me again!! (Unless of course I just really “need” that coke and snickers bar). "
44,1400069807,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7349048-melissa-klug,5,"For the past year, I've spent a vast amount of time cleaning up my health--eating and fitness. I've read multiple books on food in particular, and I would recommend this as the most universally applicable to anyone (vs other food books I have read in the past year.) I want to give it to everyone I know, particularly people like me who struggle with eating and weight. It is a comprehensive examination of the role of salt, sugar and fat in the US food supply, written accessibly--the perfect amount of science blended with great stories (like a secret meeting with a cabal of food industry executives in Minneapolis.) It outlines volumes of information about how processed food is made and marketed, some of which is distressing and some which is horrifying. I think it is critical for people to understand how grocery food in America works, and what we are consuming, and this does so in very engaging fashion. Highly recommended. "
45,1400069807,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3163253-jenny-martin,5,"INCREDIBLE. Few non-fiction books have ever have every impacted this much. Moss pulls back the curtain on the food giants, allowing the consumer to see how our food is engineered, formulated, and marketed to keep us coming back for more, no matter the cost to our health. Cereals and sodas that are strategically (deceptively, even?) loaded with the exact amount of sugar to induce an addicting, short lived sense of bliss? Soups and sauces with cheap (and unhealthy) extra salt and chemically altered fat to conceal the reduction of quality, nutritious ingredients? Cookies that were designed in a lab, to trigger optimal 'mouthfeel'? NO THANK YOU. My grocery cart will never be the same. No more FRANKENFOOD. Read SALT SUGAR FAT. It may just change the way you feed your family. You might actually start noshing on life-sustaining, nutritious, satisfying food! "
46,1400069807,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4045624-ivy,4,"“Some of the largest companies are now using brain scans to study how we react neurologically to certain foods, especially to sugar. They've discovered that the brain lights up for sugar the same way it does for cocaine.” This book is at once fascinating and horrifying. From a writing point of view, it is extremely well done. Its hard to pull off an interesting narrative in non-fiction, but Moss succeeds. I like the layout of the book, which first gave an overview of the history of convenience foods starting in the 20th century and the advertising used to promote it, followed by research into how these foods are formulated to trick your brain into eating more than you realize. He goes into how processed foods are still promoted today despite the fact they are really more like foodstuffs, and the government's inability to do anything about it. There are great quotes throughout. Here's one on my favorite junk food cheetos. ""This is one of the most marvelously constructed foods on the planet in terms of pure pleasure."" YES!!! It's true! No wonder I can sit and eat half the bag.Anyone who reads this that doesn't know how to cook from scratch will be compelled to start learning.I picked it up because after a few years of eating healthy, my family has gone off the deep end. A few years back I binged on a lot of the food documentaries that used to be on Netflix...Food, Inc.; Forks Over Knives, Food Matters, etc. (pun intended) So while a lot of this information wasn't entirely new, it delved into the topic in more depth than a 90 minute production can, and includes the relevant sources to back up the author's claims as credible. A quick peak into my pantry proved his point...fruit snacks, Froot Loops and Cocoa Krispies, loads and loads of bags of GF pasta that has even more carbs than regular pasta, granola bars that have more sugar than Oreo cookies. OMG I am rather disgusted with myself right now. Furthermore, after reading this book, I'm pretty sure my youngest kid is one of those people that can't help but shove sugar in her face. (She recently ate an entire bag of giant marshmallows she had sneaked up into her bedroom. If you're wondering, yes, the stomach ache that followed was epic).Long review made short: Read this and then go out and buy a few cookbooks."

The hype for this book says ""you'll never look at a food nutrition label the same way again."" Uh huh. I had doubts. Then two things happened. First, a family member had a major medical issue that necessitates making dietary changes. Not ""going on a diet,"" but making permanent choice changes. Second, I went on the road for a week in what was definitely not a pleasure trip nor one where I had access to even the most basic kitchen. And while I was not under any illusion that I was going to eat healthful food on the road, I was determined not to succumb to eating utter junk just because it was cheap and convenient. Let me tell you that it is a major challenge to eat real food on the road. I'm very familiar with the ploys of both retail and food service, have no problems making (insisting on) special requests from restaurants, and am not allergic to anything or have medical/religious food restrictions. Compared to a diabetic, a hypertensive, or even a vegetarian, I had it easy. If I were a vegan on that (or any other road trip), I might as well have fasted. While this book is in no way a ""diet"" or ""how to"" book, it certainly was an education in why it's damn near impossible to stay within reasonable dietary guidelines for salt, sugar, and fat unless one is preparing every single bite from raw ingredients. Well, the hype was right because we've become fascinated with food labels now. Or maybe more like ""horrified by"" than ""fascinated with."" I also became far more aware of how ""convenience"" food (or ""corporate cooked"") is marketed. The book also answered some questions I've pondered over the years. When and why did all-you-can-drink soda fountains suddenly explode into every restaurant and c-store in the world? Why don't packages make serving size information more prominent and logical? Why do banana cream Oreos even exist? Why did HFCS suddenly appear everywhere, even in foods that aren't supposed to be sweet (like beans and mayonnaise)? And why the hell can't I seem to order anything that isn't covered in cheese? Any why is it that once I snack on something sweet, I suddenly want more and more and more of something sweet? How did our school cafeterias -- which in my day (back in the Dark Ages) had pretty good food -- become either patterned after a mall food court or unable to offer anything that isn't bland, breaded, or looks like it's made of cardboard? Why does a serving of some flavors of yogurt have more sugar in them than premium ice cream? Pulitzer Prize-winning investigative reporter Michael Moss has certainly done his homework on how some of the world's best known brands made their name and made themselves a fortune by selling consumers on convenience while changing our taste preferences. Moss isn't claiming that food manufacturers are in a conspiracy to make us all fat. America (and now the world) getting fat is just the unfortunate result of corporations trying to make as much money as possible by making irresistible products. Note: I did not say those products are necessarily good, only that they are irresistible. There's a difference, and Moss helps show that difference by talking to scientists who study how the body and brain crave and process salt, sugar, and fat. He then talks to some of the R&D food scientists for major food corporations to show how this unholy trinity works together in processed foods. And, if that weren't terrifying and fascinating enough, he discusses how marketing influences buyers and how the federal government agencies who are supposed to be charged with protecting public health are also charged with protecting industry. He combines food trends to economic issues, politics and much more to outline how we've all been suckered into thinking ""low fat"" means ""healthy"" and that there's nothing wrong with downing a Double Big Gulp. You will learn about ""bliss points"" and ""sensory satiety"" in this book and why they are the gospel for food companies. And then? You will never think about Doritos or Pure Leaf Tea the same way again. For food history, food science, corporate shenanigans, marketing malfeasance, and plain old ""how the hell did we let this happen,"" Moss' book is a must-read. Fascinating. Irritating. Mind-blowing. Do not skip the epilogue or the source notes. Moss uses footnotes, end notes, and source notes the way a good chef uses spices, and you miss a lot of good stuff if you blow past them. "
48,1400069807,http://goodreads.com/user/show/62510039-hr-ml,5,"Journalist Michael Moss interviewed experts in the processed food industry: CEOs, brand managers, food scientists, food techs, product developers, marketers. Also physical psych-ologists, experimental psychologists, dentists , reps of the USDA, FDA, FTC, Congress and so on. Hardback edition. The 3 most common and potentially harmful food additives discussed were salt, sugar and fat. Scientists compared sugar's effect on the brain to meth, fat's to heroin, & salt's to cocaine. All 3 contributed to the US epidemic of diabetes and obesity. Many cos. seemed to value revenue over consumer health. 12,000 health care professionals signed a 1977 petition andenclosed a bag of 200 decayed teeth (pg 77) of children to the Federal Trade Commission (FTC). They requested the FTC ban sugary ads during TV shows aimed at kids. That got the FTC's attention. I was surpised to learn that the Coke Co. started ""bundled meals"" that included a Coke at US McDonald's & other fast food places. And drink refills. Coke suggested specials toconvenience store owners IE a customer got a free small bag of potato chips when he/ she bought a Coke (pg 113). USDA had a conflict of interest IE it was charged by law with monitoring customers health as R/T dairy & meat industries. Yet in promoted those industries and actively encouraged US consumers to eat more, more, more of both food staples. The Kraft Co. changed cheese from an occasional treat to use as ingredients in meals. Consumers flooded them with recipesas part of Kraft's recipe contest. Some consumers may believe 2% milk had 98% of the fat removed? Untrue. The author clearly explained that whole milk had 3% fat content (pg 153). The most poignant story was a 20 yr Coke employee, now an executive, whose conscience bothered him. Coke planned to expand to Mexico and Brazil and sell just under 7 oz Cokes for 20 cents apiece (pg 117). Many of these folks couldn't afford even this. Coke executives & mgrs, frowned upon referring to frequent Coke users as ""addicts,"" cultivating instead""heavy users."" (pg 109) Revised."

How does the food industry do this? By feeding you as much as possible, and getting you hooked on their product. Almost like the drug business.How do they get you hooked? By overloading you with naturally addicting ingredients that contain salts, sugars, and fats. These are short-cuts to our ancient ‘monkey’-brains that didn’t have these in abundance. Now we have companies loading these 3 addictive substances right into EVERY food imaginable.Not only that, but science can now ENHANCE the addictive properties of all 3. Sugars that are 10x smaller, more refined, and make you ‘feel-good’ faster. Fats that can be put on anything and everything to give it that delicious ‘mouth-feel’ taste. Salts that get you addicted to eating an ENTIRE bag of chips or even pizza, without even realizing it.When they figured out that sugar was addictive, what did they do? Add MORE sugar. Then add MORE salt, and MORE fat.These food companies KNOW you are addicted to their foods. They KNOW that the foods they feed you are TERRIBLE for you. They KNOW that you are over-eating, and they KNOW that people around the world are getting fatter and fatter on their foods.They have known this since you were born. They’ve been getting you hooked on their sugary cereals since you were a baby.We are now able to feed the entire planet, thanks to processed, manufactured, artificially engineered foods. But the nations that have achieved this abundance are now gorging (over-eating) to such an extreme level.Like any other addiction, it is hard to stop eating, when the food is engineered to be almost impossible to put down.What are the consequences? You get fat, you grow a ridiculous gut, your blood gets loaded with sugar and salt, and your veins get clogged with saturated fats. You end up leading a shittier life, panting and wheezing at any exercise, and shortening your number of years to the next heart attack.The food companies ARE and ARE NOT your friend. They want you to buy their product and eat, but they also want you to buy MORE of their product, and eat even MORE.After all, what is the main objective of a business? To Make money. You are their cash-cow (literally), at the expense of your health.MoooooGreat book, absolutely recommend this for the food-conscious."

I did skim through it, in fair detail for a skim, and I heard him interviewed yesterday on CBC's The Current.He's bang on about the sugar. Industry has screwed the physical health of the world for their own financial health. No qualms. In fact, the information, the stories he tells are wonderful.My complaint is he lumps in salt and fat with sugar. Mr. Moss has not done his homework. It is clear to anybody who cares to investigate that the science supprting sodium reduction and fat reduction just don't measure up. Dr. Krause has clearly shown saturated fat does not contribute to heart disease. Studies have shown that sodium reduction can be more dangerous than high sodium diets, and that general reduction does very little. He ignores the science which shows hormones like insulin effect sodium retention. Millions of n-1 anecdotal studies show reducing sugar reduces insulin and lowers blood pressure. I know this from my own n-1 experiement. I also know from my own numbers that saturated fat is likely an essential food, and it is. We will die without it. There is no credible science supporting our understanding and fears about animal foods. None to make a conclusion on, except that they are healthy and shouldn't be avoided. And Mr. Moss completely ignores the mud. He walks around in his hip waders claiming to be finding all sorts of buried treasures, but his hands aren't dirty.Well Mr Moss, if you read this, please check up on the NHLBI's ATP, specifically their conflicts of interest. This is the group that defines cholesterol as bad, saturated fat as bad, our whole understanding of animal products as bad. This is where all nutrition policy is rooted, and it's inextricably hooked into Big Pharma's jowls.Do your homework Mr. Moss. Don't write such books for money and fame. Do it to expose the real truths.http://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/guidelines/c..."
51,1400069807,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4337919-brad-seehawer,4,"At first glance, the subject of the book shouldn't be too shocking: food companies want us to buy more junk food, film at 11. But when taken into consideration just how much research, technology, chemistry, and marketing goes into the process of betting you to eat just one, it's pretty disheartening, and a near insurmountable challenge for the average person who doesn't have the financial means to purchase higher quality food or the wherewithal to take the effort to learn that a simple brandishing of ""Vitamin C"" or ""Whole Grains"" on the front of the box doesn't absolve the hundreds of calories and saturated fat hidden within. At the same time, we are ultimately the ones responsible for our own diets, and it should be no surprise that our largest quantities of saturated fat come from the outrageous amounts of red meat and cheese that we readily shove into out faces for three 'square' meals a day. It comes back to Michael Pollan's quote about what to eat to be maximally healthy: ""Eat food. Not too much. Mostly plants.""There's a lot we don't know about how the food we eat affects our bodies, but over the past thirty years, it's clear that many of us are royally screwing it up. Whatever we choose to believe about our diets, it's pretty incontrovertible that salt, sugar, and fat are the three things that are doing us the most harm."
52,1400069807,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1762190-emily,5,"This book is so much more than, ""Salt, Sugar, and Fat are all bad for you and you should stop eating these things!"" I mean...it said that too, but it was really a very comprehensive look at the food industry and how they have used science, advertising, flavor, additives, psychology, and so much more to keep us wanting their foods. It's so crazy, but as I was reading a chapter dedicated to Lunchables and how they changed lunch for millions of children and people in the 90s, I found myself thinking fondly of when my mom would let my brother and I get one to take to school...and then...I literally was craving one. It was bizarre! Here I was reading about how they we're a main contributor to diabetes and obesity and weight problems, and yet I wanted one. That's the point of this book. The food industry hooks people, like me, from a young age, and they have a built in, life-long consumer. I've recently tried to change a lot of my eating habits and it's hard, but reading this book has already changed the way I look at things at the grocery store. If you're interested at all in food, health, big business, or just like an explosive expose, read this. As informative and scary as it is, it's also wildly entertaining."
53,1400069807,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7395171-dianne,5,"Michael Moss's Salt Sugar Fat is an enlightening and thought provoking study in the role of big business for helping to create a craving in this country for processed foods that are overly saturated with fats, salts and sugars. Why? To make their products the most popular, creating more demand which in turn creates larger revenues! With their 'brand' established, the public is ripe for the new, improved version, slightly different versions, new products with 'tweeked' flavors. Did you know there is some magical number for sweetness? Hit that number and test 'victims' LOVE the taste! Same for fats and salt! With so many households with both parents working, so many single mothers working, convenience seems to reign supreme over nutrition. Once our taste buds get hold of the 'enhanced' foods, we find an apple just plain boring! Imagine what kids think? Their taste buds are programmed by outside influences-sugary, salty, fatty foods you can eat on the run.The U.S. government looked on for years before starting a very slow campaign towards eating right. Nice. Job.This is a must read for anyone who eats! Tony the Tiger is NOT your friend!This edition was provided by NetGalley and Random House in exchange for my honest review."
54,1400069807,http://goodreads.com/user/show/18944510-mario-tomic,4,"After reading this book you're gonna think twice about eating a fast food place or a convenience store. What you will learn from this books will be dozens of tricks and marketing techniques big food companies have used over the years and continue to use today to make us eat more processed food. It's all split into 3 parts covering the use of: sugar, fat and salt in that order. The whole book is really a massive eye opener, it will bring you to a new level of awareness when you go on your next late night fast food quest or when you go shopping. You'll definitely be able to make healthier choices and you'll be unplugged so to say from the seductive power of processed food marketing. Overall there's tons of valuable information in this book, it can also be a bit overwhelming to digest because a lot of the data are results of studies and market research so I suggest take your time to really think about it and soak up as much as you can. I would recommend this book to absolutely everyone, you will get a glance into the whole system of fast food industry that is fully optimized for decades to compel you to eat more processed food."
55,1400069807,http://goodreads.com/user/show/24011982-cynda,3,"I learned that mass food production in US with production times, warehouse shelf times, travel times, store shelf times, household shelf times require suppression of bacteria and reduction of WOF (warmed over flavor) which I think of as being overly-processed food that is nowhere near fresh in taste.If I chose to eat processed foods--and I eat more than I care to admit to myself--I will have to have too much fat, sugar, and salt and too little real food flavor.Home preparation of seasonal eating seems to remain the best option. I have a simplified life, so easier for me. Those still raising families and feeding growing generations of families will not have same options. Maybe we can make one or two better options until the food industry is forced to change their methods of packaging and selling their food products."
56,1400069807,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10508943-xavier,4,"I feel distinctly conflicted about Michael Moss' Salt Sugar Fat (c2013). Firstly and foremost a well-crafted and fun read, eye opening beyond education, flatly Awesome! At the same time it is spine tingly frightening, Stephen King quality horrifying in its description of the lengths the processed foods people will go to peddle us junk food. Ultimately fascinating to me is the craft, dare say sheer brilliance of these bastard’s ploys. In terms of marketing these men must be admired and learned from. They looked at a challenge not in terms of specific solutions - It was about redefining the problem, making it simpler, reframing the most basic questions. Chief execs like Robert Woodruff at Coke who saw having a Coke as a part of every great moment in a person’s life, and he should be there to sell them one. And Charles Mortimer at General Foods (who coined the term ""convenience""), who in the late fifties told the food scientists from his struggling cereal division that they were thinking about the problem all wrong - You’re in the “breakfast foods” business, not the cereal business, think outside the box (my choice of words) and forget about cereal for now. And the scientists did just that to great success, creating best sellers like Tang, instant breakfast drinks and Pop Tarts. The kid could now have cake and a sweet drink for breakfast, in addition to the usual selection of newer and even sweeter cereal brands. Cunningly smart scoundrels; they didn’t sell product features, they bestowed lifestyle benefit. Yet all at once they must with equal vigor and vehemence be despised for their blatant disregard of public health, surely every bit a criminal as any drug dealer. To these execs no ethic was sacrosanct, even aggressively marketing directly to kids. No stone would be left unturned, and after they had us turned the right way inside the store they set loose the food scientists who leapt full reign into the brain science, tens of mil spent to find out what we could have guessed- What we each already knew deep in our bones - Sugar acted like a stimulant and Fat like an opiate exciting the very same pleasure centers in the brain as the drugs did, and salt smoothed out the in between, the up and down. Unilever’s study said it, “Ice cream does make you happy.” It’s official. They had discovered with focus groups and brain scans the ‘bliss point’, and were learning to maintain it without exceeding sensory specific satiety; understanding the why we like things, and manipulating the mechanism of how we know when to stop eating. Flavors, textures, aromas and mouth feel were engineered with designer food additives (their long term health effects unknown), targeted like a laser to defeat the signal in our head, the signal that says “Enough!” Instead we keep eating, becoming junkies for the stuff. All these disgraces are artfully wrapped by Moss in real stories of real events, and real people who were there, all humanized, or at least not demonized (Moss’ narrative tone more amazed than outraged). Stories of dedicated corporate soldiers who cared about what they were doing and did the best job they could, most sounding unapologetic in the recap. To the contrary, they were proud of their contributions, although many ultimately soured with the sobering questions of morality.Like the story of a thoughtful and well-meaning VP from Kraft corporate named Michael Mudd, who got sat down at a meeting of industry leaders in 1999 for suggesting the large numbers of fat people who ate their salt sugar and fat laden stuff might present a public perception problem, and potential consumer backlash. He mentioned something about promoting exercise too. He was told, in a manner of speaking, to pipe down and not upset the apple cart. That consumer fads and preferences were current fancy, they would pass in time. There was no need to go crazy. “…Look, we’re not going to screw around with the company jewels and change the formulations because a bunch of guys in white coats are concerned about obesity…” That was the gist of what Stephen Sanger, head of General Mills, had to say about it all. Astonishingly (or predictably not), the common industry view of what was needed had become and remains more and better sugars fats and salts. Ones more easily concealed with innocuous names like ""Fruit Concentrate"" - Which is still pure sugar, only then they could picture fruit on the wrapper, and feel better about it. The answer was to double down with more offerings, line extensions – Re-formulate retest re-launch, go go go. The new marketing paradigm wasn't as concerned with generating new users, it was modeled or more accurately formulated to promote existing customers to consume even more, and feel good about it as they did, or least not to feel bad - Brilliant! - Damn the torpedoes of public criticism, and the dangers of diets high in salt sugar and fat, and their calculable contribution to obesity. The answer was more, More MORE! Gun lobbies loved that one too.The processed food giants could have acted responsibly back then, at that 1999 meeting when Mudd gave them the hard facts. They could have come to an agreement to voluntarily lower the salt sugar fat content and address nutritional concerns. They could have avoided a foreseeable future of unnecessarily higher economic and social costs. It’s easily imagined if they’d spent as much money on quality ingredients as they did on only a part of research and promotion, their stuff could be healthy and taste good, and we’d be farther along the road in dealing with the problem. Fourteen years later the arrogance stands magnified in skyrocketing obesity and diabetes numbers, and loudening demands for the industry to clean up its act. Sure too there’d be legal and legislative battles to be fought (ie NY Big gulp law), and the dreaded prospect of a sugar tax. Yet the players behave more irresponsibly than ever. The Philip Morris people could see a backlash coming. They’d been there before. It’s why they sold off their food interests.The book could also be considered as precautionary tale, argued for the necessity of closer government oversight. That a private corporation left to its own device will act in its best interest, even if those interests are directly opposed to public wellbeing. The examples in the book support this proposition time and time again. They’re not inherently evil entities; we just got to watch them. Certainly the book argues persuasively to the ineffectiveness and counter productiveness of the present legislative landscape and regulatory system. The form those regulations and enforcement should take involve thorny questions, both commercially and constitutionally sensitive, confused within the influence of big food’s lobby. Maybe most poignant is the story of marketing guru and loyal Coke employee Jeff Dunn. He’d wanted to work at Coke since he was eight. His father Walter had worked at Coke, a legend there. Jeffrey only later became disgruntled. On a trip to Brazil in 2000, as he looked around a slum in Rio, the voice in his head said, ""…‘These people need a lot of things, but they don’t need a Coke.’ - I almost threw up. From that moment forward, the fun came out of it for me."" Dunn's lately been trying to promote a new product using the same considerable marketing skills he’d employed on Coke and Dew. That new product - Bags of Carrots. Just carrots, nothing added, no sugar coating or dipping sauce included. It will likely take all his considerable skill to make it work…God Bless him! It takes quite a while to overcome generational eating habits. It takes generations. It starts slowly, a bag of carrots here and there. Kids will eat what you tell them to eat, after a couple of days of hunger. "
57,1400069807,http://goodreads.com/user/show/56359053-rachel,5,"Salt Sugar Fat is an eye-opening, riveting view into the cutthroat world that is the processed food industry. Ever since I started getting serious about losing weight, I’ve had a weird sort of fascination with learning more about nutrition and the dangers of consuming processed food. The number of food documentaries that I’ve watched is nothing short of astounding; I can’t seem to stop my quest for knowledge. I love reading, so I figured that reading about nutrition would be another good way to inform myself about food in a factual manner. Obviously, it’s very easy to be misinformed about processed food and the ingredients that it actually contains. Food companies push their products in order to make a profit. Journalists push their stories in order to sell their work. Before reading this book, I knew that I wanted to know the facts, the cold hard truth about packaged foods that people shy away from. I didn’t want to be fed lies or somehow draw myself in towards mindless propaganda. Moss is a reputable author whose extensive research, expertise, and knowledge qualify him as a credible source. For me, awareness about what I’m putting into my body is one of the biggest motivators of weight loss success. Since switching to a mostly whole foods eating plan, regularly doing intermittent fasting, exercising 6-7 days a week, and (mostly) cutting out sugar, I’ve lost almost 70 lbs. That’s not to say that I never indulge in sweets or processed foods. I occasionally do, but I do so in moderation which, as Michael Moss so expertly points out, is really hard to actually do. I don’t believe that consumers are completely at fault for not being able to stop at just a few chips. I used to gorge on chips all the time. I was absolutely hooked on junk food. My cholesterol levels were horrendous. I get it. It’s hard to stop! It has been proven time and time again that manufactures and food scientists specifically create food to be addictive. The amount of money that they spend on research, advertising, taste-testing trials, and studies is astounding. This book uncovers the truth about what happens behind closed doors (and labs) at the major food manufacturers’ properties. If you’re looking for a book filled with interviews, statistics, thorough journalism, secrets, advertising tactics, and solid information about processed food, Salt Sugar Fat is the book for you. Moss has an uncanny ability to present the facts in an intriguing manner while remaining true to the consumer. After all, Moss himself knows how difficult it is to resist the allure of a perfectly baked cookie or a (seemingly) deliciously-crafted frozen meal. Moss does an excellent job delivering the facts in a neutral manner while still challenging the industry to do better. His interviews with current and past employees shed a much-needed light towards the changes that have been and still need to be made in order to make processed foods healthier. A good majority of people in America are hooked on fast food and processed foods, and for good reason. It’s tasty, cheap, and easy. But perhaps most importantly, it’s addictive, so much so that Americans are getting larger and larger as companies make more and more money. The cycle is endless; the advertising techniques that are used border on manipulative, especially when targeted towards children. However, knowledge is power. I personally believe that this book has made me a more informed consumer. Rather than look at junk food and crave it, I look at the packaged treats and think, “It’s not worth it.” Not at the sake of my health and for the longevity of my life. Look, I’m not totally against processed foods. Like I said earlier, I still eat them, just not very often. I don’t eat organic-everything, gluten free this and gluten free that. I don’t go around preaching about my food choices to unsuspecting people, nor do I chastise them for eating Oreos in front of me. I do my own thing and I live my own life. If someone wants to know what I think about whole foods versus processed foods, then I’ll tell them, but I’m not radical and I certainly don’t judge others for their food choices. The way that I eat is my decision, just as it is for everyone else, but I’m glad that I’m able to make more informed decisions thanks to this book. I feel very confident recommending Salt Sugar Fat to anyone who wants to know more about the processed food industry and the food that they’re putting into their bodies."
58,1400069807,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6865942-claire,2,"The title of this book is pretty self-explanatory. It is about the processed food that seems to be taking over America (and giving is a pretty good go in the rest of the developed world, too), how much of these three things it contains, and how the manufacturers are working hard to sell it to us.He takes each of the three sinful things and explains why we love them. He tells us what sort of food it is in and how much of it is in that type of food. He tells us how the companies developed some of the worst offending processed foods, and how they are marketed to us. It is all quite interesting, but there's nothing ground-breaking in here, in my opinion. Processed food is bad for you. This is not a news flash to me. Is it to anyone? Soda contains lots of sugar and the companies that make it are trying to find ways to make you buy more of it. Are you shocked?I am a Brit living in America, and I was surprised when I entered my first American Wal-Mart at the amount of choice of boxed processed items, and the lack of choice of actual food. There are of course stores where you can buy actual food, but I still struggle to keep some variety in my weekly grocery shop. This book tells the story of many revolting-sounding popular American food products, such at the vast array of sugary cereal I am amazed people feed to their children, and the yellow, tasteless gloop they call cheese over here. Oreos were not sold in the UK until recently, and in reading this book I learnt why; our authorities would not allow it for health reasons. They would not allow some Kraft cheese products, either, but we have proper cheese that tastes of something in our country, so I cannot imagine that they would have sold anyway. So, if we know that crisps/chips contain fat and salt and Coke contains sugar and McDonald's contains... actually, I'm not sure what McDonald's contains, but anyway, what is Moss' point? He says it is a wake-up call about what the food industry is up to. It is to let us know that we have choices; we can buy food, or we can buy that food-like product in a box that may have been put in that box over a year ago. So, if you feel you need that wake-up call about how you fuel your body, then this book is for you. If you knew all along that fruit and vegetables existed, but still want to enjoy being horrified at the evil of a large corporation, then this book is for you, too.Moss uses the analogy that sugar is the methamphetamine of food ingredient, and he explains how food producers have made it even more so. Fat is apparently the opiate of the food world. But when the two are together is when they pack the best punch. Yes, I know. Don't we all know that? Everyone loves sugar and fat, although, in my opinion, salt does not even come close. I do not have salt as an ingredient in the house, although I do eat out a lot, so I am sure I eat my daily recommended amount. Moss explains how it is needed in almost every processed food. We know that processed food is full of this stuff, the trick is to exercise a little self-control and not overdose on it. Or maybe I'm wrong, perhaps not everyone knows this. Moss tells of programs in the UK and Finland where the governments have attempted to inform the public of what they ought to be eating. There seems to be little of this in America, but what planet does a person (OK, an adult) have to be on to not know that a Coke has lots of sugar in it?
