0,0517003937,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1713956-manny,4,"I will say at once that there was a great deal I did not understand in this book, which is based on four lectures Einstein gave at Princeton in 1921. Though short, it is very dense, and obviously written for people who know considerably more physics and mathematics than I do. But I had read enough about the content elsewhere to be able to follow the general outlines of the argument, and I will do my best to explain what I got out of it.Einstein's main goal is to show you how he arrived at the Theory of General Relativity. The basic idea is extraordinarily simple and logical: he wants to formulate the laws of nature in a way that is independent of the coordinate system chosen. This may sound modest, but it is not. In case you are in doubt, he invites you to consider the case of a rotating object like the Earth. In Newtonian physics, you have to use an ""inertial"" frame of reference, motionless or moving uniformly with respect to the fixed stars; then you can explain things like Foucault's pendulum. But Einstein wants it also to be possible to adopt the Ptolemaic frame of reference, where the Earth stands still and the rest of the universe rotates around it. For Galileo and Newton, this would have made no sense at all, since space for them was absolute. Einstein shows that his great predecessors were wrong: you can have a consistent picture where these shifts are mathematically meaningful. If the Earth is standing still and the universe is rotating, the rotating gravitational field created by the distant stars will drag Foucalt's pendulum along with it. You need to identify gravity and acceleration, and model them both as curvature of space-time. It turns out (though the details are very complicated, and I couldn't follow them), that there is just one straightforward way to organize the scheme. This turns out to be the central tensor equation of General Relativity.Having made this incredible discovery, you'd think Einstein would have been happy, but he wasn't. He felt he'd left things at best half-completed. His theory predicted singularities in what we would now call black holes (Einstein never believed in black holes, and hated them), and it had no elegant explanation for electromagnetic forces; they were just pasted on in an ugly and unsatisfying fashion. Einstein famously spent the second half of life in a fruitless search for a solution, and his frustration shines through. It is interesting to see how ruthless he is about discarding approaches which don't feel right. String theory wasn't even on the horizon yet, but this passage is remarkably prescient and I'm surprised I haven't see it quoted before:More complex field theories have frequently been proposed. They may be classified according to the following characteristic features:a) Increase of the number of dimensions of the continuum. In this case one must explain why the continuum is apparently restricted to four dimensions.b) Introduction of fields of different kind (e.g. a vector field) in addition to the displacement field and its correlated tensor field gᵢⱼ.c) Introduction of field equations of higher order (of differentiation)In my view, such more complicated systems should be considered only if there are physical-empirical reasons to do so.I would have loved to watch him debate Susskind or Polchinski.Einstein, Einstein, Einstein. Even if I only grasp a tenth of what you're telling me, you rock are an extraordinary person. I'm sorry you didn't wrap it all up the way you wanted to, but, you know, still pretty good for a mortal man."

2,0517003937,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8146484-nitin,5," I started reading this book cause i wanted to know more about the man who postulated the theory of relativity. And i was delightfully surprised by the human nature of Albert Einstein. The book is collection of his speeches, interviews and articles covering his views and opinions about diverse fields ranging from Physics to philosophy and life in general. Amazed to find that most of his ideas are valid even in today's world.Einstein seems to had opinions on almost every subject and most of these were as good as those of relevant field-experts in those times!. The book is divided into different sections like Science, Politics, Maths etc. A good read just to have a different(and good :))perspective!"
3,0517003937,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4055243-michael,4,"“Whoever undertakes to set himself up as judge in the field of Truth and Knowledge is shipwrecked by the laughter of the gods.”A book of a variety of subject matter, many of which are likely better pursued in other works. Wisdom, politics, and science are stuttered through articles, speeches, letters and statements, i.e. it is often truncated, generalized, esoteric, and/or repeated. So why go this route? For me, there are two main reasons: 1) the man is not separate from his ideas; and 2) a taste for Einstein’s own words whets the appetite for more.A revolutionary scientist, an admirably incorrigible peace-monger, Einstein is, in my opinion, most essentially a virtuoso of the unassuming, cutting through the systemic edifices that are supposed to fortify human understanding. His contribution to the world did not make our conception of it more tidy and complete as our scientific culture had so foolishly assumed it should; rather, Einstein’s work reoriented our conception of the world to the awe and mystery in which such a puny thing as man is forever condemned to regard, if he is going to have an even partially valid conception of this existence.The oxymoron is perhaps best put by Kant: “The eternal mystery of the world is its comprehensibility.”Einstein is at his best when dropping wisdom and humility in the epistemological pursuit - the brunt of which comes out as strikingly buddhist:“This more aristocratic illusion concerning the unlimited penetrative power of thought has as its counterpart the more plebeian illusion of naive realism, according to which things ‘are’ as they are perceived by us through our senses.”“The belief in an external world independent of the perceiving subject is the basis of all natural science. Since, however, sense perception only gives information of this external world or of ‘physical reality’ indirectly, we can only grasp the latter by speculative means. It follows from this that our notions of physical reality can never be final.”Let that sink in. Says one of the most, if not the most, famous scientist in history, a “belief…is the basis of…science.”“If, then, it is true that the axiomatic basis of theoretical physics cannot be extracted from experience but must be freely invented, can we ever hope to find the right way? Nay, more, has this right way any existence outside our illusions? Can we hope to be guided safely by experience at all when there exist theories (such as classical mechanics) which to a large extent do justice to experience without getting to the root of the matter?”“…in our thinking (which determines our expectation), we attribute to this concept of the bodily object a significance, which is to a high degree independent of the sense impressions which originally give rise to it. This is what we mean when we attribute to the bodily object ‘a real existence.’ The justification of such a setting rests exclusively on the fact that, by means of such concepts and mental relations between them, we are able to orient ourselves in the labyrinth of sense impressions. These notions and relations, although free mental creations, appear to us as stronger and more unalterable than the individual sense experience itself, the character of which as anything other than the result of an illusion or hallucination is never completely guaranteed.”"

5,0517003937,http://goodreads.com/user/show/598210-sue,2,"I read this book because I wanted to get to know Einstein a little. I'd run across several insightful quotes from him and decided to explore what he was all about. As my rating indicates, I felt this book was just ""ok"". The man himself was very impressive. He was definitely a humanitarian, and wanted nothing but peace. But the book is a collection of his essays and I didn't find it fascinating reading. It also seemed too repetitious at times. The last section of the book was about his ""ideas & opinions"" on Science, which was WAY over my head and I found myself just skimming the pages to get through it."
6,0517003937,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8386282-dan-goldberg,5,The words of the master himself. Not a biography written by someone else. Einstein's writings are fascinating. His opinions...thought provoking and invigorating. I highly recommend this book!

But, on the other hand, there are decisive weaknesses attached to this idea in itself, which have been painfully felt since the beginning of history. That is, if this being is omnipotent, then every occurrence, including every human action, every human thought, and every human feeling and aspiration is also His work; how is it possible to think of holding men responsible for their deeds and thoughts before such an almighty being? In giving out punishment and rewards He would to a certain extent be passing judgement on Himself. How can this be combined with the goodness and righteousness ascribed to Him?""""Education is that which remains, if one has forgotten everything he has learned in school.""""Bureaucracy is the death of any achievement."""

He has different vision that the all other people around the world!!In spite of my disagreement with some of his opinions for maybe genetic factors but he still number one. On the other hand I agree with his ideals!

No.Well, I did understand a good deal, compared to the knowledge I already had about the complex theories and lectures discussed in the book. I actually found some satisfying answers to question that itched my mind for some time. However, even though this book did benefit me, I believe that it is more beneficial to those who are more knowledgeable about mathematics and physics than I am, as they would be able to get the most out of it. But even if you are not that much of a math person or a physics prodigy, you should read it. Why you should read it: Einstein said his goal with the book was to give an insight into the theory of relativity to interested non-experts. This work does exactly that: “Nobody is better at explaining relativity than Einstein himself; his account provides a combination of depth and clarity that only he could confidently produce,” writes Tom Siegfried of Science News.**THE END**"
10,0517003937,http://goodreads.com/user/show/16950502-chris-barrett,5,"I always believe that WHEN you read a particular book for the first time is akin to the first time you heard say Gershwin for the first time or Rakim. Whatever your tastes are the timing does matter. For me, this book mattered a great deal when I first read it. I read this in 1995. I was 21 and about to move into a 285 square foot efficiency, on my own. So one can imagine the impact a book like this can have at that age in that place. I absorbed the book like an Iguana in the desert laying in 3 inches of water in the shade after 3 months of heat. Did I like it? Yes!"
11,0517003937,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1822835-trentren,5,I've given this book at least a dozen times to people over the years. Wise insights and a good book to have around.

14,0517003937,http://goodreads.com/user/show/110398797-nathan-park,2,"I thought this book was okay (2/5 stars). The book is broken down into 5 sections: ideas and opinions, on politics, government and pacifism, on the Jewish people, on Germany, and contributions to science. If I read only the first four sections and stopped, I would have given this book a higher rating (3-4 stars). The fifth section, contributions to science, was by far the longest section and definitely the most difficult thing I have read in my life.The book is basically a conglomeration of Einstein's articles, speeches, lectures, letters, etc. So, it was really interesting learning about his opinions in the world outside of science. Considering he lived through both world wars, he has a lot on his mind. Even though the world we live in is very different from the one Einstein experienced, some of his ideas are relevant in today's time.One part of the book I particularly liked were the subsections on the intersection of science and religion. Einstein was a deeply religious man and he wrote a lot on that topic. I also enjoyed his writings on the military and the idea of a supranational government.Now in reviewing the last section: contributions to science. Considering most of the writing was to be presented to other high level physicists, I understood like 5% of what he was talking about. Being the stubborn person I am, I kept thinking, ""if I read a little more, maybe I'll start understanding a little better."" That didn't happen. Like I didn't even know there was non-Euclidean geometry and how to analyze physics phenomena with it. I would only suggest reading this if you have a strong background in physics. If you don't and still want an introduction to the theory of special relativity and the theory of general relativity, I would suggest some other source.Overall, I wish I just stopped after reading the first four sections. Maybe if I get 100x smarter, I'll try reading it again."

16,0517003937,http://goodreads.com/user/show/971451-marshall,2,"This is a large collection of various writings and talks by Albert Einstein. It's boring and repetitive, but it's hard to blame this on Einstein. He wasn't trying to write a book. That was done by others after he died. These writings all existed in isolation when he wrote them, and a lot of what made them interesting was the historical and scientific context in which he wrote them.Probably my favorite part was the correspondence with the Prussian Academy of Science. Adolph Hitler had just come into power and was instituting blatantly anti-Semitic policies. Einstein, a secular Jew, left Germany in protest, along with his affiliations in Germany. The Academy was offended and felt he was being unpatriotic. He basically told them to go fuck themselves.But otherwise, damn, this book was hard to read. Just lots of political rants and physics stuff that went over my head, which I mostly just skimmed. It was hardly worth reading."
17,0517003937,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3320405-raj,3,"This is a collection of writings and lectures by Albert Einstein, organised in sections, discussing ideas, politics, pacifism, the Jewish people, science and more. I got through all of it until I reached the final part: contributions to science. Although Einstein's writing could be dense (particularly his pre-war stuff), it was generally understandable. The science writing was beyond me. I struggled through a lot of it, but stopped when I realised that I had read entire pages that didn't make any sense.His writing on other topics makes for interesting reading though, and it's particularly interesting to see his attitudes change post-war (and his writing becomes much easier to read at that point as well), but the science contributions defeated me."
18,0517003937,http://goodreads.com/user/show/23957933-katya-mills,5,"Einstein's own words, what could be better? Some scientists struggle to bring their ideas to the general public, and many scientists require you to have a working knowledge of biology, chemistry and physics to translate their writings. I was thrilled when I discovered this book and the easy way he writes about his life and theory. He was to science what Carl Jung was to psychology... both of them visionary, both humble. They both took the time to decodify their fields for us. Kinda like Bodhisattvas. Committed to the attainment of enlightenment for the benefit of others. "

24,0517003937,http://goodreads.com/user/show/826429-sj-loria,5,"Is Einstein a Philosopher?This is one of the best books I’ve read in a long, long time. The most recent addition to my “Top Shelf” on my bookshelf.Everyone “knows” Einstein as the scientist with the scientist look, E=MC2, etc. Until reading this I thought Einstein was just a scientist. After reading this book I stand in awe of the man’s intellect, the wide range of topics he thinks about, and the beautiful way that he writes and thinks.Someone recently told me an entrepreneur is an artist. I believe that a scientist, an artist, and a philosopher are all the same profession. Devotion disciple of the Real. A scientist is a philosopher. Einstein happens to be a poetic philosopher.Here’s a range of the (non-scientific) topics Einstein discusses and the main principles of his thinking.•	God Einstein believes in “Spinoza’s God.” All is one, “the Reason that manifests itself in nature.” Essentially that the universe is God’s cloak, and we’re little dust mites that live on it. The evidence of the Good, the True, and the Beautiful (Einstein usually capitalizes these ideas) and the dedication towards creating theories that best describe the world are his form of religious devotion. Einstein calls the inspiration the cosmic religious feeling, not a religious institution.•	ReligionGiven his Jewish heritage and having to leave his home country because of religion, as well his devotion to the cosmic religious spirit, Einstein talks about religion fairly extensively. He distinguishes three phases of religion, each relating to a certain emotion or longing which he says drives all of human activity. The first is primitive religion. No real understanding of cause and effect, creation of a special priestly caste, and enforcement of rules based in fear (think Opus Dei and other primitive religions).The second is social religion. The impulse being to create stronger communities, the extension being communal churches with specific days of devotion. Here God is often depicted as a parent who gives out blessings and counts rights and wrongs based on what people do or another such point system.The third, which he acknowledges as the rarest type, is the cosmic religious feeling. This is a feeling, not an institution, that intuitively guides us towards the Real. Almost like “the invisible hand” in economics, the cosmic religious spirit inspires those who follow it and guides them towards the light.•	GovernmentGiven the social conditions this is no surprise. Einstein left Germany prior to World War II and believes the state should serve man, not the other way around. He believes a government should protect people’s right to grow into thinker and not interfere with their life choices. After World War II he advocates for a kind of international government system that would safeguard rights and prevent war. •	WarEinstein is a pacifist and does not believe states should have militaries. He discusses “patriotism” as a disease, a way to indoctrinate young people into accepting mass murder in uniforms (war). •	CreativityObviously, Einstein knows math, physics, etc. But he also recognizes and acknowledges the limitations of science. Science tells you can is, creativity tells you what can be. He encourages both and respects the mystical path as much as he does the scientific. Here’s how he puts it “loving interest in the object and a desire for truth and understanding, and thus to that divine curiosity which every healthy child possesses, but which so often is weakened early.” 61•	ResponsibilityHe’s a big believer in civic duty, not to the state but to other people. “The value of a man, however, should be seen in what he gives and not in what he is able to receive.” 62QuotesThe most beautiful experience we can have is the mysterious. It is the fundamental emotion which stands at the cradle of true art and true science. Whoever does not know it and can no longer wonder, no longer marvel, is as good as dead, and his eyes are dimmed…I am satisfied with the mystery of the eternity of life and with the awareness and a glimpse of the marvelous structure of the existing world, together with the devoted striving to comprehend a portion, be it ever so tiny, of the Reason that manifests itself in nature. 11With primitive man it is above all fear that evokes religious notions – fear of hunger, wild beasts, sickness, death. Since at this stage of existence understanding of causal connections is usually poorly developed, the human mind creates illusory beings more or less analogous to itself on whose wills and actions these fearful happenings depend. Thus one tries to secure the favor of these beings by carrying out actions and offering sacrifices…Religion of fear. This not created, is in an important degree stabilized by the creation of a special priestly caste…The social impulses are another source of the crystallization of religion. Fathers and mothers and the leaders of larger human communities are mortal and fallible. The desire for guidance, love, and support prompts men to form the social or moral conception of God. This is the God of Providence, who protects, disposes, rewards, and punishes….There is a third stage of religious experience which belongs to all of them, even though it is rarely found in a pure form: I shall call it cosmic religious feeling. It is very difficult to elucidate this feeling to anyone who is entirely without it, especially as there is no anthropomorphic conception of God corresponding to it. 38It is easy to see why the churches have always fought science and persecuted its devotees. On the other hand, I maintain that the cosmic religious feeling is the strongest and noblest motive for scientific research. Only those who realize the immense efforts and, above all the devotion without which pioneer work in theoretical science cannot be achieved are able to grasp the strength and emotion out of which along such work, remote as it is from the immediate realities of life, can be issue. 39The scientist is possessed by the sense of universal causation…His religious feeling takes the form of a rapturous amazement at the harmony of natural law, which reveals an intelligence of such superiority that, compared with it, all the systematic thinking and acting of human beings is an utterly insignificant reflection. This feeling is the guiding principle of his life and work. 40Knowledge of what is [science] does not open the door directly to what should be [creativity]. 42[A creator or teacher] will have to avail themselves of those forces which are capable of cultivating the Good, the True, and the Beautiful in humanity itself. 48When presented with a specific case [of what is the “right” religion], however, it is no easy task to determine clearly what is desirable and what should be eschewed, just as we find it difficult to describe what exactly it is that makes good painting or good music. It is something that may be felt intuitively more easily than rationally comprehended. Likewise, the great moral teachers of humanity were, in a way, artistic geniuses in the art of living. 51It is not enough to teach man a specialty. Through it he may become a kind of useful machine but not a harmoniously developed personality. It is essential that the student acquire an understand of and a lively feeling for values. He must acquire a vivid sense of the beautiful and the morally good. Otherwise he – with his specialized knowledge – more closely resembles a well-trained dog than a harmoniously developed person. He must learn to understand the motives of human beings, their illusions, and their sufferings in order to acquire a proper relationship to individual fellow-men and to the community. 66The greatest obstacle to international order is that monstrously exaggerated spirit of nationalism which also goes by the fair-sounding but misused name of patriotism. During the last century and a half this idol has acquired an uncanny and exceedingly pernicious power everywhere…this is intimately connected with the institution of compulsory military service or, to call it by its sweeter name, national armies. A state which demands military service of its inhabitants is compelled to cultivate in them a nationalistic spirit, thereby laying the psychological foundation for their military usefulness. In its schools it must idolize, alongside with religion, its instrument of brutal force in the eyes of the youth. 97The benefits that the inventive genius of man has conferred on us on us in the last hundred years could make life happy and carefree, if organization had been able to keep pace with technical progress. As it is, in the hands of our generation these hard-won achievements are like a razor wielded by a child of three. The possession of marvelous means of production has brought care and hunger instead of freedom. 98The individual must not merely wait and criticize. He must serve the cause as best he can. The fate of the world will be such as the world deserves. 100Is it not significant that such men have been universally accepted as leaders, even though their efforts to mold the course of human affairs were attended with but small success? 104"

Things written about a century are still equally valid. Even if there are disagreeable points, the underpinning arguments are perfectly logical. Quite fortunate that such a book exists and that I got a chance to read it. If only I could give six stars."
26,0517003937,http://goodreads.com/user/show/782114-nathan-albright,5,"It's a good thing this book has an introduction, because this particular work presents a bit of a conundrum for many readers, myself included.  This short book, which including two appendices of some length comes out to only a bit more than 150 pages in length of Einstein's material, finds itself in a bit of an uncanny valley as a work, but this is not necessarily a bad thing [1].  Einstein, like a few of the great theoretical scientists of our time (Hawking comes to mind here), seeks to write in such a way that he can be understood by a wide audience, but this book is exceptionally technical and requires a great deal of familiarity with mathematics in order to understand.  For example, it would be hard to get through much of this book sober if you played a drinking game that required drinking a shot every time that the word ""tensor"" was mentioned.  That aside, though, this book is to be praised for the effort of its author in making the mathematics of special and general relativity accessible to a wide audience, even if this is a difficult book to understand.  For those who are willing to take on the challenge of reading this book, though, there are some immensely useful lessons that can be gathered from Einstein's approach.In terms of its contents, this book is organized in a very straightforward and direct fashion, not wasting paper or the time of the reader, which is something to be appreciated.  The introduction to the work provides the context of the work in discussing the problem that many people have in getting an intuitive feel for the world of relativity. After this the author discusses a look at space and time in pre-relativity physics, looking at what was thought to be constant.   The author then looks at the theory of special relativity, spends a bit more time on the general theory of relativity in two chapters, and then writes two appendices that discuss some notes for the second edition as well as providing a rigorously mathematical relativistic theory for non-symmetric fields.  One of the striking aspects of this book, aside from its sheer number of mathematical equations and the fact that the author seems to think that understanding what he is writing is a trivial and easy task, which is not the case, is the way that Einstein strives to work on setting boundary conditions and define as broadly as possible.This is a notable trait that is worth pondering not just for theoretical physics but also in other areas of life.  Much of the difficulty in understanding relativity and its implications is the fact that people tend not to be able to imagine very well, and theoretical physics definitely requires imagination in order to visualize.  In reading this book it is clear that Einstein was able to live in a world governed by the Maxwell-Morey equations long before others did so, and his realization of their implications for classical physics gave him an advantage when it came to envisioning and describing and justifying a radically different conception of the world than the world of Newtonian physics that most of us tend to live and breathe in regardless of our knowledge of the physics developments of the last century or so.  It is also clear that Einstein spent a lot of time trying to ponder the implications of his own work and make it as generally applicable as possible, while also reminding readers that without a constant one cannot make sense of a universe.  That truth is an important one to remember, and it is unfortunately something that those who have misapplied relativity into relativism all too frequently forget.[1] See, for example:https://edgeinducedcohesion.blog/2015...https://edgeinducedcohesion.blog/2014...https://edgeinducedcohesion.blog/2013..."

All this is put into your hands as your inheritance in order that you may receive it, honor it, add to it, and one day faithfully hand it on to your children. Thus do we mortals achieve immortality in the permanent things which we create in common.It is not enough to teach man a specialty. Through it he may become a kind of useful machine but not a harmoniously developed personality. It is essential that the student acquire an understanding of and a lively feeling for values. He must acquire a vivid sense of the beautiful and of the morally good. Otherwise he—with his specialized knowledge—more closely resembles a well-trained dog than a harmoniously developed person. He must learn to understand the motives of human beings, their illusions, and their sufferings in order to acquire a proper relationship to individual fellow-men and to the community.The pursuit of knowledge for its own sake, an almost fanatical love of justice and the desire for personal independence—these are the features of the Jewish tradition which make me thank my stars that I belong to it."

I was in waaaay over my head in the last section called ""Contributions to Science."" But my own peculiar illness dictated that I read every word, even when I had to start reading out loud to try to make any sense of those words.""The most beautiful experience we can have is the mysterious. It is the fundamental emotion which stands at the cradle of true art and true science. Whoever does not know it and can no longer wonder, no longer marvel, is as good as dead, and his eyes are dimmed. It was the experience of mystery - even if mixed with fear - that engendered religion. A knowledge of the existence of something we cannot penetrate, our perceptions of the profoundest reason and the most radiant beauty, which only in their most primitive forms are accessible to our minds - it is this knowledge and this emotion that constitute true religiosity; in this sense, and in this alone, I am a deeply religious man. I cannot conceive of a God who rewards and punishes his creatures, or has a will of the kind that we experience in ourselves. Neither can I nor would I want to conceive of an individual that survives his physical death; let feeble souls, from fear or absurd egoism, cherish such thoughts. I am satisfied with the mystery of the eternity of life and with the awareness and a glimpse of the marvelous structure of the existing world, together with the devoted striving to comprehend a portion, be it ever so tiny, of the Reason that manifests itself in nature."""

However,what fascinated me were the initial and intermediate sections of the book where Einstein talks about his political,economic and religious views.When you read these chapters,you get a lot more insights into the mercurial side of Einstein where a number of this views oscillate like a pendulum in a matter of few years.In addition,a few of his opinions on topics like God and World Peace remain ambivalent throughout the book and open to interpretation of the reader.Interestingly,he writes very few words about his family life and almost nothing about his first wife and his children.For me,this is an open ended book which may have benefited much more had there been a prodding interviewer,a bit like the biography of Steve Jobs where Walter Isaacson did a much better job."

His subsequent research in physics continued and built upon the findings in this book (independently proven by others as accurate)and the rest is history: His metamorphosis in the public eye into a genuine genius and research that built upon his findings resulting in jaw-dropping human acts of both destruction (nuclear warfare) and discovery that made our world a better place for life (advances in science and medicine from space exploration).

The thinking is both precise and acknowledges that there is always something greater than we can recognize which keeps us wondering and curious. Here’s one of many gems in Einstein’s speeches, lectures and addresses: ""Why is it necessary to drag down from the Olympian fields of Plato the fundamental ideas of thought in natural science, and to attempt to reveal their earthly lineage?

He assumes that you know classical physics and don't bother explaining notations for Newton’s laws and Maxwell’s equations (this book is short). Here goes some impressions from a layperson. He deliberately challenges the idea of space and time being slowly developed over centuries as fixed references to any event. You can't be more rebel than that. And goes about laying down his theory (this lecture happened more than 10 years after his paper so he also shares developments/experiments from other scientists). There are plenty of equations in this book, many with partial derivatives in a four-dimensions universe replacing Newton’s algebraic relations.

His subsequent research in physics continued and built upon the findings in this book (independently proven by others as accurate)and the rest is history: His metamorphosis in the public eye into a genuine genius and research that built upon his findings resulting in jaw-dropping human acts of both destruction (nuclear warfare) and discovery that made our world a better place for life (advances in science and medicine from space exploration).

Once you have gravity present in these systems, space must be curved in order for all the physics we know to work (transform in different reference frames). General relativity only shows up with velocities near the speed of light.3. The equations generated in general relativity are not fixed (e.g. the curvature of space) but depend upon the value of a constant called, amazingly enough, the cosmological constant. The cosmological constant is still not known.4. For some reason, Einstein and others want a field theory for gravitation--this part of the book I did not understand at all (hence 4 stars instead of 5 stars).Only took me 6 months to read this book.I bought this book from the University of Chicago bookstore on Nov 29, 1976 for $2.95 plus $0.15 tax according to a receipt in the book.

I freely admit that I didn't read them all.One thing that struck me was in a speech delivered in the early 1930s, where he idolises the equality of Americans, contrasting with hierarchical inegalitarian Europeans. Being aware of the growing inequalities in America in the 21st century, this came as a refreshing reminder that things weren't always so.Some of the pieces are simple speeches given on various occasions, but others are more cerebral, such as an introduction to a book by Bertrand Russel, which delves into epistemology and consciousness.There are also a few letters he wrote about Jews, Germans and Zionism. It's interesting to see how his attitude to Germany changed, and how optimistic he (and other zionists) were about sharing Palestine."

It is based both on scientific systematicity and philosophical-mathematical wholeness: in short simplicity, beauty and a feeling of never ending awe regarding the universe as a whole. The thinking is both precise and acknowledges that there is always something greater than we can recognize which keeps us wondering and curious. Here’s one of many gems in Einstein’s speeches, lectures and addresses: ""Why is it necessary to drag down from the Olympian fields of Plato the fundamental ideas of thought in natural science, and to attempt to reveal their earthly lineage? Answer: In order to free these ideas from the taboo attached to them, and thus to achieve greater freedom in the formation of ideas or concepts.""(chapter: Relativity and the Problem of Space, p.365)"

He assumes that you know classical physics and don't bother explaining notations for Newton’s laws and Maxwell’s equations (this book is short). Here goes some impressions from a layperson. He deliberately challenges the idea of space and time being slowly developed over centuries as fixed references to any event. You can't be more rebel than that. And goes about laying down his theory (this lecture happened more than 10 years after his paper so he also shares developments/experiments from other scientists). There are plenty of equations in this book, many with partial derivatives in a four-dimensions universe replacing Newton’s algebraic relations. Reality is a bit more complicated after Einstein but nowadays relativity is addressed in high school books (another day I skimmed a Physics book for teenagers in Germany)."

Einstein's ideas & opinions generated from his unique perspectives of perceiving & ability to penetrate into the subjects of politics, religion, peace & war and of course science with his gifted ingenuity & wisdom would render one insightful values which in turn would help the world to be a better place for human beings if those values are put into practice."

The thinking is both precise and acknowledges that there is always something greater than we can recognize which keeps us wondering and curious. Here’s one of many gems in Einstein’s speeches, lectures and addresses: ""Why is it necessary to drag down from the Olympian fields of Plato the fundamental ideas of thought in natural science, and to attempt to reveal their earthly lineage?

He assumes that you know classical physics and don't bother explaining notations for Newton’s laws and Maxwell’s equations (this book is short). Here goes some impressions from a layperson. He deliberately challenges the idea of space and time being slowly developed over centuries as fixed references to any event. You can't be more rebel than that. And goes about laying down his theory (this lecture happened more than 10 years after his paper so he also shares developments/experiments from other scientists). There are plenty of equations in this book, many with partial derivatives in a four-dimensions universe replacing Newton’s algebraic relations. Reality is a bit more complicated after Einstein but nowadays relativity is addressed in high school books (another day I skimmed a Physics book for teenagers in Germany)."

The thinking is both precise and acknowledges that there is always something greater than we can recognize which keeps us wondering and curious. Here’s one of many gems in Einstein’s speeches, lectures and addresses: ""Why is it necessary to drag down from the Olympian fields of Plato the fundamental ideas of thought in natural science, and to attempt to reveal their earthly lineage?

He assumes that you know classical physics and don't bother explaining notations for Newton’s laws and Maxwell’s equations (this book is short). Here goes some impressions from a layperson. He deliberately challenges the idea of space and time being slowly developed over centuries as fixed references to any event. You can't be more rebel than that. And goes about laying down his theory (this lecture happened more than 10 years after his paper so he also shares developments/experiments from other scientists). There are plenty of equations in this book, many with partial derivatives in a four-dimensions universe replacing Newton’s algebraic relations. Reality is a bit more complicated after Einstein but nowadays relativity is addressed in high school books (another day I skimmed a Physics book for teenagers in Germany)."

However,what fascinated me were the initial and intermediate sections of the book where Einstein talks about his political,economic and religious views.When you read these chapters,you get a lot more insights into the mercurial side of Einstein where a number of this views oscillate like a pendulum in a matter of few years.In addition,a few of his opinions on topics like God and World Peace remain ambivalent throughout the book and open to interpretation of the reader.Interestingly,he writes very few words about his family life and almost nothing about his first wife and his children.For me,this is an open ended book which may have benefited much more had there been a prodding interviewer,a bit like the biography of Steve Jobs where Walter Isaacson did a much better job."
271,0517003937,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4062463-margaret-langstaff,5,"Whammo! The man who couldn't get a teaching job, whom everyone who knew thought a hopeless nutcase, and a virtual nobody at the time in the world of scientific research, this man wrote a paper in the dim light of early 20th century, The Special Theory of Relativity, and changed our conception of the physical universe and our physical world forever. His subsequent research in physics continued and built upon the findings in this book (independently proven by others as accurate)and the rest is history: His metamorphosis in the public eye into a genuine genius and research that built upon his findings resulting in jaw-dropping human acts of both destruction (nuclear warfare) and discovery that made our world a better place for life (advances in science and medicine from space exploration). No one knows what's next, but the works of his contained in this book were seminal and its seeds continue to sprout and grow every day, for good and ill."
272,0517003937,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2213663-robert,4,"What a great book for this time of life! I now understand1. That Maxwell's equations force special relativity--time dilation, etc.2. Once you have gravity present in these systems, space must be curved in order for all the physics we know to work (transform in different reference frames). General relativity only shows up with velocities near the speed of light.3. The equations generated in general relativity are not fixed (e.g. the curvature of space) but depend upon the value of a constant called, amazingly enough, the cosmological constant. The cosmological constant is still not known.4. For some reason, Einstein and others want a field theory for gravitation--this part of the book I did not understand at all (hence 4 stars instead of 5 stars).Only took me 6 months to read this book.I bought this book from the University of Chicago bookstore on Nov 29, 1976 for $2.95 plus $0.15 tax according to a receipt in the book. Maybe it took me 40+ years to read this book."
273,0517003937,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4236601-popup-ch,3,"A collection of speeches, articles and notes written by Albert Einstein, spanning a wide variety of styles, subjects and seriousness. I freely admit that I didn't read them all.One thing that struck me was in a speech delivered in the early 1930s, where he idolises the equality of Americans, contrasting with hierarchical inegalitarian Europeans. Being aware of the growing inequalities in America in the 21st century, this came as a refreshing reminder that things weren't always so.Some of the pieces are simple speeches given on various occasions, but others are more cerebral, such as an introduction to a book by Bertrand Russel, which delves into epistemology and consciousness.There are also a few letters he wrote about Jews, Germans and Zionism. It's interesting to see how his attitude to Germany changed, and how optimistic he (and other zionists) were about sharing Palestine."
274,0517003937,http://goodreads.com/user/show/52339370-georg-hohbach,5,"Wonderful and Inspiring Read:In this book one can discover Einstein’s clear and systematic thinking first hand. It is based both on scientific systematicity and philosophical-mathematical wholeness: in short simplicity, beauty and a feeling of never ending awe regarding the universe as a whole. The thinking is both precise and acknowledges that there is always something greater than we can recognize which keeps us wondering and curious. Here’s one of many gems in Einstein’s speeches, lectures and addresses: ""Why is it necessary to drag down from the Olympian fields of Plato the fundamental ideas of thought in natural science, and to attempt to reveal their earthly lineage? Answer: In order to free these ideas from the taboo attached to them, and thus to achieve greater freedom in the formation of ideas or concepts.""(chapter: Relativity and the Problem of Space, p.365)"
275,0517003937,http://goodreads.com/user/show/14734538-roberto-rigolin-f-lopes,5,"We are in 1922, Einstein is explaining relativity for experts. He assumes that you know classical physics and don't bother explaining notations for Newton’s laws and Maxwell’s equations (this book is short). Here goes some impressions from a layperson. He deliberately challenges the idea of space and time being slowly developed over centuries as fixed references to any event. You can't be more rebel than that. And goes about laying down his theory (this lecture happened more than 10 years after his paper so he also shares developments/experiments from other scientists). There are plenty of equations in this book, many with partial derivatives in a four-dimensions universe replacing Newton’s algebraic relations. Reality is a bit more complicated after Einstein but nowadays relativity is addressed in high school books (another day I skimmed a Physics book for teenagers in Germany)."
276,0517003937,http://goodreads.com/user/show/24577690-souvik-khamrui,5,"I bought this gems long back in 1996 when I was a student. I kept on skipping it for 19 years pondering that it would require strenuous exercises of brain cells to understand the ideas and opinions of the genius. My assumption is proved right. It took about 12 months to finish the book (during this period I have read other books too in parallel). Einstein's ideas & opinions generated from his unique perspectives of perceiving & ability to penetrate into the subjects of politics, religion, peace & war and of course science with his gifted ingenuity & wisdom would render one insightful values which in turn would help the world to be a better place for human beings if those values are put into practice."
277,0517003937,http://goodreads.com/user/show/15755143-nur-a-a-baig,3,"This guy can speak in depth just about any topic. I wonder whether his prose was just as good as the English translation. This books is a compilation of the essays and letters written by Einstein about topics such as the general philosophy ,the persecution of Jews, the spreading nationalization, the atomic bomb( apparently every human contradicts--relative ethics is a bugger), the World War, the scientific community and the various scientific thought and theories of his time. His science writing does need some working-- REALLY NEEDED TO WORK ON IT--but he should be forgiven on that part for to be speak to a layman you got to be one. One should read this book, and don't beat yourself up over the last section."
278,0517003937,http://goodreads.com/user/show/12231707-sanchar-sharma,3,"I will give 3 stars to the book but worse to the ideas illustrated by Einstein.For starters, General Relativity for me is the most unbiased approach to science compared to all the theories that came before it. Yet, when it came down to his political (and in some cases religious) views, he seemed to be too narrow. His arguments are not quite unbiased and he dismisses arguments contrary to his own based on heuristics that lack much gravity.It is possible that a lot of his full blown arguments got lost in the compilation. But if that is the case, I guess this book creates an unworthy image of Einstein."
279,0517003937,http://goodreads.com/user/show/59682372-eric-amidi,5,"The way that Tensors are explained in this book is very old-fashioned, and understandably so. Today, you can learn it in a more advanced and intuitive way. However, this book affected me when I first read it many years ago. The way it affected me was that it introduced me to Einstein's way of thinking. As you go through the book, you learn about Einstein's thought process. You learn how he would base his theories on logical thinking instead of common beliefs at the time. That way of thinking impacted me a lot at an early age. What I learned from it was that the right way of thinking and problem-solving is using logic plus Occam's Razor i.e. simplicity."
280,0517003937,http://goodreads.com/user/show/47269294-cillian-flood,3,"Interesting mainly as a first hand historical account of the world pre and post war. Einstein's opinions echo my own, but I confess I was pretty lost when it became about mathematics. Which is a shame, I was hoping to get something out of it, I managed to understand Hawking's book okay, but maybe Einstein's notes just weren't designed to be read by a layman. He did use a metaphor when describing E = MC2 which was pretty helpful though. If only more of it took that route."
281,0517003937,http://goodreads.com/user/show/35505061-roger,4,"Einstein’s ideas on war, society, and racism is applicable today. His opinions about nuclear war written over 50 years ago seem to be a warning for today’s idiot leaders who seem hell bent on having the biggest and most destructive gun. Why should we care if the human race is exterminated? The planet will survive. "
282,0517003937,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9598107-kathy-nealen,3,"I read most of this book except for a number of chapters in Part V, which were just too difficult to understand. These chapter were speeches to scientists or articles for science magazines. They were just too technical for a non-physicist. Some of the chapters in the earlier parts were very interesting because they showed Einstein’s thought and correspondence during the rise of Nazi Germany."
283,0517003937,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2948438-ahmad,0,when the time is not absolute it is so difficult to imagine such univers.i believe relativity theory is the begining of a new way of undrestanding of the world by mixing of experiences and deep imagination.
284,0517003937,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5543581-andrea,4,"Had to take my time to read this book. Einstein had deep and complicated thoughts, nevertheless, when I grew accustomed to his writing, I could grasp concepts and ideas more easily. Very educational book that surpassed my expectations. "
285,0517003937,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8027697-adam-rodenberger,3,"an interesting read for sure, but I don't know that non-fiction is really my thing. plenty of great insights into the genius mind, but the first half of the book was a lot of repetitive ideas espoused through different letters to different people, which got tiring. "
286,0517003937,http://goodreads.com/user/show/23863427-bob-kaufman,3,"Some of Einstein's opinions on non-scientific topics are still extremely pertinent today, in my opinion. His talks/papers on peace, military mentaliy, and economics and wages are relevant 70 years later."
287,0517003937,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8394152-louise-carter,3,"This books is a little hard to follow as it is structured by topic and not year, and is also a collection of bits and pieces and not meant to really be a whole book. It is very interesting none the less and a good read. "
288,0517003937,http://goodreads.com/user/show/76134085-jorge-luna,4,"The book presents the views and opinions of the genius in his own words. I skipped some sections that were not of my interest. But overall, it is a inspiring book, that shows how even 60+ years later, we as people continue to face the same challenges and questions."
289,0517003937,http://goodreads.com/user/show/28683369-rabb-jyot,5,"Always been fond of this man. This book is a nice compilation, which tells you more about a normal human behind the tag of Genius. It throws light on his understanding about the differences between religion and science as well as his humility & concern for world peace."
290,0517003937,http://goodreads.com/user/show/26185-dave-russell,5,He had the clearest vision of anybody I've ever read.
291,0517003937,http://goodreads.com/user/show/440440-daniel-crews,4,"The whole non-science part of the book is great but one essay - ""Why Socialism?"" - is a must read. "
292,0517003937,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1009390-julia,3,"Fascinating, delving into the actual writings of Einstein. What's more interesting than his well known scientific writings are his personal views on global politics."
293,0517003937,http://goodreads.com/user/show/938311-tommy,2,Interesting to get a look at some of Einstein's thoughts though the collection was repetitive at times and the physics section somewhat dry for a layperson.
294,0517003937,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1270209-derek,5,Certainly the most insightful book I've ever picked up. 
295,0517003937,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1653451-ajp3,5,just read it already.
296,0517003937,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1600621-jenn,5,"i've read this book, re-read this book, and still go back to read different passages from time to time..."
297,0517003937,http://goodreads.com/user/show/431740-alma,0,it was the same things that are said all the time . but its still really good.
298,0517003937,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2354693-joyce-f,4,"I am not a scientist, but I was curious and this book really helped. I highly recommend it. Also ... a good idea to read this or another like it before picking up quantum theory/mechanics texts."
299,0517003937,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2474547-rahul-jha,4,Excellent and very thoughtful essays in all realms of human thought.
