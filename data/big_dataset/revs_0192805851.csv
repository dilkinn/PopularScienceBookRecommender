However, we can experience this world only through our senses: the colours, the smells and the feels. They are all we have, to form our idea about our environment. However, they are dependent upon the experiences of our brain, therefore by nature subjective - and when we come to abstract concepts like pleasure and pain, they have no existence other than in the mind.""Mind"" - the fateful word! What is it? Even if we are not read up on philosophy, we assume that it exists independently of our physical body. That is, most of us subscribe to some sort of dualism. All the world's religions, other than Buddhism, posit an indestructible ""soul"" (although there is a difference between the Hindu Atman and the Levantine soul, a point which I shall touch upon later). The best-known dualist theory about the mind is the one proposed by Rene Descartes, the famous Seventeenth Century French philosopher. According to Descartes, the mind is non-physical and resides in the pineal gland in the centre of the brain. However, the problem of the interaction of the non-physical mind with the physical brain is not so easily solved, therefore most scientists and philosophers prefer a monistic explanation – either the mind being fundamental, or the body. Modern science takes the materialistic view that the mind arises from mental processes.But this does not solve the problem of how a physical brain, made purely of material substances, can give rise to conscious experiences which scientists call the ‘qualia’, the indescribable experiences. This is traditionally called the ‘hard problem’ of consciousness, a term coined by the Australian philosopher David Chalmers 1n 1994.***What does being conscious mean? For example, is my computer which takes inputs from me, interacts with me, and provides output in some way conscious? Most of us would instinctively say no: we are conditioned to think only biologically “live” entities as conscious. But then, is a tree conscious? It is born, lives and dies: reaches towards light, and uses its roots to feed itself. Again, most of us would say no – it has no brain. But then, is a bat, which has a brain, conscious in the same way that I am conscious?“What is it like to be a bat?” – This question was made famous by the American philosopher Thomas Nagel 1n 1974. He said that if there is something it is like to be the bat, that is, if the bat is self-aware of being itself, then it is conscious: otherwise it is not. Nagel was using this argument to challenge materialism: since consciousness is subjective, we can never know objectively what it is. What we are talking about here is phenomenal consciousness, which is where self-awareness comes from – which is to be differentiated from access consciousness, which we use for thinking, acting and speaking.So here is the million-dollar question: is consciousness an add-on to the physical brain, something which arises out of neural activity yet independent of it (the ‘ghost in the machine’)? Or is it intrinsic to complex brain processes and inseparable from them, and the idea of an independent consciousness an illusion?Blackmore subscribes to the latter viewpoint, following the path of the philosopher Daniel C. Dennett. This book is devoted to proving that the self is an illusion, based on the findings of scientific research.***The Theatre of the Mind and the Stream of ConsciousnessSusan Blackmore says we more or less view our mind as a theatre, where the self sits, seeing the show through the eyes, experiencing smells through the nose, and hearing sound through the ears – our daily 4D movie show. Also, we add the time element to it, experiencing it as flowing like a stream (hence the term ‘stream of consciousness’). According to Dennett, this is all bunkum. There is no centre point in the mind where everything comes together – it is all processed in parallel.The amount of scientific research the author manages to bring to the table to prove her point are impressive. First, the human brain is analysed in detail, how various parts are related to various activities of the consciousness – also how damage significantly changes human perception in weird ways. Having linked mental processes firmly to physical activity, Blackmore attacks the concept of ‘stream of consciousness’ by establishing that the events the brain processes do not enter consciousness at all unless verbally probed - that is, we become aware of doing something only when we introspect. So there is no ‘stream’ as such, rather multiple processes which are gathered into a coherent stream later on.The Grand IllusionStill there must be something like a consciousness to do all this activity. Blackmore does not disagree – we do feel a ‘conscious self’, but in scientific terms, it is an illusion. She presents an extensive list of interesting experiments to prove that perception is largely subliminal. Even if we are not “aware” of what we perceive, the brain functions just the same. The self, instead of an entity, is a ‘bundle of sensations’, to borrow the words of David Hume. This is also very near to the concept of the ‘Anatman’ – the ‘not-self’ – posited by the Buddha (a man much ahead of his time, it seems!).However, Blackmore goes further in denying the self – she refuses to equate it with any brain process. Quoting Dennett, she says that  the self is a total illusion created by the way we use our language: Finally, a completely different approach is provided by Dennett. Having rejected the Cartesian theatre, he also rejects its audience of one who watches the show. The self, he claims, is something that needs to be explained, but it does not exist in the way that a physical object (or even a brain process) exists. Like a centre of gravity in physics, it is a useful abstraction. Indeed, he calls it a ‘centre of narrative gravity’. Our language spins the story of a self and so we come to believe that there is, in addition to our single body, a single inner self who has consciousness, holds opinions, and makes decisions. Really, there is no inner self but only multiple parallel processes that give rise to a benign user illusion – a useful fiction.It seems we have some tough choices in thinking about our own precious self. We can hang on to the way it feels and assume that a persisting self or soul or spirit exists, even though it cannot be found and leads to deep philosophical troubles. We can equate it with some kind of brain process and shelve the problem of why this brain process should have conscious experiences at all, or we can reject any persisting entity that corresponds to our feeling of being a self.I think that intellectually we have to take this last path. The trouble is that it is very hard to accept in one’s own personal life. It means taking a radically different view of every experience. It means accepting that there is no one who is having these experiences. It means accepting that every time I seem to exist, this is just a temporary fiction and not the same ‘me’ who seemed to exist a moment before, or last week, or last year. This is tough, but I think it gets easier with practice.In the same way, Susan Blackmore also negates free will. Quoting an interesting experiment by Wegner, she argues that the same unconscious impulses give rise to the action and the thought behind the action: only thing is that the thought occurs a fraction of a second before the action, so we conclude that we have willed it!(This is a truly radical approach. I must confess, even though it is argued flawlessly, it is a bit hard for me to accept. But I must admit that I have lived with this consciousness for such a long time that it is very difficult to let the chap go!)***This is a good book, which talks on a difficult subject in a readable manner. The author’s erudition and credentials also cannot be faulted. Hence the four stars.However, a couple of caveats:Firstly, this is not an introduction to the subject – it is an introduction to particular theory of consciousness. History of scientific and philosophical research on the subject is largely ignored, and competing theories are presented only so that they can be refuted. I am definitely interested in the subject, and shall be reading more – and not just Dennett’s theory.Secondly, materialism and monism is taken as a given. True, the Levantine concept of an indestructible soul occupying the destructible body cannot be treated scientifically (though it’s a valid religious concept)– but the Hindu concept of Atman and Brahman is slightly different.The Mandukya Upanishad talks extensively of consciousness. It posits four ‘Purushas’ (we may think of them as various types of consciousness). The first one, which is outward-looking and connected to the waking state, experiences the ‘real’ world. The second one, which is inward-looking and connected to the dreaming state, experiences the phenomenal world. The third one, which is connected with dreamless sleep, experiences the real and phenomenal worlds at the same time. And the fourth one, the most profound, goes beyond all these experiences and transcends the phenomenal existence. I guess it is here that the Atman identifies with the Brahman.The concept of the Brahman in Hinduism can be most closely approximated as ‘un-distilled sentience’: a sort of cosmic consciousness of which each and every atom of reality is but a part. The individual Atman is but an imperfect reflection of the Brahman: the realisation that it is part of the big whole is said to be the whole purpose of enlightenment.At the present level of scientific knowledge, materialism seems to be the only valid worldview. But in the light of quantum phenomena, is the concept of reality as sentience wholly off the mark? I don’t think so.Susan Blackmore could have dwelt a bit more on the philosophical aspects of the question also, I feel. But maybe it’s unfair to expect it from a book which is basically scientific in nature."

3,0192805851,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9512361-andrew-langridge,2,"This is a very clear, well-written exposition on a difficult subject, but it is by no means a neutral review of the field as one might expect from a 'very short introduction'. Instead, Susan Blackmore promotes her own thesis, sympathetic to the work of Daniel Dennett, in which a single inner self with subjective experience, holding opinions and acting on decisions is a useful fiction or benign illusion created by the brain. Our ordinary intuition that there is a center to conscious experience is a useful abstraction, but not something grounded in scientific fact. This very partial view probably helps to make the book a pleasurable read, but also makes it a conspicuous target for anti-materialists like me. It is commonly agreed that the idea of subjectivity lies at the heart of the problem of consciousness. What it is ‘like’ for a person to have experiences, make plans or perform actions does not seem fathomable with standard rational techniques. My personal experience of the redness of an object might be completely different to your experience of the same object, and though we use the same terminology to describe redness, we can never really be sure that we have the same thing in mind. It deeply offends a certain class of objectively-minded people that something like this could be so fundamental to our being and yet scientifically unexplainable, and they adopt two major strategies for coping. The first soft-naturalistic strategy is to isolate this peculiar phenomenal experience from the physical world and neural processes. It is allowed to ‘emerge’ from the evolved physical brain but has no causal effects and is only describable in ordinary language or special codes such as ‘memes’. The second approach is to marginalize and diffuse the phenomenal experience, treat it as illusory, and hope that scientific advance will eventually do away with it. This latter hard-naturalistic approach is the one that Blackmore and Dennett promote. They say that most of what we do is unconscious, and when we finally succeed in understanding how all our individual mental capacities such as intelligence, perception, thinking or language function, we will understand consciousness. Blackmore has many arguments to support her case. She describes a neurological condition called agnosia, in which the patient has normal visual ability but appears to lack the experience of seeing. He is able to reach out, pick up and post a letter, but cannot describe the shape of the letter or say what it is. One way of interpreting this is to say that the patient is able to see unconsciously; that agnosia is a disassociation between vision and consciousness. Blackmore says no; dualistic hogwash! There is no conscious ‘central processing unit’ able to 'observe' the visual stream and then act on it. Experiments on brain organization show that there are many different visual streams with distinct functions, and that agnosia is better described as a disassociation between action and perception. Although she argues forcefully in this way against representational dualism, Blackmore fails to recognize that her own interpretation fares little better as an explanation of visual perception. Perception has a qualitative richness, such as the aspect of the letter, that a stream of electrical energy lacks. Moreover, vision is always vision of something, just like pain is always pain somewhere, so how is our 'rapport' with an external letter incorporated in this stream? How is the patient `related appropriately' to the letter if his awareness of it is just a brain response? Awareness of external objects is different from awareness of physical mechanisms. The outside world of objects would be wholly mythical were it not for our primitive understanding of it. Blackmore presents a large quantity of scientific evidence from unusual neurological conditions, split-brains, drug-induced hallucinations and altered mental conditions that she says disabuses us of the notion of a conscious self. Yet, the fact that brain damage makes a difference to what is experienced/perceived, does not account for the experience/perception itself. Moreover, there is ample circumstantial evidence from normal human experience that our intuitive ideas about consciousness are indispensable. We assume that it is proper and useful for us to reflect on our own guilt and motivations and to try to understand other people through patient attention to their beliefs and life histories. Blackmore recommends that we set little store by these touchy-feely aspects of consciousness since they are all part of the illusion. Presumably she also dismisses the idea that this activity of reflecting on ourselves or each other has any inherent value. If science is going to reduce all such mental activities to brain functions there will eventually be no questions about value left to ask. The bleakness of that prospect is startling."

Feel free to read if you are interested!Chapter 1’ CONSCIOUSNESS, WHY THE MYSTERYThe ‘hard problem’ of consciousnessConsciousness is surprisingly difficult to investigate. Right from the start we are in the paradoxical position of seeming to have to use consciousness itself in order to investigate consciousness.A historical starting point would be to look at body_dualism and the ‘mind/body’ problem - the mind and the body seem to be two different kinds of thing with no obvious way to bring them together.On the one hand we have our own experiences - we see the sky, hear music. These ineffable (indescribable) qualities are ‘qualia’, although whether they actually exist or whether the concept is meaningful is in dispute. On the other hand if we believe there really is a physical world that gives rise to the qualia then how do we bridge the gap between them things in the real world whose attributes - weight, elemental make-up - we can measure and our private internal experiences of them? This is the ‘hard problem’ of consciousness.Most cultures, including non-western cultures and most religions, are dualists, believing in two different realms of mental and physical things - the world of the spirit and the material world - although their conception may differ between cultures or religions, Children begin to similarly divide the world from 4 or 5 years old. Buddhism and the Hindu Advaita Vedanta school advocate non-dualist philosophical concepts - see ‘non-dualism’.Dualism, monism (idealism and neutral monism), materialismDescartes proposed that the mind and brain consisted of different substances and proposed that the two substances meet in the pineal gland (Cartesian Dualism).The inability to explain how ‘mind’ and ‘body’ interact has led to most scientists and philosophers rejecting this type of dualism in favor of monism - the idea that there is only one kind of reality; note, monism is a broad philosophical concept but here is being applied narrowly to consciousness. Idealists make the mind fundamental, but are then stuck with the problem of explaining a consistent physical world. Neutral monists reject dualism but can’t make their mind up about the fundamental nature of the world. Summarised by Bertrand Russell: “...James's view is that the raw material out of which the world is built up is not of two sorts, one matter and the other mind, but that it is arranged in different patterns by its inter-relations, and that some arrangements may be called mental, while others may be called physical…"". Not so sure how this is different from some of the ideas mentioned towards the end.Materialism - which is also a form of philosophical monism - takes the position that matter is the fundamental substance in nature and that all things, including mental aspects and consciousness, are results of material interactions. In a materialist context the ‘hard problem’ becomes how to account for conscious experiences or ineffable qualia in a purely physical brain made of material substances.Controversies and the ‘hard problem’ of consciousness David Chalmers coined the term ‘hard problem’ of consciousness (below ‘Hard Problem’) which can be contrasted with the easier problems explaining mental phenomenon such as learning, attention, memory, sleep and similar.Some claim that the ‘hard problem’ does not really exist; it depends on a false conception of consciousness or an underestimation of the ‘easy’ problems (below ‘Easy Problem(s)’). Is it a false intuition that consciousness is different from the combination of perception, memory, attention and similar?Defining consciousnessThomas Nagel used the question of ‘What it is like to be a bat’ to explore what we mean by consciousness. If there is something it is like to be a bat - something for the bat itself - then the bat is conscious. If there nothing like it is to be a bat then it is not conscious. This test can be applied to other items - what is it like to be a mug of tea? An earthworm? An AI program in a computer?Nagel argued that we can never know what it is like to be a bat; he chose bats because their experiences are so different from those of a human, using sonar, hanging around upside down in caves and so on. He is a ‘mysterian’ believing that the Hard Problem is insoluble and we have no way of understanding it in the same way a dog has no way of understanding the newspaper he carries back from the shops.Consciousness and subjectivityNagel reminds us that we must deal with the subjectivity of conscious thought. Solving the Easy Problems will not explain how subjectivity arises from the material world. If you claim consciousness is an illusion to escape explaining such subjectivity you must explain why consciousness appears so strongly to exist.Phenomenality or phenomenal consciousnessPhilosopher Ned Block coined these terms to refer to subjective experience or ‘What it’s like to be a…’. He divides ‘phenomenal consciousness’ (what it is like to be in a certain state) from ‘access consciousness’ (consciousness available for use in thinking or guiding action or speech). As an aside, his Blockhead thought experiment argues that a non-intelligent system could be used to pass the Turing test.Consciousness: an ‘extra ingredient’ or not and the philosophical zombie.A key unresolved divide in consciousness studies is whether consciousness is an ‘extra ingredient’ added on to perception, memory and so on or is it intrinsic to complex biological processes and inseparable from them. Are ‘qualia’ or subjective experiences something in addition to biological processes or intrinsic to them (a materialist or functionalist view).If consciousness is an ‘extra ingredient’ other questions are raised: why do we have it, what is it for, what does it do, why did it evolve?If consciousness arises from natural biological processes then perhaps there is no Hard Problem, there just seems to be one. Any creature with intelligence, perception memory, emotions and so on would necessarily be conscious as well.The idea of the ‘philosophical zombie’ highlights the question of whether or not consciousness is an ‘added ingredient’ to a biological system. Can someone look like, act like and speak exactly like a human but have no inner world of conscious experiences and no ‘qualia’? If philosophical zombies could exist are we just lucky we did evolve a consciousness and didn’t evolve as them? Or perhaps we did? Or perhaps all my friends are philosophical zombies (not sure about my friends, but some of my co-workers certainly are).What does consciousness actually do?We visualise our conscious mind as controlling our bodies and influencing things, but does this really make sense?We may think that we need consciousness is needed to make decisions, but neuroscience shows that this may not be the case. AI systems are also making decisions without being conscious, often better than humans when playing chess or go. Some actions such as playing table tennis, interrupting fast-flowing conversations, seem to be done consciously but in fact they occur too quickly for the conscious mind.Are there some special mental phenomenon that need consciousness such as aesthetic appreciation or creativity? If so how would you show these are done wholly or partly by consciousness itself rather than the workings of a clever brain?Epiphenomenalism is the idea that consciousness is a useless by-product of the mind, but if so why are we worrying about it or even capable of talking about it?Alternatively anyone capable of the various mental processes of the Easy Problem might inevitable end up believing they are conscious even though they are not. They are simply deluded. But if so, how could we be so wrong in thinking it exists? And what does this imply for free will?The theater of the mindA natural way of thinking about consciousness is as a private theater inside my head receiving touches, smells, sounds and so on and using the imagination to conjure up sights and sounds as though seen on a mental screen or heard in an inner ear. These thoughts and sense impressions are the ‘contents’ of my consciousness while ‘I’ am the audience.Daniel Dennett challenges this idea, arguing that while people reject dualist thinking they then let it in again through the back door by imagining a ‘Cartesian theater’ - the notion that there is somewhere in the mind a place or time where everything comes together again and ‘consciousness happens’ or some form of finishing line (a Cartesian finishing line?) which if crossed allows things to become mysteriously ‘conscious’.Dennett rejects the above ideas through seeing the brain as a parallel, distributed processing system with no central headquarters and not place in which an ‘I’ sits making decisions and watching the show as it passes through consciousness. If so how does this feeling of consciousness arise without an inner theatre, no show and no audience?Chapter 2: THE HUMAN BRAINA big brainThe central nervous system comprises the brain and spinal cord; the brain stem connects to the midbrain; behind this the cerebellum and the largest outer layer of the brain the cerebral cortex, divided into four lobes – occipital at the back, temporal above the ears, parietal at the top and frontal. Specific areas have distinct functions: limbic system (instinctive responses, basic emotions), frontal lobe (planning, decision making, self control), hippocampus in the limbic system (laying down new memories), the temporal lobe (storing and retrieving them).The brain seems like a parallel, distributed system with no central organization, so why does it seem to be unified?The unity of consciousnessThe unity of consciousness is consistent with it being a theatre or stream of consciousness. We see the unity of “now”: there are some things in my consciousness while many other things are not (on stage or off). Unity over time: there seems to be continuity of consciousness from one moment to the next. Unity of identity: there seems to be a single and continuing experiences. Is this view correct?The neural correlates of consciousness (the ‘NCC’s)Much of what happens in the brain seems to be outside or inaccessible to consciousness. What does this really mean though+ What is the difference between brain activity that is conscious versus those parts that are not? Where do we find consciousness? One place to start may be identifying when brain activity correlates with conscious experience – NCCs (defined as “the minimum neural mechanism sufficient for any one specific conscious percept”)..Pain can help investigate NCC given a clear subject element and objectively observable pain transmission through chemical changes in the nerves.Note when A and B correlate reliably there are three possible causal explanations: A causes B, B causes A, both A and B are caused by something else or A and B are actually the same phenomena. Do physical changes create consciousness of pain cause NCC? If so we are back to the Hard Problem. Does consciousness of pain cause physical changes – unlikely.Can we observe NCCs by using brain scans to observe when perceptions change of a Necker cube? Maybe – scans show neural activity in the primary visual cortex stays the same but activity in higher areas changes when reporting of changes to perception of the cube. However when ‘no report’ approaches of testing perception are made (e.g. looking at pupil dilation) many of these differences in neural activity disappear.Perhaps the NCCs we observe related to specific perceptions or thoughts and there are no NCCs for consciousness itself.Damaged mindsCertain bran damage can cause patients to lose their sense of on half of the world. They may eat only food on one side of a plate, draw only one side of a picture etc. Italian neurologist Eduardo Bisiach carried out an experiment where he asked such patients to describe entering into the cathedral square in Milan from the north and then from the south. Each time they could only remember one half of the square, but each half was different. In other words, they have retained their memory of the square but were only able to bring it into consciousness under these different circumstances.In patients with Korsakoff’ syndrome their hippocampus is damaged and they cannot create new long term memories - declarative memory is damaged although procedural memory function may remain. Suffers write of how they seem to sometimes suddenly find themselves waking up, similar to how we may feel if we are suddenly conscious of the beauty of a view or by asking ourselves ‘Am I conscious now?’. Are sufferers fully conscious? Or conscious in a different way?Another patient could not recognize or line up shapes, but was able to post a letter through a slot without being conscious of trying to do so. This seems to be due to losing the ability to respond to one of multiple streams of visual input – the ‘dorsal stream’ helps fast visuo-motor control while the ‘ventral stream’ is involved in recognizing objects and perceiving the world.This is consistent with studies of “blindsight’ where patients have damage to the visual centers of the brain and cannot consciously see items but are still able to guess their orientation. Does this prove that qualia exist (due to objective vision without subjective consciousness) or rather that there are multiple routes for visual perception only some of which go through the area that also allows consciousness perception?CONTINUED IN THE COMMENTS"
5,0192805851,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3955069-hrishabh-chaudhary,4,"The Book and MeThe book deals with a very hard problem, which Blackmore puts forward in the very first line of the very first chapter: What is consciousness? A question you might have ruminated in past, in some way, at some point in time, but then you let it go in favor of attending to worldly obligations. My version goes like this:Seventh grade, Biology classMe and my friend were giving a re-read to our favorite chapter ;-) when these words fell upon my ears.Teacher	: a cell is the smallest unit of life… millions… single cell organisms… blah, blah…Me: You mean we are filled with living beings! Do they know they are inside me?Teacher	: No. They don’t have consciousness. Me: How can you be sure?Teacher: Let’s drop this, it is getting absurd.It was getting interesting. I never got an answer, as I said, it is a hard problem. It becomes even harder when you ask - Do we have consciousness? Susan Blackmore believes we don’t and declares it openly in the book, which may put off some readers, but there plenty of theories in here to keep you from falling to one side of the debate. Being a fan of Sam Harris and thus a non-believer in free-will I was much inclined to reject the idea of consciousness, but as pages increased on the left, I was gradually pushed to the center and by the end I didn’t know what to believe.RecommendationRecommended for people who are:1.	Cognizant of the debate, but haven’t read much; this might be a good start.2.	Convinced of existence/non-existence of consciousness after hearing one side.3.

6,0192805851,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2706364-ross-holmes,3,"Three stars for giving me a lot to think about, but, as many other reviews have noted, this book falls pretty far from an ""Introduction"" to the idea of consciousness, and is instead a brief presentation of the evidence for a very particular theory which takes hard materialism as a given and treats consciousness as an illusion. My distaste for how much the author's specific position was taken for granted instead of presented as one view among many was reinforced at the very end when she tacked on Dawkins' memetic theory to attack the idea of religion, which had very little to do with the concept of consciousness and served a solely ideological purpose.I read this book to gain some better language to approach the ""hard problem"" of consciousness, a subject that interests me deeply but which I find confusing to articulate in words, and while it did sharpen my thinking about the matter it also left me feeling that there may not actually be a clear way to explain consciousness. Blackmore's language attempting to refute the concept of consciousness (an interesting thing to do in an ""Introduction"" to it) still implies that there is ""someone"" to be fooled by the illusion of consciousness; she talks about how it is difficult but necessary to get outside the idea of an ""I"" but seems to be unable to do so herself. I am left thinking that ""intuitive"" is too weak a word for the concept of a self-as-observer--if anything, I would call it self-evident.Reading this book was a good experience, but it leaves me only more frustrated by the concept of consciousness than I was when I started, and not in a helpful way. It also leaves me irritated with the author, who seems to have misunderstood the purpose of the Very Short Introduction series."

This book is an easy and worthwhile read. However, the author is firmly in the camp of people stating that the consciousness phenomena is an illusion.

8,0192805851,http://goodreads.com/user/show/12086858-yousif-al-zeera,3,"The book is a decent book to stimulate your curiosity into the “consciousness” subject. It questions more than it answers. The author does well in introducing the different ideas and school of thoughts in this subject. Many concepts are intriguing. If you want definite answers, then this book will not serve your purpose. "
9,0192805851,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1241339-clif,4,"Yes, I am stuck on these wonderful ""very short introduction"" (VSI) books from Oxford University. This one is the perfect follow-up to the one on free will that I recently reviewed.While the free will book is about logic; how do we think about our consciousness and how can we eliminate false ideas about it through reasoning, this book is all about science and the physical brain. The actual parts of the brain are only mentioned a few times but many studies of brain function and the theories of a few modern philosophers form the foundation of the work.It's clear the author is a fan of Daniel Dennett. Since I am too, it didn't surprise me that I found myself agreeing with much of what Susan Blackmore presents.Being purely physical, the case for our possessing something apart from the physical that directs our activity doesn't hold up and no research has ever shown otherwise. That said, the next thing to put aside is the idea that consciousness is localized in a certain part of the brain. Instead, the leading idea is that consciousness is a byproduct of the overall operation of the brain.Evidence shows that our consciousness is not a continuous thing across time. Instead, it appears to be a very momentary, transient thing that attends to a very limited part of what we sense at any given moment. Our sense that we are aware of the full environment around us at once is illusion our brain constructs.Filled with intriguing experimental results, this book offers surprises for any reader. It appears the brain is far out in front of our perceptions as many physical activities, such as playing a game of ping-pong, proceed at speeds far beyond that of our consciousness. The brain plays ping-pong and the ""me"" that we experience is more like a spectator that later claims to have been in charge. And we've all had the experience of driving a car thinking of something else and suddenly coming back to awareness of the driving. Our brain was driving just fine while our mind was elsewhere.As is the intent of the entire VSI book series, the content of Blackmore's work would be a wonderful source of ideas for a classroom and a full bibliography points the way to further exploration. I highly recommend that you make yourself a classroom of one and take on this little gem!"
10,0192805851,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3498889-cheryl,4,"The blurb is misleading. As Blackmore says, this book clarifies some of the ideas that have been proposed, but mainly serves to enhance the confusion. Unless we basically chuck the whole idea that there is such a thing as consciousness.The thing is, this book is a survey of the scientific and philosophical theories about the very definition of consciousness itself, its shape & characteristics & falsifiability, etc., *and* it also addresses altered states of consciousness, the evolution of consciousness (with divergences into animal psychology), and the question of free will. Because, from the author's perspective, it all hangs together (except when impossibilities are revealed and things hang separately... ;), as one can see if one makes the effort to read the whole darn dense packet.It is very concise, which makes it, in a way, difficult to get through... no padding to cushion the impact of each and every word, so to speak. There are notes and index and further reading, too. Blackmore herself has a bigger book on the subject. I think I'm going to stop with my holistic overview here, though, at least for now... and you'll know why if you read my entire review. There's one big takeaway I do get out of it, but I'll save that until the end of these comments, after I've shared a few other worthy tidbits.And there's one big flaw, imo. Nowhere is there mention of a subconscious. The idea of ""attention"" seems to me to be the closest that Blackmore gets, and I don't opine that they're exactly the same thing.So one of the separate tidbits is this: there is a """"sensorimotor theory of vision"" proposed by psychologist Kevin O'Regan and philosopher Alva Noe. They take a fundamentally new approach in which vision is not about building internal representations at all, but is a way of acting in the world. Vision is about mastering the sensorimotor contingencies - that is, knowing how your own actions affect the information you get back from the world... On this view... seeing, attending, and acting all become the same thing.""Also: ""Tests with monkeys have shown no self-recognition, even though they can use mirrors in other ways, such as reaching for things seen only in a reflection.""And an experiment with hens being kept 'battery' gave them the option of using a cage with litter to scratch in, which is their normal preference. But the birds wouldn't push aside a heavy curtain to get to that cage, staying in the default cage with no litter.Or closer to home, unless one becomes proficient at meditation, it is biometrically no more relaxing than sitting in a chair listening to music or reading.More directly to the point of the book, psychologist Daniel Wegner ""suggests that unconscious processes give rise to both thoughts about the action and the action itself. We then wrongly infer that our thoughts cause our actions."" (This idea works pretty well, imo, to explain the fact that our Readiness Potential precedes our awareness of making the choice to act. If you don't know what experiments I'm referring to, read this book or look elsewhere re' Benjamin Libet.)But the bit in the book that, imo, provides for the most productive further thinking, and probably even further research, lies in the redefinition of inner self. Basically, Dennett (and, apparently, Blackmore) accept that there is no such thing. That is, there is no continuing or persistent ""I"" or thing that I am that I also was yesterday (or even a moment ago). It does need to be explained, but it is not a physical object or a process in the brain. It is a story we tell ourselves to make sense of the impressions made upon us and the actions we take. It is a ""centre of narrative gravity,"" ""only multiple parallel processes that give rise to a benign user illusion - a useful fiction."" She concludes the chapter on Self: ""It means taking a radically different view of every experience. It means accepting that there is no one who is having these experiences. It means that accepting every time I seem to exist, this is just a temporary fiction and not the same 'me` who seemed to exist a moment before, or last week, or last year. This is tough, but I think it gets easier with practice.""Believe me, friends, Blackmore is a scientist. Admittedly, she looks at everything a little differently, but it's no woo-woo psychedelic trip or spiritual vision. And this review doesn't cover the whole book, and the whole book doesn't answer any questions. But I'm glad I read (studied) it as much as I did, and I'll be thinking on it. And I think some of you might feel that reading it yourself is at least interesting, if not satisfying. I'm rounding up my rating from 3.5 to 4 (but not worrying about whether I'm doing it of my own free will ;) because it does not encourage me to feel overwhelmed by a desire to add more books to my to-read lists. ;)"
11,0192805851,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5130906-mikael-lind,3,"This book starts off very promisingly. It asks all the interesting questions and presents loads of interesting research and studies on the topics. However, the final chapter is so utterly disappointing that I can't give this book more than three stars. Blackmore presents her own ""solution"" to the problem of consciousness, but in such an unsatisfying way that all the questions she herself presented in the beginning remain unanswered. If our talk of consciousness and subconsciousness are nothing but delusions, how come we can direct our attention towards one thing rather than another? She doesn't even try to answer questions about intentionality, but instead presents her personal preference of meditation as some kind of remedy to all the delusions arising from questions about our consciousness. And even there she commits a fatal error. She writes that with Zen meditation one can ""give rise to a state in which phenomena arise and fall away but without any sense of time or place, and with no one experiencing them."" And this is presented as a solution to dualism! Wow. She fails however to explain who this ""someone"" experiencing the phenomena could fall away if there was no conscious observer in the first place. If Zen meditation can help one seeing beyond the fallacy of a conscious self, what is then this conscious self to all those people who don't practice Zen? In short, Blackmore's ""solution"" is no solution at all but makes us ask all the same questions all over again. A pity for an otherwise interesting book to have such an unsuccessful attempt to a solution in the final chapter."

On the plus side, it is well written, an easy read, and it has a clear and concise description of a lot of what has been done and the state of the art in understanding consciousness. In the end, I went with two stars because I felt this book is fundamentally dishonest, a fatal flaw in an introduction. My problem with this book is that rather than being a review, what the title promises, it considers other theories of consciousness only to dismiss them in favor of the author's theory; this book advocates rather than introduces. I am not sorry I read this book, I have done some reading on this topic already but nonetheless picked up some new information as to where the field is, but then again I read this book on the heels of one of the other authors books, ""The Meme Machine"" and for that reason and because this was not the first book I had read on this subject, I was able to detect its bias and discount it. In balance, I would only recommend this book to someone who is knowledgable in the subject area and who is interested in completeness and is able to read critically."

14,0192805851,http://goodreads.com/user/show/65398513-steve,5,"I obtained and read this book several years ago after going to a public lecture by Susan Blackmore, in my city. She was a lecturer at a nearby university at that time. The lecture and book made a big impact on me, as I’d never really thought about the subject of consciousness, whether it’s possible to study it scientifically and come to any conclusions as to its nature.I remember her talk raised lots of evidence for what it probably isn’t linked to - Dualism. That the conscious mind is separate from our grey matter computing device, the brain. I’d sadly had a close relative who’d had a bad stroke and the brain damage from a stroke can change a person’s nature and personality. How they perceive the world. So I wasn’t under any illusion about that really, but this book firmed up on it for me and showed where studies had taken our knowledge. Unfortunately brain damage and how it affects survivors of the trauma is one important guide to how our grey matter functions. Sad but true, and a number of cases are discussed in the book.As in her talk I don’t remember her coming to a dogmatic conclusion, as there’s still work to be done. Perhaps the evidence she marshals is intended to reinforce her viewpoint, but it seemed persuasive to me. Indeed a fairly recent experiment indicating that the subconscious brain can initiate what we might think is a conscious decision or action fractionally before the conscious brain is aware of it was a bit disturbing.I took from the book the possibility that our conscious brain is a ‘scratchpad’ the brain uses when it needs to learn or review tasks more carefully, given that so much of what we do from body function control through to instinctive reactions is part of our subconscious, and normally hidden from our awareness. How the brain decides what to review is unclear but I personally take the possibility that it is an aspect we may be able train to a degree. Though maybe I’m fooling myself there too! But I’ve always found Doubt a useful tool in work and life, and if that means I take a while to decide on an action at least I feel I’ve reviewed it thoroughly.There seems a clear link to our language abilities too. Indeed, I’d heard elsewhere consciousness defined as the brain talking to itself. Holding that conversation is what we consider as our conscious brain operation, I presume, though I’m sure there’s more than that conversation at play.I found this an educational book. Not a thorough review probably as it is a ‘short introduction’. I had enough evidence tossed at me to realise what a tricky area it is, but nonetheless open to a thorough investigation scientifically.I’d certainly recommend this to anyone interested in questioning or examining how they think. You may or may not agree with her materialistic approach but she raises questions taken from the literature, and not just her opinions, that you’d have to ponder if you have a dualistic view of our brain."
15,0192805851,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3186291-leon-m,4,"In ""Consciousness: A Very Short Introduction"", Susan Blackmore gives the reader just that - a very short introduction to a highly complicated interdisciplinary topic. Considering the sheer impossibility of doing that in a fully satisfying way, Blackmore did quite a good job at it.The book starts of with the basic dichotomy between dualists and monists (mainly materialists these days) and explains why none of these sides have a convincing argument to offer for why their side is true and the other is false: the problem is the bridging of the mysterious gap between objective and subjective experience, the chasm between the outside world and innermost reality. Blackmore continues to examine consciousness from a more psychological perspective, using the results of experiments with patients with damaged brains to come to conclusions about aspects of consciousness, such as the idea that change blindness actually shows that we are much less ""conscious"" than we think. I liked the introduction to bundle theory in her chapter about the self, and especially the idea of a transporter destroying all the atoms and re-creating them at another place: if you would use that teleporting machine, you are definitely a bundle theorist. (This remembered me of Kurzweil naming himself a ""patternist"" and also of Buddhist thought on the matter). The part about conscious will was a general examination of Libet's experiments, and I enjoyed the diagram about the illusion of conscious will.Actually, there are only two points I can criticize about the book: 1) it is just too short (yes, I know: that's not really a criticism of something named ""a very short [...]"", but still!) and 2) the conclusion the author arises at in the end of the book (namely the idea that consciousness is just an illusion) is still at odds with the basic dualist arguments mentioned in the beginning: I can not really blame the author of an introductory text because he is not able to resolve one of the most ancient problems of philosophy, but if she takes such a decided stance on the matter she might as well offer an argument as to how the gap between subjective experience and objective reality might be bridged. Just saying: it's all an illusion does not solve the problem that the illusion seems to be of an entirely different substance than reality. "
16,0192805851,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1360306-joshua-stein,2,"I really enjoy Susan Blackmore. She's a terrific mind and a really great person when it comes to consciousness and philosophy of mind, in particular. I received a free copy of her new introduction (not short, in the least) in the mail, and so I'll probably read that at some point over the summer.As much as I like the Oxford series, this one fell a little short for me. Maybe having a background in a field undermines the purpose of the ""Very Short Introduction"" series, but it doesn't seem to me that it should.I enjoyed the beginning of Blackmore's introduction, but it fell short over the course of the discussion. I wasn't expecting something thorough, so I don't want to give the impression that this was just about my own mistaken expectations. I was expecting Blackmore to present multiple views of consciousness, and she doesn't, really. She presents her own account which, while a good one and fairly interesting, is not the way that an introduction needs to be constructed.It leaves the impression that Blackmore's account of consciousness is a generally accepted account, and it is not. There are some issues, because it is difficult to discern between the facts (as they exist in studies of cognitive science) and the interpretation of the facts in a coherent metaphysics as presented by Blackmore. This, in the context of a book in which Blackmore is presenting her own account of consciousness, is non-problematic, but it is in the context of an introduction.It may prove to be a good introduction for some people, but I have a serious concern with respect to the impact on beginning students, who really need to have a separation between the presentation of data and the interpretations which can be controversial."

The best way to think about consciousness is like trying to see when a fridge's light turns off.

18,0192805851,http://goodreads.com/user/show/34671874,4,"It was very tiring and exhausting book, but I enjoyed it.Regardless that mostly every topic or chapter ends by:“…, but they leave the mystery of consciousness untouched"",last topic starts by:“The confusion we have reached is deep and serious, and I suspect it reveals fundamental flaws in the way we normally think about consciousness. Perhaps we need to throw out the most basic assumptions and start all over again.""So what ?I believe in science and I love philosophy, I love its complication, and this feeling to be high like you can touch the sky, I love its history which is rich in science, but I can’t get this point:The conduction velocity of neuron=neural adequacy for consciousness, and that it implies consciousness must lag far behind the events or the real world! Everything takes time including consciousness, does it mean it is useless to take any action like we have already taken it?!I like Aldous Huxley’s point of view, it is like that our senses hide our perception. Like we have a whole new world within us but we can’t see it ‘cause we are busy observing the outside.I think the only thing that has a definition in this book is that of “illusion”, I wonder if it refers to something else.However, the book is difficult and require someone has background on neuroscience and philosophy.The conclusion of the book is:“All we can say for the moment is that the study of consciousness is nowhere near sufficiently well developed to answer such questions, but at least we can begin to ask them.So the question remains unanswerable, and if a question is unanswerable it may be best to stop asking it.”"

21,0192805851,http://goodreads.com/user/show/63974062-arif-zaman,4,"As the human being, we think about almost infinite number of things. Thinking consists a significant- or, probably the major- portion of our existence. As René Descartes uttered in his much-acclaimed quote ‘I think, therefore I am.’The range of our pondering goes from our next meal to the origin of the universe. Mundane things such as politics-job-latest tv show-Donald Trump or Elon Mask's latest tweets... are sometimes easy cogitations to get by. However, when it comes to thinking about 'thinking' itself -or, thinking: our own self (if there is any!) is thinking, or about the ineffable subjective experiences of the fact of our awareness by the mind of itself and the world- things are at its height of complexities. As the author of this book, Susan Blackmore articulates it in the very first paragraph ''We seem either to have to use consciousness to investigate itself, which is a slightly weird idea, or to have to extricate ourselves from the very thing we want to study'' To put it more simply, the problem of investigating what is consciousness is more like some chunks of atoms trying to understand how their(!) subjective experiences of being themselves- acting themselves-feeling themselves rises from some interactions between another pile of atoms.So far, in science, there is a clear barrier between subjectivity and objectivity; and here is why this problem is the hardest and most unique of all. Composing of purely material substances such as our body, brain, neurons: how can they provide us with the yawning chasm, or 'fathomless abyss', between the physical and mental worlds? Starting with describing and defining how and why this is an unsolved and apparently' mysterious problem', Susan Blackmore then provide a brief account of the notable theories and viewpoints of renowned philosophers and scientists regarding the problem. No wonder from grand unifying theories to quantum mechanical theories and even spiritual or metaphysical theories have tried to explain it. However, until now, none of them could demystify the 'hard problem' of consciousness. Next, the author approaches to counter the problem from her own point of view, initiating with a description of the brain's neurophysiological characteristics and related experiments(most notably Libet's experiment: which demonstrates, consciousness of an experience can lag behind the actual event in the real world, such as -if we intend to flex our wrist- the action of flexing might have started before even thinking about it!!) and reaches into a point where she begins to question how the nature of 'feeling our own consciousness may be an illusion' and -how consciousness seems to us- while it might not be this way, in reality;leading to the questioning of the idea: if there is really something called 'me!' eventually also raising intriguing questions about our free will.Then, she meditates about the altered states of consciousness and why this might be an intriguing approach to solve the problem, concluding with the evolutionary approach to understanding consciousness in animals. As a brief introduction, she does her job very well apart from being slightly biased (as far as I can understand from my poor knowledge on this matter) toward some specific theories such as ofDaniel Dennett There were some intriguing and exemplary illustrations as well as with the use of proper humour. You got to think twice, when she says 'Trying to find out the answer of the question, Am I conscious now, is like trying to open the door quickly enough to see if the light is always on.' If you felt, consciousness is a banal topic to ponder over (maybe because of my tedious and poor write up on this book- for which I am completely liable.) please... please pick up a mirror, take some time looking at your image, and ask yourself in the mirror-who am I? Am I conscious now? Am I living? What is this? When is now? I bet, if you can feel the absurdity of the whole thing, your life will never be the same."

23,0192805851,http://goodreads.com/user/show/29100314-dschreiber,3,"In her clear and concise monograph, Consciousness : a very short introduction, psychologist Susan J. Blackmore outlines the scientific findings on consciousness. The experiments and case studies she presents are entertaining and thought-provoking, as they seek evidence in dreaming, synaesthesia, multiple personalities, ouijah boards, out-of-body and near-death experiences, animal consciousness, and so on. Even ordinary experiences seem to yield insights. For example, since people can commute to or from work for half an hour or more and have no memory of doing it, they must have somehow been conscious to navigate and obey traffic signals. Yet it’s not a normal sort of consciousness that leaves no trace in memory immediately afterwards. In the 1960s one of the most startling discoveries was made when brains were scanned of subjects performing very simple physical operations, such as moving an arm. Parts of the brain associated with preparing for physical movement were found to be activated a full half-second before the conscious subject thought they had decided to move the arm. This raised grave doubts as to whether we are really agents of our own actions, whether the self exists, and whether we have free will.Dubious ConclusionsPhilosophical questions are ubiquitous in Blackmore’s account. Again and again as she describes what science says about consciousness, she bumps into the problem of explaining the connection between what scientists observe from the outside and what we as individuals experience from the inside, and she admits repeatedly that she cannot give an answer. She uncovers indications that seem to undermine the common sense view but never quite gets to proofs. To cover the gap she invokes future discoveries—coming ”soon,” she says—when our technologies will be more advanced. Perhaps we will even discover the elusive “neural correlates of consciousness.” In the meantime, however, Blackmore does not bind herself to the evidence at hand, instead deeming the preliminary indications to be, likely, the whole truth. This leads to some peculiar theses. The mind, she believes, that is, the self, the entire mental world, is an illusion, and we ought to live dutifully keeping in mind that it is all an illusion: “This is tough, but I think it gets easier with practice,” she says, without offering any tips on how it is to be done. Free will is also an illusion, according to Blackmore, but, since studies have shown that rejecting belief in free will increases one’s tendency to depression, we should live “as if” we believe in free will. Her book is an excellent introduction to the science of consciousness, but when it addresses ancient philosophical questions, it founders badly."
24,0192805851,http://goodreads.com/user/show/47021487-jose-moa,4,"As the author say the human brain is possibly the most complex thing of the observable universe,with a billion neurones and many billions of conections in a gigantic neural network.The hard problem is understand the relation of a intangible cosciousness and self. with a pure material brain.This is a extremely complex subject to be developed in a short introductory book as this,and the author makes his best at exposing the several competing theories and curious facts of our sensorial experiences , as hemifield neglect,blindsight,the cutaneous rabbit,change blidness and so on.After exposing te Dennet critic of the Cartesian theatre model of rhe mind, as the brain makes process of information in parallel and there is not a central headquarter, he introduces the memes theory where the self could be a memeplex,a group of memes that thrive togheder ,and is strenghtened every time the word I is used,that fuel the false idea of a persistent inner self who has conscious experiences.Thebook also makes a scheme of the global worspace theory by Baars,and explores the posibility of a conscious mid in animals with the crucial mirror experimentFinally in the author words ""Consciousness,then is a grand delusion.It arises trhough asking such questions as Am I conscious now? or What am I conscious of now?.In that moment of questioning,an answer is concocted :a now,a stream of experiences and a self who observes it all appear together and a moment later they are gone.Next time you ask,a new self and a new world is concocted,bakwards from memory.Al this are theories but the hard problem is very far to be solved.

25,0192805851,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7855578-lena,1,"I just finished this book about 90 seconds ago, and flung it hard across the room.Which came first-- the onset of readiness potential, or the will to throw it?In all fairness, I cannot fully explain at this moment why it felt like Susan Blackmore was attempting to specifically hurt me in particular with her arguments. Maybe I will revisit my feelings at a later date. But I'd just like to say that it makes no sense to claim that duality is an illusion and simultaneously posit that all consciousness itself is an illusion. She kept harping on this one particular point: that no theories could explain why consciousness is subjective, and therefore they should all be thrown out the window and we should give up on trying to explain consciousness, because it doesn't really exist. That is the laziest thesis I've ever heard in my life. If duality is illusory, then why would it matter that consciousness is subjective? It makes sense to me that all creatures would have a subjective experience, because we are all observing physical phenomena from different angles. Collectively, we are all observers of reality, part of a network of consciousnesses, and our observations of this universe are subjective because we exist relative to one another in space and time. I don't understand why she thinks that is an impossible idea to wrap one's head around. Like... I can't perceive my cat's reality because my brain is not her brain. Just because everyone else's consciousness is private and relative doesn't mean none of it is real at all. I can get down with the idea that there is no such thing as a fixed and unchanging self / personality. I cannot accept the idea that consciousness itself isn't the natural consequence of life. This book is basically mentioning a lot of cool theories other people have had, and then disparaging them because, like, ~what if the blue I see isn't the blue you see, duuuude?~I think I'd be happier reading about those theories of quantum consciousness she mentioned. Perhaps that is where I will head the next time I feel like revisiting this topic. But for right now, I feel like licking the psychic wounds this book caused me. I feel genuinely angry! Wow!"

Either you must actually solve the hard problem and explain how subjectivity arises from the material world, or alternatively, if you claim that consciousness is identical to those physical processes, or is an illusion or even that it does not exist at all, you must explain why it appears so strongly to exist.- Is consciousness an extra ingredient that we humans have in addition to our abilities of perceiving, thinking, and feeling, or is it an intrinsic and inseparable part of being a creature that can perceive and think and feel? - As Darwin realized, a simple reiterativeprocess can create the most intricate and functional designsapparently out of nowhere. It works like this – start withsomething; make lots of copies of it with slight variations; selectjust one of these; and then repeat the process. That’s all.The power lies with the effect of selection. Darwin began byexplaining artificial selection, in which people choose to breed fromsome animals and not others and in this way increase desirablecharacteristics, but he realized that the same process must operatewith the blind processes of natural selection. That is, in a world withinsufficient food, space, light, and air to go round, inevitably somecreatures will do better than others, and whatever it was that helpedthem in the competition for survival will be passed on to theiroffspring, and so the process continues. As it does, characteristicssuch as eyes, wings, hair, and teeth all appear and evolve. These arethe adaptations that helped the animals to survive, and will bepassed on if they breed.Is consciousness an adaptation? It might seem that it must be,because maladaptive characteristics are soon weeded out byselection, but there are two other main possibilities: consciousnessmight be a useless by-product, or it might be an inseparablecomponent of something else that is adaptive.- Chimpanzees naturally beg for food from humans and from eachother. So a scientist tested them under some rather odd conditions.In one experiment, two experimenters offered food to thechimpanzees, one with a blindfold over her eyes and one withanother over her mouth. This made no difference to thechimpanzees, they begged equally to both. They even begged just asenthusiastically to an experimenter with a bucket over her head. Itseems they have no idea that it is pointless to beg from someonewho cannot see you. The conclusion for now is that chimpanzees donot have a theory of mind, but even this is still uncertain, and theimplications for animal consciousness are more uncertain still.One final dividing line is language, and here humans seem to beunique. It is important here to distinguish between true languageand other forms of communication. - Are dreams experiences?There is no generally accepted theory of dreams, and somevery odd facts to be explained. For example, on waking up,we remember having had dreams of which we were not consciousat the time. While experiments suggest that dreams goalong in real time, many anecdotes describe dreams thatwere concocted at the moment of waking up. The mostfamous is that of the French physician Alfred Maury(1817–1892), who dreamed of being dragged through theFrench Revolution to the guillotine only to wake up with thebed head falling on his neck.One theory allows both these to be true. During REM sleepnumerous brain processes go on in parallel, and none iseither ‘in’ or ‘out’ of consciousness. On waking up, any numberof stories can be concocted backwards by selecting one ofmany possible threads through the multiple scraps of memorythat remain. The chosen story is only one of many suchstories that might have been selected. There is no actualdream; no story that really happened ‘in consciousness’. Onthis ‘retro-selection’ theory, dreams are not streams ofexperiences passing through the sleeping mind. "

She is therefore ideally qualified to write this ""very short introduction"" to consciousness. In the space of 134 pages, her book covers a lot of ground, looking at past and present philosophical and scientific approaches to understanding consciousness, a topic that also encompasses the concepts of free will and ""self"" (who am I?). As the book progresses, for the most part Blackmore doesn't strongly support any particular lines, but rather she summarises a viewpoint and then points out its inadequacies. Only towards the very end of the book does Blackmore place herself squarely in the illusionism school of consciousness. This is not to say that consciousness doesn't exist but rather that it is not what it seems. She argues that consciousness exists when we think about it but not the rest of the time, so despite what we may believe we do not have a continuous stream of conscious experiences but instead fleeting events that give a false impression of continuity. I'm not qualified to give an opinion on whether this theory is right or wrong (and it is, apparently, a commonly held theory), but it does seem to leave a lot of questions unanswered. The bottom line is that consciousness is a phenomenon about which there is no scientific consensus and maybe it is something that can never be fully explained. In fact, even the definition of consciousness is open to debate so it's easy to appreciate how difficult it is to uncover what gives rise to it.In the course of the book, Blackmore describes many thought-provoking observations and experiments relating to consciousness. For example, in the chapter on free will she recounts work by Benjamin Libet in the 1980s that explored what initiates a deliberate physical action, such as deciding to flex one's wrist. Bizarrely, Libet found that the brain processed the planning of the flexing 350 milliseconds before the subject had the conscious desire to move. In other words, before someone decides to carry out some physical movement by means of free will, the brain has already initiated the process. Consciousness, as we perceive it, thus lags behind the unconscious activity undertaken by the brain. Blackmore claims that Libet's findings are still argued about to this day, although his results have been replicated in other experiments using different measuring systems. In the final two chapters she presents fascinating material on states of altered consciousness and the evolution of consciousness. In the chapter of altered states, she discusses dreams, out-of-body experiences, near-death experiences, psychoactive drugs and meditation, while in the chapter on evolution she focuses on whether non-human animals or plants (or anything, for that matter!) can experience consciousness and how it might have evolved in humans and what advantages it might give us.All-in-all, this book presents an interesting introduction to a very difficult subject. Some parts I found difficult to follow but largely this was due to the field of consciousness (like any other area of science) having its own jargon which can pose an entry barrier to outsiders. On the whole, though, it was an enjoyable and entertaining read."

What followed has had all the hallmark elements of things I hate, pointless gamification, totally arbitrary numerical targets with empty significance, commodification of knowledge, and prioritization of destination over journeys. This month has been a joke. This is the 3rd 100-page book I've gone after under the guise of seeking a small wide-ranging introduction that lays a sort of framework for a broader topic to be explored in depth based on parts of the framework that draw specific interest. Poppycock. I have reached 10 books this month because of said enlightened framework-building. And when this month is spake about later, it shall be known for the month of 10 books, and not for the month of roadmap creation. More sympathetically, I find increasing merit in this new approach of seeking books to answer specific questions, especially in the context of research for my writing. This one I ventured into looking for a more educated view of what I am developing to be Depths Of Perception, working title. It didn't work for this, not counting the very first point of below highlights, but I did respect the process and find promise in it. Next stop, Art Of Seduction.Highlights3 things to be explained about consciousness: a. content, why some things are conscious others are unconscious; b. flow of time, how there is consistency across time, c. subject, who is this I by whom conscious content is experienced. Subjective antedating: why conscious thought comes a few milliseconds after the stimulus, but backdated to all feel continuous. Why are some neuronal firing leading to conscious thought, but others fall under the radar. Karl Popper suggested a non-physical mind operating at synaptic level. Others have suggested metaphors like the theater workspace with other thoughts in the periphery. Does phenomena like blindsight show that consciousness is removed from material plane, that we still fully experience the stimuli when our ability to be conscious of them is removed? Maybe not, because stimuli have multiple pathways. Dennett disagrees that a zombie is even possible, that there could be perfect replication of behaviors without the lights being on upstairs2 traditional ways to address consciousness have been dualists suggesting mind-brain materialism in the vein of Descartes, and those who use fanciful physics like quantum supercomputer microtubules in coherence like Penrose, or of course that gift that keeps on giving, double-slit experiment.Ageing quicker than usual creates cognitive dissonance? That this is not the same person?Aristotle thought the brain was for cooling the bloodKarl Lashley: All thought is unconscious. Think of an animal, you think of cat. The process of thinking of the cat was unconscious, can you explain it?"
35,0192805851,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11059034-chris-leo,4,"A very short introduction to arguably the most mysterious property of existence: consciousness. Consciousness is one of those vague concepts you intuitively know but paradoxically find ineffable – much like love, truth, and beauty…pretty much all the important stuff that puzzles us.Consciousness does a great job in summarising how understanding of the subject has evolved over time and how we have reached our state of contemporary thinking. The beginning chapters in particular do a wonderful job of outlining the key disagreements and problems which litter this field of study.We start with a description of the much maligned ‘hard problem of consciousness’, which may be posited as: observable brain functions do not adequately explain qualia (subjective experience). According to Chalmers, we are beginning to understand the ‘easy’ problems of consciousness such as memory and attention yet this does not account for the phenomenological process of thought. To reinforce this idea we are given the hypothetical scenario of a ‘philosophical zombie’ who outwardly displays normal behavioural patterns but is completely bereft of an inner world. Is such a creature possible? Well, rather rudely, the author states that this idea is ”daft without giving so much as a coherent argument as to why. This unfortunately marks a trend of heavy-handed editorial opinion which we’ll come back to later.After this we move on to what it is like to be something; that is, what it’s like to be a thing possessing consciousness. A somewhat confusing idea popularised by Thomas Nagel, it asserts that we’ll never entirely know what it’s like to be a bat, as a bat is experiencing a unique state of consciousness that we could not possible duplicate. This reminded me, but wasn’t referenced in the text, of Wittgenstein’s brilliant quip ”if a lion could speak, we wouldn’t be able to understand him”. We soon skip to the idea of consciousness as a unifying experiencing; we’re presented with the notion of a ‘Cartesian Theatre’ of the mind. This, according to the author, antiquated view of consciousness believes that we are somehow independently observing our thoughts, actions and behaviours as if we were watching some movie in a theatre. The next section of the book deals primarily with brain dysfunction, attempting to extrapolate from these cases insight into how consciousness results. Individuals with Hemifield neglect have experienced some kind of brain trauma such as a stroke, the consequence of which causes them to lose half of their visual field. These people aren’t blind; they simple ignore the left or right side of their vision as if it wasn’t there. The author uses these examples to highlight the fact that consciousness is dependent on vision and so brain processes give rise to conscious recognition and thus consciousness. This is a weak argument as it does not account for the many blind people whom I’m adamant (but can’t prove) are walking around thinking about stuff; in many cases they can even ‘see’ things when they enlist the aid of their other senses. Various other instances of brain abnormalities are given to support this idea that consciousness can be explained away yet they fall into the above mode of reductionist thinking.We’re in the middle of the book now, detailing our conception of self and free will. The author touches on the different religious traditions which have emphasised the self as a sacred entity and also the more philosophical work of men such as Descartes who theorised that the self is independent of the brain. The section then espouses the more modern theories of consciousness like ‘Global Workspace’ theory which to my mind is needlessly complex and ultimately explains nothing. Modern theories of consciousness appear to explain consciousness as a range of input/out processes with the magic ‘consciousness’ occurring in the middle bit. This is meant to serve as a contrast to the more ‘primitive’ notions of self we previously had but if anything it merely shows how the ‘hard problem’ is being ignored. The book begins to wrap up nicely with a discussion on free will and altered states of consciousness. The idea that we do not possess free will is an incredibly daunting, scary thought and yet modern scientific thinking is beginning to show that this is precisely the case. This kind of deterministic outlook is given credence as we’re shown scientific studies which have measured response times between a thought occurring within the brain and the conscious perception of that thought. All of these studies involve some kind of invasive brain procedure whereby an electrode is inserted into the brain and the participant is then required to respond verbally as to when they became aware of an action or thought. This is fraught with philosophical problems of course because conscious recognition is dependent on reports by the participant being correct; to consider this we must assume that their timing and origin of thought is completely accurate. A massive assumption.The chapter on altered states of consciousness was comparatively light and pithy and seemed a bit out of step with the rest of the piece. Humans have been imbibing various chemicals to alter their consciousness throughout history, through shamanic rituals involving Psilocybin to getting pissed in the Red Lion on a Friday night. That’s all this chapter had to say really – the author’s condoning of drug is easily recognisable, as subtlety of opinion isn’t her strong suit.The final chapter discusses how consciousness came to be in the first place; why did we evolve this strange appendage we call the mind? Arguing that consciousness is an adaption seems counter-intuitive as many animals function perfectly well without it. Positing that humans possess consciousness because we’re a social species and require extensive theory of mind does not explain its emergence nor its uniqueness. The book ends then on quite a sour note by clearly stating what it has hinted out at along: consciousness is just a bunch of brain processes in unison; your consciousness is a complete illusion. You’re not real, soz.It’s a kind of emotionally revolting conclusions as if there’s anything that we feel definite about, it’s that we exist. Rationally, this hard-line materialistic view of the mind still does nothing to explain subjective experience, it simply dismisses it. This does not solve the problem! To say there is no problem does not explain how qualia – subjective experiences of our world – are perceived and seem so real to us; in fact, they feel as if they are the only certainty we can cling to! Many of the conclusions in this book may leave you feeling a little uneasy – are you a biological automaton incapable of free will? Are you just a bunch of temporary neurons pinging about?If science does one day discover that this is the case, then to quote the Archbishop of Canterbury Rowan Williams in his recent and excellent debate with Richard Dawkins:”If consciousness is an illusion…what isn’t?”Even Dawkers solemnly nodded at that one. "
36,0192805851,http://goodreads.com/user/show/70703532-nick,3,"Reading a few short books on consciousness to get an overview of what is on the market and what can be recommended to students as a short booster, so this will be the first of several similar reviews.This is the first book from the Very Short Introduction series that I've read, and it's and enormous series, so I have no idea of the style here is representative, but my initial impression is that Blakemore has a particularly uncommon view on the nature of consciousness (not an incorrect view, but certainly not representative of the wide range of neurosciencists and psychologists) which may give a skewed view as to the support for various views to a newcomer. It is also fairly biased, though as a disclaimer I agree with most of her view and biases so I am perhaps biased about these biases, and although she certainly addresses and highlights theories and theorists with whom she disagrees, the structure of the book makes it feel like we are acquiring knowledge and progressing through theories and arriving at her view, but we do so with little interrogation of the biases and shaky reasoning her stance relies on. This would admittedly be a difficult task to achieve in such a short book, which is why I think maybe it's a bad thing to attempt.The book is generally well written with descriptions of classic experiments, philosophies and controversies, though I would prefer such discussions to be more open ended in such a book with clear direction to further reading.I found the last chapter or so on altered states quite a lot worse than the rest of the book, perhaps it was tacked on later with little effort, but the section of drug induced altered states in particular reading like most had been copy and pasted from Wikipedia rather than a sincere representation of the illuminating questions of consciousness posed by the field of neuropsychopharmacology.So overall quite good but perhaps too biased to serve as a useful introduction to the subject, it certainly assumes a great deal of understanding of consciousness considering that there currently of no science of consciousness, only the scientific study of consciousness, and that study is extremely nascent."

Blackmore has a knack for framing her discussion by starting with strange aspects of consciousness that we can all identify with from our daily experience, such as our sneaking suspicion that those around us might be zombies, or wondering whether the smell of coffee is the same to me as it is to others. She provides the most important theories regarding the issues under discussion, drawing from philosophy and cognitive science, then clearly states her own conclusions regarding which theory is most convincing. The book is very well-organized, focused around the “hard problem” regarding consciousness, meaning how the material brain creates it. A common shortcoming of introductory accounts of consciousness is an over-reliance on an often-regurgitated set of case studies that many authors dutifully recite without following up on the implications. This book avoids that mistake. Blackmore is careful to make sure the reader is always aware of the larger significance of the discussion. I found the final chapter especially exciting, where she decisively refutes the intuitive delusions that (1) selfhood perseveres consistently over time, and (2) that consciousness is a stream of experience."

Does it exist anyway?Contrary to our intuition, consciousness doesn't seem to be responsible for our behaviour. Our ""conscious will"" often lag behind our actions. Even our sense of self is dubious, considering the fact that we can't observe our conscious state when we are not thinking about consciousness. What about dreams and drugs? Can I say it's me who's dreaming? Is an altered consciousness my consciousness?From materialists' view, consciousness is not something that exists independent from our thoughts or other cognitive abilities. Or maybe, consciousness doesn't exist at all, at least not in a way we intuitively think of it.We can't trust our feeling of consciousness, free will or ""self"", as we are always deceived by illusions.The author's view is that consciousness is a great delusion. We ask ourselves if we are conscious, and as a result we get the wrong idea that we are always conscious and there is a single subject (me) that experiences all the events and thoughts.But there's no evidence. It just seems as if I'm always me.The author speculates Zen meditation could lead us to the enlightenment, making us free from the delusion and letting us see the real world (which I doubt)."

As others have pointed out the author has her own view that she builds on throughout the book. I'm inclined to go with her materialist view but due to the methodological problem so measuring consciousness with the brain essentially, there still seems to be Descartes  evil demon problem , even if it's unlikely. Even so, I think I'm rather fine with my executive position over this brain with all it's daydreams. I guess another way of looking at consciousness is in the 3rd person, if people did that more maybe some people wouldn't be so hard on themselves. If we treat ourselves as we treat others will all the usual encouragement and the critiques, it may give an insight into how much free will one has and when one should look for help and support to overcome one's own limitations. (That was kind of off topic but some of the reviews here were depressing so that was some fluff to ground some people).  I'll definitely look further into this topic."

The book is good at attacking ideas but poor in offering solutions to what is admittedly a difficult problem of answering “what is consciousness?” and all the corollary questions alongside it. In my view, the author depends too much on scientific views—namely experiments of very limited insight—and not enough on philosophical positions, which can help illuminate ideas that are not (yet?) testable by science. After all, only hypotheses that are testable are by definition within the realm of science. That leaves philosophy as an additional tool, one that is too often neglected by the author.
