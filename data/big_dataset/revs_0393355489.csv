0,0393355489,http://goodreads.com/user/show/175635-trevor,5,"I’ve enjoyed all three of the books by Fine I’ve read – but particularly Delusions of Gender, which was and is one of the best books on gender I’ve ever read. This book won an award for the best science book of 2017. I’ve so far bought it for 3 people – two of which have been my daughters. Delusions of Gender is a book that considers how differences in male and female brains help to explain the all too obvious differences between the sexes. And it concludes that much of this brain science is grossly overstated or simply doesn’t prove any of these supposed differences at all. What that book does for the brain, this one does for hormones. The bottom line here is that there just isn’t all that much difference between men and women. It’s annoying, I know, but there certainly isn’t nearly enough difference between us to need us to have fundamentally different brains or bodies seething (or probably bubbling over, if I’m going to keep my metaphors consistent) with pink or blue hormones. Some of the humour in this book is a little out of place (in the sense that it isn’t all that funny) but otherwise this book is hard to put down. And I really would prefer it if this book never needed to be written – you see, it would be great to believe that science is the kind of hypothesis testing, self-regulating, rational, show-me-the-evidence type of endeavour that it loves to claim itself to be. The problem is that when it comes to gender, science seems to ignore ‘the evidence’ and to run instead with ‘common-sense’. And common-sense says that the sexes are a bit like day and night, yin and yang, or an action movie vs a romantic comedy. The problem is that as soon as you poke the black bag of common-sense about gender with the pointy stick of empirical evidence it turns out that you can’t help noticing common-sense smells decidedly iffy. A repeated theme here is the notion that testosterone makes men the world’s great risk takers. She spends much of the book showing that this is only true if we define male risk taking in ways that seem edger than the risks that women take – but that really, in many contexts women are equal to, if not greater risk takers, than men. And given the stats on men bashing or killing women, the crown for ‘world’s greatest risk-taker’ really doesn’t nearly so obviously go to men here. I’m not sure now if I read it in this book or not now, but as some guy said somewhere, when I go out on a date the worst that can happen is he has a boring conversation over a crap meal, whereas a bad date for a woman might involve being raped and murdered.That is one of the things I particularly like about Fine – she presents an example that seems to utterly confirm our biases and be supported by our experience too, and then she shows how we have in fact been affected by our stereotypical visions of the roles of the sexes or by our culture’s presumptions. When I rule the world both of her books on gender will be made compulsory reading. And not just because they help us understand how gender science is often rubbish – but also because they help us see how easy it is for otherwise intelligent people to ‘just know’ something must be right and to then fool themselves over and over again to confirm what they just know."
1,0393355489,http://goodreads.com/user/show/53165-warwick,3,"This is a book that argues against the traditionalist idea that basic biology means men are from Mars, women are from Venus, and never the twain shall meet. The different behavioural traits and social outcomes that men and women have are mostly down to social structures, Fine believes, not hormones or neurochemistry; in particular, testosterone is not some kind of magic substance that makes men stereotypically ‘masculine’, except for all the physical ways in which it definitely does. But, Fine argues, ‘potentially’, the fact that it has clear physical effects ‘may’ not mean that it's responsible for psychological effects as well.If I sound a little cynical, it's because I went into this book hoping that it would convince me that gender differences have nothing to do with biology and that social inequities can all be removed by social means. I would love to believe this is the case, but I don't think this will be the book to put my niggling doubts to rest. So although I really enjoyed reading it – Cordelia Fine writes brilliantly, and made me laugh out loud several times – I am struggling with how good her arguments really were.Most of the problems seemed to come under the two headings of straw-manning and begging the question. Her arguments are levelled at an imagined opponent – a supporter of the ‘testosterone rex’ hypothesis – whose gender essentialism is so extreme as to be scarcely realistic. She argues (convincingly!) that ‘there isn't a sharp line between the sexes’, but I don't think most ‘bio-essentialists’ think there is a sharp line – they think that there's a difference, with considerable overlap, between averages in the two sexes which is attributable to biological causes. This turns out to be basically what Fine thinks as well, so I was left wondering why it was all being presented as such an iconoclastic approach.For instance, she argues that ‘neither promiscuity nor competition are necessarily the preserve’ of men only, apparently because ‘testosterone rex’ theory would predict women as faithful, uncompetitive partners. In fact, though, female ‘promiscuity’ is predicted by loads of evolutionary-biological theories – prehistoric polyandry is a central tenet of Barash's Out of Eden, for example. On the subject of status symbols, Fine likewise argues that ‘Resources and rank matter for females’ as though this is supposed to debunk anything – surely the image of women competing amongst themselves for status and ‘reproductive success’ is one of the hoariest stereotypes going?So far so nit-picky, but things get weirder. Discussing the hypothesis that neural activity and behavioural patterns can be neatly divided into male and female, Fine concludes thatdifferences between males and females may not “add up” in a consistent way to create two kinds of human nature; but rather, as with sex differences in the brain, create “mosaics” of personality traits, attitudes, interests, and behaviours, some more common in males than in females, others more common in females than in males.OK…so in other words, there are ‘personality traits, attitudes, interests, and behaviours’ that on average are gendered. Isn't this the exact opposite of her thesis?It's not the only time her arguments seem to work against her conclusions. Looking into a study on financial risk-taking, which tested betting inclinations among two tribal groups in Asia, she summarises the results:Although in both societies the females bet less than the men, the gap was considerably smaller in the matrilineal Mosuo.OK…so in other words, even in a matrilineal society, women are less inclined to financial risk than men? Again, this seems to say the opposite of what she wants it to say. Then later, on the subject of ‘brain sex’:One way to think of it is like this: a neuroscientist certainly might be able to correctly guess your sex from your brain, but she wouldn't be able to guess the structure of your brain from your sex.OK…so in other words, neuroscientists can tell your sex from your brain!? That's actually news to me! This was one of those times – and there were several in the book – where I somehow came away from Fine's arguments with more credence in the opposing view than I had had going in. There is something very strange going on here; it's like her tone is saying one thing, but her actual words are saying something different.Perhaps even more problematic are those occasions where, from my point of view, it seemed that she was missing the argument altogether. The most glaring of these came early in the book when she discussed the classic Clark and Hatfield study of 1989, in which women solicited a one-night stand from male strangers and men solicited a one-night stand from female strangers on a college campus. Men turned down about a third of their offers, and women turned down 100 percent of theirs.Fine's concern, when assessing these results, is to downplay any suggestion that the disparity comes from hormonal or biological first causes. So she makes the (I would have thought obvious) point that, far from revealing differences in libido, ‘what this study is actually primarily showing is women's lack of interest in being murdered, raped, robbed, or inflaming the interests of a potential stalker’. And…that's it. That's the full extent of her dismissal.I read this bit almost open-mouthed. Surely the whole point is – WHY are men more likely than women to be murderers or rapists? Isn't that violence exactly the issue that a book about testosterone should be trying to grapple with? Far from killing off the biological argument, she's just kicking the can further down the road. It's frustrating, because in cultures with a lot of violence and cultures with very little violence, we see the same pattern: proportionally, across space, culture and time, ninety-nine percent of it involves men being violent to other men. Not only does this book fail to explain this, it fails even to address it.Whether or not testosterone itself has any responsibility is an open question (I conclude, after finishing this book). Fine thinks social factors are much more important, which perhaps they are, although, again, many of the studies she cites seem to say the opposite. I must admit, living as I now do in the countryside, it's hard for me to square her approach with such practicalities as the way farmers routinely castrate cattle and pigs to control docility. If gendered behaviour like aggression and competitiveness were social constructs, this would seem to be unnecessary. (I note here that one usual objection to evo-psych theories – i.e. that animal behaviour has no bearing on human behaviour – is not open to Fine, since she herself bases many of her gender-busting arguments on the behaviour of cichlid fish and stick insects.)The thing is, despite this litany of objections, I do agree with what Fine is saying overall, which is that social norms are hugely important in determining how men and women behave and how they ‘perform’ in society. Social structures matter, and we can make real differences in equality by challenging them. Nevertheless, if any of the observed differences in, say, workplace representation, do come down to biology, then, as she puts it, ‘equality of opportunity will never lead to equality of outcome’.At this juncture, her response shifts to question – and perhaps not without reason – the motivations of those who insist on stressing this point.I understand that attempts to identify the psychological factors that underlie sex inequalities in the workplace are well-meaning. And, of course, we shouldn't shy away from naming (supposedly) politically unpalatable causes of those inequalities. But when you consider the women who enter and persist in highly competitive and risky occupations like surgery and policing—despite the odds stacked against them by largely unfettered sex discrimination and harassment—casual scholarly suggestions that women are relatively few in number, particularly in the higher echelons, because they're less geared to compete in the workplace, start to seem almost offensive.I think she makes this point very well and it has to be taken seriously. Arguments about biological differences cannot be allowed to shade into excuses for fixable inequality or shitty behaviour. And we know that gender essentialism is bad for society – people who believe in it are more likely to enforce gender stereotypes, be lenient on sex crimes, and a raft of other depressing things. The problem is, none of that means they're wrong, and what I wanted from this book was a reason to tell these people that they are unequivocally wrong. The paragraph above is not a scientific argument at all, it's special pleading. She's basically saying, ‘we shouldn't shy away from unpalatable arguments, but this argument is unpalatable and we should shy away from it.’ It bothers me, not because I wish to ring-fence some biological gender-essentialism, but precisely the reverse – because I would love to be able to dismiss such arguments with authority. This book does not give you that authority.What it does give you, buttressed by a lot of speculation and well-deployed sarcasm, is a nuanced version of the argument that both nature and nurture have a part to play. Perhaps this is news to some hardline bio-essentialists, but on the whole it seems – dare I say it – a little bland for someone presenting themselves as slaying the T-rex of received opinion. Far from T-rex going extinct, on the evidence of this book it's just…evolved into some kind of dispiriting bird.Fine herself summarises her view like this: ‘the genetic and hormonal components of sex collaborate with other parts of the developmental system, including our gender constructions.’ That doesn't seem like something most people would argue with. But it doesn't seem like much of a revolutionary idea, either."
2,0393355489,http://goodreads.com/user/show/35183085-emma,2,"This has really inspired me to stop reading popular science books by random people I find under the ""feminism"" tag on Goodreads. This book is not scientific & makes a lot of unprovable assertions not backed up by studies. For example, 97% of domestic abusers are male and she literally explains this by saying it's caused by the pressure of conforming to gender stereotypes. How does she know?? There's no study; that's just an opinion. Once she cited a study showing that one time men and women did equally well on a math test. This seems obviously cherry-picky; anyone can look up statistics showing at the highest level of the math SATs boys outnumber girls 3:2; this effect is still persistent across higher-level math in different countries.She spends a lot of time talking about how we shouldn't gender-code toys for children, but that doesn't have anything to do with how 85% of people with autism are boys, or how gay men report far more sexual partners than lesbian women, or how the vast majority of violent criminals and nearly all rapists are male, and how men have more aggression in every society measured. I'm a bit disappointed because there were a lot of nice snippets in this book showing how sex differences in the research lab were rather small, but for me at least the point of science is to answer questions and make predictions about the world, so it's not helpful to tear down other people's research & then propose your own (unprovable) assertions. Our society has such massive sex differences & it felt like the author had no answers to that, just opinions that can't even be reasonably tested. One cool actual fact I learned is that your chance of getting pregnant during a random act of unprotected intercourse is, on average, 3%. (She says this shows historically this practically meant sex was a care-free endeavor for women, which strikes me as ragingly insensitive to all the women who before reliable contraception had unwanted pregnancies & historically not true. Also, you shouldn't take unprotected-sex advice from this because 59% of couples who are having unprotected sex get pregnant within 3 months.) Anyway, that fact + a resolution to avoid popular science writing makes this book worth it, I guess."

(c)A lot of interesting research on gender evolution, roles, specters, biology, marketing, risks and potential. Lehman Sisters hypothesis and risk considerations are particularly well-thought out.Q:A pair of testicles hanging on a key ring is bound to capture attention; to mesmerize. “That’s some key ring you have there,” people would politely comment. But what they would really mean is that in some important way your identity has been defined. Idiosyncrasies, complexities, contradictions, characteristics in common with those who don’t have genitals on a key ring—all this fades into the background. Who you are is someone with a testicle key ring. (c) That's quite an ides. Seriously, her son's a awesomely chill kid.Q:How could it be sexist to merely report the objective conclusions of science? In fact, are there any sexists these days? Or are there just people who recognize that our brains and natures have been shaped by evolutionary pressures responsive only to reproductive success in our ancestral past, with no concern for the future consequences for the representation of women in Formula 1 world championships, or on corporate boards? (c)Q:“Psychologically, men and women are almost a different species,” was the conclusion of one Manchester Business School academic. Cahill, likewise, suggests that this compounding is akin to the way that many small differences between a Volvo and a Corvette—a little difference in the brakes here, a modest dissimilarity in the pistons there, and so on—add up to very different kinds of car. Perhaps not coincidentally, one is a nice, safe family vehicle with plenty of room in the trunk for groceries; the other is designed to offer power and status. (c)Q:And when it comes to the workplace, many “gender diversity” consultants take it for granted that biological sex provides a useful proxy for the skill sets employees bring to organizations. To increase female representation at senior levels, they recommend that employers “harness the unique qualities of men and women.” To have mostly men in senior management positions, this argument goes, is a bit like trying to sweep a floor with nine dustpans and one brush. (c)Q:It’s as if the women of a harem were to casually comment to the sultan when he popped by, “Oh no, that child’s not one of yours—that’s the second footman’s daughter.… Eh? Ah, sorry. He’s not yours either, that’s the son of the chauffeur. Hang on, sultan, we’ll find your kid. Nadia… Nadia! Do you remember which of these kids is the sultan’s? Oh, yes, that’s right. That boy over there playing with his half-brother. He’s yours. Almost certainly.” (c)Q:Given the risks and costs of these “excess” matings (such as disease and predation risks for leaving the group, as well as the investment of time and energy that could be spent doing something else), this was behaviour that required explanation. (Hrdy suggested that it helped to leave open the father’s identity, making it less likely that the mothers’ offspring would be killed.) Since this justly famous scientific revelation, researchers have come up with all manner of ingenious suggestions as to the advantages female animals might gain from multiple mates. Since it only seems fair that women, too, should have access to evolutionarily flavoured “the-whisperings-of-my-genes-made-me-do-it” excuses for cheating on a partner, I provide a selection of these ideas here. Proposed gains of female promiscuity include genetic benefits, healthier offspring, and the opportunity to set up sperm competitions that weed out inferior specimens. It’s even been suggested that females may have sex with several males in order to sabotage the reproductive success of rivals, by depleting local sperm stocks. (c)Q:Among primates, for instance, low-ranking females’ ovulation may be suppressed by nearby dominant females, or they may be so harassed by other females that they spontaneously abort. (c)Q:price of sex for the male St. Andrew’s Cross spider is so high that he only mates once. As the University of Melbourne evolutionary biologist Mark Elgar explained to me, this is because during this very special occasion “he foolishly breaks his copulatory apparatus and the female puts him out of his embarrassment by eating him.” (No wonder they’re cross.) (c)Q:Other species keep costs down with self-imposed chastity. In Elgar’s lab, male stick insects (Macleay’s Spectre) are offered a mating opportunity every week. Despite apparently having nothing more demanding to do all day than resemble a stick, they only rouse themselves to take up this mating opportunity 30–40 per cent of the time. (c)Q:A man with a Maserati is a fascinating phenomenon, deserving of study, to be sure. But whether he is the human biological equivalent of the well-antlered stag, his spotless luxury car the counterpart of the shimmering, biologically extravagant tail of the peacock—that is another matter altogether. (c) Fun)Q:Some individual women have even managed to give birth to many more than this: the anonymous first wife of a Russian peasant called Feodor Vassilyev had thirty-seven pregnancies yielding sixty-nine children. (c)Q:As Bradley University psychologist David Schmitt explains:Consider that one man can produce as many as 100 offspring by indiscriminately mating with 100 women in a given year, whereas a man who is monogamous will tend to have only one child with his partner during that same time period. In evolutionary currencies, this represents a strong selective pressure—and a potent adaptive problem—for men’s mating strategies to favor at least some desire for sexual variety...Consider, Einon posits, a woman who on average has sex once a week for thirty years. Now suppose she bears a generous brood of nine children. As you can easily calculate for yourself, on average she will have sex 173 times per child. And for each of the 172 coital acts that didn’t lead to a baby, there was a partner involved, having nonreproductive sex. To explore what this means for any man trying to reach the benchmark set by Schmitt of scoring a century of infants in a year, it’s worth following Einon in breaking things down to clearly see the schedule involved. First, the man has to find a fertile woman. For the benefit of younger readers, it may be worth pointing out that throughout most of human evolution the Tinder app was not available to facilitate this. Nor, as observed in the previous chapter, was there likely to have been a limitless supply of fertile female vessels for men to access. In historical and traditional societies, perhaps as many as 80–90 per cent of women of reproductive age at any one time would be pregnant, or temporarily infertile because they were breast-feeding, Einon suggests. Of the remaining women, some of course would already be in a relationship, making sexual relations at the very least less probable and possibly more fraught with difficulties. Let’s suppose, though, that our man manages to identify a suitable candidate from the limited supply. Next, he has to prevail in the intense competition created by all the other men who are also hoping for casual sex with a fertile woman, and successfully negotiate sex with her. Say that takes a day. In order to reach his target of one hundred women per annum, our man then has just two to three days to successfully repeat the exercise, ninety-nine more times, from an ever-decreasing pool of women. All this, mind you, while also maintaining the status and material resources he needs to remain competitive as a desirable sexual partner.So what’s the likely reproductive return on this exhausting investment? For healthy couples, the probability of a woman becoming pregnant from a single randomly timed act of intercourse is about 3 per cent, ranging (depending on the time of the month), from a low of 0 to a high of nearly 9 per cent. On average, then, a year of competitive courtship would result in only about three of the one hundred women becoming pregnant. (Although a man could increase his chances of conception by having sex with the same woman repeatedly, this would of course disrupt his very tight schedule.) This estimate, by the way, assumes that the man, in contradiction with the principle of “indiscriminately mating,” excludes women under twenty and over forty, who have a greater number of cycles in which no egg is released. It also doesn’t take into account that some women will be chronically infertile (Einon estimates about 8 per cent), or that women who are mostly sexually abstinent have longer menstrual cycles and ovulate less frequently, making it less likely that a single coital act will result in pregnancy. We’re also kindly overlooking sperm depletion, and discreetly turning a blind eye to the possibility that another man’s sperm might reach the egg first. In these unrealistically ideal conditions, a man who sets himself the annual project of producing one hundred children from one hundred one-night stands has a chance of success of about 0.00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000363. ...To put that number in a little context, a man’s odds of being killed by a meteorite in his lifetime is 0.000004.14.And they say feminists are wishful thinkers.(c)Q:In fact, a major headache for sex researchers is that men reliably report a larger mean number of other-sex sexual partners than do women. This is logically cally impossible, since heterosexual coitus requires the presence of both a woman and a man. This impossible discrepancy seems to be mostly due to men’s inaccurate reporting, and their “greater tendency to report large, ‘round’ numbers of partners.” Once people’s tallies get to about fifteen partners, they tend to answer with “ballpark figures” ending in multiples of five (Let’s see, there was Suzy, Jenny, Malini, Ruth,… call it fifty) and the discrepancy between the mean for men and women is larger in the oldest age groups, for whom memory is presumably most blurred. (c)Q:A second obvious objection is that what this study is actually primarily showing is women’s lack of interest in being murdered, raped, robbed, or inflaming the interests of a potential stalker. (c)Q:Certainly, attitudes can shift: sometimes remarkably quickly, as I discovered once when visiting the home of a university boyfriend. His father protested strongly against me sleeping in the same bedroom as his son, given our unmarried state. His wife listened respectfully, then suggested that if this was how he felt he had better get the ladder, climb up to the attic, find the camp bed, carry it down the ladder, clean it off, mend the wobbly leg, set it up in the study, find some bed linen and make it up for me. My boyfriend’s father considered this for a moment and then concluded that, upon reflection, one did have to move with the times. (c)Q:Ultimately, that old tale claims that it isn’t just sexism and discrimination that sustains the glass ceiling—not completely. At the core of this inequality are the whisperings of evolution. To men, it murmurs That’s right… keep going, son. I know it may seem counter-intuitive to suggest that spending eighty hours a week in a science lab becoming increasingly pale and weedy, and possibly developing rickets, will make you more attractive to scores of young, beautiful, fertile women, but trust me on this. Instead, to women, evolution is whispering Are you sure all this hard work is worth it? Why not go home, invest more in the few kids you’ve got? Oh, and maybe brush your hair a little? It’ll make it glossier—more youthful.But this old story is on its last legs, and it’s time to give birth to its successor. (c) Cheers!Q:Interestingly, even the apparent counterexample of the minority of men who purchase sex—often taken as evidence of men’s capacity and desire for purely physical sexual activity—turns out in some cases at least to be nothing of the sort. According to University of Leeds sociologist Teela Sanders, “a significant number” of men who purchase sex habitually or exclusively visit the same sex worker. This seems surprising, given the natural assumption that the purchasing of sex is the manifestation of men’s evolved desire for sexual variety, unencumbered by the restrictive relational obligations, moralities, and negotiations that sex usually entails. Why buy the same woman’s sexual services twice, in a market exchange potentially as emotionally uncomplicated and uncommitted as getting one’s car washed, or buying a bunch of bananas? (с)Q:recent research has established higher frequencies of “de novo” mutations (that is, those that arise for the first time in the gametes, rather than hereditary mutations) in the sperm of older men, and their contribution to genetic disease.28 Presumably, then, the younger the man, the better the state of his “good genes.” Yet despite all this, men don’t wear uncomfortable platform shoes in order to make themselves look taller, rarely hand over fistfuls of cash to pay for major surgeries to make themselves more pleasingly V-shaped, or make their chins more handsomely prominent, nor line up in large numbers to have their foreheads paralysed with Botox injections. This absence of male enthusiasm for painful and expensive physical enhancements points to the possibility that deficiencies in reproductive potential can be, and are, forgivingly overlooked when it comes to sexual attraction. (c) Q:These preferred characteristics do not offensively imply that the “mate value” of your wife—even if she happens to be the woman you love, the mother of your children, and the only person in the world who understands what you mean when you say someone had “‘a beard like McFie’s’ or ‘hair the same colour as that man in Hove who caught me kicking his cat’”—is less when she’s fifty than when she was twenty years younger. They are attributes that can’t be bought, injected into you, or liposuctioned out of you. And they are also traits that have little to do with tax brackets, luxury European cars, or corner offices. Rather, they correspond to factors that reduce the chances you will want to throw a plate at your partner’s head. They are dependability, emotional stability, a pleasing personality, and love. (c)Q:The ape that mistook itself for a peacock should also not forget that it’s human. (c)Q:They analysed images of more than 1,400 human brains, drawn from large data sets from four different sources. First, they identified around ten of the largest sex differences in each sample. Even this preliminary exercise challenged popular understanding in a couple of ways. First of all, contrary to the view that the brains of men and women are strikingly different, none of these differences were particularly substantial. Even for the very largest, the overlap between the sexes meant that about one in five women were more “male-like” than the average male. What’s more, each data set had a different Top Ten list. As the authors point out, this shows that sex differences in the brain aren’t simply due to sex, but depend on additional factors, the most obvious candidates being age, environment, and genetic variation. (с)Q:This critical difference between ourselves and other species is perhaps best illustrated by the reality TV show Wife Swap. In this long-running programme, viewers enjoy the mayhem that ensues when wives of generally very different social class, background, personality, and lifestyle swap homes, household rules, lives, husband, and children for two weeks “to discover just what it’s like to live another woman’s life.” I think I can say with low risk of the charge of anthropocentric bias that there is no other species in the animal kingdom for which this concept would work for seven seasons. Other animals are fascinating, to be sure. Many are highly flexible and adaptable. But there just aren’t that many ways to be a female baboon. (c) I KNEW there was a reason why I dislike TV. Q:for decades there have been indications that risk taking isn’t a one-dimensional personality trait: instead, there are “insurance-buying gamblers” and “skydiving wallflowers,” as one group of researchers put it. (c)Q:Columbia University’s Elke Weber and colleagues asked several hundred U.S. undergraduates how likely they would be to take risks in six different domains: gambling, financial, health, recreational, social, and ethical decisions. Again, a person’s risk-taking propensity didn’t follow any kind of consistent pattern across the different domains—that is, the person who would happily blow a week’s wages at the races was no more likely to leap from a bridge attached to a rubber cord, invest in speculative stock, ask their boss for a raise, have unprotected sex, or steal an additional TV cable connection, than was someone who’d as soon flush dollar bills down the toilet as put them on a horse. Researchers drew the same conclusion a few years later in a study that deliberately recruited people on the basis of their affinity to a particular kind of risk: like skydivers, smokers, casino gamblers, and members of stock-trading clubs. Once again, risk taking in one domain didn’t extend to others. So gamblers, say, unsurprisingly stood out as the most risk taking when it came to questions about betting. But they were no more risk taking than the other groups, including even a group of health-risk-averse gym members, when it came to questions about recreational or investment risks. ... The pure, unadulterated daredevil no doubt exists, but such individuals are statistical exceptions to the general rule that people are fascinatingly idiosyncratic and multifaceted when it comes to risk. (c)Q:So what makes someone eager to take risks in one domain, but reluctant in another? It turns out to be risk takers’ less negative perception of the risks and more positive perception of the benefits, Weber and colleagues found. The study of the skydivers, gamblers, smokers, and stock traders came to a similar conclusion. The risk takers in this study didn’t like risk per se any more than did the risk-averse gym members. Rather, they perceived greater benefits in their particular pocket of risk taking, and this explained why they took risks that others avoided, and took one kind of risk rather than another. (c)Q:Or consider a recent study of young Chinese women and men, who played a risk-taking game either privately or while being were observed by an attractive person of the other sex. ... Chinese women were every bit as risk taking as the men when unobserved. But in line with gender norms, men increased their risk taking when supposedly observed by an attractive other-sex observer, while women decreased it. (c)Q:Disappointingly, the wide range of reactions to this brief biography has yet to include You must be Cordelia Fine! Would you sign this copy of your book that I carry around with me? Instead, people often shoot me a startled look, and then ask whether I’d also deny that there are other basic physiological differences between the sexes. Whenever this happens, I’m always tempted to fix my interrogator in the grip of a steely gaze and pronounce briskly, “Certainly! Testes are merely a social construction,” then see how the conversation flows from there. (c)Q:We have stereotypes that stain every encounter, clothing, language, salaries, titles, awards, media, legislation, norms, stigma, jokes, art, religion… the list of phenomena that make up our rich, gendered cultures goes on and on.That’s a lot of social construction to reconstruct.(c)"
4,0393355489,http://goodreads.com/user/show/79765515-prerna,4,"Despite all the advances made in developmental biology, as a society we still widely believe that men and women are complementary to each other. This belief is so ingrained into our society so as to give rise to popular slogans that are irrationally used as excuses for misbehaviour and sexual stereotypes: Men are from mars, women are from Venus, boys will be boys. And of course, these are explained away using the “men are biologically evolved to be aggressive, competitive masters of the household, whereas it is in women's nature to play submissive, nurturing roles” view. In Testosterone Rex Cordelia Fine questions the scientific credibility of these views. Does Testosterone really create an unbridgeable divide between men and women?This is Testosterone Rex: that familiar, plausible, pervasive, and powerful story of sex and society. Weaving together interlinked claims about evolution, brains, hormones, and behavior, it offers a neat and compelling account of our societies’ persistent and seemingly intractable sex inequalities. Testosterone Rex can appear undefeatable. Whenever we discuss the worthy topic of sex inequalities and what to do about them, it is the giant elephant testicles in the room. What about our evolved differences, the dissimilarities between the male brain and the female brain? What about all that male testosterone?Does Testosterone affect brain functions in cis-men leading to significantly different brain development? The popular answer is yes and the origin of this affirmation comes from a study of fruit flies carried out by Angus Bateman.The outcome of Bateman’s six series of matchmaking was the first scientific report of greater male variation in reproductive success. For example, 21 percent of males failed to produce any offspring, compared with only 4 percent of females. Males also showed greater variation in the estimated number of mates. But it was the linking of the two findings that became the basis of explanations for why males compete and females choose: Bateman concluded that although male reproductive success increased with promiscuity, female reproductive success did not. His critically important explanation was the now familiar insight that male success in producing offspring is largely limited by the number of females he can inseminate, whereas a female gains nothing from further pairings beyond a single one (since her first mate should furnish her with plenty more sperm than she needs).But, a recent re-analysis of the original data Bateman used revealed a discrepency between his considered data and findings. There was actually evidence within his study for female promiscuity that he seems to have ignored. Fine does not in anyway completely disregard Bateman’s works, she simply argues against the ‘foundational nature’ of its results. And I want to point out here that Fine makes exactly zero claims that are unsupported by evidence. There are numerous citations and notes (623, to be precise), evaluation of counter-evidence, and well studied examples.Fine also challenges the traditional view that men are more prone to risk-taking behavior and therefore fare well in competitive fields like finance. Experiments of risk-taking behavior in a patriarchal community and a matrilineal tribe revealed that there are no significant differences in risk-taking behavior between the sexes. However, when these experiments were performed with white males as the subjects, they did see considerable differences between risk-taking behavior in white men and white women or even other people of color. (people, as in, including men)Perhaps white males see less risk in the world because they create, manage, control, and benefit from so much of it. Perhaps women and non-white men see the world as more dangerous because in many ways they are more vulnerable, because they benefit less from many of its technologies and institutions, and because they have less power and control.Aha, but there’s actually a legion of evidence for the Testosterone Rex point of view and Fine just exhibits a clear case of feminist bias, you say? Fine has answers for you! Studies show that researchers within evolutionary and developmental biology often exhibit “confirmation bias’, wherein they summarize results from previous studies in ways that are consistent with existing stereotypes. Small average differences between populations under study are presented as fundamental and important. All right, you say, but what is Fine trying to get at? That the findings of evolutionary biology cannot be simply explained away using a single hormone as the source of all functional differences, it’s way more complicated that that. Our biological selves interact with and develop alongside our cultural environments and existing stereotypes, leading to marked differences in our behaviors.Words are nice, but often deeds work better.Which of these directions we prefer is up to us: it’s a question for our values, not science. But that evolving science is showing that one time-honored option is no longer available to us. It’s time to stop blaming Testosterone Rex, because that king is dead.What I have written in this review is only a lousy summary, and Fine offers many more detailed studies and analyses in this extraordinary book. Everybody needs to read this. But if you’re a woman in STEM like me, please, please read it.Here's a link to an article by the author that's basically an overview of this book:Sexual dinosaurs"
5,0393355489,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5441925-kaisha,4,"This is a much-needed review of the outdated scientific interpretations of the role of testosterone on behavior. From the earliest experiments, Fine shows how value-laden and culturally reinforcing many of these ""scientific"" experiments are. To sum up a wonderfully entertaining and thorough investigation of the history of sex hormone research Fine points out that the current agreed upon model is that behavior influences hormones more than hormones influence behavior. There are many studies that now show how testosterone increases when people are put in stressful situations or positions of power. And equally how testosterone decreases when people are given infants to take care of. It blows out of the water the boys-will-be-boys model where testosterone has been blamed (or praised) for making men: logical, assertive, aggressive, risk-takers and just generally better suited to high-status positions like finance, higher mathematics, and science, fighting and sports. One particularly interesting example is a testosterone test on men who had just competed in elite international athletic competitions - several of the men had levels BELOW the normal reference range. Moreover, these are TOP competing athletes. The book is extremely compelling and should be required reading for parents, teachers, politicians, religious leaders (honestly everybody) or anybody who has a role in legislating or shaping the gendered experiences of people."
6,0393355489,http://goodreads.com/user/show/50966121-peter-geyer,5,"Cordelia Fine has appeared somewhat controversial in a controversy-cluttered area, to the extent that I had avoided her work, notwithstanding it being in and around a topic of great interest, and it wasn't until I read something about her and this book in a kind of interview/review that I decided to test out what she had to say.Fine's area of interest is broadly what scientific research can tell us about makes and females, as categories, inclinations and behaviours with respect to various groups of humans and other animals. Her interest isn't descriptive, but investigative and evaluative, and so we are presented with research and opinion from a number of sources, including a comment coming from the first female jockey to ride a Melbourne Cup winner, in which she labelled the horse racing industry as patriarchal, and that they had made incorrect assessments about female capacity and physical strength.In the last week, a women's Australian Football League has been launched in which the players demonstrated a vigorous and competitive playing style and will to win, as well as a general excitement from some players interviewed beforehand that they'd been waiting all their lives for this day to come. Naturally, Fine doesn't reference this, but this event is at the core of the discussion, examples and theme of the book, which is about the kinds of myths the public at large, people in various positions of power, and researchers of all kinds appear to take for granted, which is the role testosterone plays in the kinds of attributes I've mentioned with the women playing football, particularly including risk-taking. The book critiques the above views by providing research and other evidence, demonstrating that some researchers prejudge their outcomes or report favourably on statistical differences that don't really say anything, research males and infer results to females (unresearched), don't take account of environment and social expectations, have limited pools of subjects (usually students) that are hardly representative, and so on. Economics researchers come in for some stick, for some very good reasons, as their research methods appear to be tightly bound to ideology of some kind, as well as the bewildering idea (to me anyway) that you can get meaningful data from people making decisions over a dollar or two. This lack of largesse, as Fine puts it, surely has an influence on whether participants would really be invested in the task. I remember being engaged in such a ""game"" at a university course in 1989 (not economics) in which $5 was at stake, which left the whole exercise somewhat unrealistic for the participants, all of whom were in well-paid and permanent employment.Fine is a particularly witty and fluent writer and explains these issues with clarity. Sometimes, a genuinely funny statement appears after a particular method is described, which makes you go back to what's been said, to really get the point.Where she starts, of course is with notions of hard-wired male and female brains with the theme of testosterone not far behind. We discover that a demarcation point for these categories is impossible to find and that external definitions of what masculinity and femininity are used in this case, such as a scale of masculinity, something obviously socially constructed, to this personality researcher at any rate. How males and females respond to tasks, or just daily life (more fluid categories than one might think) is astutely examined and critiqued. I must admit that this contention isn't new to me, and it's obviously more representative of what people and other beings are really like. Actually, how the latter go about things doesn't make for rigid behaviour categories. In some respects the idea presented here is that a person might be male or female (taking into account that some species change this orientation according to circumstance) but it's how they go about things, or express that orientation that's the real point, Not every male wants to be in finance or a CEO or something, some females might be so inclinedOne of the things I was most startled about in this book came towards the end, when gender-based marketing strategies were discussed, in particular the pink and blue divide, which is known to be socially constructed i.e. in the past the reverse was the case as far as boys and girls were concerned. Maybe this points to a lack of research or interest in the facts. I was startled partly because I don't venture into the toy stores Fine speaks of, and that I recall contemporaries who became parents mentioning that no toy guns came into the house, that the toys they selected were gender neutral and that one of their sons liked playing with dolls. So I was presuming progress in this area; from what is recounted here, apparently not. It also brought to mind a comment by my elderly mother a year or two ago in which she expressed her regret that she had never bought me a train set when I was a child. Friends had these things, and I could never understand their interest as once you'd gone around the track, that was that. So I explained my complete lack of interest, hoping that would assuage her guilt. But she may also be wondering what she did wrong to raise a son for whom mechanical things were of no interest. On the other hand, she did buy books for my sister and me on a kind of egalitarian basis, so who knows?This is an excellent book that worked well for me to the book by Frans de Wall that I bought at the same time. Some people apparently think Fine is a behaviourist, but I think that's far from the case."

But again, for someone who isn't interested in them, reading a text without citations interrupting is a lot easier, I get it.At times I felt like the author was trying to prove her point of view right just a bit too hard; so much so that sometimes I got lost attempting to follow her reasoning.However, several points were raised that I did find interesting or studies were referenced that I hadn't heard of which made it a worthwhile endeavour. What, I think, the main point of the book is, is that there's no such thing as ""men have more testosterone and that's why they are in higher positions."" There's no direct line between hormones and your employment. And I know that this sounds utterly ludicrous, but some people seem to be of this opinion; just check the referenced publishings. As social creatures, our physical and social environment influences how our personality develops.I mean, if women were praised for being in hard sciences while men were discouraged from early ages, would the same pattern of gender inequality be observed as today when gender norms ""teach"" the exact opposite? It would probably be the other way around, more women compared to the number of men.It's all past ""boys will be boys"" because our early childhood socialisation has an enormous effect on adult behaviour, possibly to the same scale as genes and hormones.Oh, and I totally share the author's hate for gendered toys. Let kids play with whatever they want, without those toys being ""blue for boys"" and ""pink for girls""."

9,0393355489,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1345046-todd-martin,2,"Male and Female PeacocksAs everyone knows by now human behavior is a combination of nature and nurture. However, when it comes to the differences in behaviors between the sexes, Cordelia Fine (an academic psychologist and writer) believes nature has nothing to with it. She makes her argument as to why in Testosterone Rex: Myths of Sex, Science, and Society.In other words, she’d likely take issue with Tom Bodett’s observation that “my boys used to chew their toast into the shape of a gun and then shoot at each other”, presumably because this activity is also one she believes is widely shared by little girls. First off, it’s worth mentioning (and I don’t think Fine would disagree) that the book is not simply an impartial review of the science, it has an ideological aim … Fine wants to further a more equal society based on both sexes’ full, human potential. This is a worthy goal and one to which I fully subscribe. However, I do not subscribe to misrepresenting the science to do so, and Fine gets it wrong early in the book in her description of an flawed experiment performed in the 1940’s by Angus Bateman in which he examined the mating behavior of fruit flies. Bateman concluded from his work that reproductive variance is greater in males than in females. However, it was later shown that his experimental methodology was flawed. Fine concludes from this error that sexual selection (first proposed by Charles Darwin in The Origin of Species and developed in The Descent of Man and Selection in Relation to Sex) therefore doesn’t exist. As an aside, this is a method of argumentation that she commonly returns to in the book. It’s akin to saying: rain doesn’t always follow thunder, therefore anyone who reaches for an umbrella before venturing outside while thunder is rumbling is a blithering idiot. It should be noted that Bateman’s experiment has subsequently been repeated properly in several other species, and the results have precisely supported Bateman’s original conclusion.Here’s the thing. Sexual selection is a well-established biological theory with multiple lines of supporting evidence. If it did not exist, how could sexual dimorphism between men and women (or between males and females of any species) be explained (see the photo above)? Fine needs to undermine sexual selection since it’s the mechanism that undercuts the foundation upon which her argument is based. It’s possible that biologists are busily re-writing evolutionary textbooks to comport with Fine’s conclusion (overlooking her lack of credentials in the field), but I doubt such is the case. With that out of the way, the book does have its merits. Where Fine is at her best is in demolishing the idea of rigid gender-specific character traits. The human species is highly adaptive and exhibits a broad range of behaviors to varying degrees: cooperativeness, dutifulness, obedience, goal-orientation, risk-taking, talkativeness, pragmatism etc. There is no gender-specific list that can be referred to that distinguishes behaviors exhibited by men from those exhibited by women. There is so much overlap involved in human traits that we can only speak of such characteristics statistically (and much of that statistical variance is quite modest). The U.S. is just starting to begin to acknowledge that gender behavior and gender identity are more complex than the binary form as was once thought and Fine is right to direct criticism at the ‘Men are from Mars, Women are from Venus’ proponents. There’s one exception though, and Fine is unusually silent with regards to its prevalence … aggression. I’ll let you take a blind guess as to which sex is more aggressive, but here’s a statistic: violent crime is overwhelmingly committed by just one sex (80.4 % vs. 19.6 % in the U.S.). I suppose Fine would argue that this is a culturally learned behavior … except it bears out throughout the world and throughout human history. The theory of sexual selection does an admirable job explaining why, and you can convince yourself with a web search if you’re so inclined. As to the book itself and most importantly as far as my enjoyment was concerned, Testosterone Rex really didn’t hold my interest."
10,0393355489,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11951948-paul,4,"The gender issue is a hot topic at the moment, for decades we have been led to believe that ‘boys will be boys’, that pink and blue toys are entirely suitable for the appropriate sex and that men have evolved to take risks because of the extra testosterone swishing about and that the female brain is utterly different to the male brain.Psychologist, Cordelia Fine, is having none of it.The ‘nature versus nurture’ argument is dragged up frequently, but by using arguments from social history, psychology, neuroscience and evolutionary science, Fine takes apart all the old, entrenched evidence and goes a long way to explaining how what is between your legs doesn’t create male and female natures, but the elements that actually defines us is a complicated mix of evolution, hormones, culture and sex. Fine is not afraid to be controversial in some of her conclusions in this book, looking at the facts and assessing the evidence; pointing out the errors is not going to endear her to some readers. She has written an interesting and enlightened take on the role that testosterone has to play in both male and female bodies, and the effects that it has. She does not hold back as she obliterates the myths and cultural norms in society that still surround the gender issue. She is not afraid to get stuck into the science and statistics and evaluate the studies that have been done. It is a really good popular science, one of the few where I have actually laughed out loud at certain points of the book. Worth reading."

""Testosterone Rex"" did not disappoint. Fine has a delightful writing style, combining personal anecdote and a great deal of humor with clear arguments and large amounts of evidence supporting her views. This book was perhaps a drier topic, at least to me, with a great deal of biology, but I nonetheless found the book fascinating, and many of the key arguments were novel to me. Two in particular - that T levels might be a response to, rather than a cause of, certain physiological or behavioral changes, and that some gender differences might serve to make behavior similar despite reproductive biology differences, rather than the behavior being different because of those differences - really stood out. Correlation is not causation, and here are two huge causation arrows that can possibly be turned the other way. Fine is quite deft at dissecting the motivated reasoning and confirmation bias of various research efforts, something she does with humor and understanding rather than rancor. Human behavior, she frequently points out, is complex, and is not necessarily comparable to animal behavior in all ways. Fine also rightfully points out the folly of assuming that all human evolution traces only to the Stone age; much has happened since then that affects behavior. All in all, this was a wonderful book, and I recommend it."
13,0393355489,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1340545-michael-livingston,3,"I really loved Delusions of Gender: How Our Minds, Society, and Neurosexism Create Difference, so I had high hopes for Cordelia Fine's follow-up, Testosterone Rex. It's a well put together argument against the idea that biological sex, and particularly testosterone, determines behaviour, but it didn't impress me nearly as much as I was expecting. I found myself much more sceptical of Fine's presentation of the evidence here - wanting more meta-analyses or systematic reviews over neat and interesting individual studies. I've no doubt that the majority of Fine's arguments reflect the state of scientific play, but at times it felt like the argument was driving her choice of sources rather than the reverse. I also found some of Fine's stylistic choices a bit more grating than I expected - a few too many self-satisfied asides for my tastes. Testosterone Rex is still an important contribution of course - it's readable and clear and will convincingly drives home the point that much of what people assume are 'innate' or 'natural' differences between men and women are really profoundly social. But I think it falls well short of the standards Fine set in Delusions of Gender, a book I think everyone should read."

Indeed, the only myths are those perpetuated by the author. Leaving unmentioned entire bodies of scientific findings can only be a sign of two things: ignorance or purposeful propagandizing. I think the latter is more probable since I suspect that the author thinks that by burying scientific evidence (or not mentioning it) helps the cause of fighting gender discrimination and segregation. It doesn't. The author does a decent job on reminding us of the dangers of misapplications of scientific findings into policy.

Needless to say, I found a lot of comfort in the pages of the book and here is why:- I am a straight male who works in a field that is 97% women (I am an interior designer...Not a decorator!)- I have been very active in my son's early life, and split his care more than 50/50 with my wife for the most part (some days she does more, other days I do, but there is a balance)- I grew up fascinated by the arts, music, literature and didn't like playing anything but dodgeball or floor hockey- I liked playing video games where I could blow people up, and I played with toy guns with my brother religiously while we were growing up- I love my wife dearly and made a pledge to her when we were married that she was the last person I would ever be with, and we will be together no matter the hardships and issues. I have found my one person in this world.- I am a total fashion snob and enjoy shopping.What do all these things have in common? Nothing, other than to prove that, as a male, I am not defined by testosterone, and women, should not be defined by their lack of it, as it does not guide in any way who you are as a PERSON. That was the big takeaway for me from this book: we are all unique individuals, regardless of sex. Some men will have more female tendencies, while some women will have more male tendencies. The idea is that we should understand and proport a society where respecting the person over respecting the sex is paramount.One of my favorite parts, which I will leave as a takeaway, talked about how we use the term ""Testosterone Fueled Event"" when in reality, based on numerous studies, when we find ourselves in a situation that may make us aggressive or angry, we release testosterone, not the other way around.I am doing a terrible job at simplifying the incredible amount of work that went into this book, but I would highly recommend reading it, no matter your stance on the issues of gender equality or feminism. It was a witty and enjoyable read that may change your position on a few things without you even knowing it."
16,0393355489,http://goodreads.com/user/show/900800-inderjit-sanghera,5,"One-by-one Cordelia Fine upends various modern myths surrounding gender stereotypes, or, to be more specific, fables surrounding testosterone as somehow being the magic bullet which justifies all sorts if illusions; men are inherently greater risk-takers, men are hard-wired for promiscuity, men thrive in stressful scenarios. Testosterone continues to be used to justify male privilege, to justify ideas surrounding toxic masculinity, whether it be the propensity for domestic violence or for male dominance in leadership roles in the finance industry. Fine is not arguing that there additional testosterone has no impact on male behaviour, or that male and female brains are exactly the same, instead her argument is that the impacts of testosterone are exaggerated and that it is societal norms and values which define gendered behaviours rather than simply human biology.Concepts such as gender-specific toys are the rock upon which gender identities are built. Fine highlights the story of the Australian politician who linked boys toys with domestic violence; right-wing critics lampooned her links without understanding the nuances behind the argument. From a young age boys are taught that certain behaviours (aggressiveness, self-confidence, boisterousness) are masculine tendencies and therefore acceptable under the adage ‘boys will be boys’. However, it is when women seek to assert their individuality and break these stereotypes that male insecurity, which is the source of most domestic violence, crops up, as women do no fulfil the roles society places on them. Behind each Action Man toy lies a series of stereotypes which stay with children into adulthoodFine presents a convincing argument on dispensing with gender stereotypes, or even the concept of gender, which is mainly a social construct, in order to free us, especially women, who feel the constant weight of male expectations, of male privilege which not only fail to allow them to meet their potential but prevent them from making aware it ever existed. In an ever-changing world, where concepts of gender and identity are constantly being redefined, books such as Testosterone Rex are essential in allowing us to re-consider what it means to be human."
17,0393355489,http://goodreads.com/user/show/14941179-anna,4,"‘Testosterone Rex’ is a follow up to Delusions of Gender: How Our Minds, Society, and Neurosexism Create Difference, both of which are excellent demolitions of sexist pseudo-scientific nonsense. The first tackled misinterpretations of neuroscience. The second deals with misinterpretations of research on hormones, specifically the oversimplification that men are risk-takers and women aren't because testosterone. Fine’s tone in both books is one of controlled sardonic rage, which I have every sympathy with. She must have dealt with a lot of mansplaining. ‘Testosterone Rex’ feels slightly briefer than her previous book, so I didn’t like it quite as much. The two hundred pages were undoubtedly very good, though. Fine captures the nuance of testosterone’s effects well. These sections particularly stood out:The complexity also helps to make the following problem less bewildering. How do humans achieve the feat of turning something rather large (average sex differences in circulating testosterone levels) into something rather small (average sex differences in behaviour)? No sex difference in basic behaviour comes close to the divergence between the sexes in circulating testosterone, for which there’s only 10 t0 15% overlap between women’s and men’s levels. Potentially, this puzzle is solved by the important principle we met in Chapter 4: that sex effects in the brain don’t always serve to create different behaviour. Sometimes instead, one sex effect counteracts or compensates for another, enabling similarity of behaviour, despite dissimilarity of biology. Combine this principle with the the considerable room for manoeuvre on the journey between T in the bloodstream and its action on the brain…[...]Not only is T neither a sufficient, nor necessary, cause of hormone-linked behaviour - sometimes it’s not even really a cause at all. Recall the purpose of hormones: to ‘adjust behaviour to circumstances and contexts’. To this end, T turns out to play ‘a key role’ in helping animals tune their social behaviour to whatever social scene they find themselves in. Although we’re used to thinking of certain kinds of behaviour as ‘testosterone fuelled’, in many cases it would make more sense to instead think of action and situations as being ‘testosterone fuelling’. Social context modulates T levels (up or down), which influences behaviour (presumably via changes in perception, motivation, and cognition), which influences social outcome, which influences T levels… and so on.I also heartily approve of Fine’s mocking economists for making the ground-breaking discovery that (GASP) people's decisions are influenced by social norms. As she puts it, ‘To a social psychologist, this is an almost comically belated revelation: a little bit as if only recently a landmark social psychology article introduced colleagues to the concept of money.’ The book wraps up with a succinct assessment of how the sexist myths of hunter-men and caregiver-women manifest in society, which is well expressed and depressing. One thing it left me thinking, though, is whether anyone has researched the effects of testosterone by surveying pre- and post-T trans men’s levels of risk-taking. Fine’s synthesis implies that such research may not have occurred due to a strong attachment to the gender binary in this field. It’s always seemed odd to me that sex differences in insects, birds, and animals are assumed to provide close analogies to humanity, despite the fact that humans are the only creatures to have the socially constructed concept of gender."
18,0393355489,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6100646-brian-clegg,4,"It seems that books about the myth of gendered minds are somewhat like busses - wait ages for one, then two come along close together. I've already reviewed the superb Inferior by Angela Saini, so it was fascinating to be able to contrast Cordelia Fine's impressive Testosterone Rex.This is a full-on take on the whole business of the ways that men and women aren't (and are) different. You may think that there's no need to do this in today's world. After, all, we all recognise gender equality, don't we? However, not only is it taking a long time for this to percolate through to equal pay (at the time of writing this review there's been quite a fuss about this at the BBC), it's clear that acceptance that the bias still exists is often, at best, skin deep. I was fascinated to see an online argument, started with a post by a (female) physicist on the topic, only to have a string of male scientists, who really should know better, pile in with a combination of denial, excuses, and attempts to counter studies with anecdotes, somehow forgetting that anecdotes are not data.Even more so than with Saini's book, Fine's makes me feel sorry for evolutionary psychologists - these academics are really getting it in the neck with findings that suggest that at least some of their long-held views aren't based on fact. Part of the reason I particularly feel their pain here is that Fine is more full on than Saini: fiery, snarky and writing much more of a polemic than Saini's cool, careful and scientific approach. My suspicion is that the approach taken in Testosterone Rex might have the wider appeal, even though, for me, Saini's book has the edge.Luckily, though, the two titles aren't really competitors. There is a strong overlap of theme, but each has a significantly different focus. Here relationships, sex and everyday life are stressed more (down to those infuriating 'girls' and 'boys' aisles in toyshops), while Inferior came particularly from the viewpoint of the influence of gender bias on education and careers, scientific careers in particular.I found Testosterone Rex an enjoyable read (I hate the name, though in fairness, Fine does spend a lot of pages on the misunderstanding of the influence of testosterone and how, for example, trading floors are not so much testosterone-fueled as testosterone-generating). The book did sometimes feel a tad repetitive, as in the end it's a vast series of examples illustrating the same point. And, for me, there was also too much about animals. Having established early on that we are very different, even from the other primates, and that there was no point in using animal examples as 'natural' behaviour for us, there didn't seem any point continuing with the animal stories. If you enjoy a good piece of punchy, persuasive writing, but are still to be convinced that 'boys will be boys' or that 'women are naturally less inclined to jobs requiring assertiveness or aggression' this is a must read. If you are already fully committed to equality, you will also enjoy having your beliefs reinforced. Sadly, some will still see this as political correctness gone mad. It's not - it's about getting the scientific basis right, rather than rolling out the same dated and simply incorrect arguments."

This is a subject that is of interest to many but the language was not really inclusive. This book was clearly aimed at academics with a background in gender studies. I felt as if I were in class- and not a class in which we were all taking part in wonderful debates or discussions, but rather a class where I felt that I had to sift through jargon to really appreciate the full impact of what was being said. "
20,0393355489,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7197098-richard,3,"Written by an Australian professor who challenges the idea that human sexuality is binary and fixed, I like her style of arguing, where she begins by carefully summarizing the evidence behind something, and then shows how looking at the whole story may show a different conclusion.For decades, sociobiologists have pointed out that, biologically, females are severely limited in their total number of potential descendants — you can only become pregnant so many times — but males can have a near infinite number of progeny. Supposedly, that fact makes males more prone to promiscuity — get as many genes out there as possible — while females tend to be more concerned about protecting the (relatively) few children they can personally deliver.Cordelina Fine repeats that argument, but then shows how in reality men have far fewer options than you’d think. In a band of hunter-gatherers, which typically number no more than 100-150 people, the women might each have — maximum — ten babies or something in their lifetimes, but that also means the women are pregnant most of the time and therefore off limits for reproduction. If you do all the math, you’ll find that men can realistically have only a few more babies than the women. In other words, don’t assume that men will evolve to be more risk-loving or more aggressive just because you assume they can theoretically have more babies; in fact, there is good evidence that women are often just as aggressive risk-takers.Well, I was all excited about this line of reasoning. The book continues with many other examples from neuroscience and biochemistry that show how the story about women vs. men is much more complicated than we tend to blindly accept. Page after page she runs through examples that violate this supposed rule.Unfortunately, I don’t think the author made her case. She points out exceptions to the sociobiological arguments – all interesting and worthwhile to consider –but when I think deeper I’m reminded that the most she does is show that men and women are more alike than they are different, hardly a provocative conclusion. The point remains that men and women are different in some important ways, and not all the differences are “better” for the man.She never mentions violence, for example. It’s easy to forget that, until very recently, men were often, regularly killed, in wars, in brawls, in stupidity. Even today, men are way over-represented in jails, psychiatric wards, homelessness, and many more awful situations. A good explanation of biology can’t just complain that there aren’t enough women CEOs.My biggest problem with her book, though, is that it ignores partnerships. A man or woman is not the fundamental unit of society. Families are. Successful families work together, without obsessing over how the credit or blame is allocated. If you’re on a team, the issue is whether everyone is better off as a whole, and relative to their alternatives.If evolution worked strictly at the individual organism level, then the author has some interesting new ways to see the facts. But evolution doesn't care about you or me as individuals. Do gender differences make human groups _as a whole_ more productive or less so? This book tries to make the case that gender is not relevant, but I wasn't convinced."
21,0393355489,http://goodreads.com/user/show/35789244-paul,5,"This is both a brilliant and hilarious book. I've always thought the only essential difference culturally between women and men was that men spit and women didn't. This book is a great refutation of patriarchal society and the studies (always by men) that confirmed their pre-existing biases. To me, it's incredible to what lengths rich white men will go to develop theories that back up their starting point, which is--the way we are is normative, and I'll prove it by going back and showing that during evolution, men always grunted, spit and were ferocious, and women were homemakers and knew their place.This book is so well-researched that 40 percent of it is notes. Fine digs up amazing studies that refute most of what is laughingly called ""evolutionary psychology"" and refutes many male-biased interpretations of evolutionary biology. We have evolved past caveman society, but no caveman--or anyone at all (I'm talking to you, King John of England, re: 1215 at Runnymede) wants to willingly give up power once they have attained it. Thus we get such ridiculous ideas as The Divine Right of Kings and Droit du seigneur. People in power will make up any outlandish scheme or philosophy they think people will buy to assure people out of power that god just ordained the people in power to be in power.Well, guess what? The world has changed radically since 1215 and continues to change at an increasingly rapid pace. Blacks are actually human beings! Women should be able to vote and inherit property! All humans are created equal! Democracy generally works better than monarchy. Fine is not the first to point out the emperor's new clothes, but she sure does it in the funniest way.I would highly recommend this book to anyone interested in the truth."

I really enjoyed this audiobook - the narrator was fantastic, btw. I will admit that often when I read science writing I feel like I am eating my peas. (Well, not really because I like peas and in truth they are not really healthy, but that is the expression and people think its weird when you say it is like eating really gross things like tinned sardines or flourless chocolate cake.) But this book was really a fun read, and well researched to boot. The animal behavior information was truly fascinating. My only issue is that where research does not fully support her hypothesis, Fine simply ""yadda yadda yadda's"" it. She finds a story where it doesn't disprove her position and says it like its truth. And it might be the truth but it also might not, and the potential evidence of difference based on testosterone might in fact have some truth to it. But for Fine the question doesn't even exist, she glosses right over it. So read it with a critical eye, but read it, good and good for you."
23,0393355489,http://goodreads.com/user/show/38036772-annie,4,"This was fantastic, packed with incredibly interesting research, but packaged in a jokesy, light voice. Cordelia Fine’s thesis is this: she rejects the “testosterone rex” viewpoint, which is basically sexual essentialism, or the idea that biological differences like testosterone can explain our behaviour; it says that men are Manly Men and women are Wispy Women. Cordelia Fine agrees that biology certainly has a role in our behaviour, but it’s always entangled with culture- and in fact, culture has the upper hand and our socialization controls far more of our behaviour than our biological sex does, and that what we consider “masculine” or “feminine” is basically a myth. And she backs this up with some cool research. I’ve reproduced some of my favourites below.>> When you look at traits traditionally classified as “masculine” (e.g. independent, confident, logical, dominant) and traits traditionally classified as “feminine” (e.g. emotional, dependent, empathic, cooperative), you’ll find that actually, they aren’t linked at all. So for instance, a person who has the “masculine” trait of dominance is no more likely to have the other masculine traits than he is the “feminine” ones. Basically, these labels are totally arbitrary in practice and there aren’t “two kinds” of human nature. We’re just mosaics of personality traits of all kinds. >> Feminists have more orgasms than women who view themselves as submissive to men—and their partners also report more sexual satisfaction. >> Plenty of animal species out there where the females do the courting. It’s not as “natural” for men to chase women than we think. >> Traits like “risk-taking” are traditionally ascribed to men—but that’s because what’s considered a “risk-taking” behaviour are things men happen to do (say, contact football or boxing). But women do just as many risk-taking behaviours (like cheerleading, riding horses, pairs skating—all are just as likely to result in serious injuries or death as male sports). Even going on a date carries a serious risk of assault for women, but they do it all the time. Or pregnancy: in the United States, being pregnant is 20x more likely to result in death than sky-diving. Let that sink in for a second. >> Studies find that women perceive higher risks to themselves and society from hazards like nuclear power, smoking, and ozone pollution. Testosterone rex theory would say that women have evolved to be more cautious since they’re the ones who care for offspring. But when you divide that research by ethnicity as well as sex, it’s only one subgroup that stands out from the rest. Society seems to be a safer place to white males than it did to all other groups- white women, women of colour, AND all men of colour. What at first appeared to be a sex difference was actually a difference between white males and everyone else. A subgroup of white men who were particularly cavalier about risk were white men who well-educated, rich, and politically conservative, as well as more trusting of institutions and authorities. These men are likely to agree with statements like “We have gone too far with equal rights in this country” and “Problems in society today come from the decline in the traditional family.” But surveys of more sexually egalitarian countries, like Sweden, don't find a difference between men and women in what they perceive to be a risk (however, the difference still appears in terms of race and immigration status). >> In hypothetical financial risk games (“pretend you have $1000, do you want to invest it in a risky stock that could pay off big, or a low-risk stock that will pay off less, but be more reliable?”), men are much more likely to take risks than women. However, when the financial risk is real (i.e. researchers hand them a dollar they get to keep, and say they can try to invest it in a risky endeavour that pays off big, or a more steady investment that pays off less but is more consistent) there’s no sex difference at all. This suggests that the initial difference is because the male participants want to appear bold and confident to the researchers, but when there’s real money on the line, that wins out over their desire to appear confident and “manly.” "
24,0393355489,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10298127-anne,0,"A few months ago I had a long discussion with a male friend about gender equality. I think we were talking (at some points exclaiming loudly) for at least half an hour on a range of topics within this subject. Generally, my friend feels that men and women are biologically wired to have certain inclinations and behaviour, while I think that there is no correlation between having ovaries and being extremely good at changing diapers and/or enjoying telling a child to eat broccoli. The discussion got heated, since we were both so sure that we were the ones in the right. The reason that we agreed to disagree was that neither of us could back up our views with data (I knew some statistics but not that many). Cordelia Fine would say that my friend is a firm believer in Testosterone Rex: the belief that the behavioural differences between the sexes are caused by testosterone. She convincingly shows that for over half a century, research into gender and sex has been exaggerating the differences between men and women, not through some evil plot, but simply because gender bias is so deeply ingrained in our minds (so that for example an experiment about risk taking only represents traditionally male factors as risks).She touches upon everything my friend talked about: how in the animal world males are always the providers, the hunters, not the caretakers; how hormones make men and women better at certain tasks than others; how hormones make men and women enjoy certain taks and roles and activities and detest others. Fine convincingly refutes all these arguments and gives you plenty of evidence to the contrary to boot. For instance, she writes about an experiment on testosterone levels in men who took care of their babies, which shows that testosterone levels can diminish or increase according to the situation a man is in.I enjoyed the topic and I can wholeheartedly recommend this book to anyone interested in the topic or to anyone who thinks men and women are ""better natural [insert false stereotype here]"". I was a bit distracted at the end because the book gets a bit repetitive - for example, the chapter about financial risks felt redundant after the long discussion on risk patterns in an earlier chapter. But overall I would say it's very readable for the layman and while I had really hoped to be more enthusiastic about it, it was still worth the read and I learned some new and interesting things. Maybe I should buy my friend a copy."
25,0393355489,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2209427-holly,4,"This isn't a perfect book, but it's pretty good. I found it useful for the way it refutes commonplace arguments about maleness:Beyond the genitals, sex is surprisingly dynamic, and not just open to influence from gender constructions, but reliant on them. Nor does sex inscribe us with male brains and female brains, or with male natures and female natures. There are no essential male or female characteristics--not even when it comes to risk tasking and competitiveness, the traits so often called on to explain why men are more likely to reach the top.I also found it useful in its critique of how often we treat our assumptions as fact, and the way women's behavior is invisible and/or unintelligible to male researchers, skewing what we think of as ""science"":although women routinely take risks, these often seem to slip under the research radar. For example, with divorce rates hovering close to 50 percent, being the one to quit or scale back your job when children arrive is a significant economic risk. Going on a date can end in sexual assault. Leaving a marriage is financially, socially and emotionally risky. In the United States, being pregnant is about 20 times more likely to result in death than is a sky dive.... None of which is to say that existing assessments of sex differences in risk taking aren't informative, interesting, and valid. However they also reflect implicitly gendered assumptions about what risk taking is. The reported gender gap in risk taking would almost certainly narrow if researchers' questionnaires started to include more items like How likely is it that you would bake an impressive but difficult souffle for an important dinner party, risk misogynist backlash by writing a feminist opinion piece, or train for a lucrative career in which there's a high probability of sex-based discrimination or harassment?It's an excellent point."
26,0393355489,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2198250-nikki,1,"Another attempt to tell us that gender differences--what we consider feminine or masculine characteristics--are not genetically determined, rather they are ""adaptive traits"" which are ""socially constructed"". OK, whatever...Why does this matter? Well, if our gender differences are social constructs, then they can be manipulated--changed. And at the heart of this book is the desire to do just that. Fine believes that to address issues such as the pay gap and sexual harassment we must first fix these ""gender constructions"". I'm always puzzled when I read about a scientist who thinks they can culturally manipulate what evolution has created over millions of years.To be more specific, Fine challenges the belief that testosterone is responsible for typically masculine traits. I have two simple questions for Fine, which were not addressed in her book:1. If testosterone does not affect aggressive behavior, why do we castrate our male animals in order to make them docile and more manageable?2. If testosterone does not affect competitive behavior, why is it a controlled substance which athletic association routinely test for?(If you think my review is too tedious, you do not want to read this book!)"
27,0393355489,http://goodreads.com/user/show/92729266-emma,4,I agree with some reviews that it is an info dump but I think that’s also the point. It’s supposed to throw so much data at you that you must challenge your previous views because they do not align. The purpose of this book seems to not be clear to everyone but I believe the way the author summarizes it in the last chapter is now that you have all this data you have no excuses to raise girls and boys differently anymore. Eleventh grade AP Comp would have me describe this book as a call to action. It calls for radical change in society. I love the quote on pg. 176; “The reaction was a timely reminder that to refer to gender debates as ‘spirited’ can be like describing the surface of the sun as ‘warm.’” This book is good for you if you’re interested in the brain sex debate or social conditioning.

30,0393355489,http://goodreads.com/user/show/16080726-sabin,2,"I'm in two minds about Cordelia Fine's achievements in this book. On the one hand, she crafts a very good and thorough argument for gender equality, attacking every conceivable statement which tries to make the existing gaps seem inevitable. Her arguments are filled with data taken from scientific studies and meta-analyses of the scientific literature. She explains that even some of the science is biased and concludes, many times over, that all the large gaps between the genders stem from cultural biases, which have constantly been reinforced throughout history. And based on the evidence she presents, I can do nothing else but wholeheartedly agree with her conclusions of culturally enforce artificial gender differences.On the other hand, the book is utterly repetitive. She states her conclusions from the start of the book, her arguments develop only slightly - repeating her conclusions over and over again, usually taking a popular counter-argument and battering it to a pulp and by pouring on it study after study which finds even a smidgen of evidence to support her claim. She tries to justify this aggressive crusade against gender-inequality by exaggerating the opposition. I scanned Joe Haldeman's book, Testosterone, for those glaring omissions she attributes to it – keeping testosterone only in the realm of male achievements. He does not omit to include the effects of testosterone in women and does mention the fuzziness of the results. I agree with her, though, that his tone is somewhat dismissive of the role testosterone plays in women's bodies and brains, but it's hard to distinguish between her presentation of real data and her consistently one-sided interpretation.She speaks of deeds, not words, to use in the fight for gender equality. But I'm afraid she misinterprets her mantra and uses words as a flurry of punches which hit everything and everyone who happens to be near her intended targets."

Fine is a skill-full, witty, insightful, and above all scientifically ruthless writer. Her greatest appeal is that she brings sharp objectivity to such an emotionally-charged discussion, and helps defend feminist and queer ideals with logic, fact, and perspective. One of the best books released this year, full of new information for me even though I read the psychology and neuroscience literature regularly. A heroic book.Fine begins with an elegant challenge to Darwin’s theory of sexual selection. This echoes the broad themes of Evolution’s Rainbow, but it des not appear in the references and the arguments are refined with greater precision and clarity. Sexual selection theory, which states that the low-investment sperm production in males mandates a competitive, aggressive, promiscuous mating strategy which cannot benefit females is supported by very little evidence. The 1945 study by Bateman with fruit flies which is often cited as the first impirical evidence of this showed “ The outcome of Bateman’s six series of matchmaking was the first scientific report of greater male variation in reproductive success. For example, 21 per cent of males failed to produce any off-spring, compared with only 4 per cent of females.” Yet Fine cites recent meta-analyses of Bateman’s own data which showed that the mutant fly lines he used to detect paternity of offspring overcounted fathers and underrepresented maternal mutations, and that his own findings showed greater offspring survival in promiscuous females. “ Proposed gains of female promiscuity include genetic benefits, healthier offspring, and the opportunity to set up sperm competitions that weed out inferior specimens.” Using statistics to explain poor analysis and biased publication of positive results, Fine show that there is just as much evidence that the traditionally “male” mating strategy is effective for females in some environments, and equally the “female” strategy can be effective for males. I particularly enjoyed the numerical analysis of the fecundity of a single man achieving more than 100 one-night-stands a year, still less likely than a monogamous man of fathering a single baby. “ (Indeed, a promiscuous man would need to have sex with more than 130 women just to have 90 per cent odds of outdoing the one baby a monogamous man might expect to father in a year.)” This simplistic view of “mating strategies” is made to seem outdated and juvenile.Fine then attacks the biology underlying these ecological assumptions, the idea that there are hard-wired genetics programmes, boulstered by hormones, which then dictate how a person will live their life. “ To confuse human (cultural) sexuality and (natural) reproduction is classically pseudo-scientific.” She dispels the idea that the most attractive men are wealthy and powerful whereas the most attractive women are merely young, by pooling data from dozens of cultures from urban China “But an analysis of actual matches made through an online dating Web site in China found that likes-attract again provided a much better explanation of the data than did potentials-attract.” to hunter-gatherer societies which demonstrated that humans are more attracted to those that they share traits in common with than there architypes. Fine shows that women underperform in laboratory tasks after being primed that these are “masculine” tasks as a form of social defence, and that ficticious male job applications are actually considered more favourably if the candidate admits to being poor at traditionally “feminine” activities. “ For many decades, researchers supposed that masculinity and femininity are polar ends of a single dimension: someone high in masculinity is therefore necessarily low in femininity, and vice versa.” Even the single traditionally masculine dimension of risk-taking is shown to be an uncorrelated mix of different psychological assessments of different situations (those who gamble are no more likely to take health or ethical risks etc.), and that findings that women are more risk averse also apply to dozens of other populations in society whom also face discrimination. “ Society seemed a significantly safer place to white males than it did to all other groups, including nonwhite men.” It is very difficult to objectively make a case that this T-Rex “hyper male” persona exists within the male population, and is not an extrapolation that blends many historical time periods and cultures into something fictional.“ These very open-ended outcomes would be more easily achieved by a developmental pathway that runs from sex to socialization to the brain (and hormones, as we’ll come to in a later chapter), rather than by an inflexible direct path from sex to brain.”Arguments for the essential, and probable, role of environment in human behaviour over hard-wired genetic determinism is skilfully and logically made. Queer identities are not the main focus of this book but are dealt with using sensitivity and intelligence. “If most of us were intersex in some way or another, the ubiquitous question, “Is it a boy or a girl?” wouldn’t be so compelling. And if the shape of our external genitalia fell on a continuum, with the majority of people in an ambiguous midrange shape, it’s an interesting question whether our sex would play such a key role in how we present ourselves to the world.” I hope to see future writing from her which might expand some of these tantalising hints.Fine’s treatment of the animal literature of sex differences is droll, thorough, and erudite. “ The development of testes from an “androgynous” gonad is an active, gene-directed process, but in the absence of the potent, male SRY gene, ovarian tissue just… happens, as the default?” She reveals amazingly underpublicized results. For example, male rats will care for young if there is no female in the cage to do it for them, showing that they have all the same innate behavioural tools as females. Also, chemically castrated macaques of high social status do not lose their power, aggression, or mating opportunities in the absence of testosterone. In many animals, including fish with whopping testicles, social status trusts blood testosterone levels and scientists are beginning to believe that hormones respond to social heirarchies, rather than a linear system the other way round. ““Social events regulate gonadal events.” Or to put it another way, just in case the significance of this sailed past unnoticed, cichlid testes are a social construction.” Even differences in hypocampal dendrites between the sexes are so condition-specific that it is impossible to even ascribe a “male” or “female” profile. “In other words, brief stress exposure reverses the “sex difference” for that particular brain characteristic.” Is being stressed more truly “male” than being relaxed, and which types of being stressed? Overall, this is a scholarly criticism of the often oversimplified debate surrounding sex/gender associated anatomy and the erroneous leap that this represents thinking. I could not fault the science or the writing. I’m just sad that it’s finished now.“Science writer and behavioural endocrinologist Richard Francis coined the term “Testosterone Rex” to poke fun at the mistaken conception of testosterone as a “super-actor”—the “plenipotent executor of selection’s demands” that simply “takes care of everything.””"
36,0393355489,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5847899-patrick,3,"When I picked this up, I thought this book might be about to try to persuade me that there are no innate differences between men and women beyond those that are self-evident, and that the differences we think might exist are all merely the result of social conditioning. And that is not actually what this book claims - it is, after all  nature and nurture but still...The book demolishes a particular cartoon 'biological essentialist' version of sex differences, and there probably are those who do actually subscribe to such a view (though I doubt any of them would pick this book up) but it did feel like it was skewering a straw man. All of which is fine, but very often, Fine seems to leave the balance to the footnotes. And while I'm in no way expert enough to offer my own informed view, I got the impression that she was sometimes being very deliberately selective in the studies she refers to in order to strengthen her pre-existing point of view ('policy-based evidence making as a long-time colleague put it, albeit in a very different context).For example, she does quite a good job of rubbishing the idea that all men are driven on some level by a desire to obtain a harem, but then I think she pushes the argument too far in trying to imply, without ever quite saying it, that there are no real differences between (the average) men and women's attitudes to casual sex at all. The fact that she cites in support a study by Teela Sanders about the fact that men who visit prostitutes very often go back to the same person over and over, but never stops to look at what I'd regard as the more fundamental question of why almost all prostitution is servicing the desires of male clients is just one example. And it turns out that the stuff she has at the beginning about fruit flies' mating behaviours is also a fairly selective version of the wider evidence on the topic (though I had to google that to find it out).As a whole, the book seemed uneven in that a great deal of space is given to how we are shaped by our social environment, and even how it can shape our very biology, but questions of how biology might shape the social world we construct are not really given much of an airing.All the same, I thought there was a fair amount of interest to found here: For example, the chapter on risk-taking, examining in more detail the cliched idea that men tend to take more risk than women was a quite illuminating exploration of what we actually mean by 'risk taking'. The idea, in particular that the concept had been very narrowly defined by those investigating risk-taking differences between the sexes to look specifically at a particular kind of physical risk and that this could be used to build a narrative that the 2008 (and presumably the 1929) financial crash was caused by the testosterone levels of (mainly male) city traders she shows to be a rather simplistic reading of the evidence. She also does quite a good job of questioning the validity of experiments exploring risk-taking or gambling behaviours in artificial environments where absolutely nothing is truly at stake.So worth a read, but not the comprehensive demolition of the idea that there are biologically determined differences between the average man and the average woman that the author sometimes seems to have set out to write."

Fine attempts to shine her light on common conceptions of gender based on outdated scientific views. While some sections were a little too sciencey (which is, of course, unsurprising!), she generally manages to use clear language to convey her argument. I felt a little more sociology might have supported the overall point even further, since gender is one of the ultimate multidisciplinary fields of this moment.I'd highly recommend this book to anyone who feels their blood boil when someone argues men are simply more likely to cheat, women are more caring because genes and 'boys will be boys'.

This almost deadpan start sets the scene for a witty riposte to those who insist on the testosterone myth that we, modern men and women, are fixed in an ancestral past that rewarded competitive males and caring females.Winner of the 2017 Royal Society Science Book Award, Testosterone Rex brings together evolutionary science, psychology, neuroscience and social history to move beyond old ‘nature versus nurture’ debates, and to explain ‘I think you’ll find it’s more complicated than men are from Mars and women are from Venus‘ and therefore why it’s time to unmake the tyrannical myth of Testosterone Rex. The author, Cordelia Fine, is a professor of the history and philosophy of science at the University of Melbourne. Fine’s earlier two books; A mind of its own (2006) and Delusions of gender (2010) were similarly insightful, intellectually pugnacious and drolly written. I remember being annoyed reading A mind of its own, making copious margin notes as I went - for me usually a good sign that a book has a lot to say and is challenging my existing ideas and/or sparking off new ones. Like Jonathan Swift, Fine is a writer who will “vex the world rather than divert it.” A worthy recipient of the Royal Society science book award.Fine tackles many of the classic experiments that have led to our myths around testosterone, maleness and competitiveness. One such example is a chapter long denouement of A. J. Bateman’s 1940s experiments on fruit flies and its later (1960s) elaboration by biologist Robert Trivers, which resulted in the almost universally accepted “Bateman’s principle” that males would do best (pace Darwin) by competing with other males in order to spread their cheap, mass-produced sperm among as many females as possible - while females should protect their precious eggs and be as selective as possible. Fine counters these experiments and the conclusions drawn from them, canvassing a large body of contemporary research that looks not only at the conclusions drawn, sexually reluctant females and promiscuous males, in addition underlining the biases that Bateman introduced, prejudicing his own results. All this is achieved with witty referencing to Maserati-driving boyfriends and the ever popular tails of the male Peacock.Fine then moves on to dismember the arguments that airily tie together sexual selection, evolutionary biology and consumer behaviour such as a Maserati -driving male giving a pair of Bulgari sunglasses as a male flaunting their resources. Fine asserts that for humans sexuality is far more than for reproduction. Reminding us: humans routinely engage in sexual pairings and acts, that not only often don’t - but actually can’t - lead to pregnancy. There are also many human sexual activities, like touching, kissing, and oral sex that likewise have no reproductive potential.The idea that we we have only to peel away the veneer of culture, learning, habit, fantasy and the true (natural) sexual being will emerge is pseudoscience - it is profoundly mistaken.Having demolished the past Rex myths Fine then proceeds to wittily tackle the current testosterone myths. If you were wondering Why can’t a woman be more like a man? or Are males (naturally) more risk-taking? Will I become a monstrous sexual predator if I increase the testosterone in my bloodstream? or If the Lehman brothers were sisters would we have had the recent global financial crisis? then read Testosterone Rex.Fine concludes with a grand challenge. Words are nice but often deeds are better - become less polite and more disruptive. Sexual equality is more than a lovely idea in principle. The science, Fine reveals, of Testosterone Rex does not block the path to a better place - it is our complacency in ‘waiting’ patiently for an evolutionary change to occur. Thinking that men are from Mars and women are from Venus is about our values not science.This review was first posted here: http://dragonlaughing.tumblr.com/post... "

“So what happens when a scientist, under controlled laboratory conditions, simulates a first-wave feminist rodent movement by placing males in cages with pups but no females? Before too long you will see the male “mothering” the infant, in much the same way that females do. Feminism: 1. Sexual selection: nil.”
 Delusions of Gender: How Our Minds, Society, and Neurosexism Create Difference is one of my favorite psychology/science books of all-time: it’s funny, it’s clever, and it’s devastatingly sharp in cutting away the illusionist veil that many people still pretend hangs over the divide between boys and girls.So when its scientific successor,  Testosterone Rex: Myths of Sex, Science, and Society, came out, I knew I had to get my hands on it as soon as possible. And, as expected, it’s as good as the first – though I have to admit I enjoyed it slightly less because I’m not as hardcore into biology and hormones as I am into psychology. But that’s purely a personal preference.In this book, psychologist and researcher  Cordelia Fine takes a good, hard look at the influence of the hormone testosterone on humans and gender – effectively separating its presumed influence, and its scientific and biological influence. Just as in her previous book, she picks apart both research and popular or common opinion, giving us readers a critical overview of what testosterone does do and what it doesn’t. (Or what we might simply assume it to do rather than what it actually does.)I’ve heard people accuse Fine of cherry picking scientific data and not being able to explain away certain discrepancies in gender – such as higher statistics for men in terms of crime and rape – with her explanations and expositions of the workings of testosterone.I respectfully disagree. What Fine shows us with this book is that causal relations cannot just be applied to any and all things without evidence, or without critically examining just what such a causal relation might imply. An example of this would be, “If men are statistically more likely to commit a crime than women, then it must be due to testosterone, because that marks the main/biggest biological difference between men and women!”.I can see how someone could arrive at such a conclusion, but: in human nature, combining both psychology and biology, it’s almost impossible to subscribe an effect to one single variable (in this case, subscribing higher crime rates in men to testosterone). Especially with hormones, the interaction of a hormone with its host and that host’s direct environment can have a huge effect on the workings of said hormone.Not to mention that a variable might play a much smaller role than initially expected.Fine dives into both of these lines of thoughts (complex interaction versus actual role) into this book, which leads to a bunch of very interesting reinterpretations of existing research. She steps outside of the simple paradigm that says, “X makes Y happen” and looks at what exactly constitutes X, what influences both X and Y, and is it actually true that X makes Y happen?It’s a solid, well-researched book that doesn’t shy away from using field jargon (so be warned if you’re not fully at home in psychology/biology research) and forces its readers to look at common assumptions in a different way. Even as a fellow psychologist, it taught me a lot, and gave me plenty of insights to ponder upon.It’s also funny and wittily written, which makes it a more pleasant read throughout the drier research material. (Though doubtlessly some will find Fine’s references to feminism and jokes about sexism offensive.)"
42,0393355489,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3611893-dearbhla,5,"I read Fine's Delusions of Gender a few years ago and really enjoyed it, so when I saw she had another one coming out I knew I had to order it. It is just as good as Delusions, and I would recommend it to anyone to read.

In this book Fine takes a look at testosterone and asks is it really the reason behind financial crisis, risk taking, and the differences between the sexes. the short answer is no. The slightly longer, but still short version is that it has an important role to play but it is equally as important as all other hormones in the human body. For more go read the book, it is fascinating, interesting, funny and very readable. Fine has a great style. She weaves personal anecdotes in with scientific studies as well as her own speculation. She counters arguments with facts and figures, but never in a dry and boring way.It is also a most quotable book, if you follow me on tumblr you may have noticed, if not click here for a selection and if that doesn't prompt you to think about trying this book I don't know what will.One of my very favourite lines is Social events regulate gonadal events. I think it should be my new motto.But apart from the writing style what she says in the book is important. She never says that there aren't differences between men and women, but she emphasizes that we cannot accurately tell what is causing those differences. From the moment we are born we are influenced by both genes and environment, and sometimes environment has a greater influence. Never mind the fact that when you average everything out there are more differences between men (or women) than between the sexes. Also, sex is a spectrum, not an either or. Stereotypes and hardline ""men are like this"" views do nobody any good.People are people, and people are different to people in many many ways. And society and experience do a lot to shape people. If you think about the idea behind ""privilege"" for example you can see that influences how people of differing backgrounds see and act. It isn't what you were born with, it is how society around you that shapes what you were born with.I've skimmed a few of the negative reviews on Goodreads and many of them seem to say ""I don't agree with this so it is wrong"" and some say that Fine wants to proclaim that there are no differences between men and women. Well, I've read the book and she makes it perfectly clear that there are differences, both in humans and in other species, what she is looking at is how innate those differences are and can they be altered? Also across the whole species are the differences really there. And in some cases she argues that, yes, they are. In others no, the variables even out across a large sample. Fine also points to numerous studies that show that just because X has been the way for so long, it doesn't mean it can't ever be altered.Of course I came to the book on her side, so maybe I'm just agreeing with her because it supports my view of the world. I'm not a scientist and am not about to go through hundreds of studies in an attempt to prove myself wrong. However I have skimmed through some of those ""men are from mars"" type books, you know the sort that try to argue that all relationship differences exist because men are like this while women are like that, and in most cases I don't identify with the version of womanhood that they portray. So maybe I'm just an outlier, or maybe there is more to being a person than what is between your legs."

Blasphemy! To have the nerve to say that Jacques Derrida, the untalented soccer player turned state paid prophet does not understand advanced math would be a something like saying ""in France, Winters can get pretty cold."" Those statements have hurt only the egos of the many academic bureaucrats who have built a well paid career by mindlessly singing odes to the Emperor's new clothes. And by publishing Intellectual Impostures the world got to see how many academics were scurrying to hide their nakedness behind century old desks.Cordelia Fine deals a new blow to the impostors. Say one Gijsbert Stoet who can declare: In the stone age, it was useful for men to be hunters and women to look after babies, and nature has helped by encoding some of these skills in the hardware of our brain. That still influences how we think today although he never encountered live stone age hominids, unless his priestly confessor can do channeling. That was written in jest, anybody can tell stone age people don't have souls as the precede the Garden of Eden by some 100.000 years. And is paid as a professor and researched by the British state to do his rain dance. In this sick Medieval game Cordelia Fine tries to bring some light.In the end, there is no controversy, only mostly old white men scared that their prized male offsprings will not enjoy their level of privilege because of some sort of biblical reenactment with the feminists playing Eve giving once more the dumb Adam the fruit of knowlege."
45,0393355489,http://goodreads.com/user/show/47667703-chris-chapman,5,"This is an awesome, exhaustively researched book, and yes it is readable. Read my GR friend Trevor's review, it says it all:https://www.goodreads.com/review/show...Just to add, it is interesting what this book says about one of the acrimonious debates in feminism - which I'll crassly summarise as smash the patriarchy vs lean in. Lean In: Women, Work, and the Will to Lead being Sheryl Sandberg's book which encourages women to work within the system but to much more aggressively put themselves forward and refuse to be ignored/underpaid/touched up etc. Fine doesn't mention the book but she does suggest the Lean In approach, as well as not only ignoring and leaving intact the structural barriers that exclude women, may also simply not work. She quotes one study which found that both female and male graduates of high-powered MBA courses were equally forthright in negotiating the pay package when they landed their first job. But guess what? Women's demands were met less often than men's. Because Fine's book is about hormones, her point is that it's not hormones that make men more aggressive in negotiating etc. It could just be, that after being knocked back again and again, maybe you just give up? The cost/benefit analysis is going to be different.I'm not going to downgrade my star rating because of the chirpy and not funny ""this is a science book but don't worry it's accessible"" stuff, which I imagine is a feature of a lot of popular science writing (I haven't read much, I'm just guessing). "
46,0393355489,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7089145-alisha,3,"3.5 stars.....more to come later but this was a mix of some really great science and a little bit of reaching too far to make conclusions that the author holds near and dear. Speculation is always allowed and even fruitful but there needs to be a clear delineation between fact and what has been surmised from that (this was starkly clear in the chapter regarding hormones and I was disappointed to find that the author spent an inordinate amount of time on testosterone and none on estrogen). I also felt that the book suffered from uneven handling of the many animal studies; sometimes they were used to show that humans are different and we can't use the results from those studies to compare to humans.....and then when the results of the studies aligned with an idea that the author liked then suddenly the results of those studies were extrapolated to humans as well. This hearkens back to the old saying - ""when you're a hammer everything looks like a nail""."
47,0393355489,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1058994-ryan-mishap,5,"Combined with her previous book--Delusions of Gender--this is crucial reading that shows how little difference there is between these so-called immutable genders our society has created. This book shatters the testosterone excuse for how men behave and explores the real evolutionary story in light of our cultures, traditions, and power relations.All around brilliant: as science writing, it is straight-forward, well argued, and hilarious. She also boldly claims to be a feminist writing a feminist science book--no doubt this will land her many detractors who will focus on her supposed bias instead of on the research she illuminates.Go, read this now."
48,0393355489,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1045774-mehrsa,4,"Interesting research about gender differences. Testosterone is not as determinative as previously thought. I think the debunking of the myth is useful and asking questions and doing more research on gender is important, but I wasn't sure she made quite the case that she tried to make about the lack of meaningful differences. I want to read more by her though to see if her other books are more thorough. "
49,0393355489,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6262367-abby,2,"Not nearly as interesting as her first book (Delusions of Gender). I felt like she was just making the same point (humans are complicated and not ruled by gender-specific hormones) for 300 pages.

52,0393355489,http://goodreads.com/user/show/30924713-kramer-thompson,3,"I am very new to the science behind gender/sex differences and similarities, and I found Testosterone Rex quite interesting. Fine discusses quite a variety of ways that the sexes are purportedly distinct, and argues that under scrutiny we discover that they are actually not so different. Many of the studies she cites to back these views up are very interesting, and she presents most of the topics in a very accessible way.That said, at times it seemed like she might have been arguing against a strawman. For example, at the beginning of one chapter Fine notes one quote by David Schmitt, who states that male humans have the ability to lend their sperm in the conception of 100 offspring within a single month by mating with many (100) different women. She then spends a large section of that chapter demonstrating how implausible this is. But what's really important is not whether male humans could produce 100 offspring a month, but merely whether they could consistently produce a significantly higher amount of offspring by acting polygynously than could female humans. This would suggest that male polygyny could be adaptive and thus that the tendency for men to act polygynously could be an adaptation. Of course it is implausible that men could produce 100 offspring in a month. But could they produce 1 a month? 2? 5? Fine does state afterwards that the males of some tribes whose behaviour probably resembles that of humans over much of our evolutionary history are expected to produce a maximum of 12-16 children, and women of those tribes 9-12. This suggests that a strategy of male polygyny would not be significantly more adaptive than monogamy, so there probably would not be an adaptation for male polygyny. I would have much preferred detailed examination of Fine's latter claim regarding the maximum offspring able to be produced by men in tribes that purportedly resemble humans throughout much of our evolutionary history. It seems to me that such discussion would be more relevant to serious debates about the adaptiveness of male polygyny. However, I get the impression that there are people who take serious, hardline approaches that are very similar to the ones Fine argues against in Testosterone Rex. Perhaps these people do believe that male humans can really produce 100 offspring a month, or at least some similarly absurdly high number. If that's the case, then I see the merit of Fine's discussion of the unlikelihood of men fathering 100 children a month. Of course, this is just one section among a larger book, and much of the book was not similarly frustrating. To summarise: much of the book was interesting; some parts seemed to be arguing against strawmen, but; it may be that these arguments are actually not strawmen (depending on the views of Fine's dialectical partners). In order to determine whether Fine successfully and absolutely defeats all aspects of the Testosterone Rex belief system I will have to read more about the differences (or lack thereof) between the sexes. Thanks to Cordelia Fine's interesting explication of and argumentation regarding these topics, I plan on undertaking such further education."
53,0393355489,http://goodreads.com/user/show/117566-mauri,3,"I forgot how funny Fine is - she writes in a tightly controlled, ""isn't it amusing how..."" sort of manner that both makes you laugh and realize that she is quite ticked off (and you should be too).In this, Fine tackles research about gender and sex, with a focus on knocking back a lot of the ""boys will be boys"" beliefs society holds dear.For example: male promiscuity. A man can impregnate hundreds of women in the time it takes a woman to gestate and bear one child, which she is usually bound to for years while that same man skips merrily from town to town. Therefore it makes sense that men want sex all the time and women don't. It's reproductively advantageous, duh.Fine merrily pokes holes in all of this. First, what women? Setting aside the number of women within a day's walk of the average caveman, Neolithic farmer, or 1800s city dweller, even in today's jet-setting world how many women are lining up to have sex with an endless line-up of horny men? Not just sex, but baby-making sex? And how many of those women are actually fertile at a given point of time? And while everyone can think of a story they heard about someone getting pregnant off a one night stand, I bet many more can think of couples taking months to conceive. Turns out this reproductive strategy may have only worked out for Genghis Khan and a few other despotic men throughout history, and, Fine points out, maybe that says more about despots than it does about men? In short, a lot of looking at scientific studies done on sex and gender that point out that there maybe? Might have? been a bit of bias going on. Less tightly constructed than Delusions of Gender: How Our Minds, Society, and Neurosexism Create Difference, Fine does meander a bit, but accessible to people whose eyes crossed a bit trying to read Women's Work, Men's Property: The Origins of Gender and Class. (Mine.)"
54,0393355489,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1348540-charlie,3,"Cordelia Fine sets up a well-known stalking horse in the shape of Testosterone Rex the king of hormones with a view to pulling him down and showing him to be a meaningless construct. She uses scientific studies as part of the technique for pulling him down, but also an appeal to ‘our values’. The Testosterone Rex construct which she pulls apart is the idea that boys will be boys, that the presence of testosterone makes men into naturally promiscuous hunters, risk takers and show-offs while the lack of it makes women into careful carers and nurturers. Fine needs to state her T Rex construct at the start of the book in order for the reader to know what she will be arguing against, however, I did not find that she made it clear until afterwards that this was not actually her view of the world. As a result, I nearly put the book down and left it before she was really ready to start. I found a lot of the science interesting, but I was somewhat sad that there was not more evidence for a wider range of elements to the story. The science seemed to be very strongly focussed around the risk-taking area. I guess this is the easiest part of the story to test and verify, but I would personally have liked a bit more stress on other areas too.The book states on the cover that it is a science book prize winner. It does not say it is also a feminist book. I am happy to read either or both kinds of book, but I picked this one up expecting something more dispassionate. The Author is however very passionate, she has a very definite agenda. She makes a good case for it with the evidence she uses, but as a scientist, that passion means that I have to wonder if the evidence she uses is cherry picked to make a point or not. I find that doubt tarnishes some apparently very good, interesting science for me. I would have preferred the science and the passion in two separate books."
55,0393355489,http://goodreads.com/user/show/17594936-colin,4,"I always find it hard to evaluate books like this. There are so many studies into human nature, human behaviour, sex differences, and for me, they raise more questions than they answer. How was that test administered? Were the men and women in the test into risk appetite all the same age? How was the question phrased? I invariably find myself doubting the scientific method, and then in the absence of reliable data points, measuring the writer's interpretation against my own experience. But of course that just means I'm layering my own bias on top of the writer's bias, which in turn is overlaid on the experimenter's experimental design. The result is a superficially plausible narrative, which I know will be contradicted by the next book I read on the same topic.Cordelia Fine does a good job of trying to combat the kinds of folk narrative explanations that thrive in all this confusion. She starts off with one of the hoariest of all - the idea that men have evolved to be unfaithful while women have evolved to be monogamous nest builders. This is one of the best known examples of sociobiology being drafted in to support a conclusion you know the researcher had in mind from the start and wanted to ""prove"". Fine's iconoclasm in taking aim at it seems admirable. She also takes care to present her evidence carefully, showing balanced results and not just trying to claim all the evidence points to one inevitable conclusion. This in marked contrast to - for example - Jordan Peterson who is forever pointing at stuff that happens in nature and implying that we just have to accept that the status quo is here to stay and resistance is futile. Give me a Cordelia Fine over a Jordan Peterson any day of the week. And she won't even tell me to tidy my room. I didn't find my hackles raising at any point, and although she editorialises strenuously on the meaning of the results, she's not trying to press the science into service or (as far as I can tell) manipulate the facts. Fair enough.The general gist is that there are differences between the sexes in some ways but that there was so much social conditioning overlaid on top of that that most of what we think of as immutable human nature can be stripped back if we, as a society, choose to do so. I think I'd put myself a little further towards the Stephen Pinker end of the spectrum but again, that's just me, maybe overlaying what I see around me, how I think and how women I know seem to think, how our daughter developed in what we thought was a fairly stereotype-free household... So it's a hit and miss, subjective interpretation of the facts but can any of us bring any better expertise to bear to judge between the competing claims of the people who have looked inside our brains and reckon they know what they've found there? Probably not."
56,0393355489,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2860188-eduardo-santiago,3,"So much research these days claims to find testosterone-this or hardwired-gender-difference-that. Risk-taking, competitiveness, ability, even childhood toy preference. Cordelia Fine somewhat exasperatedly follows up with crucial context—“the rest of the story,” if you will: yes, but this study didn’t consider corticoid levels; yes, but that other study neglected such-and-such findings; and most crucially yes, but it’s staggeringly difficult to isolate this effect from social and cultural factors. Nevertheless, she persiidentifies clever ways in which these issues have been studied, and the gist is: context matters. A lot.Science requires reproducibility. Reproducible results are best obtained when there are a small number of variables—hard to achieve with something as richly messy as a human life. Once one compensates for the factors overlooked in much research, plus publication bias, plus just plain built-in human bias, few effects survive scrutiny. Yes, we’re different—deliciously so, in my view!—but not in any way that affects ability. Not even in the slightest bit.Fine writes with a sardonic bite that worked well to start with but grew tiresome. I was also highly disappointed in her somewhat off-context quoting of Robert Sapolsky—a hero of mine—and her failure to acknowledge his groundbreaking work decades ago in breaking down testosterone myths. And, dear FSM, what has happened to proofreading? Much as I want to grant four stars, much as I think this is important work that needs to be read, I can only justify three. (Goodreads, could we have fractional stars please?)On a side note, I find myself fortunate to have read this just before and just after the 2018 Women’s March where I was surrounded by thousands of strong, powerful, capable human beings of all genders and colors, many of whom are living under the culturally-imposed “oh, you just aren’t able to do these sorts of things.” All of whom categorically reject that, as does Fine and as do I and, I trust, you. #resist.And on another side note: if you’re interested in these sorts of gender issues, I urge you to listen to this episode of the Hidden Brain podcast in which two progressive parents attempt to raise their children free of gender stereotypes and much loveliness ensues."
57,0393355489,http://goodreads.com/user/show/62793003-cody-mccoy,5,"Testosterone is not what you think it is. This book, cleverly written, does an outstanding job of decimating stereotypical beliefs that boys are boys and girls are girls because of innate, fixed differences. I used to think men were more prone to risk taking than women. It turns out that this isn’t true, for a few reasons! For example:1) risk taking studies have methodological flaws. For example, these studies typically focus on activities that are considered to be male-expertise. Different results are found if you consider female-expertise activities. Would you consider baking a very difficult soufflé for a dinner party? 2) risk taking studies ACTUALLY find that the most high-status people are most likely to take risks. In matrilineal society is women. In western society it is WHITE men followed by women and minorities. Etc.3) the actual risk to women of “risky” events proposed in these studies is MUCH HIGHER than the actual risk to men. Consider: would you go to the bus station at 11 PM for a chance to pick up $100? For whom is that obviously more risky- a 5’10” man or a 5’2” woman? Obviously women need the cash reward to be higher because they are literally facing MORE RISK. Change the situation so men are facing more risk, and the answers change.The book gives a careful data based treatment to many stereotypical beliefs, overturning widely held views about the impact of biological sex and sex hormones on the brain.

58,0393355489,http://goodreads.com/user/show/28668057-jasmine,3,"Cordelia Fine's Delusions of Gender was one of my favorite reads of the year, and so I was excited to pick up this sequel-in-spirit.It started out strong, combining Fine's delightful dry wit with a thorough review/critique of seminal works in the ""male/testestosterone = high risk/high reward = spray & pray mating strategy"" field. She then continued with a review of the many different ways male and female creatures compete for reproductive success. Although while I found this part interesting, I ultimately found tidbits like the two opposite mating strategies of the horned dung beetle to be less useful in my day-to-day experience of the world than the aspects of gender and science described in Delusions of Gender. The final portion I found to be a bit more unfocused. I found myself a little uncertain about what Fine or anyone else in the field takes home from experiments on risk versus reward between men and women. In this portion of the book particularly, she often repeated parts of Delusions of Gender - which left me feeling that perhaps this whole book could have been an extra set of chapters in the earlier volume rather than a stand-alone book.Still, I overall enjoyed the book, and would probably still read another book written by Fine - but I would recommend Delusions of Gender and not this one, as a starting point."
59,0393355489,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4239658-karen-chung,3,"This book was a fairly interesting, quick read, but I ended up convinced that testosterone is still the main source of male-female differences. The book made a lot of good points about how environment and social conditions can adjust the concentration of testosterone in an individual, and how circumstances can bring out ""atypical"" behavior relative to the usual gender stereotypes, such as gentle, nurturing behavior in males. But as I see it, testosterone is still at the core of and key to competitiveness, aggression, and ambition in humans (and probably other animals as well). Women have some too, just not as much, and I believe there is still a strong correlation between testosterone level and ambition and related traits in women. I highly recommend listening to this podcast in conjunction with this book:This American Life: Testosteronehttps://www.thisamericanlife.org/220/...Transcript:https://www.thisamericanlife.org/220/...It left a deep impression on me, and also adds a lot to what you will read in this book should you decide to give it a try."
60,0393355489,http://goodreads.com/user/show/16080726-sabin,2,"I'm in two minds about Cordelia Fine's achievements in this book. On the one hand, she crafts a very good and thorough argument for gender equality, attacking every conceivable statement which tries to make the existing gaps seem inevitable. Her arguments are filled with data taken from scientific studies and meta-analyses of the scientific literature. She explains that even some of the science is biased and concludes, many times over, that all the large gaps between the genders stem from cultural biases, which have constantly been reinforced throughout history. And based on the evidence she presents, I can do nothing else but wholeheartedly agree with her conclusions of culturally enforce artificial gender differences.On the other hand, the book is utterly repetitive. She states her conclusions from the start of the book, her arguments develop only slightly - repeating her conclusions over and over again, usually taking a popular counter-argument and battering it to a pulp and by pouring on it study after study which finds even a smidgen of evidence to support her claim. She tries to justify this aggressive crusade against gender-inequality by exaggerating the opposition. I scanned Joe Haldeman's book, Testosterone, for those glaring omissions she attributes to it – keeping testosterone only in the realm of male achievements. He does not omit to include the effects of testosterone in women and does mention the fuzziness of the results. I agree with her, though, that his tone is somewhat dismissive of the role testosterone plays in women's bodies and brains, but it's hard to distinguish between her presentation of real data and her consistently one-sided interpretation.She speaks of deeds, not words, to use in the fight for gender equality. But I'm afraid she misinterprets her mantra and uses words as a flurry of punches which hit everything and everyone who happens to be near her intended targets."

Fine is a skill-full, witty, insightful, and above all scientifically ruthless writer. Her greatest appeal is that she brings sharp objectivity to such an emotionally-charged discussion, and helps defend feminist and queer ideals with logic, fact, and perspective. One of the best books released this year, full of new information for me even though I read the psychology and neuroscience literature regularly. A heroic book.Fine begins with an elegant challenge to Darwin’s theory of sexual selection. This echoes the broad themes of Evolution’s Rainbow, but it des not appear in the references and the arguments are refined with greater precision and clarity. Sexual selection theory, which states that the low-investment sperm production in males mandates a competitive, aggressive, promiscuous mating strategy which cannot benefit females is supported by very little evidence. The 1945 study by Bateman with fruit flies which is often cited as the first impirical evidence of this showed “ The outcome of Bateman’s six series of matchmaking was the first scientific report of greater male variation in reproductive success. For example, 21 per cent of males failed to produce any off-spring, compared with only 4 per cent of females.” Yet Fine cites recent meta-analyses of Bateman’s own data which showed that the mutant fly lines he used to detect paternity of offspring overcounted fathers and underrepresented maternal mutations, and that his own findings showed greater offspring survival in promiscuous females. “ Proposed gains of female promiscuity include genetic benefits, healthier offspring, and the opportunity to set up sperm competitions that weed out inferior specimens.” Using statistics to explain poor analysis and biased publication of positive results, Fine show that there is just as much evidence that the traditionally “male” mating strategy is effective for females in some environments, and equally the “female” strategy can be effective for males. I particularly enjoyed the numerical analysis of the fecundity of a single man achieving more than 100 one-night-stands a year, still less likely than a monogamous man of fathering a single baby. “ (Indeed, a promiscuous man would need to have sex with more than 130 women just to have 90 per cent odds of outdoing the one baby a monogamous man might expect to father in a year.)” This simplistic view of “mating strategies” is made to seem outdated and juvenile.Fine then attacks the biology underlying these ecological assumptions, the idea that there are hard-wired genetics programmes, boulstered by hormones, which then dictate how a person will live their life. “ To confuse human (cultural) sexuality and (natural) reproduction is classically pseudo-scientific.” She dispels the idea that the most attractive men are wealthy and powerful whereas the most attractive women are merely young, by pooling data from dozens of cultures from urban China “But an analysis of actual matches made through an online dating Web site in China found that likes-attract again provided a much better explanation of the data than did potentials-attract.” to hunter-gatherer societies which demonstrated that humans are more attracted to those that they share traits in common with than there architypes. Fine shows that women underperform in laboratory tasks after being primed that these are “masculine” tasks as a form of social defence, and that ficticious male job applications are actually considered more favourably if the candidate admits to being poor at traditionally “feminine” activities. “ For many decades, researchers supposed that masculinity and femininity are polar ends of a single dimension: someone high in masculinity is therefore necessarily low in femininity, and vice versa.” Even the single traditionally masculine dimension of risk-taking is shown to be an uncorrelated mix of different psychological assessments of different situations (those who gamble are no more likely to take health or ethical risks etc.), and that findings that women are more risk averse also apply to dozens of other populations in society whom also face discrimination. “ Society seemed a significantly safer place to white males than it did to all other groups, including nonwhite men.” It is very difficult to objectively make a case that this T-Rex “hyper male” persona exists within the male population, and is not an extrapolation that blends many historical time periods and cultures into something fictional.“ These very open-ended outcomes would be more easily achieved by a developmental pathway that runs from sex to socialization to the brain (and hormones, as we’ll come to in a later chapter), rather than by an inflexible direct path from sex to brain.”Arguments for the essential, and probable, role of environment in human behaviour over hard-wired genetic determinism is skilfully and logically made. Queer identities are not the main focus of this book but are dealt with using sensitivity and intelligence. “If most of us were intersex in some way or another, the ubiquitous question, “Is it a boy or a girl?” wouldn’t be so compelling. And if the shape of our external genitalia fell on a continuum, with the majority of people in an ambiguous midrange shape, it’s an interesting question whether our sex would play such a key role in how we present ourselves to the world.” I hope to see future writing from her which might expand some of these tantalising hints.Fine’s treatment of the animal literature of sex differences is droll, thorough, and erudite. “ The development of testes from an “androgynous” gonad is an active, gene-directed process, but in the absence of the potent, male SRY gene, ovarian tissue just… happens, as the default?” She reveals amazingly underpublicized results. For example, male rats will care for young if there is no female in the cage to do it for them, showing that they have all the same innate behavioural tools as females. Also, chemically castrated macaques of high social status do not lose their power, aggression, or mating opportunities in the absence of testosterone. In many animals, including fish with whopping testicles, social status trusts blood testosterone levels and scientists are beginning to believe that hormones respond to social heirarchies, rather than a linear system the other way round. ““Social events regulate gonadal events.” Or to put it another way, just in case the significance of this sailed past unnoticed, cichlid testes are a social construction.” Even differences in hypocampal dendrites between the sexes are so condition-specific that it is impossible to even ascribe a “male” or “female” profile. “In other words, brief stress exposure reverses the “sex difference” for that particular brain characteristic.” Is being stressed more truly “male” than being relaxed, and which types of being stressed? Overall, this is a scholarly criticism of the often oversimplified debate surrounding sex/gender associated anatomy and the erroneous leap that this represents thinking. I could not fault the science or the writing. I’m just sad that it’s finished now.“Science writer and behavioural endocrinologist Richard Francis coined the term “Testosterone Rex” to poke fun at the mistaken conception of testosterone as a “super-actor”—the “plenipotent executor of selection’s demands” that simply “takes care of everything.””"
66,0393355489,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5847899-patrick,3,"When I picked this up, I thought this book might be about to try to persuade me that there are no innate differences between men and women beyond those that are self-evident, and that the differences we think might exist are all merely the result of social conditioning. And that is not actually what this book claims - it is, after all  nature and nurture but still...The book demolishes a particular cartoon 'biological essentialist' version of sex differences, and there probably are those who do actually subscribe to such a view (though I doubt any of them would pick this book up) but it did feel like it was skewering a straw man. All of which is fine, but very often, Fine seems to leave the balance to the footnotes. And while I'm in no way expert enough to offer my own informed view, I got the impression that she was sometimes being very deliberately selective in the studies she refers to in order to strengthen her pre-existing point of view ('policy-based evidence making as a long-time colleague put it, albeit in a very different context).For example, she does quite a good job of rubbishing the idea that all men are driven on some level by a desire to obtain a harem, but then I think she pushes the argument too far in trying to imply, without ever quite saying it, that there are no real differences between (the average) men and women's attitudes to casual sex at all. The fact that she cites in support a study by Teela Sanders about the fact that men who visit prostitutes very often go back to the same person over and over, but never stops to look at what I'd regard as the more fundamental question of why almost all prostitution is servicing the desires of male clients is just one example. And it turns out that the stuff she has at the beginning about fruit flies' mating behaviours is also a fairly selective version of the wider evidence on the topic (though I had to google that to find it out).As a whole, the book seemed uneven in that a great deal of space is given to how we are shaped by our social environment, and even how it can shape our very biology, but questions of how biology might shape the social world we construct are not really given much of an airing.All the same, I thought there was a fair amount of interest to found here: For example, the chapter on risk-taking, examining in more detail the cliched idea that men tend to take more risk than women was a quite illuminating exploration of what we actually mean by 'risk taking'. The idea, in particular that the concept had been very narrowly defined by those investigating risk-taking differences between the sexes to look specifically at a particular kind of physical risk and that this could be used to build a narrative that the 2008 (and presumably the 1929) financial crash was caused by the testosterone levels of (mainly male) city traders she shows to be a rather simplistic reading of the evidence. She also does quite a good job of questioning the validity of experiments exploring risk-taking or gambling behaviours in artificial environments where absolutely nothing is truly at stake.So worth a read, but not the comprehensive demolition of the idea that there are biologically determined differences between the average man and the average woman that the author sometimes seems to have set out to write."

Fine attempts to shine her light on common conceptions of gender based on outdated scientific views. While some sections were a little too sciencey (which is, of course, unsurprising!), she generally manages to use clear language to convey her argument. I felt a little more sociology might have supported the overall point even further, since gender is one of the ultimate multidisciplinary fields of this moment.I'd highly recommend this book to anyone who feels their blood boil when someone argues men are simply more likely to cheat, women are more caring because genes and 'boys will be boys'.

Not so Cordelia Fine in her new book Testosterone Rex: unmaking the myths of our gendered minds. Instead Fine leads with a scene of domestic normalcy, a family dinner where a discussion on desexing the new family pet dog moves on to taxidermy and the possibility of making the said canines testicles into a key ring. This almost deadpan start sets the scene for a witty riposte to those who insist on the testosterone myth that we, modern men and women, are fixed in an ancestral past that rewarded competitive males and caring females.Winner of the 2017 Royal Society Science Book Award, Testosterone Rex brings together evolutionary science, psychology, neuroscience and social history to move beyond old ‘nature versus nurture’ debates, and to explain ‘I think you’ll find it’s more complicated than men are from Mars and women are from Venus‘ and therefore why it’s time to unmake the tyrannical myth of Testosterone Rex. The author, Cordelia Fine, is a professor of the history and philosophy of science at the University of Melbourne. Fine’s earlier two books; A mind of its own (2006) and Delusions of gender (2010) were similarly insightful, intellectually pugnacious and drolly written. I remember being annoyed reading A mind of its own, making copious margin notes as I went - for me usually a good sign that a book has a lot to say and is challenging my existing ideas and/or sparking off new ones. Like Jonathan Swift, Fine is a writer who will “vex the world rather than divert it.” A worthy recipient of the Royal Society science book award.Fine tackles many of the classic experiments that have led to our myths around testosterone, maleness and competitiveness. One such example is a chapter long denouement of A. J. Bateman’s 1940s experiments on fruit flies and its later (1960s) elaboration by biologist Robert Trivers, which resulted in the almost universally accepted “Bateman’s principle” that males would do best (pace Darwin) by competing with other males in order to spread their cheap, mass-produced sperm among as many females as possible - while females should protect their precious eggs and be as selective as possible. Fine counters these experiments and the conclusions drawn from them, canvassing a large body of contemporary research that looks not only at the conclusions drawn, sexually reluctant females and promiscuous males, in addition underlining the biases that Bateman introduced, prejudicing his own results. All this is achieved with witty referencing to Maserati-driving boyfriends and the ever popular tails of the male Peacock.Fine then moves on to dismember the arguments that airily tie together sexual selection, evolutionary biology and consumer behaviour such as a Maserati -driving male giving a pair of Bulgari sunglasses as a male flaunting their resources. Fine asserts that for humans sexuality is far more than for reproduction. Reminding us: humans routinely engage in sexual pairings and acts, that not only often don’t - but actually can’t - lead to pregnancy. There are also many human sexual activities, like touching, kissing, and oral sex that likewise have no reproductive potential.The idea that we we have only to peel away the veneer of culture, learning, habit, fantasy and the true (natural) sexual being will emerge is pseudoscience - it is profoundly mistaken.Having demolished the past Rex myths Fine then proceeds to wittily tackle the current testosterone myths. If you were wondering Why can’t a woman be more like a man? or Are males (naturally) more risk-taking? Will I become a monstrous sexual predator if I increase the testosterone in my bloodstream? or If the Lehman brothers were sisters would we have had the recent global financial crisis? then read Testosterone Rex.Fine concludes with a grand challenge. Words are nice but often deeds are better - become less polite and more disruptive. Sexual equality is more than a lovely idea in principle. The science, Fine reveals, of Testosterone Rex does not block the path to a better place - it is our complacency in ‘waiting’ patiently for an evolutionary change to occur. Thinking that men are from Mars and women are from Venus is about our values not science.This review was first posted here: http://dragonlaughing.tumblr.com/post... "

“So what happens when a scientist, under controlled laboratory conditions, simulates a first-wave feminist rodent movement by placing males in cages with pups but no females? Before too long you will see the male “mothering” the infant, in much the same way that females do. Feminism: 1. Sexual selection: nil.”
 Delusions of Gender: How Our Minds, Society, and Neurosexism Create Difference is one of my favorite psychology/science books of all-time: it’s funny, it’s clever, and it’s devastatingly sharp in cutting away the illusionist veil that many people still pretend hangs over the divide between boys and girls.So when its scientific successor,  Testosterone Rex: Myths of Sex, Science, and Society, came out, I knew I had to get my hands on it as soon as possible. And, as expected, it’s as good as the first – though I have to admit I enjoyed it slightly less because I’m not as hardcore into biology and hormones as I am into psychology. But that’s purely a personal preference.In this book, psychologist and researcher  Cordelia Fine takes a good, hard look at the influence of the hormone testosterone on humans and gender – effectively separating its presumed influence, and its scientific and biological influence. Just as in her previous book, she picks apart both research and popular or common opinion, giving us readers a critical overview of what testosterone does do and what it doesn’t. (Or what we might simply assume it to do rather than what it actually does.)I’ve heard people accuse Fine of cherry picking scientific data and not being able to explain away certain discrepancies in gender – such as higher statistics for men in terms of crime and rape – with her explanations and expositions of the workings of testosterone.I respectfully disagree. What Fine shows us with this book is that causal relations cannot just be applied to any and all things without evidence, or without critically examining just what such a causal relation might imply. An example of this would be, “If men are statistically more likely to commit a crime than women, then it must be due to testosterone, because that marks the main/biggest biological difference between men and women!”.I can see how someone could arrive at such a conclusion, but: in human nature, combining both psychology and biology, it’s almost impossible to subscribe an effect to one single variable (in this case, subscribing higher crime rates in men to testosterone). Especially with hormones, the interaction of a hormone with its host and that host’s direct environment can have a huge effect on the workings of said hormone.Not to mention that a variable might play a much smaller role than initially expected.Fine dives into both of these lines of thoughts (complex interaction versus actual role) into this book, which leads to a bunch of very interesting reinterpretations of existing research. She steps outside of the simple paradigm that says, “X makes Y happen” and looks at what exactly constitutes X, what influences both X and Y, and is it actually true that X makes Y happen?It’s a solid, well-researched book that doesn’t shy away from using field jargon (so be warned if you’re not fully at home in psychology/biology research) and forces its readers to look at common assumptions in a different way. Even as a fellow psychologist, it taught me a lot, and gave me plenty of insights to ponder upon.It’s also funny and wittily written, which makes it a more pleasant read throughout the drier research material. (Though doubtlessly some will find Fine’s references to feminism and jokes about sexism offensive.)"
72,0393355489,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3611893-dearbhla,5,"I read Fine's Delusions of Gender a few years ago and really enjoyed it, so when I saw she had another one coming out I knew I had to order it. It is just as good as Delusions, and I would recommend it to anyone to read.

In this book Fine takes a look at testosterone and asks is it really the reason behind financial crisis, risk taking, and the differences between the sexes. the short answer is no. The slightly longer, but still short version is that it has an important role to play but it is equally as important as all other hormones in the human body. For more go read the book, it is fascinating, interesting, funny and very readable. Fine has a great style. She weaves personal anecdotes in with scientific studies as well as her own speculation. She counters arguments with facts and figures, but never in a dry and boring way.It is also a most quotable book, if you follow me on tumblr you may have noticed, if not click here for a selection and if that doesn't prompt you to think about trying this book I don't know what will.One of my very favourite lines is Social events regulate gonadal events. I think it should be my new motto.But apart from the writing style what she says in the book is important. She never says that there aren't differences between men and women, but she emphasizes that we cannot accurately tell what is causing those differences. From the moment we are born we are influenced by both genes and environment, and sometimes environment has a greater influence. Never mind the fact that when you average everything out there are more differences between men (or women) than between the sexes. Also, sex is a spectrum, not an either or. Stereotypes and hardline ""men are like this"" views do nobody any good.People are people, and people are different to people in many many ways. And society and experience do a lot to shape people. If you think about the idea behind ""privilege"" for example you can see that influences how people of differing backgrounds see and act. It isn't what you were born with, it is how society around you that shapes what you were born with.I've skimmed a few of the negative reviews on Goodreads and many of them seem to say ""I don't agree with this so it is wrong"" and some say that Fine wants to proclaim that there are no differences between men and women. Well, I've read the book and she makes it perfectly clear that there are differences, both in humans and in other species, what she is looking at is how innate those differences are and can they be altered? Also across the whole species are the differences really there. And in some cases she argues that, yes, they are. In others no, the variables even out across a large sample. Fine also points to numerous studies that show that just because X has been the way for so long, it doesn't mean it can't ever be altered.Of course I came to the book on her side, so maybe I'm just agreeing with her because it supports my view of the world. I'm not a scientist and am not about to go through hundreds of studies in an attempt to prove myself wrong. However I have skimmed through some of those ""men are from mars"" type books, you know the sort that try to argue that all relationship differences exist because men are like this while women are like that, and in most cases I don't identify with the version of womanhood that they portray. So maybe I'm just an outlier, or maybe there is more to being a person than what is between your legs."

Read my GR friend Trevor's review, it says it all:https://www.goodreads.com/review/show...Just to add, it is interesting what this book says about one of the acrimonious debates in feminism - which I'll crassly summarise as smash the patriarchy vs lean in. Lean In: Women, Work, and the Will to Lead being Sheryl Sandberg's book which encourages women to work within the system but to much more aggressively put themselves forward and refuse to be ignored/underpaid/touched up etc. Fine doesn't mention the book but she does suggest the Lean In approach, as well as not only ignoring and leaving intact the structural barriers that exclude women, may also simply not work. She quotes one study which found that both female and male graduates of high-powered MBA courses were equally forthright in negotiating the pay package when they landed their first job. But guess what? Women's demands were met less often than men's. Because Fine's book is about hormones, her point is that it's not hormones that make men more aggressive in negotiating etc. It could just be, that after being knocked back again and again, maybe you just give up? The cost/benefit analysis is going to be different.I'm not going to downgrade my star rating because of the chirpy and not funny ""this is a science book but don't worry it's accessible"" stuff, which I imagine is a feature of a lot of popular science writing (I haven't read much, I'm just guessing).

Speculation is always allowed and even fruitful but there needs to be a clear delineation between fact and what has been surmised from that (this was starkly clear in the chapter regarding hormones and I was disappointed to find that the author spent an inordinate amount of time on testosterone and none on estrogen). I also felt that the book suffered from uneven handling of the many animal studies; sometimes they were used to show that humans are different and we can't use the results from those studies to compare to humans.....and then when the results of the studies aligned with an idea that the author liked then suddenly the results of those studies were extrapolated to humans as well. This hearkens back to the old saying - ""when you're a hammer everything looks like a nail""."

This book shatters the testosterone excuse for how men behave and explores the real evolutionary story in light of our cultures, traditions, and power relations.All around brilliant: as science writing, it is straight-forward, well argued, and hilarious. She also boldly claims to be a feminist writing a feminist science book--no doubt this will land her many detractors who will focus on her supposed bias instead of on the research she illuminates.Go, read this now."

I think the debunking of the myth is useful and asking questions and doing more research on gender is important, but I wasn't sure she made quite the case that she tried to make about the lack of meaningful differences. I want to read more by her though to see if her other books are more thorough. "

82,0393355489,http://goodreads.com/user/show/30924713-kramer-thompson,3,"I am very new to the science behind gender/sex differences and similarities, and I found Testosterone Rex quite interesting. Fine discusses quite a variety of ways that the sexes are purportedly distinct, and argues that under scrutiny we discover that they are actually not so different. Many of the studies she cites to back these views up are very interesting, and she presents most of the topics in a very accessible way.That said, at times it seemed like she might have been arguing against a strawman. For example, at the beginning of one chapter Fine notes one quote by David Schmitt, who states that male humans have the ability to lend their sperm in the conception of 100 offspring within a single month by mating with many (100) different women. She then spends a large section of that chapter demonstrating how implausible this is. But what's really important is not whether male humans could produce 100 offspring a month, but merely whether they could consistently produce a significantly higher amount of offspring by acting polygynously than could female humans. This would suggest that male polygyny could be adaptive and thus that the tendency for men to act polygynously could be an adaptation. Of course it is implausible that men could produce 100 offspring in a month. But could they produce 1 a month? 2? 5? Fine does state afterwards that the males of some tribes whose behaviour probably resembles that of humans over much of our evolutionary history are expected to produce a maximum of 12-16 children, and women of those tribes 9-12. This suggests that a strategy of male polygyny would not be significantly more adaptive than monogamy, so there probably would not be an adaptation for male polygyny. I would have much preferred detailed examination of Fine's latter claim regarding the maximum offspring able to be produced by men in tribes that purportedly resemble humans throughout much of our evolutionary history. It seems to me that such discussion would be more relevant to serious debates about the adaptiveness of male polygyny. However, I get the impression that there are people who take serious, hardline approaches that are very similar to the ones Fine argues against in Testosterone Rex. Perhaps these people do believe that male humans can really produce 100 offspring a month, or at least some similarly absurdly high number. If that's the case, then I see the merit of Fine's discussion of the unlikelihood of men fathering 100 children a month. Of course, this is just one section among a larger book, and much of the book was not similarly frustrating. To summarise: much of the book was interesting; some parts seemed to be arguing against strawmen, but; it may be that these arguments are actually not strawmen (depending on the views of Fine's dialectical partners). In order to determine whether Fine successfully and absolutely defeats all aspects of the Testosterone Rex belief system I will have to read more about the differences (or lack thereof) between the sexes. Thanks to Cordelia Fine's interesting explication of and argumentation regarding these topics, I plan on undertaking such further education."
83,0393355489,http://goodreads.com/user/show/117566-mauri,3,"I forgot how funny Fine is - she writes in a tightly controlled, ""isn't it amusing how..."" sort of manner that both makes you laugh and realize that she is quite ticked off (and you should be too).In this, Fine tackles research about gender and sex, with a focus on knocking back a lot of the ""boys will be boys"" beliefs society holds dear.For example: male promiscuity. A man can impregnate hundreds of women in the time it takes a woman to gestate and bear one child, which she is usually bound to for years while that same man skips merrily from town to town. Therefore it makes sense that men want sex all the time and women don't. It's reproductively advantageous, duh.Fine merrily pokes holes in all of this. First, what women? Setting aside the number of women within a day's walk of the average caveman, Neolithic farmer, or 1800s city dweller, even in today's jet-setting world how many women are lining up to have sex with an endless line-up of horny men? Not just sex, but baby-making sex? And how many of those women are actually fertile at a given point of time? And while everyone can think of a story they heard about someone getting pregnant off a one night stand, I bet many more can think of couples taking months to conceive. Turns out this reproductive strategy may have only worked out for Genghis Khan and a few other despotic men throughout history, and, Fine points out, maybe that says more about despots than it does about men? In short, a lot of looking at scientific studies done on sex and gender that point out that there maybe? Might have? been a bit of bias going on. Less tightly constructed than Delusions of Gender: How Our Minds, Society, and Neurosexism Create Difference, Fine does meander a bit, but accessible to people whose eyes crossed a bit trying to read Women's Work, Men's Property: The Origins of Gender and Class. (Mine.)"
84,0393355489,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1348540-charlie,3,"Cordelia Fine sets up a well-known stalking horse in the shape of Testosterone Rex the king of hormones with a view to pulling him down and showing him to be a meaningless construct. She uses scientific studies as part of the technique for pulling him down, but also an appeal to ‘our values’. The Testosterone Rex construct which she pulls apart is the idea that boys will be boys, that the presence of testosterone makes men into naturally promiscuous hunters, risk takers and show-offs while the lack of it makes women into careful carers and nurturers. Fine needs to state her T Rex construct at the start of the book in order for the reader to know what she will be arguing against, however, I did not find that she made it clear until afterwards that this was not actually her view of the world. As a result, I nearly put the book down and left it before she was really ready to start. I found a lot of the science interesting, but I was somewhat sad that there was not more evidence for a wider range of elements to the story. The science seemed to be very strongly focussed around the risk-taking area. I guess this is the easiest part of the story to test and verify, but I would personally have liked a bit more stress on other areas too.The book states on the cover that it is a science book prize winner. It does not say it is also a feminist book. I am happy to read either or both kinds of book, but I picked this one up expecting something more dispassionate. The Author is however very passionate, she has a very definite agenda. She makes a good case for it with the evidence she uses, but as a scientist, that passion means that I have to wonder if the evidence she uses is cherry picked to make a point or not. I find that doubt tarnishes some apparently very good, interesting science for me. I would have preferred the science and the passion in two separate books."
85,0393355489,http://goodreads.com/user/show/17594936-colin,4,"I always find it hard to evaluate books like this. There are so many studies into human nature, human behaviour, sex differences, and for me, they raise more questions than they answer. How was that test administered? Were the men and women in the test into risk appetite all the same age? How was the question phrased? I invariably find myself doubting the scientific method, and then in the absence of reliable data points, measuring the writer's interpretation against my own experience. But of course that just means I'm layering my own bias on top of the writer's bias, which in turn is overlaid on the experimenter's experimental design. The result is a superficially plausible narrative, which I know will be contradicted by the next book I read on the same topic.Cordelia Fine does a good job of trying to combat the kinds of folk narrative explanations that thrive in all this confusion. She starts off with one of the hoariest of all - the idea that men have evolved to be unfaithful while women have evolved to be monogamous nest builders. This is one of the best known examples of sociobiology being drafted in to support a conclusion you know the researcher had in mind from the start and wanted to ""prove"". Fine's iconoclasm in taking aim at it seems admirable. She also takes care to present her evidence carefully, showing balanced results and not just trying to claim all the evidence points to one inevitable conclusion. This in marked contrast to - for example - Jordan Peterson who is forever pointing at stuff that happens in nature and implying that we just have to accept that the status quo is here to stay and resistance is futile. Give me a Cordelia Fine over a Jordan Peterson any day of the week. And she won't even tell me to tidy my room. I didn't find my hackles raising at any point, and although she editorialises strenuously on the meaning of the results, she's not trying to press the science into service or (as far as I can tell) manipulate the facts. Fair enough.The general gist is that there are differences between the sexes in some ways but that there was so much social conditioning overlaid on top of that that most of what we think of as immutable human nature can be stripped back if we, as a society, choose to do so. I think I'd put myself a little further towards the Stephen Pinker end of the spectrum but again, that's just me, maybe overlaying what I see around me, how I think and how women I know seem to think, how our daughter developed in what we thought was a fairly stereotype-free household... So it's a hit and miss, subjective interpretation of the facts but can any of us bring any better expertise to bear to judge between the competing claims of the people who have looked inside our brains and reckon they know what they've found there? Probably not."
86,0393355489,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2860188-eduardo-santiago,3,"So much research these days claims to find testosterone-this or hardwired-gender-difference-that. Risk-taking, competitiveness, ability, even childhood toy preference. Cordelia Fine somewhat exasperatedly follows up with crucial context—“the rest of the story,” if you will: yes, but this study didn’t consider corticoid levels; yes, but that other study neglected such-and-such findings; and most crucially yes, but it’s staggeringly difficult to isolate this effect from social and cultural factors. Nevertheless, she persiidentifies clever ways in which these issues have been studied, and the gist is: context matters. A lot.Science requires reproducibility. Reproducible results are best obtained when there are a small number of variables—hard to achieve with something as richly messy as a human life. Once one compensates for the factors overlooked in much research, plus publication bias, plus just plain built-in human bias, few effects survive scrutiny. Yes, we’re different—deliciously so, in my view!—but not in any way that affects ability. Not even in the slightest bit.Fine writes with a sardonic bite that worked well to start with but grew tiresome. I was also highly disappointed in her somewhat off-context quoting of Robert Sapolsky—a hero of mine—and her failure to acknowledge his groundbreaking work decades ago in breaking down testosterone myths. And, dear FSM, what has happened to proofreading? Much as I want to grant four stars, much as I think this is important work that needs to be read, I can only justify three. (Goodreads, could we have fractional stars please?)On a side note, I find myself fortunate to have read this just before and just after the 2018 Women’s March where I was surrounded by thousands of strong, powerful, capable human beings of all genders and colors, many of whom are living under the culturally-imposed “oh, you just aren’t able to do these sorts of things.” All of whom categorically reject that, as does Fine and as do I and, I trust, you. #resist.And on another side note: if you’re interested in these sorts of gender issues, I urge you to listen to this episode of the Hidden Brain podcast in which two progressive parents attempt to raise their children free of gender stereotypes and much loveliness ensues."

This book, cleverly written, does an outstanding job of decimating stereotypical beliefs that boys are boys and girls are girls because of innate, fixed differences. I used to think men were more prone to risk taking than women. It turns out that this isn’t true, for a few reasons! For example:1) risk taking studies have methodological flaws. For example, these studies typically focus on activities that are considered to be male-expertise. Different results are found if you consider female-expertise activities. Would you consider baking a very difficult soufflé for a dinner party? 2) risk taking studies ACTUALLY find that the most high-status people are most likely to take risks. In matrilineal society is women. In western society it is WHITE men followed by women and minorities. Etc.3) the actual risk to women of “risky” events proposed in these studies is MUCH HIGHER than the actual risk to men. Consider: would you go to the bus station at 11 PM for a chance to pick up $100? For whom is that obviously more risky- a 5’10” man or a 5’2” woman? Obviously women need the cash reward to be higher because they are literally facing MORE RISK. Change the situation so men are facing more risk, and the answers change.The book gives a careful data based treatment to many stereotypical beliefs, overturning widely held views about the impact of biological sex and sex hormones on the brain.

88,0393355489,http://goodreads.com/user/show/28668057-jasmine,3,"Cordelia Fine's Delusions of Gender was one of my favorite reads of the year, and so I was excited to pick up this sequel-in-spirit.It started out strong, combining Fine's delightful dry wit with a thorough review/critique of seminal works in the ""male/testestosterone = high risk/high reward = spray & pray mating strategy"" field. She then continued with a review of the many different ways male and female creatures compete for reproductive success. Although while I found this part interesting, I ultimately found tidbits like the two opposite mating strategies of the horned dung beetle to be less useful in my day-to-day experience of the world than the aspects of gender and science described in Delusions of Gender. The final portion I found to be a bit more unfocused. I found myself a little uncertain about what Fine or anyone else in the field takes home from experiments on risk versus reward between men and women. In this portion of the book particularly, she often repeated parts of Delusions of Gender - which left me feeling that perhaps this whole book could have been an extra set of chapters in the earlier volume rather than a stand-alone book.Still, I overall enjoyed the book, and would probably still read another book written by Fine - but I would recommend Delusions of Gender and not this one, as a starting point."
89,0393355489,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4239658-karen-chung,3,"This book was a fairly interesting, quick read, but I ended up convinced that testosterone is still the main source of male-female differences. The book made a lot of good points about how environment and social conditions can adjust the concentration of testosterone in an individual, and how circumstances can bring out ""atypical"" behavior relative to the usual gender stereotypes, such as gentle, nurturing behavior in males. But as I see it, testosterone is still at the core of and key to competitiveness, aggression, and ambition in humans (and probably other animals as well). Women have some too, just not as much, and I believe there is still a strong correlation between testosterone level and ambition and related traits in women. I highly recommend listening to this podcast in conjunction with this book:This American Life: Testosteronehttps://www.thisamericanlife.org/220/...Transcript:https://www.thisamericanlife.org/220/...It left a deep impression on me, and also adds a lot to what you will read in this book should you decide to give it a try."
90,0393355489,http://goodreads.com/user/show/16080726-sabin,2,"I'm in two minds about Cordelia Fine's achievements in this book. On the one hand, she crafts a very good and thorough argument for gender equality, attacking every conceivable statement which tries to make the existing gaps seem inevitable. Her arguments are filled with data taken from scientific studies and meta-analyses of the scientific literature. She explains that even some of the science is biased and concludes, many times over, that all the large gaps between the genders stem from cultural biases, which have constantly been reinforced throughout history. And based on the evidence she presents, I can do nothing else but wholeheartedly agree with her conclusions of culturally enforce artificial gender differences.On the other hand, the book is utterly repetitive. She states her conclusions from the start of the book, her arguments develop only slightly - repeating her conclusions over and over again, usually taking a popular counter-argument and battering it to a pulp and by pouring on it study after study which finds even a smidgen of evidence to support her claim. She tries to justify this aggressive crusade against gender-inequality by exaggerating the opposition. I scanned Joe Haldeman's book, Testosterone, for those glaring omissions she attributes to it – keeping testosterone only in the realm of male achievements. He does not omit to include the effects of testosterone in women and does mention the fuzziness of the results. I agree with her, though, that his tone is somewhat dismissive of the role testosterone plays in women's bodies and brains, but it's hard to distinguish between her presentation of real data and her consistently one-sided interpretation.She speaks of deeds, not words, to use in the fight for gender equality. But I'm afraid she misinterprets her mantra and uses words as a flurry of punches which hit everything and everyone who happens to be near her intended targets."

If you're tired of having gender essentialism used to explain why men can never be nurses (testosterone precludes empathy and caregiving!), or why women will never be interested enough in business to be CEOs (maybe we should make calculators pink!), this is a popular science repackaging of the actual scientific articles which demonstrate that hormones often follow behavior, that social and cultural structures are often far more to blame for the way men and women behave (women are also interested in casual sex, when the deck isn't stacked to get them killed of socially shunned) and that taking GNC Testosto-Boost is not going to fix personal insecurities."

Fine is a skill-full, witty, insightful, and above all scientifically ruthless writer. Her greatest appeal is that she brings sharp objectivity to such an emotionally-charged discussion, and helps defend feminist and queer ideals with logic, fact, and perspective. One of the best books released this year, full of new information for me even though I read the psychology and neuroscience literature regularly. A heroic book.Fine begins with an elegant challenge to Darwin’s theory of sexual selection. This echoes the broad themes of Evolution’s Rainbow, but it des not appear in the references and the arguments are refined with greater precision and clarity. Sexual selection theory, which states that the low-investment sperm production in males mandates a competitive, aggressive, promiscuous mating strategy which cannot benefit females is supported by very little evidence. The 1945 study by Bateman with fruit flies which is often cited as the first impirical evidence of this showed “ The outcome of Bateman’s six series of matchmaking was the first scientific report of greater male variation in reproductive success. For example, 21 per cent of males failed to produce any off-spring, compared with only 4 per cent of females.” Yet Fine cites recent meta-analyses of Bateman’s own data which showed that the mutant fly lines he used to detect paternity of offspring overcounted fathers and underrepresented maternal mutations, and that his own findings showed greater offspring survival in promiscuous females. “ Proposed gains of female promiscuity include genetic benefits, healthier offspring, and the opportunity to set up sperm competitions that weed out inferior specimens.” Using statistics to explain poor analysis and biased publication of positive results, Fine show that there is just as much evidence that the traditionally “male” mating strategy is effective for females in some environments, and equally the “female” strategy can be effective for males. I particularly enjoyed the numerical analysis of the fecundity of a single man achieving more than 100 one-night-stands a year, still less likely than a monogamous man of fathering a single baby. “ (Indeed, a promiscuous man would need to have sex with more than 130 women just to have 90 per cent odds of outdoing the one baby a monogamous man might expect to father in a year.)” This simplistic view of “mating strategies” is made to seem outdated and juvenile.Fine then attacks the biology underlying these ecological assumptions, the idea that there are hard-wired genetics programmes, boulstered by hormones, which then dictate how a person will live their life. “ To confuse human (cultural) sexuality and (natural) reproduction is classically pseudo-scientific.” She dispels the idea that the most attractive men are wealthy and powerful whereas the most attractive women are merely young, by pooling data from dozens of cultures from urban China “But an analysis of actual matches made through an online dating Web site in China found that likes-attract again provided a much better explanation of the data than did potentials-attract.” to hunter-gatherer societies which demonstrated that humans are more attracted to those that they share traits in common with than there architypes. Fine shows that women underperform in laboratory tasks after being primed that these are “masculine” tasks as a form of social defence, and that ficticious male job applications are actually considered more favourably if the candidate admits to being poor at traditionally “feminine” activities. “ For many decades, researchers supposed that masculinity and femininity are polar ends of a single dimension: someone high in masculinity is therefore necessarily low in femininity, and vice versa.” Even the single traditionally masculine dimension of risk-taking is shown to be an uncorrelated mix of different psychological assessments of different situations (those who gamble are no more likely to take health or ethical risks etc.), and that findings that women are more risk averse also apply to dozens of other populations in society whom also face discrimination. “ Society seemed a significantly safer place to white males than it did to all other groups, including nonwhite men.” It is very difficult to objectively make a case that this T-Rex “hyper male” persona exists within the male population, and is not an extrapolation that blends many historical time periods and cultures into something fictional.“ These very open-ended outcomes would be more easily achieved by a developmental pathway that runs from sex to socialization to the brain (and hormones, as we’ll come to in a later chapter), rather than by an inflexible direct path from sex to brain.”Arguments for the essential, and probable, role of environment in human behaviour over hard-wired genetic determinism is skilfully and logically made. Queer identities are not the main focus of this book but are dealt with using sensitivity and intelligence. “If most of us were intersex in some way or another, the ubiquitous question, “Is it a boy or a girl?” wouldn’t be so compelling. And if the shape of our external genitalia fell on a continuum, with the majority of people in an ambiguous midrange shape, it’s an interesting question whether our sex would play such a key role in how we present ourselves to the world.” I hope to see future writing from her which might expand some of these tantalising hints.Fine’s treatment of the animal literature of sex differences is droll, thorough, and erudite. “ The development of testes from an “androgynous” gonad is an active, gene-directed process, but in the absence of the potent, male SRY gene, ovarian tissue just… happens, as the default?” She reveals amazingly underpublicized results. For example, male rats will care for young if there is no female in the cage to do it for them, showing that they have all the same innate behavioural tools as females. Also, chemically castrated macaques of high social status do not lose their power, aggression, or mating opportunities in the absence of testosterone. In many animals, including fish with whopping testicles, social status trusts blood testosterone levels and scientists are beginning to believe that hormones respond to social heirarchies, rather than a linear system the other way round. ““Social events regulate gonadal events.” Or to put it another way, just in case the significance of this sailed past unnoticed, cichlid testes are a social construction.” Even differences in hypocampal dendrites between the sexes are so condition-specific that it is impossible to even ascribe a “male” or “female” profile. “In other words, brief stress exposure reverses the “sex difference” for that particular brain characteristic.” Is being stressed more truly “male” than being relaxed, and which types of being stressed? Overall, this is a scholarly criticism of the often oversimplified debate surrounding sex/gender associated anatomy and the erroneous leap that this represents thinking. I could not fault the science or the writing. I’m just sad that it’s finished now.“Science writer and behavioural endocrinologist Richard Francis coined the term “Testosterone Rex” to poke fun at the mistaken conception of testosterone as a “super-actor”—the “plenipotent executor of selection’s demands” that simply “takes care of everything.””"
96,0393355489,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5847899-patrick,3,"When I picked this up, I thought this book might be about to try to persuade me that there are no innate differences between men and women beyond those that are self-evident, and that the differences we think might exist are all merely the result of social conditioning. And that is not actually what this book claims - it is, after all  nature and nurture but still...The book demolishes a particular cartoon 'biological essentialist' version of sex differences, and there probably are those who do actually subscribe to such a view (though I doubt any of them would pick this book up) but it did feel like it was skewering a straw man. All of which is fine, but very often, Fine seems to leave the balance to the footnotes. And while I'm in no way expert enough to offer my own informed view, I got the impression that she was sometimes being very deliberately selective in the studies she refers to in order to strengthen her pre-existing point of view ('policy-based evidence making as a long-time colleague put it, albeit in a very different context).For example, she does quite a good job of rubbishing the idea that all men are driven on some level by a desire to obtain a harem, but then I think she pushes the argument too far in trying to imply, without ever quite saying it, that there are no real differences between (the average) men and women's attitudes to casual sex at all. The fact that she cites in support a study by Teela Sanders about the fact that men who visit prostitutes very often go back to the same person over and over, but never stops to look at what I'd regard as the more fundamental question of why almost all prostitution is servicing the desires of male clients is just one example. And it turns out that the stuff she has at the beginning about fruit flies' mating behaviours is also a fairly selective version of the wider evidence on the topic (though I had to google that to find it out).As a whole, the book seemed uneven in that a great deal of space is given to how we are shaped by our social environment, and even how it can shape our very biology, but questions of how biology might shape the social world we construct are not really given much of an airing.All the same, I thought there was a fair amount of interest to found here: For example, the chapter on risk-taking, examining in more detail the cliched idea that men tend to take more risk than women was a quite illuminating exploration of what we actually mean by 'risk taking'. The idea, in particular that the concept had been very narrowly defined by those investigating risk-taking differences between the sexes to look specifically at a particular kind of physical risk and that this could be used to build a narrative that the 2008 (and presumably the 1929) financial crash was caused by the testosterone levels of (mainly male) city traders she shows to be a rather simplistic reading of the evidence. She also does quite a good job of questioning the validity of experiments exploring risk-taking or gambling behaviours in artificial environments where absolutely nothing is truly at stake.So worth a read, but not the comprehensive demolition of the idea that there are biologically determined differences between the average man and the average woman that the author sometimes seems to have set out to write."

Fine attempts to shine her light on common conceptions of gender based on outdated scientific views. While some sections were a little too sciencey (which is, of course, unsurprising!), she generally manages to use clear language to convey her argument. I felt a little more sociology might have supported the overall point even further, since gender is one of the ultimate multidisciplinary fields of this moment.I'd highly recommend this book to anyone who feels their blood boil when someone argues men are simply more likely to cheat, women are more caring because genes and 'boys will be boys'.

100,0393355489,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11116317-kevin-orrman-rossiter,5,"Many a modern book on popular science leads with a quest story positioning the people and scientific puzzle contextually - historical and social scene setting for the story of discovery to unfold. Not so Cordelia Fine in her new book Testosterone Rex: unmaking the myths of our gendered minds. Instead Fine leads with a scene of domestic normalcy, a family dinner where a discussion on desexing the new family pet dog moves on to taxidermy and the possibility of making the said canines testicles into a key ring. This almost deadpan start sets the scene for a witty riposte to those who insist on the testosterone myth that we, modern men and women, are fixed in an ancestral past that rewarded competitive males and caring females.Winner of the 2017 Royal Society Science Book Award, Testosterone Rex brings together evolutionary science, psychology, neuroscience and social history to move beyond old ‘nature versus nurture’ debates, and to explain ‘I think you’ll find it’s more complicated than men are from Mars and women are from Venus‘ and therefore why it’s time to unmake the tyrannical myth of Testosterone Rex. The author, Cordelia Fine, is a professor of the history and philosophy of science at the University of Melbourne. Fine’s earlier two books; A mind of its own (2006) and Delusions of gender (2010) were similarly insightful, intellectually pugnacious and drolly written. I remember being annoyed reading A mind of its own, making copious margin notes as I went - for me usually a good sign that a book has a lot to say and is challenging my existing ideas and/or sparking off new ones. Like Jonathan Swift, Fine is a writer who will “vex the world rather than divert it.” A worthy recipient of the Royal Society science book award.Fine tackles many of the classic experiments that have led to our myths around testosterone, maleness and competitiveness. One such example is a chapter long denouement of A. J. Bateman’s 1940s experiments on fruit flies and its later (1960s) elaboration by biologist Robert Trivers, which resulted in the almost universally accepted “Bateman’s principle” that males would do best (pace Darwin) by competing with other males in order to spread their cheap, mass-produced sperm among as many females as possible - while females should protect their precious eggs and be as selective as possible. Fine counters these experiments and the conclusions drawn from them, canvassing a large body of contemporary research that looks not only at the conclusions drawn, sexually reluctant females and promiscuous males, in addition underlining the biases that Bateman introduced, prejudicing his own results. All this is achieved with witty referencing to Maserati-driving boyfriends and the ever popular tails of the male Peacock.Fine then moves on to dismember the arguments that airily tie together sexual selection, evolutionary biology and consumer behaviour such as a Maserati -driving male giving a pair of Bulgari sunglasses as a male flaunting their resources. Fine asserts that for humans sexuality is far more than for reproduction. Reminding us: humans routinely engage in sexual pairings and acts, that not only often don’t - but actually can’t - lead to pregnancy. There are also many human sexual activities, like touching, kissing, and oral sex that likewise have no reproductive potential.The idea that we we have only to peel away the veneer of culture, learning, habit, fantasy and the true (natural) sexual being will emerge is pseudoscience - it is profoundly mistaken.Having demolished the past Rex myths Fine then proceeds to wittily tackle the current testosterone myths. If you were wondering Why can’t a woman be more like a man? or Are males (naturally) more risk-taking? Will I become a monstrous sexual predator if I increase the testosterone in my bloodstream? or If the Lehman brothers were sisters would we have had the recent global financial crisis? then read Testosterone Rex.Fine concludes with a grand challenge. Words are nice but often deeds are better - become less polite and more disruptive. Sexual equality is more than a lovely idea in principle. The science, Fine reveals, of Testosterone Rex does not block the path to a better place - it is our complacency in ‘waiting’ patiently for an evolutionary change to occur. Thinking that men are from Mars and women are from Venus is about our values not science.This review was first posted here: http://dragonlaughing.tumblr.com/post... "

“So what happens when a scientist, under controlled laboratory conditions, simulates a first-wave feminist rodent movement by placing males in cages with pups but no females? Before too long you will see the male “mothering” the infant, in much the same way that females do. Feminism: 1. Sexual selection: nil.”
 Delusions of Gender: How Our Minds, Society, and Neurosexism Create Difference is one of my favorite psychology/science books of all-time: it’s funny, it’s clever, and it’s devastatingly sharp in cutting away the illusionist veil that many people still pretend hangs over the divide between boys and girls.So when its scientific successor,  Testosterone Rex: Myths of Sex, Science, and Society, came out, I knew I had to get my hands on it as soon as possible. And, as expected, it’s as good as the first – though I have to admit I enjoyed it slightly less because I’m not as hardcore into biology and hormones as I am into psychology. But that’s purely a personal preference.In this book, psychologist and researcher  Cordelia Fine takes a good, hard look at the influence of the hormone testosterone on humans and gender – effectively separating its presumed influence, and its scientific and biological influence. Just as in her previous book, she picks apart both research and popular or common opinion, giving us readers a critical overview of what testosterone does do and what it doesn’t. (Or what we might simply assume it to do rather than what it actually does.)I’ve heard people accuse Fine of cherry picking scientific data and not being able to explain away certain discrepancies in gender – such as higher statistics for men in terms of crime and rape – with her explanations and expositions of the workings of testosterone.I respectfully disagree. What Fine shows us with this book is that causal relations cannot just be applied to any and all things without evidence, or without critically examining just what such a causal relation might imply. An example of this would be, “If men are statistically more likely to commit a crime than women, then it must be due to testosterone, because that marks the main/biggest biological difference between men and women!”.I can see how someone could arrive at such a conclusion, but: in human nature, combining both psychology and biology, it’s almost impossible to subscribe an effect to one single variable (in this case, subscribing higher crime rates in men to testosterone). Especially with hormones, the interaction of a hormone with its host and that host’s direct environment can have a huge effect on the workings of said hormone.Not to mention that a variable might play a much smaller role than initially expected.Fine dives into both of these lines of thoughts (complex interaction versus actual role) into this book, which leads to a bunch of very interesting reinterpretations of existing research. She steps outside of the simple paradigm that says, “X makes Y happen” and looks at what exactly constitutes X, what influences both X and Y, and is it actually true that X makes Y happen?It’s a solid, well-researched book that doesn’t shy away from using field jargon (so be warned if you’re not fully at home in psychology/biology research) and forces its readers to look at common assumptions in a different way. Even as a fellow psychologist, it taught me a lot, and gave me plenty of insights to ponder upon.It’s also funny and wittily written, which makes it a more pleasant read throughout the drier research material. (Though doubtlessly some will find Fine’s references to feminism and jokes about sexism offensive.)"
102,0393355489,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3611893-dearbhla,5,"I read Fine's Delusions of Gender a few years ago and really enjoyed it, so when I saw she had another one coming out I knew I had to order it. It is just as good as Delusions, and I would recommend it to anyone to read.

In this book Fine takes a look at testosterone and asks is it really the reason behind financial crisis, risk taking, and the differences between the sexes. the short answer is no. The slightly longer, but still short version is that it has an important role to play but it is equally as important as all other hormones in the human body. For more go read the book, it is fascinating, interesting, funny and very readable. Fine has a great style. She weaves personal anecdotes in with scientific studies as well as her own speculation. She counters arguments with facts and figures, but never in a dry and boring way.It is also a most quotable book, if you follow me on tumblr you may have noticed, if not click here for a selection and if that doesn't prompt you to think about trying this book I don't know what will.One of my very favourite lines is Social events regulate gonadal events. I think it should be my new motto.But apart from the writing style what she says in the book is important. She never says that there aren't differences between men and women, but she emphasizes that we cannot accurately tell what is causing those differences. From the moment we are born we are influenced by both genes and environment, and sometimes environment has a greater influence. Never mind the fact that when you average everything out there are more differences between men (or women) than between the sexes. Also, sex is a spectrum, not an either or. Stereotypes and hardline ""men are like this"" views do nobody any good.People are people, and people are different to people in many many ways. And society and experience do a lot to shape people. If you think about the idea behind ""privilege"" for example you can see that influences how people of differing backgrounds see and act. It isn't what you were born with, it is how society around you that shapes what you were born with.I've skimmed a few of the negative reviews on Goodreads and many of them seem to say ""I don't agree with this so it is wrong"" and some say that Fine wants to proclaim that there are no differences between men and women. Well, I've read the book and she makes it perfectly clear that there are differences, both in humans and in other species, what she is looking at is how innate those differences are and can they be altered? Also across the whole species are the differences really there. And in some cases she argues that, yes, they are. In others no, the variables even out across a large sample. Fine also points to numerous studies that show that just because X has been the way for so long, it doesn't mean it can't ever be altered.Of course I came to the book on her side, so maybe I'm just agreeing with her because it supports my view of the world. I'm not a scientist and am not about to go through hundreds of studies in an attempt to prove myself wrong. However I have skimmed through some of those ""men are from mars"" type books, you know the sort that try to argue that all relationship differences exist because men are like this while women are like that, and in most cases I don't identify with the version of womanhood that they portray. So maybe I'm just an outlier, or maybe there is more to being a person than what is between your legs."
103,0393355489,http://goodreads.com/user/show/53036232-rebecca,2,"although i certainly learnt a lot from this book, i got slightly frustrated by the constant repetition of this idea that there isn't a clear divide between male and female brains, but rather our brains are more like mosaics of 'male' and 'female' traits. like... obviously? the points fine made often seemed a little redundant, and the book was certainly fluffed out a lot, with large amounts of repetition. the layout of the book was slightly robotic as well. fine would begin every chapter with a sort of irrelevant anecdote and then dive into some vaguely boring theory which would eventually usually progress into some more interesting theory.but whatever. these points aren't really all that important. the main reason why this book annoys me is because in the final chapter fine acts like gendered toys and stuff are things we need to be violently protesting about. like yes gendered toys are a shit idea but uh hello... climate change??? refugee crisis??? homelessness????? there are ten thousand more important things to protest about. additionally, the book completely ignores how the theory relates to people who are transgender apart from one sentence just to say that when the author says ""women"" she means people with vaginas. like?? this is one of the main reasons stopping me from completely agreeing with your theory could you please address it?? thanks.anyway still an interesting read & v fast. wouldn't recco to ppl who already think men and women are pretty much the same tho. that's just preaching to the converted & ultimately pointless. u wont learn much from this book. read it if u think men and women are decidedly different beings. book has some good points. in the grand scheme tho, this stuff doesn't matter. go read about climate change.also i didnt buy this book just to shit on it!! i read it as part of my natural sciences book club module lol. we readin brief history of time next semester so that should be fun. peace x"

Blasphemy! To have the nerve to say that Jacques Derrida, the untalented soccer player turned state paid prophet does not understand advanced math would be a something like saying ""in France, Winters can get pretty cold."" Those statements have hurt only the egos of the many academic bureaucrats who have built a well paid career by mindlessly singing odes to the Emperor's new clothes. And by publishing Intellectual Impostures the world got to see how many academics were scurrying to hide their nakedness behind century old desks.Cordelia Fine deals a new blow to the impostors. Say one Gijsbert Stoet who can declare: In the stone age, it was useful for men to be hunters and women to look after babies, and nature has helped by encoding some of these skills in the hardware of our brain. That still influences how we think today although he never encountered live stone age hominids, unless his priestly confessor can do channeling. That was written in jest, anybody can tell stone age people don't have souls as the precede the Garden of Eden by some 100.000 years. And is paid as a professor and researched by the British state to do his rain dance. In this sick Medieval game Cordelia Fine tries to bring some light.In the end, there is no controversy, only mostly old white men scared that their prized male offsprings will not enjoy their level of privilege because of some sort of biblical reenactment with the feminists playing Eve giving once more the dumb Adam the fruit of knowlege."
105,0393355489,http://goodreads.com/user/show/47667703-chris-chapman,5,"This is an awesome, exhaustively researched book, and yes it is readable. Read my GR friend Trevor's review, it says it all:https://www.goodreads.com/review/show...Just to add, it is interesting what this book says about one of the acrimonious debates in feminism - which I'll crassly summarise as smash the patriarchy vs lean in. Lean In: Women, Work, and the Will to Lead being Sheryl Sandberg's book which encourages women to work within the system but to much more aggressively put themselves forward and refuse to be ignored/underpaid/touched up etc. Fine doesn't mention the book but she does suggest the Lean In approach, as well as not only ignoring and leaving intact the structural barriers that exclude women, may also simply not work. She quotes one study which found that both female and male graduates of high-powered MBA courses were equally forthright in negotiating the pay package when they landed their first job. But guess what? Women's demands were met less often than men's. Because Fine's book is about hormones, her point is that it's not hormones that make men more aggressive in negotiating etc. It could just be, that after being knocked back again and again, maybe you just give up? The cost/benefit analysis is going to be different.I'm not going to downgrade my star rating because of the chirpy and not funny ""this is a science book but don't worry it's accessible"" stuff, which I imagine is a feature of a lot of popular science writing (I haven't read much, I'm just guessing). "
106,0393355489,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7089145-alisha,3,"3.5 stars.....more to come later but this was a mix of some really great science and a little bit of reaching too far to make conclusions that the author holds near and dear. Speculation is always allowed and even fruitful but there needs to be a clear delineation between fact and what has been surmised from that (this was starkly clear in the chapter regarding hormones and I was disappointed to find that the author spent an inordinate amount of time on testosterone and none on estrogen). I also felt that the book suffered from uneven handling of the many animal studies; sometimes they were used to show that humans are different and we can't use the results from those studies to compare to humans.....and then when the results of the studies aligned with an idea that the author liked then suddenly the results of those studies were extrapolated to humans as well. This hearkens back to the old saying - ""when you're a hammer everything looks like a nail""."
107,0393355489,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1058994-ryan-mishap,5,"Combined with her previous book--Delusions of Gender--this is crucial reading that shows how little difference there is between these so-called immutable genders our society has created. This book shatters the testosterone excuse for how men behave and explores the real evolutionary story in light of our cultures, traditions, and power relations.All around brilliant: as science writing, it is straight-forward, well argued, and hilarious. She also boldly claims to be a feminist writing a feminist science book--no doubt this will land her many detractors who will focus on her supposed bias instead of on the research she illuminates.Go, read this now."
108,0393355489,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1045774-mehrsa,4,"Interesting research about gender differences. Testosterone is not as determinative as previously thought. I think the debunking of the myth is useful and asking questions and doing more research on gender is important, but I wasn't sure she made quite the case that she tried to make about the lack of meaningful differences. I want to read more by her though to see if her other books are more thorough. "

112,0393355489,http://goodreads.com/user/show/30924713-kramer-thompson,3,"I am very new to the science behind gender/sex differences and similarities, and I found Testosterone Rex quite interesting. Fine discusses quite a variety of ways that the sexes are purportedly distinct, and argues that under scrutiny we discover that they are actually not so different. Many of the studies she cites to back these views up are very interesting, and she presents most of the topics in a very accessible way.That said, at times it seemed like she might have been arguing against a strawman. For example, at the beginning of one chapter Fine notes one quote by David Schmitt, who states that male humans have the ability to lend their sperm in the conception of 100 offspring within a single month by mating with many (100) different women. She then spends a large section of that chapter demonstrating how implausible this is. But what's really important is not whether male humans could produce 100 offspring a month, but merely whether they could consistently produce a significantly higher amount of offspring by acting polygynously than could female humans. This would suggest that male polygyny could be adaptive and thus that the tendency for men to act polygynously could be an adaptation. Of course it is implausible that men could produce 100 offspring in a month. But could they produce 1 a month? 2? 5? Fine does state afterwards that the males of some tribes whose behaviour probably resembles that of humans over much of our evolutionary history are expected to produce a maximum of 12-16 children, and women of those tribes 9-12. This suggests that a strategy of male polygyny would not be significantly more adaptive than monogamy, so there probably would not be an adaptation for male polygyny. I would have much preferred detailed examination of Fine's latter claim regarding the maximum offspring able to be produced by men in tribes that purportedly resemble humans throughout much of our evolutionary history. It seems to me that such discussion would be more relevant to serious debates about the adaptiveness of male polygyny. However, I get the impression that there are people who take serious, hardline approaches that are very similar to the ones Fine argues against in Testosterone Rex. Perhaps these people do believe that male humans can really produce 100 offspring a month, or at least some similarly absurdly high number. If that's the case, then I see the merit of Fine's discussion of the unlikelihood of men fathering 100 children a month. Of course, this is just one section among a larger book, and much of the book was not similarly frustrating. To summarise: much of the book was interesting; some parts seemed to be arguing against strawmen, but; it may be that these arguments are actually not strawmen (depending on the views of Fine's dialectical partners). In order to determine whether Fine successfully and absolutely defeats all aspects of the Testosterone Rex belief system I will have to read more about the differences (or lack thereof) between the sexes. Thanks to Cordelia Fine's interesting explication of and argumentation regarding these topics, I plan on undertaking such further education."
113,0393355489,http://goodreads.com/user/show/117566-mauri,3,"I forgot how funny Fine is - she writes in a tightly controlled, ""isn't it amusing how..."" sort of manner that both makes you laugh and realize that she is quite ticked off (and you should be too).In this, Fine tackles research about gender and sex, with a focus on knocking back a lot of the ""boys will be boys"" beliefs society holds dear.For example: male promiscuity. A man can impregnate hundreds of women in the time it takes a woman to gestate and bear one child, which she is usually bound to for years while that same man skips merrily from town to town. Therefore it makes sense that men want sex all the time and women don't. It's reproductively advantageous, duh.Fine merrily pokes holes in all of this. First, what women? Setting aside the number of women within a day's walk of the average caveman, Neolithic farmer, or 1800s city dweller, even in today's jet-setting world how many women are lining up to have sex with an endless line-up of horny men? Not just sex, but baby-making sex? And how many of those women are actually fertile at a given point of time? And while everyone can think of a story they heard about someone getting pregnant off a one night stand, I bet many more can think of couples taking months to conceive. Turns out this reproductive strategy may have only worked out for Genghis Khan and a few other despotic men throughout history, and, Fine points out, maybe that says more about despots than it does about men? In short, a lot of looking at scientific studies done on sex and gender that point out that there maybe? Might have? been a bit of bias going on. Less tightly constructed than Delusions of Gender: How Our Minds, Society, and Neurosexism Create Difference, Fine does meander a bit, but accessible to people whose eyes crossed a bit trying to read Women's Work, Men's Property: The Origins of Gender and Class. (Mine.)"
114,0393355489,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1348540-charlie,3,"Cordelia Fine sets up a well-known stalking horse in the shape of Testosterone Rex the king of hormones with a view to pulling him down and showing him to be a meaningless construct. She uses scientific studies as part of the technique for pulling him down, but also an appeal to ‘our values’. The Testosterone Rex construct which she pulls apart is the idea that boys will be boys, that the presence of testosterone makes men into naturally promiscuous hunters, risk takers and show-offs while the lack of it makes women into careful carers and nurturers. Fine needs to state her T Rex construct at the start of the book in order for the reader to know what she will be arguing against, however, I did not find that she made it clear until afterwards that this was not actually her view of the world. As a result, I nearly put the book down and left it before she was really ready to start. I found a lot of the science interesting, but I was somewhat sad that there was not more evidence for a wider range of elements to the story. The science seemed to be very strongly focussed around the risk-taking area. I guess this is the easiest part of the story to test and verify, but I would personally have liked a bit more stress on other areas too.The book states on the cover that it is a science book prize winner. It does not say it is also a feminist book. I am happy to read either or both kinds of book, but I picked this one up expecting something more dispassionate. The Author is however very passionate, she has a very definite agenda. She makes a good case for it with the evidence she uses, but as a scientist, that passion means that I have to wonder if the evidence she uses is cherry picked to make a point or not. I find that doubt tarnishes some apparently very good, interesting science for me. I would have preferred the science and the passion in two separate books."
115,0393355489,http://goodreads.com/user/show/17594936-colin,4,"I always find it hard to evaluate books like this. There are so many studies into human nature, human behaviour, sex differences, and for me, they raise more questions than they answer. How was that test administered? Were the men and women in the test into risk appetite all the same age? How was the question phrased? I invariably find myself doubting the scientific method, and then in the absence of reliable data points, measuring the writer's interpretation against my own experience. But of course that just means I'm layering my own bias on top of the writer's bias, which in turn is overlaid on the experimenter's experimental design. The result is a superficially plausible narrative, which I know will be contradicted by the next book I read on the same topic.Cordelia Fine does a good job of trying to combat the kinds of folk narrative explanations that thrive in all this confusion. She starts off with one of the hoariest of all - the idea that men have evolved to be unfaithful while women have evolved to be monogamous nest builders. This is one of the best known examples of sociobiology being drafted in to support a conclusion you know the researcher had in mind from the start and wanted to ""prove"". Fine's iconoclasm in taking aim at it seems admirable. She also takes care to present her evidence carefully, showing balanced results and not just trying to claim all the evidence points to one inevitable conclusion. This in marked contrast to - for example - Jordan Peterson who is forever pointing at stuff that happens in nature and implying that we just have to accept that the status quo is here to stay and resistance is futile. Give me a Cordelia Fine over a Jordan Peterson any day of the week. And she won't even tell me to tidy my room. I didn't find my hackles raising at any point, and although she editorialises strenuously on the meaning of the results, she's not trying to press the science into service or (as far as I can tell) manipulate the facts. Fair enough.The general gist is that there are differences between the sexes in some ways but that there was so much social conditioning overlaid on top of that that most of what we think of as immutable human nature can be stripped back if we, as a society, choose to do so. I think I'd put myself a little further towards the Stephen Pinker end of the spectrum but again, that's just me, maybe overlaying what I see around me, how I think and how women I know seem to think, how our daughter developed in what we thought was a fairly stereotype-free household... So it's a hit and miss, subjective interpretation of the facts but can any of us bring any better expertise to bear to judge between the competing claims of the people who have looked inside our brains and reckon they know what they've found there? Probably not."
116,0393355489,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2860188-eduardo-santiago,3,"So much research these days claims to find testosterone-this or hardwired-gender-difference-that. Risk-taking, competitiveness, ability, even childhood toy preference. Cordelia Fine somewhat exasperatedly follows up with crucial context—“the rest of the story,” if you will: yes, but this study didn’t consider corticoid levels; yes, but that other study neglected such-and-such findings; and most crucially yes, but it’s staggeringly difficult to isolate this effect from social and cultural factors. Nevertheless, she persiidentifies clever ways in which these issues have been studied, and the gist is: context matters. A lot.Science requires reproducibility. Reproducible results are best obtained when there are a small number of variables—hard to achieve with something as richly messy as a human life. Once one compensates for the factors overlooked in much research, plus publication bias, plus just plain built-in human bias, few effects survive scrutiny. Yes, we’re different—deliciously so, in my view!—but not in any way that affects ability. Not even in the slightest bit.Fine writes with a sardonic bite that worked well to start with but grew tiresome. I was also highly disappointed in her somewhat off-context quoting of Robert Sapolsky—a hero of mine—and her failure to acknowledge his groundbreaking work decades ago in breaking down testosterone myths. And, dear FSM, what has happened to proofreading? Much as I want to grant four stars, much as I think this is important work that needs to be read, I can only justify three. (Goodreads, could we have fractional stars please?)On a side note, I find myself fortunate to have read this just before and just after the 2018 Women’s March where I was surrounded by thousands of strong, powerful, capable human beings of all genders and colors, many of whom are living under the culturally-imposed “oh, you just aren’t able to do these sorts of things.” All of whom categorically reject that, as does Fine and as do I and, I trust, you. #resist.And on another side note: if you’re interested in these sorts of gender issues, I urge you to listen to this episode of the Hidden Brain podcast in which two progressive parents attempt to raise their children free of gender stereotypes and much loveliness ensues."
117,0393355489,http://goodreads.com/user/show/62793003-cody-mccoy,5,"Testosterone is not what you think it is. This book, cleverly written, does an outstanding job of decimating stereotypical beliefs that boys are boys and girls are girls because of innate, fixed differences. I used to think men were more prone to risk taking than women. It turns out that this isn’t true, for a few reasons! For example:1) risk taking studies have methodological flaws. For example, these studies typically focus on activities that are considered to be male-expertise. Different results are found if you consider female-expertise activities. Would you consider baking a very difficult soufflé for a dinner party? 2) risk taking studies ACTUALLY find that the most high-status people are most likely to take risks. In matrilineal society is women. In western society it is WHITE men followed by women and minorities. Etc.3) the actual risk to women of “risky” events proposed in these studies is MUCH HIGHER than the actual risk to men. Consider: would you go to the bus station at 11 PM for a chance to pick up $100? For whom is that obviously more risky- a 5’10” man or a 5’2” woman? Obviously women need the cash reward to be higher because they are literally facing MORE RISK. Change the situation so men are facing more risk, and the answers change.The book gives a careful data based treatment to many stereotypical beliefs, overturning widely held views about the impact of biological sex and sex hormones on the brain.

118,0393355489,http://goodreads.com/user/show/28668057-jasmine,3,"Cordelia Fine's Delusions of Gender was one of my favorite reads of the year, and so I was excited to pick up this sequel-in-spirit.It started out strong, combining Fine's delightful dry wit with a thorough review/critique of seminal works in the ""male/testestosterone = high risk/high reward = spray & pray mating strategy"" field. She then continued with a review of the many different ways male and female creatures compete for reproductive success. Although while I found this part interesting, I ultimately found tidbits like the two opposite mating strategies of the horned dung beetle to be less useful in my day-to-day experience of the world than the aspects of gender and science described in Delusions of Gender. The final portion I found to be a bit more unfocused. I found myself a little uncertain about what Fine or anyone else in the field takes home from experiments on risk versus reward between men and women. In this portion of the book particularly, she often repeated parts of Delusions of Gender - which left me feeling that perhaps this whole book could have been an extra set of chapters in the earlier volume rather than a stand-alone book.Still, I overall enjoyed the book, and would probably still read another book written by Fine - but I would recommend Delusions of Gender and not this one, as a starting point."
119,0393355489,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4239658-karen-chung,3,"This book was a fairly interesting, quick read, but I ended up convinced that testosterone is still the main source of male-female differences. The book made a lot of good points about how environment and social conditions can adjust the concentration of testosterone in an individual, and how circumstances can bring out ""atypical"" behavior relative to the usual gender stereotypes, such as gentle, nurturing behavior in males. But as I see it, testosterone is still at the core of and key to competitiveness, aggression, and ambition in humans (and probably other animals as well). Women have some too, just not as much, and I believe there is still a strong correlation between testosterone level and ambition and related traits in women. I highly recommend listening to this podcast in conjunction with this book:This American Life: Testosteronehttps://www.thisamericanlife.org/220/...Transcript:https://www.thisamericanlife.org/220/...It left a deep impression on me, and also adds a lot to what you will read in this book should you decide to give it a try."
120,0393355489,http://goodreads.com/user/show/16080726-sabin,2,"I'm in two minds about Cordelia Fine's achievements in this book. On the one hand, she crafts a very good and thorough argument for gender equality, attacking every conceivable statement which tries to make the existing gaps seem inevitable. Her arguments are filled with data taken from scientific studies and meta-analyses of the scientific literature. She explains that even some of the science is biased and concludes, many times over, that all the large gaps between the genders stem from cultural biases, which have constantly been reinforced throughout history. And based on the evidence she presents, I can do nothing else but wholeheartedly agree with her conclusions of culturally enforce artificial gender differences.On the other hand, the book is utterly repetitive. She states her conclusions from the start of the book, her arguments develop only slightly - repeating her conclusions over and over again, usually taking a popular counter-argument and battering it to a pulp and by pouring on it study after study which finds even a smidgen of evidence to support her claim. She tries to justify this aggressive crusade against gender-inequality by exaggerating the opposition. I scanned Joe Haldeman's book, Testosterone, for those glaring omissions she attributes to it – keeping testosterone only in the realm of male achievements. He does not omit to include the effects of testosterone in women and does mention the fuzziness of the results. I agree with her, though, that his tone is somewhat dismissive of the role testosterone plays in women's bodies and brains, but it's hard to distinguish between her presentation of real data and her consistently one-sided interpretation.She speaks of deeds, not words, to use in the fight for gender equality. But I'm afraid she misinterprets her mantra and uses words as a flurry of punches which hit everything and everyone who happens to be near her intended targets."

(and GNC is going to make America macho again). If you're tired of having gender essentialism used to explain why men can never be nurses (testosterone precludes empathy and caregiving!), or why women will never be interested enough in business to be CEOs (maybe we should make calculators pink!), this is a popular science repackaging of the actual scientific articles which demonstrate that hormones often follow behavior, that social and cultural structures are often far more to blame for the way men and women behave (women are also interested in casual sex, when the deck isn't stacked to get them killed of socially shunned) and that taking GNC Testosto-Boost is not going to fix personal insecurities."
122,0393355489,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2780292-tadas-talaikis,5,"On many traits males are more variable than are females without a difference on average, what makes my belief about no real difference in advantage between males and females.Will see what this book says or not about it.Says pretty much it and this is first book I had found about it. Then it led me to more research and keeping everything short: 46 meta-analyses on ""cognitive, verbal and nonverbal communication, aggression (sic!), leadership, self-esteem, moral reasoning and motor behaviors"", risk taking, etc. - there are no big differences between sexes: SourceThat pretty says it all, but more popular would always be idiocies like Men from Mars, Women from Venus."

125,0393355489,http://goodreads.com/user/show/46538050-lance,5,"“ Although scientific claims don’t tell us how our society ought to be, that being the job of our values, they can give us strong hints as to how to fulfil those values, and what kind of arrangements are feasible.”Cordelia Fine’s new book critiquing the objective psychology and biology behind behavioural differences between the sexes is an excellent update and expansion of her writing in Delusions of Gender, a truly gratifying and formative book in helping me understand my own gender in relation to my physiology. Fine is a skill-full, witty, insightful, and above all scientifically ruthless writer. Her greatest appeal is that she brings sharp objectivity to such an emotionally-charged discussion, and helps defend feminist and queer ideals with logic, fact, and perspective. One of the best books released this year, full of new information for me even though I read the psychology and neuroscience literature regularly. A heroic book.Fine begins with an elegant challenge to Darwin’s theory of sexual selection. This echoes the broad themes of Evolution’s Rainbow, but it des not appear in the references and the arguments are refined with greater precision and clarity. Sexual selection theory, which states that the low-investment sperm production in males mandates a competitive, aggressive, promiscuous mating strategy which cannot benefit females is supported by very little evidence. The 1945 study by Bateman with fruit flies which is often cited as the first impirical evidence of this showed “ The outcome of Bateman’s six series of matchmaking was the first scientific report of greater male variation in reproductive success. For example, 21 per cent of males failed to produce any off-spring, compared with only 4 per cent of females.” Yet Fine cites recent meta-analyses of Bateman’s own data which showed that the mutant fly lines he used to detect paternity of offspring overcounted fathers and underrepresented maternal mutations, and that his own findings showed greater offspring survival in promiscuous females. “ Proposed gains of female promiscuity include genetic benefits, healthier offspring, and the opportunity to set up sperm competitions that weed out inferior specimens.” Using statistics to explain poor analysis and biased publication of positive results, Fine show that there is just as much evidence that the traditionally “male” mating strategy is effective for females in some environments, and equally the “female” strategy can be effective for males. I particularly enjoyed the numerical analysis of the fecundity of a single man achieving more than 100 one-night-stands a year, still less likely than a monogamous man of fathering a single baby. “ (Indeed, a promiscuous man would need to have sex with more than 130 women just to have 90 per cent odds of outdoing the one baby a monogamous man might expect to father in a year.)” This simplistic view of “mating strategies” is made to seem outdated and juvenile.Fine then attacks the biology underlying these ecological assumptions, the idea that there are hard-wired genetics programmes, boulstered by hormones, which then dictate how a person will live their life. “ To confuse human (cultural) sexuality and (natural) reproduction is classically pseudo-scientific.” She dispels the idea that the most attractive men are wealthy and powerful whereas the most attractive women are merely young, by pooling data from dozens of cultures from urban China “But an analysis of actual matches made through an online dating Web site in China found that likes-attract again provided a much better explanation of the data than did potentials-attract.” to hunter-gatherer societies which demonstrated that humans are more attracted to those that they share traits in common with than there architypes. Fine shows that women underperform in laboratory tasks after being primed that these are “masculine” tasks as a form of social defence, and that ficticious male job applications are actually considered more favourably if the candidate admits to being poor at traditionally “feminine” activities. “ For many decades, researchers supposed that masculinity and femininity are polar ends of a single dimension: someone high in masculinity is therefore necessarily low in femininity, and vice versa.” Even the single traditionally masculine dimension of risk-taking is shown to be an uncorrelated mix of different psychological assessments of different situations (those who gamble are no more likely to take health or ethical risks etc.), and that findings that women are more risk averse also apply to dozens of other populations in society whom also face discrimination. “ Society seemed a significantly safer place to white males than it did to all other groups, including nonwhite men.” It is very difficult to objectively make a case that this T-Rex “hyper male” persona exists within the male population, and is not an extrapolation that blends many historical time periods and cultures into something fictional.“ These very open-ended outcomes would be more easily achieved by a developmental pathway that runs from sex to socialization to the brain (and hormones, as we’ll come to in a later chapter), rather than by an inflexible direct path from sex to brain.”Arguments for the essential, and probable, role of environment in human behaviour over hard-wired genetic determinism is skilfully and logically made. Queer identities are not the main focus of this book but are dealt with using sensitivity and intelligence. “If most of us were intersex in some way or another, the ubiquitous question, “Is it a boy or a girl?” wouldn’t be so compelling. And if the shape of our external genitalia fell on a continuum, with the majority of people in an ambiguous midrange shape, it’s an interesting question whether our sex would play such a key role in how we present ourselves to the world.” I hope to see future writing from her which might expand some of these tantalising hints.Fine’s treatment of the animal literature of sex differences is droll, thorough, and erudite. “ The development of testes from an “androgynous” gonad is an active, gene-directed process, but in the absence of the potent, male SRY gene, ovarian tissue just… happens, as the default?” She reveals amazingly underpublicized results. For example, male rats will care for young if there is no female in the cage to do it for them, showing that they have all the same innate behavioural tools as females. Also, chemically castrated macaques of high social status do not lose their power, aggression, or mating opportunities in the absence of testosterone. In many animals, including fish with whopping testicles, social status trusts blood testosterone levels and scientists are beginning to believe that hormones respond to social heirarchies, rather than a linear system the other way round. ““Social events regulate gonadal events.” Or to put it another way, just in case the significance of this sailed past unnoticed, cichlid testes are a social construction.” Even differences in hypocampal dendrites between the sexes are so condition-specific that it is impossible to even ascribe a “male” or “female” profile. “In other words, brief stress exposure reverses the “sex difference” for that particular brain characteristic.” Is being stressed more truly “male” than being relaxed, and which types of being stressed? Overall, this is a scholarly criticism of the often oversimplified debate surrounding sex/gender associated anatomy and the erroneous leap that this represents thinking. I could not fault the science or the writing. I’m just sad that it’s finished now.“Science writer and behavioural endocrinologist Richard Francis coined the term “Testosterone Rex” to poke fun at the mistaken conception of testosterone as a “super-actor”—the “plenipotent executor of selection’s demands” that simply “takes care of everything.””"
126,0393355489,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5847899-patrick,3,"When I picked this up, I thought this book might be about to try to persuade me that there are no innate differences between men and women beyond those that are self-evident, and that the differences we think might exist are all merely the result of social conditioning. And that is not actually what this book claims - it is, after all  nature and nurture but still...The book demolishes a particular cartoon 'biological essentialist' version of sex differences, and there probably are those who do actually subscribe to such a view (though I doubt any of them would pick this book up) but it did feel like it was skewering a straw man. All of which is fine, but very often, Fine seems to leave the balance to the footnotes. And while I'm in no way expert enough to offer my own informed view, I got the impression that she was sometimes being very deliberately selective in the studies she refers to in order to strengthen her pre-existing point of view ('policy-based evidence making as a long-time colleague put it, albeit in a very different context).For example, she does quite a good job of rubbishing the idea that all men are driven on some level by a desire to obtain a harem, but then I think she pushes the argument too far in trying to imply, without ever quite saying it, that there are no real differences between (the average) men and women's attitudes to casual sex at all. The fact that she cites in support a study by Teela Sanders about the fact that men who visit prostitutes very often go back to the same person over and over, but never stops to look at what I'd regard as the more fundamental question of why almost all prostitution is servicing the desires of male clients is just one example. And it turns out that the stuff she has at the beginning about fruit flies' mating behaviours is also a fairly selective version of the wider evidence on the topic (though I had to google that to find it out).As a whole, the book seemed uneven in that a great deal of space is given to how we are shaped by our social environment, and even how it can shape our very biology, but questions of how biology might shape the social world we construct are not really given much of an airing.All the same, I thought there was a fair amount of interest to found here: For example, the chapter on risk-taking, examining in more detail the cliched idea that men tend to take more risk than women was a quite illuminating exploration of what we actually mean by 'risk taking'. The idea, in particular that the concept had been very narrowly defined by those investigating risk-taking differences between the sexes to look specifically at a particular kind of physical risk and that this could be used to build a narrative that the 2008 (and presumably the 1929) financial crash was caused by the testosterone levels of (mainly male) city traders she shows to be a rather simplistic reading of the evidence. She also does quite a good job of questioning the validity of experiments exploring risk-taking or gambling behaviours in artificial environments where absolutely nothing is truly at stake.So worth a read, but not the comprehensive demolition of the idea that there are biologically determined differences between the average man and the average woman that the author sometimes seems to have set out to write."
127,0393355489,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5275457-mirte,4,"Extremely interesting book! I was drawn in by the title, which in my opinion is quite brilliantly thought up. Fine attempts to shine her light on common conceptions of gender based on outdated scientific views. While some sections were a little too sciencey (which is, of course, unsurprising!), she generally manages to use clear language to convey her argument. I felt a little more sociology might have supported the overall point even further, since gender is one of the ultimate multidisciplinary fields of this moment.I'd highly recommend this book to anyone who feels their blood boil when someone argues men are simply more likely to cheat, women are more caring because genes and 'boys will be boys'. Get your ammunition for that next conversation ;)"

130,0393355489,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11116317-kevin-orrman-rossiter,5,"Many a modern book on popular science leads with a quest story positioning the people and scientific puzzle contextually - historical and social scene setting for the story of discovery to unfold. Not so Cordelia Fine in her new book Testosterone Rex: unmaking the myths of our gendered minds. Instead Fine leads with a scene of domestic normalcy, a family dinner where a discussion on desexing the new family pet dog moves on to taxidermy and the possibility of making the said canines testicles into a key ring. This almost deadpan start sets the scene for a witty riposte to those who insist on the testosterone myth that we, modern men and women, are fixed in an ancestral past that rewarded competitive males and caring females.Winner of the 2017 Royal Society Science Book Award, Testosterone Rex brings together evolutionary science, psychology, neuroscience and social history to move beyond old ‘nature versus nurture’ debates, and to explain ‘I think you’ll find it’s more complicated than men are from Mars and women are from Venus‘ and therefore why it’s time to unmake the tyrannical myth of Testosterone Rex. The author, Cordelia Fine, is a professor of the history and philosophy of science at the University of Melbourne. Fine’s earlier two books; A mind of its own (2006) and Delusions of gender (2010) were similarly insightful, intellectually pugnacious and drolly written. I remember being annoyed reading A mind of its own, making copious margin notes as I went - for me usually a good sign that a book has a lot to say and is challenging my existing ideas and/or sparking off new ones. Like Jonathan Swift, Fine is a writer who will “vex the world rather than divert it.” A worthy recipient of the Royal Society science book award.Fine tackles many of the classic experiments that have led to our myths around testosterone, maleness and competitiveness. One such example is a chapter long denouement of A. J. Bateman’s 1940s experiments on fruit flies and its later (1960s) elaboration by biologist Robert Trivers, which resulted in the almost universally accepted “Bateman’s principle” that males would do best (pace Darwin) by competing with other males in order to spread their cheap, mass-produced sperm among as many females as possible - while females should protect their precious eggs and be as selective as possible. Fine counters these experiments and the conclusions drawn from them, canvassing a large body of contemporary research that looks not only at the conclusions drawn, sexually reluctant females and promiscuous males, in addition underlining the biases that Bateman introduced, prejudicing his own results. All this is achieved with witty referencing to Maserati-driving boyfriends and the ever popular tails of the male Peacock.Fine then moves on to dismember the arguments that airily tie together sexual selection, evolutionary biology and consumer behaviour such as a Maserati -driving male giving a pair of Bulgari sunglasses as a male flaunting their resources. Fine asserts that for humans sexuality is far more than for reproduction. Reminding us: humans routinely engage in sexual pairings and acts, that not only often don’t - but actually can’t - lead to pregnancy. There are also many human sexual activities, like touching, kissing, and oral sex that likewise have no reproductive potential.The idea that we we have only to peel away the veneer of culture, learning, habit, fantasy and the true (natural) sexual being will emerge is pseudoscience - it is profoundly mistaken.Having demolished the past Rex myths Fine then proceeds to wittily tackle the current testosterone myths. If you were wondering Why can’t a woman be more like a man? or Are males (naturally) more risk-taking? Will I become a monstrous sexual predator if I increase the testosterone in my bloodstream? or If the Lehman brothers were sisters would we have had the recent global financial crisis? then read Testosterone Rex.Fine concludes with a grand challenge. Words are nice but often deeds are better - become less polite and more disruptive. Sexual equality is more than a lovely idea in principle. The science, Fine reveals, of Testosterone Rex does not block the path to a better place - it is our complacency in ‘waiting’ patiently for an evolutionary change to occur. Thinking that men are from Mars and women are from Venus is about our values not science.This review was first posted here: http://dragonlaughing.tumblr.com/post... "

“So what happens when a scientist, under controlled laboratory conditions, simulates a first-wave feminist rodent movement by placing males in cages with pups but no females? Before too long you will see the male “mothering” the infant, in much the same way that females do. Feminism: 1. Sexual selection: nil.”
 Delusions of Gender: How Our Minds, Society, and Neurosexism Create Difference is one of my favorite psychology/science books of all-time: it’s funny, it’s clever, and it’s devastatingly sharp in cutting away the illusionist veil that many people still pretend hangs over the divide between boys and girls.So when its scientific successor,  Testosterone Rex: Myths of Sex, Science, and Society, came out, I knew I had to get my hands on it as soon as possible. And, as expected, it’s as good as the first – though I have to admit I enjoyed it slightly less because I’m not as hardcore into biology and hormones as I am into psychology. But that’s purely a personal preference.In this book, psychologist and researcher  Cordelia Fine takes a good, hard look at the influence of the hormone testosterone on humans and gender – effectively separating its presumed influence, and its scientific and biological influence. Just as in her previous book, she picks apart both research and popular or common opinion, giving us readers a critical overview of what testosterone does do and what it doesn’t. (Or what we might simply assume it to do rather than what it actually does.)I’ve heard people accuse Fine of cherry picking scientific data and not being able to explain away certain discrepancies in gender – such as higher statistics for men in terms of crime and rape – with her explanations and expositions of the workings of testosterone.I respectfully disagree. What Fine shows us with this book is that causal relations cannot just be applied to any and all things without evidence, or without critically examining just what such a causal relation might imply. An example of this would be, “If men are statistically more likely to commit a crime than women, then it must be due to testosterone, because that marks the main/biggest biological difference between men and women!”.I can see how someone could arrive at such a conclusion, but: in human nature, combining both psychology and biology, it’s almost impossible to subscribe an effect to one single variable (in this case, subscribing higher crime rates in men to testosterone). Especially with hormones, the interaction of a hormone with its host and that host’s direct environment can have a huge effect on the workings of said hormone.Not to mention that a variable might play a much smaller role than initially expected.Fine dives into both of these lines of thoughts (complex interaction versus actual role) into this book, which leads to a bunch of very interesting reinterpretations of existing research. She steps outside of the simple paradigm that says, “X makes Y happen” and looks at what exactly constitutes X, what influences both X and Y, and is it actually true that X makes Y happen?It’s a solid, well-researched book that doesn’t shy away from using field jargon (so be warned if you’re not fully at home in psychology/biology research) and forces its readers to look at common assumptions in a different way. Even as a fellow psychologist, it taught me a lot, and gave me plenty of insights to ponder upon.It’s also funny and wittily written, which makes it a more pleasant read throughout the drier research material. (Though doubtlessly some will find Fine’s references to feminism and jokes about sexism offensive.)"
132,0393355489,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3611893-dearbhla,5,"I read Fine's Delusions of Gender a few years ago and really enjoyed it, so when I saw she had another one coming out I knew I had to order it. It is just as good as Delusions, and I would recommend it to anyone to read.

In this book Fine takes a look at testosterone and asks is it really the reason behind financial crisis, risk taking, and the differences between the sexes. the short answer is no. The slightly longer, but still short version is that it has an important role to play but it is equally as important as all other hormones in the human body. For more go read the book, it is fascinating, interesting, funny and very readable. Fine has a great style. She weaves personal anecdotes in with scientific studies as well as her own speculation. She counters arguments with facts and figures, but never in a dry and boring way.It is also a most quotable book, if you follow me on tumblr you may have noticed, if not click here for a selection and if that doesn't prompt you to think about trying this book I don't know what will.One of my very favourite lines is Social events regulate gonadal events. I think it should be my new motto.But apart from the writing style what she says in the book is important. She never says that there aren't differences between men and women, but she emphasizes that we cannot accurately tell what is causing those differences. From the moment we are born we are influenced by both genes and environment, and sometimes environment has a greater influence. Never mind the fact that when you average everything out there are more differences between men (or women) than between the sexes. Also, sex is a spectrum, not an either or. Stereotypes and hardline ""men are like this"" views do nobody any good.People are people, and people are different to people in many many ways. And society and experience do a lot to shape people. If you think about the idea behind ""privilege"" for example you can see that influences how people of differing backgrounds see and act. It isn't what you were born with, it is how society around you that shapes what you were born with.I've skimmed a few of the negative reviews on Goodreads and many of them seem to say ""I don't agree with this so it is wrong"" and some say that Fine wants to proclaim that there are no differences between men and women. Well, I've read the book and she makes it perfectly clear that there are differences, both in humans and in other species, what she is looking at is how innate those differences are and can they be altered? Also across the whole species are the differences really there. And in some cases she argues that, yes, they are. In others no, the variables even out across a large sample. Fine also points to numerous studies that show that just because X has been the way for so long, it doesn't mean it can't ever be altered.Of course I came to the book on her side, so maybe I'm just agreeing with her because it supports my view of the world. I'm not a scientist and am not about to go through hundreds of studies in an attempt to prove myself wrong. However I have skimmed through some of those ""men are from mars"" type books, you know the sort that try to argue that all relationship differences exist because men are like this while women are like that, and in most cases I don't identify with the version of womanhood that they portray. So maybe I'm just an outlier, or maybe there is more to being a person than what is between your legs."

Those statements have hurt only the egos of the many academic bureaucrats who have built a well paid career by mindlessly singing odes to the Emperor's new clothes. And by publishing Intellectual Impostures the world got to see how many academics were scurrying to hide their nakedness behind century old desks.Cordelia Fine deals a new blow to the impostors. Say one Gijsbert Stoet who can declare: In the stone age, it was useful for men to be hunters and women to look after babies, and nature has helped by encoding some of these skills in the hardware of our brain. That still influences how we think today although he never encountered live stone age hominids, unless his priestly confessor can do channeling.

Read my GR friend Trevor's review, it says it all:https://www.goodreads.com/review/show...Just to add, it is interesting what this book says about one of the acrimonious debates in feminism - which I'll crassly summarise as smash the patriarchy vs lean in. Lean In: Women, Work, and the Will to Lead being Sheryl Sandberg's book which encourages women to work within the system but to much more aggressively put themselves forward and refuse to be ignored/underpaid/touched up etc. Fine doesn't mention the book but she does suggest the Lean In approach, as well as not only ignoring and leaving intact the structural barriers that exclude women, may also simply not work. She quotes one study which found that both female and male graduates of high-powered MBA courses were equally forthright in negotiating the pay package when they landed their first job. But guess what? Women's demands were met less often than men's. Because Fine's book is about hormones, her point is that it's not hormones that make men more aggressive in negotiating etc. It could just be, that after being knocked back again and again, maybe you just give up? The cost/benefit analysis is going to be different.I'm not going to downgrade my star rating because of the chirpy and not funny ""this is a science book but don't worry it's accessible"" stuff, which I imagine is a feature of a lot of popular science writing (I haven't read much, I'm just guessing).

136,0393355489,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7089145-alisha,3,"3.5 stars.....more to come later but this was a mix of some really great science and a little bit of reaching too far to make conclusions that the author holds near and dear. Speculation is always allowed and even fruitful but there needs to be a clear delineation between fact and what has been surmised from that (this was starkly clear in the chapter regarding hormones and I was disappointed to find that the author spent an inordinate amount of time on testosterone and none on estrogen). I also felt that the book suffered from uneven handling of the many animal studies; sometimes they were used to show that humans are different and we can't use the results from those studies to compare to humans.....and then when the results of the studies aligned with an idea that the author liked then suddenly the results of those studies were extrapolated to humans as well. This hearkens back to the old saying - ""when you're a hammer everything looks like a nail""."
137,0393355489,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1058994-ryan-mishap,5,"Combined with her previous book--Delusions of Gender--this is crucial reading that shows how little difference there is between these so-called immutable genders our society has created. This book shatters the testosterone excuse for how men behave and explores the real evolutionary story in light of our cultures, traditions, and power relations.All around brilliant: as science writing, it is straight-forward, well argued, and hilarious. She also boldly claims to be a feminist writing a feminist science book--no doubt this will land her many detractors who will focus on her supposed bias instead of on the research she illuminates.Go, read this now."
138,0393355489,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1045774-mehrsa,4,"Interesting research about gender differences. Testosterone is not as determinative as previously thought. I think the debunking of the myth is useful and asking questions and doing more research on gender is important, but I wasn't sure she made quite the case that she tried to make about the lack of meaningful differences. I want to read more by her though to see if her other books are more thorough. "
139,0393355489,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6262367-abby,2,"Not nearly as interesting as her first book (Delusions of Gender). I felt like she was just making the same point (humans are complicated and not ruled by gender-specific hormones) for 300 pages.

142,0393355489,http://goodreads.com/user/show/30924713-kramer-thompson,3,"I am very new to the science behind gender/sex differences and similarities, and I found Testosterone Rex quite interesting. Fine discusses quite a variety of ways that the sexes are purportedly distinct, and argues that under scrutiny we discover that they are actually not so different. Many of the studies she cites to back these views up are very interesting, and she presents most of the topics in a very accessible way.That said, at times it seemed like she might have been arguing against a strawman. For example, at the beginning of one chapter Fine notes one quote by David Schmitt, who states that male humans have the ability to lend their sperm in the conception of 100 offspring within a single month by mating with many (100) different women. She then spends a large section of that chapter demonstrating how implausible this is. But what's really important is not whether male humans could produce 100 offspring a month, but merely whether they could consistently produce a significantly higher amount of offspring by acting polygynously than could female humans. This would suggest that male polygyny could be adaptive and thus that the tendency for men to act polygynously could be an adaptation. Of course it is implausible that men could produce 100 offspring in a month. But could they produce 1 a month? 2? 5? Fine does state afterwards that the males of some tribes whose behaviour probably resembles that of humans over much of our evolutionary history are expected to produce a maximum of 12-16 children, and women of those tribes 9-12. This suggests that a strategy of male polygyny would not be significantly more adaptive than monogamy, so there probably would not be an adaptation for male polygyny. I would have much preferred detailed examination of Fine's latter claim regarding the maximum offspring able to be produced by men in tribes that purportedly resemble humans throughout much of our evolutionary history. It seems to me that such discussion would be more relevant to serious debates about the adaptiveness of male polygyny. However, I get the impression that there are people who take serious, hardline approaches that are very similar to the ones Fine argues against in Testosterone Rex. Perhaps these people do believe that male humans can really produce 100 offspring a month, or at least some similarly absurdly high number. If that's the case, then I see the merit of Fine's discussion of the unlikelihood of men fathering 100 children a month. Of course, this is just one section among a larger book, and much of the book was not similarly frustrating. To summarise: much of the book was interesting; some parts seemed to be arguing against strawmen, but; it may be that these arguments are actually not strawmen (depending on the views of Fine's dialectical partners). In order to determine whether Fine successfully and absolutely defeats all aspects of the Testosterone Rex belief system I will have to read more about the differences (or lack thereof) between the sexes. Thanks to Cordelia Fine's interesting explication of and argumentation regarding these topics, I plan on undertaking such further education."
143,0393355489,http://goodreads.com/user/show/117566-mauri,3,"I forgot how funny Fine is - she writes in a tightly controlled, ""isn't it amusing how..."" sort of manner that both makes you laugh and realize that she is quite ticked off (and you should be too).In this, Fine tackles research about gender and sex, with a focus on knocking back a lot of the ""boys will be boys"" beliefs society holds dear.For example: male promiscuity. A man can impregnate hundreds of women in the time it takes a woman to gestate and bear one child, which she is usually bound to for years while that same man skips merrily from town to town. Therefore it makes sense that men want sex all the time and women don't. It's reproductively advantageous, duh.Fine merrily pokes holes in all of this. First, what women? Setting aside the number of women within a day's walk of the average caveman, Neolithic farmer, or 1800s city dweller, even in today's jet-setting world how many women are lining up to have sex with an endless line-up of horny men? Not just sex, but baby-making sex? And how many of those women are actually fertile at a given point of time? And while everyone can think of a story they heard about someone getting pregnant off a one night stand, I bet many more can think of couples taking months to conceive. Turns out this reproductive strategy may have only worked out for Genghis Khan and a few other despotic men throughout history, and, Fine points out, maybe that says more about despots than it does about men? In short, a lot of looking at scientific studies done on sex and gender that point out that there maybe? Might have? been a bit of bias going on. Less tightly constructed than Delusions of Gender: How Our Minds, Society, and Neurosexism Create Difference, Fine does meander a bit, but accessible to people whose eyes crossed a bit trying to read Women's Work, Men's Property: The Origins of Gender and Class. (Mine.)"
144,0393355489,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1348540-charlie,3,"Cordelia Fine sets up a well-known stalking horse in the shape of Testosterone Rex the king of hormones with a view to pulling him down and showing him to be a meaningless construct. She uses scientific studies as part of the technique for pulling him down, but also an appeal to ‘our values’. The Testosterone Rex construct which she pulls apart is the idea that boys will be boys, that the presence of testosterone makes men into naturally promiscuous hunters, risk takers and show-offs while the lack of it makes women into careful carers and nurturers. Fine needs to state her T Rex construct at the start of the book in order for the reader to know what she will be arguing against, however, I did not find that she made it clear until afterwards that this was not actually her view of the world. As a result, I nearly put the book down and left it before she was really ready to start. I found a lot of the science interesting, but I was somewhat sad that there was not more evidence for a wider range of elements to the story. The science seemed to be very strongly focussed around the risk-taking area. I guess this is the easiest part of the story to test and verify, but I would personally have liked a bit more stress on other areas too.The book states on the cover that it is a science book prize winner. It does not say it is also a feminist book. I am happy to read either or both kinds of book, but I picked this one up expecting something more dispassionate. The Author is however very passionate, she has a very definite agenda. She makes a good case for it with the evidence she uses, but as a scientist, that passion means that I have to wonder if the evidence she uses is cherry picked to make a point or not. I find that doubt tarnishes some apparently very good, interesting science for me. I would have preferred the science and the passion in two separate books."
145,0393355489,http://goodreads.com/user/show/17594936-colin,4,"I always find it hard to evaluate books like this. There are so many studies into human nature, human behaviour, sex differences, and for me, they raise more questions than they answer. How was that test administered? Were the men and women in the test into risk appetite all the same age? How was the question phrased? I invariably find myself doubting the scientific method, and then in the absence of reliable data points, measuring the writer's interpretation against my own experience. But of course that just means I'm layering my own bias on top of the writer's bias, which in turn is overlaid on the experimenter's experimental design. The result is a superficially plausible narrative, which I know will be contradicted by the next book I read on the same topic.Cordelia Fine does a good job of trying to combat the kinds of folk narrative explanations that thrive in all this confusion. She starts off with one of the hoariest of all - the idea that men have evolved to be unfaithful while women have evolved to be monogamous nest builders. This is one of the best known examples of sociobiology being drafted in to support a conclusion you know the researcher had in mind from the start and wanted to ""prove"". Fine's iconoclasm in taking aim at it seems admirable. She also takes care to present her evidence carefully, showing balanced results and not just trying to claim all the evidence points to one inevitable conclusion. This in marked contrast to - for example - Jordan Peterson who is forever pointing at stuff that happens in nature and implying that we just have to accept that the status quo is here to stay and resistance is futile. Give me a Cordelia Fine over a Jordan Peterson any day of the week. And she won't even tell me to tidy my room. I didn't find my hackles raising at any point, and although she editorialises strenuously on the meaning of the results, she's not trying to press the science into service or (as far as I can tell) manipulate the facts. Fair enough.The general gist is that there are differences between the sexes in some ways but that there was so much social conditioning overlaid on top of that that most of what we think of as immutable human nature can be stripped back if we, as a society, choose to do so. I think I'd put myself a little further towards the Stephen Pinker end of the spectrum but again, that's just me, maybe overlaying what I see around me, how I think and how women I know seem to think, how our daughter developed in what we thought was a fairly stereotype-free household... So it's a hit and miss, subjective interpretation of the facts but can any of us bring any better expertise to bear to judge between the competing claims of the people who have looked inside our brains and reckon they know what they've found there? Probably not."
146,0393355489,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2860188-eduardo-santiago,3,"So much research these days claims to find testosterone-this or hardwired-gender-difference-that. Risk-taking, competitiveness, ability, even childhood toy preference. Cordelia Fine somewhat exasperatedly follows up with crucial context—“the rest of the story,” if you will: yes, but this study didn’t consider corticoid levels; yes, but that other study neglected such-and-such findings; and most crucially yes, but it’s staggeringly difficult to isolate this effect from social and cultural factors. Nevertheless, she persiidentifies clever ways in which these issues have been studied, and the gist is: context matters. A lot.Science requires reproducibility. Reproducible results are best obtained when there are a small number of variables—hard to achieve with something as richly messy as a human life. Once one compensates for the factors overlooked in much research, plus publication bias, plus just plain built-in human bias, few effects survive scrutiny. Yes, we’re different—deliciously so, in my view!—but not in any way that affects ability. Not even in the slightest bit.Fine writes with a sardonic bite that worked well to start with but grew tiresome. I was also highly disappointed in her somewhat off-context quoting of Robert Sapolsky—a hero of mine—and her failure to acknowledge his groundbreaking work decades ago in breaking down testosterone myths. And, dear FSM, what has happened to proofreading? Much as I want to grant four stars, much as I think this is important work that needs to be read, I can only justify three. (Goodreads, could we have fractional stars please?)On a side note, I find myself fortunate to have read this just before and just after the 2018 Women’s March where I was surrounded by thousands of strong, powerful, capable human beings of all genders and colors, many of whom are living under the culturally-imposed “oh, you just aren’t able to do these sorts of things.” All of whom categorically reject that, as does Fine and as do I and, I trust, you. #resist.And on another side note: if you’re interested in these sorts of gender issues, I urge you to listen to this episode of the Hidden Brain podcast in which two progressive parents attempt to raise their children free of gender stereotypes and much loveliness ensues."
147,0393355489,http://goodreads.com/user/show/62793003-cody-mccoy,5,"Testosterone is not what you think it is. This book, cleverly written, does an outstanding job of decimating stereotypical beliefs that boys are boys and girls are girls because of innate, fixed differences. I used to think men were more prone to risk taking than women. It turns out that this isn’t true, for a few reasons! For example:1) risk taking studies have methodological flaws. For example, these studies typically focus on activities that are considered to be male-expertise. Different results are found if you consider female-expertise activities. Would you consider baking a very difficult soufflé for a dinner party? 2) risk taking studies ACTUALLY find that the most high-status people are most likely to take risks. In matrilineal society is women. In western society it is WHITE men followed by women and minorities. Etc.3) the actual risk to women of “risky” events proposed in these studies is MUCH HIGHER than the actual risk to men. Consider: would you go to the bus station at 11 PM for a chance to pick up $100? For whom is that obviously more risky- a 5’10” man or a 5’2” woman? Obviously women need the cash reward to be higher because they are literally facing MORE RISK. Change the situation so men are facing more risk, and the answers change.The book gives a careful data based treatment to many stereotypical beliefs, overturning widely held views about the impact of biological sex and sex hormones on the brain.

148,0393355489,http://goodreads.com/user/show/28668057-jasmine,3,"Cordelia Fine's Delusions of Gender was one of my favorite reads of the year, and so I was excited to pick up this sequel-in-spirit.It started out strong, combining Fine's delightful dry wit with a thorough review/critique of seminal works in the ""male/testestosterone = high risk/high reward = spray & pray mating strategy"" field. She then continued with a review of the many different ways male and female creatures compete for reproductive success. Although while I found this part interesting, I ultimately found tidbits like the two opposite mating strategies of the horned dung beetle to be less useful in my day-to-day experience of the world than the aspects of gender and science described in Delusions of Gender. The final portion I found to be a bit more unfocused. I found myself a little uncertain about what Fine or anyone else in the field takes home from experiments on risk versus reward between men and women. In this portion of the book particularly, she often repeated parts of Delusions of Gender - which left me feeling that perhaps this whole book could have been an extra set of chapters in the earlier volume rather than a stand-alone book.Still, I overall enjoyed the book, and would probably still read another book written by Fine - but I would recommend Delusions of Gender and not this one, as a starting point."
149,0393355489,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4239658-karen-chung,3,"This book was a fairly interesting, quick read, but I ended up convinced that testosterone is still the main source of male-female differences. The book made a lot of good points about how environment and social conditions can adjust the concentration of testosterone in an individual, and how circumstances can bring out ""atypical"" behavior relative to the usual gender stereotypes, such as gentle, nurturing behavior in males. But as I see it, testosterone is still at the core of and key to competitiveness, aggression, and ambition in humans (and probably other animals as well). Women have some too, just not as much, and I believe there is still a strong correlation between testosterone level and ambition and related traits in women. I highly recommend listening to this podcast in conjunction with this book:This American Life: Testosteronehttps://www.thisamericanlife.org/220/...Transcript:https://www.thisamericanlife.org/220/...It left a deep impression on me, and also adds a lot to what you will read in this book should you decide to give it a try."
150,0393355489,http://goodreads.com/user/show/16080726-sabin,2,"I'm in two minds about Cordelia Fine's achievements in this book. On the one hand, she crafts a very good and thorough argument for gender equality, attacking every conceivable statement which tries to make the existing gaps seem inevitable. Her arguments are filled with data taken from scientific studies and meta-analyses of the scientific literature. She explains that even some of the science is biased and concludes, many times over, that all the large gaps between the genders stem from cultural biases, which have constantly been reinforced throughout history. And based on the evidence she presents, I can do nothing else but wholeheartedly agree with her conclusions of culturally enforce artificial gender differences.On the other hand, the book is utterly repetitive. She states her conclusions from the start of the book, her arguments develop only slightly - repeating her conclusions over and over again, usually taking a popular counter-argument and battering it to a pulp and by pouring on it study after study which finds even a smidgen of evidence to support her claim. She tries to justify this aggressive crusade against gender-inequality by exaggerating the opposition. I scanned Joe Haldeman's book, Testosterone, for those glaring omissions she attributes to it – keeping testosterone only in the realm of male achievements. He does not omit to include the effects of testosterone in women and does mention the fuzziness of the results. I agree with her, though, that his tone is somewhat dismissive of the role testosterone plays in women's bodies and brains, but it's hard to distinguish between her presentation of real data and her consistently one-sided interpretation.She speaks of deeds, not words, to use in the fight for gender equality. But I'm afraid she misinterprets her mantra and uses words as a flurry of punches which hit everything and everyone who happens to be near her intended targets."

If you're tired of having gender essentialism used to explain why men can never be nurses (testosterone precludes empathy and caregiving!), or why women will never be interested enough in business to be CEOs (maybe we should make calculators pink!), this is a popular science repackaging of the actual scientific articles which demonstrate that hormones often follow behavior, that social and cultural structures are often far more to blame for the way men and women behave (women are also interested in casual sex, when the deck isn't stacked to get them killed of socially shunned) and that taking GNC Testosto-Boost is not going to fix personal insecurities."

Fine is a skill-full, witty, insightful, and above all scientifically ruthless writer. Her greatest appeal is that she brings sharp objectivity to such an emotionally-charged discussion, and helps defend feminist and queer ideals with logic, fact, and perspective. One of the best books released this year, full of new information for me even though I read the psychology and neuroscience literature regularly. A heroic book.Fine begins with an elegant challenge to Darwin’s theory of sexual selection. This echoes the broad themes of Evolution’s Rainbow, but it des not appear in the references and the arguments are refined with greater precision and clarity. Sexual selection theory, which states that the low-investment sperm production in males mandates a competitive, aggressive, promiscuous mating strategy which cannot benefit females is supported by very little evidence. The 1945 study by Bateman with fruit flies which is often cited as the first impirical evidence of this showed “ The outcome of Bateman’s six series of matchmaking was the first scientific report of greater male variation in reproductive success. For example, 21 per cent of males failed to produce any off-spring, compared with only 4 per cent of females.” Yet Fine cites recent meta-analyses of Bateman’s own data which showed that the mutant fly lines he used to detect paternity of offspring overcounted fathers and underrepresented maternal mutations, and that his own findings showed greater offspring survival in promiscuous females. “ Proposed gains of female promiscuity include genetic benefits, healthier offspring, and the opportunity to set up sperm competitions that weed out inferior specimens.” Using statistics to explain poor analysis and biased publication of positive results, Fine show that there is just as much evidence that the traditionally “male” mating strategy is effective for females in some environments, and equally the “female” strategy can be effective for males. I particularly enjoyed the numerical analysis of the fecundity of a single man achieving more than 100 one-night-stands a year, still less likely than a monogamous man of fathering a single baby. “ (Indeed, a promiscuous man would need to have sex with more than 130 women just to have 90 per cent odds of outdoing the one baby a monogamous man might expect to father in a year.)” This simplistic view of “mating strategies” is made to seem outdated and juvenile.Fine then attacks the biology underlying these ecological assumptions, the idea that there are hard-wired genetics programmes, boulstered by hormones, which then dictate how a person will live their life. “ To confuse human (cultural) sexuality and (natural) reproduction is classically pseudo-scientific.” She dispels the idea that the most attractive men are wealthy and powerful whereas the most attractive women are merely young, by pooling data from dozens of cultures from urban China “But an analysis of actual matches made through an online dating Web site in China found that likes-attract again provided a much better explanation of the data than did potentials-attract.” to hunter-gatherer societies which demonstrated that humans are more attracted to those that they share traits in common with than there architypes. Fine shows that women underperform in laboratory tasks after being primed that these are “masculine” tasks as a form of social defence, and that ficticious male job applications are actually considered more favourably if the candidate admits to being poor at traditionally “feminine” activities. “ For many decades, researchers supposed that masculinity and femininity are polar ends of a single dimension: someone high in masculinity is therefore necessarily low in femininity, and vice versa.” Even the single traditionally masculine dimension of risk-taking is shown to be an uncorrelated mix of different psychological assessments of different situations (those who gamble are no more likely to take health or ethical risks etc.), and that findings that women are more risk averse also apply to dozens of other populations in society whom also face discrimination. “ Society seemed a significantly safer place to white males than it did to all other groups, including nonwhite men.” It is very difficult to objectively make a case that this T-Rex “hyper male” persona exists within the male population, and is not an extrapolation that blends many historical time periods and cultures into something fictional.“ These very open-ended outcomes would be more easily achieved by a developmental pathway that runs from sex to socialization to the brain (and hormones, as we’ll come to in a later chapter), rather than by an inflexible direct path from sex to brain.”Arguments for the essential, and probable, role of environment in human behaviour over hard-wired genetic determinism is skilfully and logically made. Queer identities are not the main focus of this book but are dealt with using sensitivity and intelligence. “If most of us were intersex in some way or another, the ubiquitous question, “Is it a boy or a girl?” wouldn’t be so compelling. And if the shape of our external genitalia fell on a continuum, with the majority of people in an ambiguous midrange shape, it’s an interesting question whether our sex would play such a key role in how we present ourselves to the world.” I hope to see future writing from her which might expand some of these tantalising hints.Fine’s treatment of the animal literature of sex differences is droll, thorough, and erudite. “ The development of testes from an “androgynous” gonad is an active, gene-directed process, but in the absence of the potent, male SRY gene, ovarian tissue just… happens, as the default?” She reveals amazingly underpublicized results. For example, male rats will care for young if there is no female in the cage to do it for them, showing that they have all the same innate behavioural tools as females. Also, chemically castrated macaques of high social status do not lose their power, aggression, or mating opportunities in the absence of testosterone. In many animals, including fish with whopping testicles, social status trusts blood testosterone levels and scientists are beginning to believe that hormones respond to social heirarchies, rather than a linear system the other way round. ““Social events regulate gonadal events.” Or to put it another way, just in case the significance of this sailed past unnoticed, cichlid testes are a social construction.” Even differences in hypocampal dendrites between the sexes are so condition-specific that it is impossible to even ascribe a “male” or “female” profile. “In other words, brief stress exposure reverses the “sex difference” for that particular brain characteristic.” Is being stressed more truly “male” than being relaxed, and which types of being stressed? Overall, this is a scholarly criticism of the often oversimplified debate surrounding sex/gender associated anatomy and the erroneous leap that this represents thinking. I could not fault the science or the writing. I’m just sad that it’s finished now.“Science writer and behavioural endocrinologist Richard Francis coined the term “Testosterone Rex” to poke fun at the mistaken conception of testosterone as a “super-actor”—the “plenipotent executor of selection’s demands” that simply “takes care of everything.””"
156,0393355489,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5847899-patrick,3,"When I picked this up, I thought this book might be about to try to persuade me that there are no innate differences between men and women beyond those that are self-evident, and that the differences we think might exist are all merely the result of social conditioning. And that is not actually what this book claims - it is, after all  nature and nurture but still...The book demolishes a particular cartoon 'biological essentialist' version of sex differences, and there probably are those who do actually subscribe to such a view (though I doubt any of them would pick this book up) but it did feel like it was skewering a straw man. All of which is fine, but very often, Fine seems to leave the balance to the footnotes. And while I'm in no way expert enough to offer my own informed view, I got the impression that she was sometimes being very deliberately selective in the studies she refers to in order to strengthen her pre-existing point of view ('policy-based evidence making as a long-time colleague put it, albeit in a very different context).For example, she does quite a good job of rubbishing the idea that all men are driven on some level by a desire to obtain a harem, but then I think she pushes the argument too far in trying to imply, without ever quite saying it, that there are no real differences between (the average) men and women's attitudes to casual sex at all. The fact that she cites in support a study by Teela Sanders about the fact that men who visit prostitutes very often go back to the same person over and over, but never stops to look at what I'd regard as the more fundamental question of why almost all prostitution is servicing the desires of male clients is just one example. And it turns out that the stuff she has at the beginning about fruit flies' mating behaviours is also a fairly selective version of the wider evidence on the topic (though I had to google that to find it out).As a whole, the book seemed uneven in that a great deal of space is given to how we are shaped by our social environment, and even how it can shape our very biology, but questions of how biology might shape the social world we construct are not really given much of an airing.All the same, I thought there was a fair amount of interest to found here: For example, the chapter on risk-taking, examining in more detail the cliched idea that men tend to take more risk than women was a quite illuminating exploration of what we actually mean by 'risk taking'. The idea, in particular that the concept had been very narrowly defined by those investigating risk-taking differences between the sexes to look specifically at a particular kind of physical risk and that this could be used to build a narrative that the 2008 (and presumably the 1929) financial crash was caused by the testosterone levels of (mainly male) city traders she shows to be a rather simplistic reading of the evidence. She also does quite a good job of questioning the validity of experiments exploring risk-taking or gambling behaviours in artificial environments where absolutely nothing is truly at stake.So worth a read, but not the comprehensive demolition of the idea that there are biologically determined differences between the average man and the average woman that the author sometimes seems to have set out to write."

Fine attempts to shine her light on common conceptions of gender based on outdated scientific views. While some sections were a little too sciencey (which is, of course, unsurprising!), she generally manages to use clear language to convey her argument. I felt a little more sociology might have supported the overall point even further, since gender is one of the ultimate multidisciplinary fields of this moment.I'd highly recommend this book to anyone who feels their blood boil when someone argues men are simply more likely to cheat, women are more caring because genes and 'boys will be boys'. Get your ammunition for that next conversation ;)"

160,0393355489,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11116317-kevin-orrman-rossiter,5,"Many a modern book on popular science leads with a quest story positioning the people and scientific puzzle contextually - historical and social scene setting for the story of discovery to unfold. Not so Cordelia Fine in her new book Testosterone Rex: unmaking the myths of our gendered minds. Instead Fine leads with a scene of domestic normalcy, a family dinner where a discussion on desexing the new family pet dog moves on to taxidermy and the possibility of making the said canines testicles into a key ring. This almost deadpan start sets the scene for a witty riposte to those who insist on the testosterone myth that we, modern men and women, are fixed in an ancestral past that rewarded competitive males and caring females.Winner of the 2017 Royal Society Science Book Award, Testosterone Rex brings together evolutionary science, psychology, neuroscience and social history to move beyond old ‘nature versus nurture’ debates, and to explain ‘I think you’ll find it’s more complicated than men are from Mars and women are from Venus‘ and therefore why it’s time to unmake the tyrannical myth of Testosterone Rex. The author, Cordelia Fine, is a professor of the history and philosophy of science at the University of Melbourne. Fine’s earlier two books; A mind of its own (2006) and Delusions of gender (2010) were similarly insightful, intellectually pugnacious and drolly written. I remember being annoyed reading A mind of its own, making copious margin notes as I went - for me usually a good sign that a book has a lot to say and is challenging my existing ideas and/or sparking off new ones. Like Jonathan Swift, Fine is a writer who will “vex the world rather than divert it.” A worthy recipient of the Royal Society science book award.Fine tackles many of the classic experiments that have led to our myths around testosterone, maleness and competitiveness. One such example is a chapter long denouement of A. J. Bateman’s 1940s experiments on fruit flies and its later (1960s) elaboration by biologist Robert Trivers, which resulted in the almost universally accepted “Bateman’s principle” that males would do best (pace Darwin) by competing with other males in order to spread their cheap, mass-produced sperm among as many females as possible - while females should protect their precious eggs and be as selective as possible. Fine counters these experiments and the conclusions drawn from them, canvassing a large body of contemporary research that looks not only at the conclusions drawn, sexually reluctant females and promiscuous males, in addition underlining the biases that Bateman introduced, prejudicing his own results. All this is achieved with witty referencing to Maserati-driving boyfriends and the ever popular tails of the male Peacock.Fine then moves on to dismember the arguments that airily tie together sexual selection, evolutionary biology and consumer behaviour such as a Maserati -driving male giving a pair of Bulgari sunglasses as a male flaunting their resources. Fine asserts that for humans sexuality is far more than for reproduction. Reminding us: humans routinely engage in sexual pairings and acts, that not only often don’t - but actually can’t - lead to pregnancy. There are also many human sexual activities, like touching, kissing, and oral sex that likewise have no reproductive potential.The idea that we we have only to peel away the veneer of culture, learning, habit, fantasy and the true (natural) sexual being will emerge is pseudoscience - it is profoundly mistaken.Having demolished the past Rex myths Fine then proceeds to wittily tackle the current testosterone myths. If you were wondering Why can’t a woman be more like a man? or Are males (naturally) more risk-taking? Will I become a monstrous sexual predator if I increase the testosterone in my bloodstream? or If the Lehman brothers were sisters would we have had the recent global financial crisis? then read Testosterone Rex.Fine concludes with a grand challenge. Words are nice but often deeds are better - become less polite and more disruptive. Sexual equality is more than a lovely idea in principle. The science, Fine reveals, of Testosterone Rex does not block the path to a better place - it is our complacency in ‘waiting’ patiently for an evolutionary change to occur. Thinking that men are from Mars and women are from Venus is about our values not science.This review was first posted here: http://dragonlaughing.tumblr.com/post... "

“So what happens when a scientist, under controlled laboratory conditions, simulates a first-wave feminist rodent movement by placing males in cages with pups but no females? Before too long you will see the male “mothering” the infant, in much the same way that females do. Feminism: 1. Sexual selection: nil.”
 Delusions of Gender: How Our Minds, Society, and Neurosexism Create Difference is one of my favorite psychology/science books of all-time: it’s funny, it’s clever, and it’s devastatingly sharp in cutting away the illusionist veil that many people still pretend hangs over the divide between boys and girls.So when its scientific successor,  Testosterone Rex: Myths of Sex, Science, and Society, came out, I knew I had to get my hands on it as soon as possible. And, as expected, it’s as good as the first – though I have to admit I enjoyed it slightly less because I’m not as hardcore into biology and hormones as I am into psychology. But that’s purely a personal preference.In this book, psychologist and researcher  Cordelia Fine takes a good, hard look at the influence of the hormone testosterone on humans and gender – effectively separating its presumed influence, and its scientific and biological influence. Just as in her previous book, she picks apart both research and popular or common opinion, giving us readers a critical overview of what testosterone does do and what it doesn’t. (Or what we might simply assume it to do rather than what it actually does.)I’ve heard people accuse Fine of cherry picking scientific data and not being able to explain away certain discrepancies in gender – such as higher statistics for men in terms of crime and rape – with her explanations and expositions of the workings of testosterone.I respectfully disagree. What Fine shows us with this book is that causal relations cannot just be applied to any and all things without evidence, or without critically examining just what such a causal relation might imply. An example of this would be, “If men are statistically more likely to commit a crime than women, then it must be due to testosterone, because that marks the main/biggest biological difference between men and women!”.I can see how someone could arrive at such a conclusion, but: in human nature, combining both psychology and biology, it’s almost impossible to subscribe an effect to one single variable (in this case, subscribing higher crime rates in men to testosterone). Especially with hormones, the interaction of a hormone with its host and that host’s direct environment can have a huge effect on the workings of said hormone.Not to mention that a variable might play a much smaller role than initially expected.Fine dives into both of these lines of thoughts (complex interaction versus actual role) into this book, which leads to a bunch of very interesting reinterpretations of existing research. She steps outside of the simple paradigm that says, “X makes Y happen” and looks at what exactly constitutes X, what influences both X and Y, and is it actually true that X makes Y happen?It’s a solid, well-researched book that doesn’t shy away from using field jargon (so be warned if you’re not fully at home in psychology/biology research) and forces its readers to look at common assumptions in a different way. Even as a fellow psychologist, it taught me a lot, and gave me plenty of insights to ponder upon.It’s also funny and wittily written, which makes it a more pleasant read throughout the drier research material. (Though doubtlessly some will find Fine’s references to feminism and jokes about sexism offensive.)"
162,0393355489,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3611893-dearbhla,5,"I read Fine's Delusions of Gender a few years ago and really enjoyed it, so when I saw she had another one coming out I knew I had to order it. It is just as good as Delusions, and I would recommend it to anyone to read.

In this book Fine takes a look at testosterone and asks is it really the reason behind financial crisis, risk taking, and the differences between the sexes. the short answer is no. The slightly longer, but still short version is that it has an important role to play but it is equally as important as all other hormones in the human body. For more go read the book, it is fascinating, interesting, funny and very readable. Fine has a great style. She weaves personal anecdotes in with scientific studies as well as her own speculation. She counters arguments with facts and figures, but never in a dry and boring way.It is also a most quotable book, if you follow me on tumblr you may have noticed, if not click here for a selection and if that doesn't prompt you to think about trying this book I don't know what will.One of my very favourite lines is Social events regulate gonadal events. I think it should be my new motto.But apart from the writing style what she says in the book is important. She never says that there aren't differences between men and women, but she emphasizes that we cannot accurately tell what is causing those differences. From the moment we are born we are influenced by both genes and environment, and sometimes environment has a greater influence. Never mind the fact that when you average everything out there are more differences between men (or women) than between the sexes. Also, sex is a spectrum, not an either or. Stereotypes and hardline ""men are like this"" views do nobody any good.People are people, and people are different to people in many many ways. And society and experience do a lot to shape people. If you think about the idea behind ""privilege"" for example you can see that influences how people of differing backgrounds see and act. It isn't what you were born with, it is how society around you that shapes what you were born with.I've skimmed a few of the negative reviews on Goodreads and many of them seem to say ""I don't agree with this so it is wrong"" and some say that Fine wants to proclaim that there are no differences between men and women. Well, I've read the book and she makes it perfectly clear that there are differences, both in humans and in other species, what she is looking at is how innate those differences are and can they be altered? Also across the whole species are the differences really there. And in some cases she argues that, yes, they are. In others no, the variables even out across a large sample. Fine also points to numerous studies that show that just because X has been the way for so long, it doesn't mean it can't ever be altered.Of course I came to the book on her side, so maybe I'm just agreeing with her because it supports my view of the world. I'm not a scientist and am not about to go through hundreds of studies in an attempt to prove myself wrong. However I have skimmed through some of those ""men are from mars"" type books, you know the sort that try to argue that all relationship differences exist because men are like this while women are like that, and in most cases I don't identify with the version of womanhood that they portray. So maybe I'm just an outlier, or maybe there is more to being a person than what is between your legs."

Read my GR friend Trevor's review, it says it all:https://www.goodreads.com/review/show...Just to add, it is interesting what this book says about one of the acrimonious debates in feminism - which I'll crassly summarise as smash the patriarchy vs lean in. Lean In: Women, Work, and the Will to Lead being Sheryl Sandberg's book which encourages women to work within the system but to much more aggressively put themselves forward and refuse to be ignored/underpaid/touched up etc. Fine doesn't mention the book but she does suggest the Lean In approach, as well as not only ignoring and leaving intact the structural barriers that exclude women, may also simply not work. She quotes one study which found that both female and male graduates of high-powered MBA courses were equally forthright in negotiating the pay package when they landed their first job. But guess what? Women's demands were met less often than men's. Because Fine's book is about hormones, her point is that it's not hormones that make men more aggressive in negotiating etc. It could just be, that after being knocked back again and again, maybe you just give up? The cost/benefit analysis is going to be different.I'm not going to downgrade my star rating because of the chirpy and not funny ""this is a science book but don't worry it's accessible"" stuff, which I imagine is a feature of a lot of popular science writing (I haven't read much, I'm just guessing).

Speculation is always allowed and even fruitful but there needs to be a clear delineation between fact and what has been surmised from that (this was starkly clear in the chapter regarding hormones and I was disappointed to find that the author spent an inordinate amount of time on testosterone and none on estrogen). I also felt that the book suffered from uneven handling of the many animal studies; sometimes they were used to show that humans are different and we can't use the results from those studies to compare to humans.....and then when the results of the studies aligned with an idea that the author liked then suddenly the results of those studies were extrapolated to humans as well. This hearkens back to the old saying - ""when you're a hammer everything looks like a nail""."

172,0393355489,http://goodreads.com/user/show/30924713-kramer-thompson,3,"I am very new to the science behind gender/sex differences and similarities, and I found Testosterone Rex quite interesting. Fine discusses quite a variety of ways that the sexes are purportedly distinct, and argues that under scrutiny we discover that they are actually not so different. Many of the studies she cites to back these views up are very interesting, and she presents most of the topics in a very accessible way.That said, at times it seemed like she might have been arguing against a strawman. For example, at the beginning of one chapter Fine notes one quote by David Schmitt, who states that male humans have the ability to lend their sperm in the conception of 100 offspring within a single month by mating with many (100) different women. She then spends a large section of that chapter demonstrating how implausible this is. But what's really important is not whether male humans could produce 100 offspring a month, but merely whether they could consistently produce a significantly higher amount of offspring by acting polygynously than could female humans. This would suggest that male polygyny could be adaptive and thus that the tendency for men to act polygynously could be an adaptation. Of course it is implausible that men could produce 100 offspring in a month. But could they produce 1 a month? 2? 5? Fine does state afterwards that the males of some tribes whose behaviour probably resembles that of humans over much of our evolutionary history are expected to produce a maximum of 12-16 children, and women of those tribes 9-12. This suggests that a strategy of male polygyny would not be significantly more adaptive than monogamy, so there probably would not be an adaptation for male polygyny. I would have much preferred detailed examination of Fine's latter claim regarding the maximum offspring able to be produced by men in tribes that purportedly resemble humans throughout much of our evolutionary history. It seems to me that such discussion would be more relevant to serious debates about the adaptiveness of male polygyny. However, I get the impression that there are people who take serious, hardline approaches that are very similar to the ones Fine argues against in Testosterone Rex. Perhaps these people do believe that male humans can really produce 100 offspring a month, or at least some similarly absurdly high number. If that's the case, then I see the merit of Fine's discussion of the unlikelihood of men fathering 100 children a month. Of course, this is just one section among a larger book, and much of the book was not similarly frustrating. To summarise: much of the book was interesting; some parts seemed to be arguing against strawmen, but; it may be that these arguments are actually not strawmen (depending on the views of Fine's dialectical partners). In order to determine whether Fine successfully and absolutely defeats all aspects of the Testosterone Rex belief system I will have to read more about the differences (or lack thereof) between the sexes. Thanks to Cordelia Fine's interesting explication of and argumentation regarding these topics, I plan on undertaking such further education."
173,0393355489,http://goodreads.com/user/show/117566-mauri,3,"I forgot how funny Fine is - she writes in a tightly controlled, ""isn't it amusing how..."" sort of manner that both makes you laugh and realize that she is quite ticked off (and you should be too).In this, Fine tackles research about gender and sex, with a focus on knocking back a lot of the ""boys will be boys"" beliefs society holds dear.For example: male promiscuity. A man can impregnate hundreds of women in the time it takes a woman to gestate and bear one child, which she is usually bound to for years while that same man skips merrily from town to town. Therefore it makes sense that men want sex all the time and women don't. It's reproductively advantageous, duh.Fine merrily pokes holes in all of this. First, what women? Setting aside the number of women within a day's walk of the average caveman, Neolithic farmer, or 1800s city dweller, even in today's jet-setting world how many women are lining up to have sex with an endless line-up of horny men? Not just sex, but baby-making sex? And how many of those women are actually fertile at a given point of time? And while everyone can think of a story they heard about someone getting pregnant off a one night stand, I bet many more can think of couples taking months to conceive. Turns out this reproductive strategy may have only worked out for Genghis Khan and a few other despotic men throughout history, and, Fine points out, maybe that says more about despots than it does about men? In short, a lot of looking at scientific studies done on sex and gender that point out that there maybe? Might have? been a bit of bias going on. Less tightly constructed than Delusions of Gender: How Our Minds, Society, and Neurosexism Create Difference, Fine does meander a bit, but accessible to people whose eyes crossed a bit trying to read Women's Work, Men's Property: The Origins of Gender and Class. (Mine.)"
174,0393355489,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1348540-charlie,3,"Cordelia Fine sets up a well-known stalking horse in the shape of Testosterone Rex the king of hormones with a view to pulling him down and showing him to be a meaningless construct. She uses scientific studies as part of the technique for pulling him down, but also an appeal to ‘our values’. The Testosterone Rex construct which she pulls apart is the idea that boys will be boys, that the presence of testosterone makes men into naturally promiscuous hunters, risk takers and show-offs while the lack of it makes women into careful carers and nurturers. Fine needs to state her T Rex construct at the start of the book in order for the reader to know what she will be arguing against, however, I did not find that she made it clear until afterwards that this was not actually her view of the world. As a result, I nearly put the book down and left it before she was really ready to start. I found a lot of the science interesting, but I was somewhat sad that there was not more evidence for a wider range of elements to the story. The science seemed to be very strongly focussed around the risk-taking area. I guess this is the easiest part of the story to test and verify, but I would personally have liked a bit more stress on other areas too.The book states on the cover that it is a science book prize winner. It does not say it is also a feminist book. I am happy to read either or both kinds of book, but I picked this one up expecting something more dispassionate. The Author is however very passionate, she has a very definite agenda. She makes a good case for it with the evidence she uses, but as a scientist, that passion means that I have to wonder if the evidence she uses is cherry picked to make a point or not. I find that doubt tarnishes some apparently very good, interesting science for me. I would have preferred the science and the passion in two separate books."
175,0393355489,http://goodreads.com/user/show/17594936-colin,4,"I always find it hard to evaluate books like this. There are so many studies into human nature, human behaviour, sex differences, and for me, they raise more questions than they answer. How was that test administered? Were the men and women in the test into risk appetite all the same age? How was the question phrased? I invariably find myself doubting the scientific method, and then in the absence of reliable data points, measuring the writer's interpretation against my own experience. But of course that just means I'm layering my own bias on top of the writer's bias, which in turn is overlaid on the experimenter's experimental design. The result is a superficially plausible narrative, which I know will be contradicted by the next book I read on the same topic.Cordelia Fine does a good job of trying to combat the kinds of folk narrative explanations that thrive in all this confusion. She starts off with one of the hoariest of all - the idea that men have evolved to be unfaithful while women have evolved to be monogamous nest builders. This is one of the best known examples of sociobiology being drafted in to support a conclusion you know the researcher had in mind from the start and wanted to ""prove"". Fine's iconoclasm in taking aim at it seems admirable. She also takes care to present her evidence carefully, showing balanced results and not just trying to claim all the evidence points to one inevitable conclusion. This in marked contrast to - for example - Jordan Peterson who is forever pointing at stuff that happens in nature and implying that we just have to accept that the status quo is here to stay and resistance is futile. Give me a Cordelia Fine over a Jordan Peterson any day of the week. And she won't even tell me to tidy my room. I didn't find my hackles raising at any point, and although she editorialises strenuously on the meaning of the results, she's not trying to press the science into service or (as far as I can tell) manipulate the facts. Fair enough.The general gist is that there are differences between the sexes in some ways but that there was so much social conditioning overlaid on top of that that most of what we think of as immutable human nature can be stripped back if we, as a society, choose to do so. I think I'd put myself a little further towards the Stephen Pinker end of the spectrum but again, that's just me, maybe overlaying what I see around me, how I think and how women I know seem to think, how our daughter developed in what we thought was a fairly stereotype-free household... So it's a hit and miss, subjective interpretation of the facts but can any of us bring any better expertise to bear to judge between the competing claims of the people who have looked inside our brains and reckon they know what they've found there? Probably not."
176,0393355489,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2860188-eduardo-santiago,3,"So much research these days claims to find testosterone-this or hardwired-gender-difference-that. Risk-taking, competitiveness, ability, even childhood toy preference. Cordelia Fine somewhat exasperatedly follows up with crucial context—“the rest of the story,” if you will: yes, but this study didn’t consider corticoid levels; yes, but that other study neglected such-and-such findings; and most crucially yes, but it’s staggeringly difficult to isolate this effect from social and cultural factors. Nevertheless, she persiidentifies clever ways in which these issues have been studied, and the gist is: context matters. A lot.Science requires reproducibility. Reproducible results are best obtained when there are a small number of variables—hard to achieve with something as richly messy as a human life. Once one compensates for the factors overlooked in much research, plus publication bias, plus just plain built-in human bias, few effects survive scrutiny. Yes, we’re different—deliciously so, in my view!—but not in any way that affects ability. Not even in the slightest bit.Fine writes with a sardonic bite that worked well to start with but grew tiresome. I was also highly disappointed in her somewhat off-context quoting of Robert Sapolsky—a hero of mine—and her failure to acknowledge his groundbreaking work decades ago in breaking down testosterone myths. And, dear FSM, what has happened to proofreading? Much as I want to grant four stars, much as I think this is important work that needs to be read, I can only justify three. (Goodreads, could we have fractional stars please?)On a side note, I find myself fortunate to have read this just before and just after the 2018 Women’s March where I was surrounded by thousands of strong, powerful, capable human beings of all genders and colors, many of whom are living under the culturally-imposed “oh, you just aren’t able to do these sorts of things.” All of whom categorically reject that, as does Fine and as do I and, I trust, you. #resist.And on another side note: if you’re interested in these sorts of gender issues, I urge you to listen to this episode of the Hidden Brain podcast in which two progressive parents attempt to raise their children free of gender stereotypes and much loveliness ensues."

This book, cleverly written, does an outstanding job of decimating stereotypical beliefs that boys are boys and girls are girls because of innate, fixed differences. I used to think men were more prone to risk taking than women. It turns out that this isn’t true, for a few reasons! For example:1) risk taking studies have methodological flaws. For example, these studies typically focus on activities that are considered to be male-expertise. Different results are found if you consider female-expertise activities. Would you consider baking a very difficult soufflé for a dinner party? 2) risk taking studies ACTUALLY find that the most high-status people are most likely to take risks. In matrilineal society is women. In western society it is WHITE men followed by women and minorities. Etc.3) the actual risk to women of “risky” events proposed in these studies is MUCH HIGHER than the actual risk to men. Consider: would you go to the bus station at 11 PM for a chance to pick up $100? For whom is that obviously more risky- a 5’10” man or a 5’2” woman? Obviously women need the cash reward to be higher because they are literally facing MORE RISK. Change the situation so men are facing more risk, and the answers change.The book gives a careful data based treatment to many stereotypical beliefs, overturning widely held views about the impact of biological sex and sex hormones on the brain.

178,0393355489,http://goodreads.com/user/show/28668057-jasmine,3,"Cordelia Fine's Delusions of Gender was one of my favorite reads of the year, and so I was excited to pick up this sequel-in-spirit.It started out strong, combining Fine's delightful dry wit with a thorough review/critique of seminal works in the ""male/testestosterone = high risk/high reward = spray & pray mating strategy"" field. She then continued with a review of the many different ways male and female creatures compete for reproductive success. Although while I found this part interesting, I ultimately found tidbits like the two opposite mating strategies of the horned dung beetle to be less useful in my day-to-day experience of the world than the aspects of gender and science described in Delusions of Gender. The final portion I found to be a bit more unfocused. I found myself a little uncertain about what Fine or anyone else in the field takes home from experiments on risk versus reward between men and women. In this portion of the book particularly, she often repeated parts of Delusions of Gender - which left me feeling that perhaps this whole book could have been an extra set of chapters in the earlier volume rather than a stand-alone book.Still, I overall enjoyed the book, and would probably still read another book written by Fine - but I would recommend Delusions of Gender and not this one, as a starting point."
179,0393355489,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4239658-karen-chung,3,"This book was a fairly interesting, quick read, but I ended up convinced that testosterone is still the main source of male-female differences. The book made a lot of good points about how environment and social conditions can adjust the concentration of testosterone in an individual, and how circumstances can bring out ""atypical"" behavior relative to the usual gender stereotypes, such as gentle, nurturing behavior in males. But as I see it, testosterone is still at the core of and key to competitiveness, aggression, and ambition in humans (and probably other animals as well). Women have some too, just not as much, and I believe there is still a strong correlation between testosterone level and ambition and related traits in women. I highly recommend listening to this podcast in conjunction with this book:This American Life: Testosteronehttps://www.thisamericanlife.org/220/...Transcript:https://www.thisamericanlife.org/220/...It left a deep impression on me, and also adds a lot to what you will read in this book should you decide to give it a try."
180,0393355489,http://goodreads.com/user/show/16080726-sabin,2,"I'm in two minds about Cordelia Fine's achievements in this book. On the one hand, she crafts a very good and thorough argument for gender equality, attacking every conceivable statement which tries to make the existing gaps seem inevitable. Her arguments are filled with data taken from scientific studies and meta-analyses of the scientific literature. She explains that even some of the science is biased and concludes, many times over, that all the large gaps between the genders stem from cultural biases, which have constantly been reinforced throughout history. And based on the evidence she presents, I can do nothing else but wholeheartedly agree with her conclusions of culturally enforce artificial gender differences.On the other hand, the book is utterly repetitive. She states her conclusions from the start of the book, her arguments develop only slightly - repeating her conclusions over and over again, usually taking a popular counter-argument and battering it to a pulp and by pouring on it study after study which finds even a smidgen of evidence to support her claim. She tries to justify this aggressive crusade against gender-inequality by exaggerating the opposition. I scanned Joe Haldeman's book, Testosterone, for those glaring omissions she attributes to it – keeping testosterone only in the realm of male achievements. He does not omit to include the effects of testosterone in women and does mention the fuzziness of the results. I agree with her, though, that his tone is somewhat dismissive of the role testosterone plays in women's bodies and brains, but it's hard to distinguish between her presentation of real data and her consistently one-sided interpretation.She speaks of deeds, not words, to use in the fight for gender equality. But I'm afraid she misinterprets her mantra and uses words as a flurry of punches which hit everything and everyone who happens to be near her intended targets."

Fine is a skill-full, witty, insightful, and above all scientifically ruthless writer. Her greatest appeal is that she brings sharp objectivity to such an emotionally-charged discussion, and helps defend feminist and queer ideals with logic, fact, and perspective. One of the best books released this year, full of new information for me even though I read the psychology and neuroscience literature regularly. A heroic book.Fine begins with an elegant challenge to Darwin’s theory of sexual selection. This echoes the broad themes of Evolution’s Rainbow, but it des not appear in the references and the arguments are refined with greater precision and clarity. Sexual selection theory, which states that the low-investment sperm production in males mandates a competitive, aggressive, promiscuous mating strategy which cannot benefit females is supported by very little evidence. The 1945 study by Bateman with fruit flies which is often cited as the first impirical evidence of this showed “ The outcome of Bateman’s six series of matchmaking was the first scientific report of greater male variation in reproductive success. For example, 21 per cent of males failed to produce any off-spring, compared with only 4 per cent of females.” Yet Fine cites recent meta-analyses of Bateman’s own data which showed that the mutant fly lines he used to detect paternity of offspring overcounted fathers and underrepresented maternal mutations, and that his own findings showed greater offspring survival in promiscuous females. “ Proposed gains of female promiscuity include genetic benefits, healthier offspring, and the opportunity to set up sperm competitions that weed out inferior specimens.” Using statistics to explain poor analysis and biased publication of positive results, Fine show that there is just as much evidence that the traditionally “male” mating strategy is effective for females in some environments, and equally the “female” strategy can be effective for males. I particularly enjoyed the numerical analysis of the fecundity of a single man achieving more than 100 one-night-stands a year, still less likely than a monogamous man of fathering a single baby. “ (Indeed, a promiscuous man would need to have sex with more than 130 women just to have 90 per cent odds of outdoing the one baby a monogamous man might expect to father in a year.)” This simplistic view of “mating strategies” is made to seem outdated and juvenile.Fine then attacks the biology underlying these ecological assumptions, the idea that there are hard-wired genetics programmes, boulstered by hormones, which then dictate how a person will live their life. “ To confuse human (cultural) sexuality and (natural) reproduction is classically pseudo-scientific.” She dispels the idea that the most attractive men are wealthy and powerful whereas the most attractive women are merely young, by pooling data from dozens of cultures from urban China “But an analysis of actual matches made through an online dating Web site in China found that likes-attract again provided a much better explanation of the data than did potentials-attract.” to hunter-gatherer societies which demonstrated that humans are more attracted to those that they share traits in common with than there architypes. Fine shows that women underperform in laboratory tasks after being primed that these are “masculine” tasks as a form of social defence, and that ficticious male job applications are actually considered more favourably if the candidate admits to being poor at traditionally “feminine” activities. “ For many decades, researchers supposed that masculinity and femininity are polar ends of a single dimension: someone high in masculinity is therefore necessarily low in femininity, and vice versa.” Even the single traditionally masculine dimension of risk-taking is shown to be an uncorrelated mix of different psychological assessments of different situations (those who gamble are no more likely to take health or ethical risks etc.), and that findings that women are more risk averse also apply to dozens of other populations in society whom also face discrimination. “ Society seemed a significantly safer place to white males than it did to all other groups, including nonwhite men.” It is very difficult to objectively make a case that this T-Rex “hyper male” persona exists within the male population, and is not an extrapolation that blends many historical time periods and cultures into something fictional.“ These very open-ended outcomes would be more easily achieved by a developmental pathway that runs from sex to socialization to the brain (and hormones, as we’ll come to in a later chapter), rather than by an inflexible direct path from sex to brain.”Arguments for the essential, and probable, role of environment in human behaviour over hard-wired genetic determinism is skilfully and logically made. Queer identities are not the main focus of this book but are dealt with using sensitivity and intelligence. “If most of us were intersex in some way or another, the ubiquitous question, “Is it a boy or a girl?” wouldn’t be so compelling. And if the shape of our external genitalia fell on a continuum, with the majority of people in an ambiguous midrange shape, it’s an interesting question whether our sex would play such a key role in how we present ourselves to the world.” I hope to see future writing from her which might expand some of these tantalising hints.Fine’s treatment of the animal literature of sex differences is droll, thorough, and erudite. “ The development of testes from an “androgynous” gonad is an active, gene-directed process, but in the absence of the potent, male SRY gene, ovarian tissue just… happens, as the default?” She reveals amazingly underpublicized results. For example, male rats will care for young if there is no female in the cage to do it for them, showing that they have all the same innate behavioural tools as females. Also, chemically castrated macaques of high social status do not lose their power, aggression, or mating opportunities in the absence of testosterone. In many animals, including fish with whopping testicles, social status trusts blood testosterone levels and scientists are beginning to believe that hormones respond to social heirarchies, rather than a linear system the other way round. ““Social events regulate gonadal events.” Or to put it another way, just in case the significance of this sailed past unnoticed, cichlid testes are a social construction.” Even differences in hypocampal dendrites between the sexes are so condition-specific that it is impossible to even ascribe a “male” or “female” profile. “In other words, brief stress exposure reverses the “sex difference” for that particular brain characteristic.” Is being stressed more truly “male” than being relaxed, and which types of being stressed? Overall, this is a scholarly criticism of the often oversimplified debate surrounding sex/gender associated anatomy and the erroneous leap that this represents thinking. I could not fault the science or the writing. I’m just sad that it’s finished now.“Science writer and behavioural endocrinologist Richard Francis coined the term “Testosterone Rex” to poke fun at the mistaken conception of testosterone as a “super-actor”—the “plenipotent executor of selection’s demands” that simply “takes care of everything.””"
186,0393355489,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5847899-patrick,3,"When I picked this up, I thought this book might be about to try to persuade me that there are no innate differences between men and women beyond those that are self-evident, and that the differences we think might exist are all merely the result of social conditioning. And that is not actually what this book claims - it is, after all  nature and nurture but still...The book demolishes a particular cartoon 'biological essentialist' version of sex differences, and there probably are those who do actually subscribe to such a view (though I doubt any of them would pick this book up) but it did feel like it was skewering a straw man. All of which is fine, but very often, Fine seems to leave the balance to the footnotes. And while I'm in no way expert enough to offer my own informed view, I got the impression that she was sometimes being very deliberately selective in the studies she refers to in order to strengthen her pre-existing point of view ('policy-based evidence making as a long-time colleague put it, albeit in a very different context).For example, she does quite a good job of rubbishing the idea that all men are driven on some level by a desire to obtain a harem, but then I think she pushes the argument too far in trying to imply, without ever quite saying it, that there are no real differences between (the average) men and women's attitudes to casual sex at all. The fact that she cites in support a study by Teela Sanders about the fact that men who visit prostitutes very often go back to the same person over and over, but never stops to look at what I'd regard as the more fundamental question of why almost all prostitution is servicing the desires of male clients is just one example. And it turns out that the stuff she has at the beginning about fruit flies' mating behaviours is also a fairly selective version of the wider evidence on the topic (though I had to google that to find it out).As a whole, the book seemed uneven in that a great deal of space is given to how we are shaped by our social environment, and even how it can shape our very biology, but questions of how biology might shape the social world we construct are not really given much of an airing.All the same, I thought there was a fair amount of interest to found here: For example, the chapter on risk-taking, examining in more detail the cliched idea that men tend to take more risk than women was a quite illuminating exploration of what we actually mean by 'risk taking'. The idea, in particular that the concept had been very narrowly defined by those investigating risk-taking differences between the sexes to look specifically at a particular kind of physical risk and that this could be used to build a narrative that the 2008 (and presumably the 1929) financial crash was caused by the testosterone levels of (mainly male) city traders she shows to be a rather simplistic reading of the evidence. She also does quite a good job of questioning the validity of experiments exploring risk-taking or gambling behaviours in artificial environments where absolutely nothing is truly at stake.So worth a read, but not the comprehensive demolition of the idea that there are biologically determined differences between the average man and the average woman that the author sometimes seems to have set out to write."
187,0393355489,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5275457-mirte,4,"Extremely interesting book! I was drawn in by the title, which in my opinion is quite brilliantly thought up. Fine attempts to shine her light on common conceptions of gender based on outdated scientific views. While some sections were a little too sciencey (which is, of course, unsurprising!), she generally manages to use clear language to convey her argument. I felt a little more sociology might have supported the overall point even further, since gender is one of the ultimate multidisciplinary fields of this moment.I'd highly recommend this book to anyone who feels their blood boil when someone argues men are simply more likely to cheat, women are more caring because genes and 'boys will be boys'.

Not so Cordelia Fine in her new book Testosterone Rex: unmaking the myths of our gendered minds. Instead Fine leads with a scene of domestic normalcy, a family dinner where a discussion on desexing the new family pet dog moves on to taxidermy and the possibility of making the said canines testicles into a key ring. This almost deadpan start sets the scene for a witty riposte to those who insist on the testosterone myth that we, modern men and women, are fixed in an ancestral past that rewarded competitive males and caring females.Winner of the 2017 Royal Society Science Book Award, Testosterone Rex brings together evolutionary science, psychology, neuroscience and social history to move beyond old ‘nature versus nurture’ debates, and to explain ‘I think you’ll find it’s more complicated than men are from Mars and women are from Venus‘ and therefore why it’s time to unmake the tyrannical myth of Testosterone Rex. The author, Cordelia Fine, is a professor of the history and philosophy of science at the University of Melbourne. Fine’s earlier two books; A mind of its own (2006) and Delusions of gender (2010) were similarly insightful, intellectually pugnacious and drolly written. I remember being annoyed reading A mind of its own, making copious margin notes as I went - for me usually a good sign that a book has a lot to say and is challenging my existing ideas and/or sparking off new ones. Like Jonathan Swift, Fine is a writer who will “vex the world rather than divert it.” A worthy recipient of the Royal Society science book award.Fine tackles many of the classic experiments that have led to our myths around testosterone, maleness and competitiveness. One such example is a chapter long denouement of A. J. Bateman’s 1940s experiments on fruit flies and its later (1960s) elaboration by biologist Robert Trivers, which resulted in the almost universally accepted “Bateman’s principle” that males would do best (pace Darwin) by competing with other males in order to spread their cheap, mass-produced sperm among as many females as possible - while females should protect their precious eggs and be as selective as possible. Fine counters these experiments and the conclusions drawn from them, canvassing a large body of contemporary research that looks not only at the conclusions drawn, sexually reluctant females and promiscuous males, in addition underlining the biases that Bateman introduced, prejudicing his own results. All this is achieved with witty referencing to Maserati-driving boyfriends and the ever popular tails of the male Peacock.Fine then moves on to dismember the arguments that airily tie together sexual selection, evolutionary biology and consumer behaviour such as a Maserati -driving male giving a pair of Bulgari sunglasses as a male flaunting their resources. Fine asserts that for humans sexuality is far more than for reproduction. Reminding us: humans routinely engage in sexual pairings and acts, that not only often don’t - but actually can’t - lead to pregnancy. There are also many human sexual activities, like touching, kissing, and oral sex that likewise have no reproductive potential.The idea that we we have only to peel away the veneer of culture, learning, habit, fantasy and the true (natural) sexual being will emerge is pseudoscience - it is profoundly mistaken.Having demolished the past Rex myths Fine then proceeds to wittily tackle the current testosterone myths. If you were wondering Why can’t a woman be more like a man? or Are males (naturally) more risk-taking? Will I become a monstrous sexual predator if I increase the testosterone in my bloodstream? or If the Lehman brothers were sisters would we have had the recent global financial crisis? then read Testosterone Rex.Fine concludes with a grand challenge. Words are nice but often deeds are better - become less polite and more disruptive. Sexual equality is more than a lovely idea in principle. The science, Fine reveals, of Testosterone Rex does not block the path to a better place - it is our complacency in ‘waiting’ patiently for an evolutionary change to occur. Thinking that men are from Mars and women are from Venus is about our values not science.This review was first posted here: http://dragonlaughing.tumblr.com/post... "

“So what happens when a scientist, under controlled laboratory conditions, simulates a first-wave feminist rodent movement by placing males in cages with pups but no females? Before too long you will see the male “mothering” the infant, in much the same way that females do. Feminism: 1. Sexual selection: nil.”
 Delusions of Gender: How Our Minds, Society, and Neurosexism Create Difference is one of my favorite psychology/science books of all-time: it’s funny, it’s clever, and it’s devastatingly sharp in cutting away the illusionist veil that many people still pretend hangs over the divide between boys and girls.So when its scientific successor,  Testosterone Rex: Myths of Sex, Science, and Society, came out, I knew I had to get my hands on it as soon as possible. And, as expected, it’s as good as the first – though I have to admit I enjoyed it slightly less because I’m not as hardcore into biology and hormones as I am into psychology. But that’s purely a personal preference.In this book, psychologist and researcher  Cordelia Fine takes a good, hard look at the influence of the hormone testosterone on humans and gender – effectively separating its presumed influence, and its scientific and biological influence. Just as in her previous book, she picks apart both research and popular or common opinion, giving us readers a critical overview of what testosterone does do and what it doesn’t. (Or what we might simply assume it to do rather than what it actually does.)I’ve heard people accuse Fine of cherry picking scientific data and not being able to explain away certain discrepancies in gender – such as higher statistics for men in terms of crime and rape – with her explanations and expositions of the workings of testosterone.I respectfully disagree. What Fine shows us with this book is that causal relations cannot just be applied to any and all things without evidence, or without critically examining just what such a causal relation might imply. An example of this would be, “If men are statistically more likely to commit a crime than women, then it must be due to testosterone, because that marks the main/biggest biological difference between men and women!”.I can see how someone could arrive at such a conclusion, but: in human nature, combining both psychology and biology, it’s almost impossible to subscribe an effect to one single variable (in this case, subscribing higher crime rates in men to testosterone). Especially with hormones, the interaction of a hormone with its host and that host’s direct environment can have a huge effect on the workings of said hormone.Not to mention that a variable might play a much smaller role than initially expected.Fine dives into both of these lines of thoughts (complex interaction versus actual role) into this book, which leads to a bunch of very interesting reinterpretations of existing research. She steps outside of the simple paradigm that says, “X makes Y happen” and looks at what exactly constitutes X, what influences both X and Y, and is it actually true that X makes Y happen?It’s a solid, well-researched book that doesn’t shy away from using field jargon (so be warned if you’re not fully at home in psychology/biology research) and forces its readers to look at common assumptions in a different way. Even as a fellow psychologist, it taught me a lot, and gave me plenty of insights to ponder upon.It’s also funny and wittily written, which makes it a more pleasant read throughout the drier research material. (Though doubtlessly some will find Fine’s references to feminism and jokes about sexism offensive.)"
192,0393355489,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3611893-dearbhla,5,"I read Fine's Delusions of Gender a few years ago and really enjoyed it, so when I saw she had another one coming out I knew I had to order it. It is just as good as Delusions, and I would recommend it to anyone to read.

In this book Fine takes a look at testosterone and asks is it really the reason behind financial crisis, risk taking, and the differences between the sexes. the short answer is no. The slightly longer, but still short version is that it has an important role to play but it is equally as important as all other hormones in the human body. For more go read the book, it is fascinating, interesting, funny and very readable. Fine has a great style. She weaves personal anecdotes in with scientific studies as well as her own speculation. She counters arguments with facts and figures, but never in a dry and boring way.It is also a most quotable book, if you follow me on tumblr you may have noticed, if not click here for a selection and if that doesn't prompt you to think about trying this book I don't know what will.One of my very favourite lines is Social events regulate gonadal events. I think it should be my new motto.But apart from the writing style what she says in the book is important. She never says that there aren't differences between men and women, but she emphasizes that we cannot accurately tell what is causing those differences. From the moment we are born we are influenced by both genes and environment, and sometimes environment has a greater influence. Never mind the fact that when you average everything out there are more differences between men (or women) than between the sexes. Also, sex is a spectrum, not an either or. Stereotypes and hardline ""men are like this"" views do nobody any good.People are people, and people are different to people in many many ways. And society and experience do a lot to shape people. If you think about the idea behind ""privilege"" for example you can see that influences how people of differing backgrounds see and act. It isn't what you were born with, it is how society around you that shapes what you were born with.I've skimmed a few of the negative reviews on Goodreads and many of them seem to say ""I don't agree with this so it is wrong"" and some say that Fine wants to proclaim that there are no differences between men and women. Well, I've read the book and she makes it perfectly clear that there are differences, both in humans and in other species, what she is looking at is how innate those differences are and can they be altered? Also across the whole species are the differences really there. And in some cases she argues that, yes, they are. In others no, the variables even out across a large sample. Fine also points to numerous studies that show that just because X has been the way for so long, it doesn't mean it can't ever be altered.Of course I came to the book on her side, so maybe I'm just agreeing with her because it supports my view of the world. I'm not a scientist and am not about to go through hundreds of studies in an attempt to prove myself wrong. However I have skimmed through some of those ""men are from mars"" type books, you know the sort that try to argue that all relationship differences exist because men are like this while women are like that, and in most cases I don't identify with the version of womanhood that they portray. So maybe I'm just an outlier, or maybe there is more to being a person than what is between your legs."

Read my GR friend Trevor's review, it says it all:https://www.goodreads.com/review/show...Just to add, it is interesting what this book says about one of the acrimonious debates in feminism - which I'll crassly summarise as smash the patriarchy vs lean in. Lean In: Women, Work, and the Will to Lead being Sheryl Sandberg's book which encourages women to work within the system but to much more aggressively put themselves forward and refuse to be ignored/underpaid/touched up etc. Fine doesn't mention the book but she does suggest the Lean In approach, as well as not only ignoring and leaving intact the structural barriers that exclude women, may also simply not work. She quotes one study which found that both female and male graduates of high-powered MBA courses were equally forthright in negotiating the pay package when they landed their first job. But guess what? Women's demands were met less often than men's. Because Fine's book is about hormones, her point is that it's not hormones that make men more aggressive in negotiating etc. It could just be, that after being knocked back again and again, maybe you just give up? The cost/benefit analysis is going to be different.I'm not going to downgrade my star rating because of the chirpy and not funny ""this is a science book but don't worry it's accessible"" stuff, which I imagine is a feature of a lot of popular science writing (I haven't read much, I'm just guessing). "
196,0393355489,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7089145-alisha,3,"3.5 stars.....more to come later but this was a mix of some really great science and a little bit of reaching too far to make conclusions that the author holds near and dear. Speculation is always allowed and even fruitful but there needs to be a clear delineation between fact and what has been surmised from that (this was starkly clear in the chapter regarding hormones and I was disappointed to find that the author spent an inordinate amount of time on testosterone and none on estrogen). I also felt that the book suffered from uneven handling of the many animal studies; sometimes they were used to show that humans are different and we can't use the results from those studies to compare to humans.....and then when the results of the studies aligned with an idea that the author liked then suddenly the results of those studies were extrapolated to humans as well. This hearkens back to the old saying - ""when you're a hammer everything looks like a nail""."
197,0393355489,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1058994-ryan-mishap,5,"Combined with her previous book--Delusions of Gender--this is crucial reading that shows how little difference there is between these so-called immutable genders our society has created. This book shatters the testosterone excuse for how men behave and explores the real evolutionary story in light of our cultures, traditions, and power relations.All around brilliant: as science writing, it is straight-forward, well argued, and hilarious. She also boldly claims to be a feminist writing a feminist science book--no doubt this will land her many detractors who will focus on her supposed bias instead of on the research she illuminates.Go, read this now."
198,0393355489,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1045774-mehrsa,4,"Interesting research about gender differences. Testosterone is not as determinative as previously thought. I think the debunking of the myth is useful and asking questions and doing more research on gender is important, but I wasn't sure she made quite the case that she tried to make about the lack of meaningful differences. I want to read more by her though to see if her other books are more thorough. "
199,0393355489,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6262367-abby,2,"Not nearly as interesting as her first book (Delusions of Gender). I felt like she was just making the same point (humans are complicated and not ruled by gender-specific hormones) for 300 pages. There's some encouraging support for monogamy, and some of the studies are very interesting, but I got bored quickly, and I usually lap this kind of thing up. "
200,0393355489,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2748628-sara,3,Great premise and well researched but I felt like it could have been an article not a book. She did not make the background science interesting for me.

202,0393355489,http://goodreads.com/user/show/30924713-kramer-thompson,3,"I am very new to the science behind gender/sex differences and similarities, and I found Testosterone Rex quite interesting. Fine discusses quite a variety of ways that the sexes are purportedly distinct, and argues that under scrutiny we discover that they are actually not so different. Many of the studies she cites to back these views up are very interesting, and she presents most of the topics in a very accessible way.That said, at times it seemed like she might have been arguing against a strawman. For example, at the beginning of one chapter Fine notes one quote by David Schmitt, who states that male humans have the ability to lend their sperm in the conception of 100 offspring within a single month by mating with many (100) different women. She then spends a large section of that chapter demonstrating how implausible this is. But what's really important is not whether male humans could produce 100 offspring a month, but merely whether they could consistently produce a significantly higher amount of offspring by acting polygynously than could female humans. This would suggest that male polygyny could be adaptive and thus that the tendency for men to act polygynously could be an adaptation. Of course it is implausible that men could produce 100 offspring in a month. But could they produce 1 a month? 2? 5? Fine does state afterwards that the males of some tribes whose behaviour probably resembles that of humans over much of our evolutionary history are expected to produce a maximum of 12-16 children, and women of those tribes 9-12. This suggests that a strategy of male polygyny would not be significantly more adaptive than monogamy, so there probably would not be an adaptation for male polygyny. I would have much preferred detailed examination of Fine's latter claim regarding the maximum offspring able to be produced by men in tribes that purportedly resemble humans throughout much of our evolutionary history. It seems to me that such discussion would be more relevant to serious debates about the adaptiveness of male polygyny. However, I get the impression that there are people who take serious, hardline approaches that are very similar to the ones Fine argues against in Testosterone Rex. Perhaps these people do believe that male humans can really produce 100 offspring a month, or at least some similarly absurdly high number. If that's the case, then I see the merit of Fine's discussion of the unlikelihood of men fathering 100 children a month. Of course, this is just one section among a larger book, and much of the book was not similarly frustrating. To summarise: much of the book was interesting; some parts seemed to be arguing against strawmen, but; it may be that these arguments are actually not strawmen (depending on the views of Fine's dialectical partners). In order to determine whether Fine successfully and absolutely defeats all aspects of the Testosterone Rex belief system I will have to read more about the differences (or lack thereof) between the sexes. Thanks to Cordelia Fine's interesting explication of and argumentation regarding these topics, I plan on undertaking such further education."
203,0393355489,http://goodreads.com/user/show/117566-mauri,3,"I forgot how funny Fine is - she writes in a tightly controlled, ""isn't it amusing how..."" sort of manner that both makes you laugh and realize that she is quite ticked off (and you should be too).In this, Fine tackles research about gender and sex, with a focus on knocking back a lot of the ""boys will be boys"" beliefs society holds dear.For example: male promiscuity. A man can impregnate hundreds of women in the time it takes a woman to gestate and bear one child, which she is usually bound to for years while that same man skips merrily from town to town. Therefore it makes sense that men want sex all the time and women don't. It's reproductively advantageous, duh.Fine merrily pokes holes in all of this. First, what women? Setting aside the number of women within a day's walk of the average caveman, Neolithic farmer, or 1800s city dweller, even in today's jet-setting world how many women are lining up to have sex with an endless line-up of horny men? Not just sex, but baby-making sex? And how many of those women are actually fertile at a given point of time? And while everyone can think of a story they heard about someone getting pregnant off a one night stand, I bet many more can think of couples taking months to conceive. Turns out this reproductive strategy may have only worked out for Genghis Khan and a few other despotic men throughout history, and, Fine points out, maybe that says more about despots than it does about men? In short, a lot of looking at scientific studies done on sex and gender that point out that there maybe? Might have? been a bit of bias going on. Less tightly constructed than Delusions of Gender: How Our Minds, Society, and Neurosexism Create Difference, Fine does meander a bit, but accessible to people whose eyes crossed a bit trying to read Women's Work, Men's Property: The Origins of Gender and Class. (Mine.)"
204,0393355489,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1348540-charlie,3,"Cordelia Fine sets up a well-known stalking horse in the shape of Testosterone Rex the king of hormones with a view to pulling him down and showing him to be a meaningless construct. She uses scientific studies as part of the technique for pulling him down, but also an appeal to ‘our values’. The Testosterone Rex construct which she pulls apart is the idea that boys will be boys, that the presence of testosterone makes men into naturally promiscuous hunters, risk takers and show-offs while the lack of it makes women into careful carers and nurturers. Fine needs to state her T Rex construct at the start of the book in order for the reader to know what she will be arguing against, however, I did not find that she made it clear until afterwards that this was not actually her view of the world. As a result, I nearly put the book down and left it before she was really ready to start. I found a lot of the science interesting, but I was somewhat sad that there was not more evidence for a wider range of elements to the story. The science seemed to be very strongly focussed around the risk-taking area. I guess this is the easiest part of the story to test and verify, but I would personally have liked a bit more stress on other areas too.The book states on the cover that it is a science book prize winner. It does not say it is also a feminist book. I am happy to read either or both kinds of book, but I picked this one up expecting something more dispassionate. The Author is however very passionate, she has a very definite agenda. She makes a good case for it with the evidence she uses, but as a scientist, that passion means that I have to wonder if the evidence she uses is cherry picked to make a point or not. I find that doubt tarnishes some apparently very good, interesting science for me. I would have preferred the science and the passion in two separate books."
205,0393355489,http://goodreads.com/user/show/17594936-colin,4,"I always find it hard to evaluate books like this. There are so many studies into human nature, human behaviour, sex differences, and for me, they raise more questions than they answer. How was that test administered? Were the men and women in the test into risk appetite all the same age? How was the question phrased? I invariably find myself doubting the scientific method, and then in the absence of reliable data points, measuring the writer's interpretation against my own experience. But of course that just means I'm layering my own bias on top of the writer's bias, which in turn is overlaid on the experimenter's experimental design. The result is a superficially plausible narrative, which I know will be contradicted by the next book I read on the same topic.Cordelia Fine does a good job of trying to combat the kinds of folk narrative explanations that thrive in all this confusion. She starts off with one of the hoariest of all - the idea that men have evolved to be unfaithful while women have evolved to be monogamous nest builders. This is one of the best known examples of sociobiology being drafted in to support a conclusion you know the researcher had in mind from the start and wanted to ""prove"". Fine's iconoclasm in taking aim at it seems admirable. She also takes care to present her evidence carefully, showing balanced results and not just trying to claim all the evidence points to one inevitable conclusion. This in marked contrast to - for example - Jordan Peterson who is forever pointing at stuff that happens in nature and implying that we just have to accept that the status quo is here to stay and resistance is futile. Give me a Cordelia Fine over a Jordan Peterson any day of the week. And she won't even tell me to tidy my room. I didn't find my hackles raising at any point, and although she editorialises strenuously on the meaning of the results, she's not trying to press the science into service or (as far as I can tell) manipulate the facts. Fair enough.The general gist is that there are differences between the sexes in some ways but that there was so much social conditioning overlaid on top of that that most of what we think of as immutable human nature can be stripped back if we, as a society, choose to do so. I think I'd put myself a little further towards the Stephen Pinker end of the spectrum but again, that's just me, maybe overlaying what I see around me, how I think and how women I know seem to think, how our daughter developed in what we thought was a fairly stereotype-free household... So it's a hit and miss, subjective interpretation of the facts but can any of us bring any better expertise to bear to judge between the competing claims of the people who have looked inside our brains and reckon they know what they've found there? Probably not."
206,0393355489,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2860188-eduardo-santiago,3,"So much research these days claims to find testosterone-this or hardwired-gender-difference-that. Risk-taking, competitiveness, ability, even childhood toy preference. Cordelia Fine somewhat exasperatedly follows up with crucial context—“the rest of the story,” if you will: yes, but this study didn’t consider corticoid levels; yes, but that other study neglected such-and-such findings; and most crucially yes, but it’s staggeringly difficult to isolate this effect from social and cultural factors. Nevertheless, she persiidentifies clever ways in which these issues have been studied, and the gist is: context matters. A lot.Science requires reproducibility. Reproducible results are best obtained when there are a small number of variables—hard to achieve with something as richly messy as a human life. Once one compensates for the factors overlooked in much research, plus publication bias, plus just plain built-in human bias, few effects survive scrutiny. Yes, we’re different—deliciously so, in my view!—but not in any way that affects ability. Not even in the slightest bit.Fine writes with a sardonic bite that worked well to start with but grew tiresome. I was also highly disappointed in her somewhat off-context quoting of Robert Sapolsky—a hero of mine—and her failure to acknowledge his groundbreaking work decades ago in breaking down testosterone myths. And, dear FSM, what has happened to proofreading? Much as I want to grant four stars, much as I think this is important work that needs to be read, I can only justify three. (Goodreads, could we have fractional stars please?)On a side note, I find myself fortunate to have read this just before and just after the 2018 Women’s March where I was surrounded by thousands of strong, powerful, capable human beings of all genders and colors, many of whom are living under the culturally-imposed “oh, you just aren’t able to do these sorts of things.” All of whom categorically reject that, as does Fine and as do I and, I trust, you. #resist.And on another side note: if you’re interested in these sorts of gender issues, I urge you to listen to this episode of the Hidden Brain podcast in which two progressive parents attempt to raise their children free of gender stereotypes and much loveliness ensues."
207,0393355489,http://goodreads.com/user/show/62793003-cody-mccoy,5,"Testosterone is not what you think it is. This book, cleverly written, does an outstanding job of decimating stereotypical beliefs that boys are boys and girls are girls because of innate, fixed differences. I used to think men were more prone to risk taking than women. It turns out that this isn’t true, for a few reasons! For example:1) risk taking studies have methodological flaws. For example, these studies typically focus on activities that are considered to be male-expertise. Different results are found if you consider female-expertise activities. Would you consider baking a very difficult soufflé for a dinner party? 2) risk taking studies ACTUALLY find that the most high-status people are most likely to take risks. In matrilineal society is women. In western society it is WHITE men followed by women and minorities. Etc.3) the actual risk to women of “risky” events proposed in these studies is MUCH HIGHER than the actual risk to men. Consider: would you go to the bus station at 11 PM for a chance to pick up $100? For whom is that obviously more risky- a 5’10” man or a 5’2” woman? Obviously women need the cash reward to be higher because they are literally facing MORE RISK. Change the situation so men are facing more risk, and the answers change.The book gives a careful data based treatment to many stereotypical beliefs, overturning widely held views about the impact of biological sex and sex hormones on the brain.

208,0393355489,http://goodreads.com/user/show/28668057-jasmine,3,"Cordelia Fine's Delusions of Gender was one of my favorite reads of the year, and so I was excited to pick up this sequel-in-spirit.It started out strong, combining Fine's delightful dry wit with a thorough review/critique of seminal works in the ""male/testestosterone = high risk/high reward = spray & pray mating strategy"" field. She then continued with a review of the many different ways male and female creatures compete for reproductive success. Although while I found this part interesting, I ultimately found tidbits like the two opposite mating strategies of the horned dung beetle to be less useful in my day-to-day experience of the world than the aspects of gender and science described in Delusions of Gender. The final portion I found to be a bit more unfocused. I found myself a little uncertain about what Fine or anyone else in the field takes home from experiments on risk versus reward between men and women. In this portion of the book particularly, she often repeated parts of Delusions of Gender - which left me feeling that perhaps this whole book could have been an extra set of chapters in the earlier volume rather than a stand-alone book.Still, I overall enjoyed the book, and would probably still read another book written by Fine - but I would recommend Delusions of Gender and not this one, as a starting point."
209,0393355489,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4239658-karen-chung,3,"This book was a fairly interesting, quick read, but I ended up convinced that testosterone is still the main source of male-female differences. The book made a lot of good points about how environment and social conditions can adjust the concentration of testosterone in an individual, and how circumstances can bring out ""atypical"" behavior relative to the usual gender stereotypes, such as gentle, nurturing behavior in males. But as I see it, testosterone is still at the core of and key to competitiveness, aggression, and ambition in humans (and probably other animals as well). Women have some too, just not as much, and I believe there is still a strong correlation between testosterone level and ambition and related traits in women. I highly recommend listening to this podcast in conjunction with this book:This American Life: Testosteronehttps://www.thisamericanlife.org/220/...Transcript:https://www.thisamericanlife.org/220/...It left a deep impression on me, and also adds a lot to what you will read in this book should you decide to give it a try."
210,0393355489,http://goodreads.com/user/show/16080726-sabin,2,"I'm in two minds about Cordelia Fine's achievements in this book. On the one hand, she crafts a very good and thorough argument for gender equality, attacking every conceivable statement which tries to make the existing gaps seem inevitable. Her arguments are filled with data taken from scientific studies and meta-analyses of the scientific literature. She explains that even some of the science is biased and concludes, many times over, that all the large gaps between the genders stem from cultural biases, which have constantly been reinforced throughout history. And based on the evidence she presents, I can do nothing else but wholeheartedly agree with her conclusions of culturally enforce artificial gender differences.On the other hand, the book is utterly repetitive. She states her conclusions from the start of the book, her arguments develop only slightly - repeating her conclusions over and over again, usually taking a popular counter-argument and battering it to a pulp and by pouring on it study after study which finds even a smidgen of evidence to support her claim. She tries to justify this aggressive crusade against gender-inequality by exaggerating the opposition. I scanned Joe Haldeman's book, Testosterone, for those glaring omissions she attributes to it – keeping testosterone only in the realm of male achievements. He does not omit to include the effects of testosterone in women and does mention the fuzziness of the results. I agree with her, though, that his tone is somewhat dismissive of the role testosterone plays in women's bodies and brains, but it's hard to distinguish between her presentation of real data and her consistently one-sided interpretation.She speaks of deeds, not words, to use in the fight for gender equality. But I'm afraid she misinterprets her mantra and uses words as a flurry of punches which hit everything and everyone who happens to be near her intended targets."

(and GNC is going to make America macho again). If you're tired of having gender essentialism used to explain why men can never be nurses (testosterone precludes empathy and caregiving!), or why women will never be interested enough in business to be CEOs (maybe we should make calculators pink!), this is a popular science repackaging of the actual scientific articles which demonstrate that hormones often follow behavior, that social and cultural structures are often far more to blame for the way men and women behave (women are also interested in casual sex, when the deck isn't stacked to get them killed of socially shunned) and that taking GNC Testosto-Boost is not going to fix personal insecurities."

Fine is a skill-full, witty, insightful, and above all scientifically ruthless writer. Her greatest appeal is that she brings sharp objectivity to such an emotionally-charged discussion, and helps defend feminist and queer ideals with logic, fact, and perspective. One of the best books released this year, full of new information for me even though I read the psychology and neuroscience literature regularly. A heroic book.Fine begins with an elegant challenge to Darwin’s theory of sexual selection. This echoes the broad themes of Evolution’s Rainbow, but it des not appear in the references and the arguments are refined with greater precision and clarity. Sexual selection theory, which states that the low-investment sperm production in males mandates a competitive, aggressive, promiscuous mating strategy which cannot benefit females is supported by very little evidence. The 1945 study by Bateman with fruit flies which is often cited as the first impirical evidence of this showed “ The outcome of Bateman’s six series of matchmaking was the first scientific report of greater male variation in reproductive success. For example, 21 per cent of males failed to produce any off-spring, compared with only 4 per cent of females.” Yet Fine cites recent meta-analyses of Bateman’s own data which showed that the mutant fly lines he used to detect paternity of offspring overcounted fathers and underrepresented maternal mutations, and that his own findings showed greater offspring survival in promiscuous females. “ Proposed gains of female promiscuity include genetic benefits, healthier offspring, and the opportunity to set up sperm competitions that weed out inferior specimens.” Using statistics to explain poor analysis and biased publication of positive results, Fine show that there is just as much evidence that the traditionally “male” mating strategy is effective for females in some environments, and equally the “female” strategy can be effective for males. I particularly enjoyed the numerical analysis of the fecundity of a single man achieving more than 100 one-night-stands a year, still less likely than a monogamous man of fathering a single baby. “ (Indeed, a promiscuous man would need to have sex with more than 130 women just to have 90 per cent odds of outdoing the one baby a monogamous man might expect to father in a year.)” This simplistic view of “mating strategies” is made to seem outdated and juvenile.Fine then attacks the biology underlying these ecological assumptions, the idea that there are hard-wired genetics programmes, boulstered by hormones, which then dictate how a person will live their life. “ To confuse human (cultural) sexuality and (natural) reproduction is classically pseudo-scientific.” She dispels the idea that the most attractive men are wealthy and powerful whereas the most attractive women are merely young, by pooling data from dozens of cultures from urban China “But an analysis of actual matches made through an online dating Web site in China found that likes-attract again provided a much better explanation of the data than did potentials-attract.” to hunter-gatherer societies which demonstrated that humans are more attracted to those that they share traits in common with than there architypes. Fine shows that women underperform in laboratory tasks after being primed that these are “masculine” tasks as a form of social defence, and that ficticious male job applications are actually considered more favourably if the candidate admits to being poor at traditionally “feminine” activities. “ For many decades, researchers supposed that masculinity and femininity are polar ends of a single dimension: someone high in masculinity is therefore necessarily low in femininity, and vice versa.” Even the single traditionally masculine dimension of risk-taking is shown to be an uncorrelated mix of different psychological assessments of different situations (those who gamble are no more likely to take health or ethical risks etc.), and that findings that women are more risk averse also apply to dozens of other populations in society whom also face discrimination. “ Society seemed a significantly safer place to white males than it did to all other groups, including nonwhite men.” It is very difficult to objectively make a case that this T-Rex “hyper male” persona exists within the male population, and is not an extrapolation that blends many historical time periods and cultures into something fictional.“ These very open-ended outcomes would be more easily achieved by a developmental pathway that runs from sex to socialization to the brain (and hormones, as we’ll come to in a later chapter), rather than by an inflexible direct path from sex to brain.”Arguments for the essential, and probable, role of environment in human behaviour over hard-wired genetic determinism is skilfully and logically made. Queer identities are not the main focus of this book but are dealt with using sensitivity and intelligence. “If most of us were intersex in some way or another, the ubiquitous question, “Is it a boy or a girl?” wouldn’t be so compelling. And if the shape of our external genitalia fell on a continuum, with the majority of people in an ambiguous midrange shape, it’s an interesting question whether our sex would play such a key role in how we present ourselves to the world.” I hope to see future writing from her which might expand some of these tantalising hints.Fine’s treatment of the animal literature of sex differences is droll, thorough, and erudite. “ The development of testes from an “androgynous” gonad is an active, gene-directed process, but in the absence of the potent, male SRY gene, ovarian tissue just… happens, as the default?” She reveals amazingly underpublicized results. For example, male rats will care for young if there is no female in the cage to do it for them, showing that they have all the same innate behavioural tools as females. Also, chemically castrated macaques of high social status do not lose their power, aggression, or mating opportunities in the absence of testosterone. In many animals, including fish with whopping testicles, social status trusts blood testosterone levels and scientists are beginning to believe that hormones respond to social heirarchies, rather than a linear system the other way round. ““Social events regulate gonadal events.” Or to put it another way, just in case the significance of this sailed past unnoticed, cichlid testes are a social construction.” Even differences in hypocampal dendrites between the sexes are so condition-specific that it is impossible to even ascribe a “male” or “female” profile. “In other words, brief stress exposure reverses the “sex difference” for that particular brain characteristic.” Is being stressed more truly “male” than being relaxed, and which types of being stressed? Overall, this is a scholarly criticism of the often oversimplified debate surrounding sex/gender associated anatomy and the erroneous leap that this represents thinking. I could not fault the science or the writing. I’m just sad that it’s finished now.“Science writer and behavioural endocrinologist Richard Francis coined the term “Testosterone Rex” to poke fun at the mistaken conception of testosterone as a “super-actor”—the “plenipotent executor of selection’s demands” that simply “takes care of everything.””"
216,0393355489,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5847899-patrick,3,"When I picked this up, I thought this book might be about to try to persuade me that there are no innate differences between men and women beyond those that are self-evident, and that the differences we think might exist are all merely the result of social conditioning. And that is not actually what this book claims - it is, after all  nature and nurture but still...The book demolishes a particular cartoon 'biological essentialist' version of sex differences, and there probably are those who do actually subscribe to such a view (though I doubt any of them would pick this book up) but it did feel like it was skewering a straw man. All of which is fine, but very often, Fine seems to leave the balance to the footnotes. And while I'm in no way expert enough to offer my own informed view, I got the impression that she was sometimes being very deliberately selective in the studies she refers to in order to strengthen her pre-existing point of view ('policy-based evidence making as a long-time colleague put it, albeit in a very different context).For example, she does quite a good job of rubbishing the idea that all men are driven on some level by a desire to obtain a harem, but then I think she pushes the argument too far in trying to imply, without ever quite saying it, that there are no real differences between (the average) men and women's attitudes to casual sex at all. The fact that she cites in support a study by Teela Sanders about the fact that men who visit prostitutes very often go back to the same person over and over, but never stops to look at what I'd regard as the more fundamental question of why almost all prostitution is servicing the desires of male clients is just one example. And it turns out that the stuff she has at the beginning about fruit flies' mating behaviours is also a fairly selective version of the wider evidence on the topic (though I had to google that to find it out).As a whole, the book seemed uneven in that a great deal of space is given to how we are shaped by our social environment, and even how it can shape our very biology, but questions of how biology might shape the social world we construct are not really given much of an airing.All the same, I thought there was a fair amount of interest to found here: For example, the chapter on risk-taking, examining in more detail the cliched idea that men tend to take more risk than women was a quite illuminating exploration of what we actually mean by 'risk taking'. The idea, in particular that the concept had been very narrowly defined by those investigating risk-taking differences between the sexes to look specifically at a particular kind of physical risk and that this could be used to build a narrative that the 2008 (and presumably the 1929) financial crash was caused by the testosterone levels of (mainly male) city traders she shows to be a rather simplistic reading of the evidence. She also does quite a good job of questioning the validity of experiments exploring risk-taking or gambling behaviours in artificial environments where absolutely nothing is truly at stake.So worth a read, but not the comprehensive demolition of the idea that there are biologically determined differences between the average man and the average woman that the author sometimes seems to have set out to write."

Fine attempts to shine her light on common conceptions of gender based on outdated scientific views. While some sections were a little too sciencey (which is, of course, unsurprising!), she generally manages to use clear language to convey her argument. I felt a little more sociology might have supported the overall point even further, since gender is one of the ultimate multidisciplinary fields of this moment.I'd highly recommend this book to anyone who feels their blood boil when someone argues men are simply more likely to cheat, women are more caring because genes and 'boys will be boys'. Get your ammunition for that next conversation ;)"

Not so Cordelia Fine in her new book Testosterone Rex: unmaking the myths of our gendered minds. Instead Fine leads with a scene of domestic normalcy, a family dinner where a discussion on desexing the new family pet dog moves on to taxidermy and the possibility of making the said canines testicles into a key ring. This almost deadpan start sets the scene for a witty riposte to those who insist on the testosterone myth that we, modern men and women, are fixed in an ancestral past that rewarded competitive males and caring females.Winner of the 2017 Royal Society Science Book Award, Testosterone Rex brings together evolutionary science, psychology, neuroscience and social history to move beyond old ‘nature versus nurture’ debates, and to explain ‘I think you’ll find it’s more complicated than men are from Mars and women are from Venus‘ and therefore why it’s time to unmake the tyrannical myth of Testosterone Rex. The author, Cordelia Fine, is a professor of the history and philosophy of science at the University of Melbourne. Fine’s earlier two books; A mind of its own (2006) and Delusions of gender (2010) were similarly insightful, intellectually pugnacious and drolly written. I remember being annoyed reading A mind of its own, making copious margin notes as I went - for me usually a good sign that a book has a lot to say and is challenging my existing ideas and/or sparking off new ones. Like Jonathan Swift, Fine is a writer who will “vex the world rather than divert it.” A worthy recipient of the Royal Society science book award.Fine tackles many of the classic experiments that have led to our myths around testosterone, maleness and competitiveness. One such example is a chapter long denouement of A. J. Bateman’s 1940s experiments on fruit flies and its later (1960s) elaboration by biologist Robert Trivers, which resulted in the almost universally accepted “Bateman’s principle” that males would do best (pace Darwin) by competing with other males in order to spread their cheap, mass-produced sperm among as many females as possible - while females should protect their precious eggs and be as selective as possible. Fine counters these experiments and the conclusions drawn from them, canvassing a large body of contemporary research that looks not only at the conclusions drawn, sexually reluctant females and promiscuous males, in addition underlining the biases that Bateman introduced, prejudicing his own results. All this is achieved with witty referencing to Maserati-driving boyfriends and the ever popular tails of the male Peacock.Fine then moves on to dismember the arguments that airily tie together sexual selection, evolutionary biology and consumer behaviour such as a Maserati -driving male giving a pair of Bulgari sunglasses as a male flaunting their resources. Fine asserts that for humans sexuality is far more than for reproduction. Reminding us: humans routinely engage in sexual pairings and acts, that not only often don’t - but actually can’t - lead to pregnancy. There are also many human sexual activities, like touching, kissing, and oral sex that likewise have no reproductive potential.The idea that we we have only to peel away the veneer of culture, learning, habit, fantasy and the true (natural) sexual being will emerge is pseudoscience - it is profoundly mistaken.Having demolished the past Rex myths Fine then proceeds to wittily tackle the current testosterone myths. If you were wondering Why can’t a woman be more like a man? or Are males (naturally) more risk-taking? Will I become a monstrous sexual predator if I increase the testosterone in my bloodstream? or If the Lehman brothers were sisters would we have had the recent global financial crisis? then read Testosterone Rex.Fine concludes with a grand challenge. Words are nice but often deeds are better - become less polite and more disruptive. Sexual equality is more than a lovely idea in principle. The science, Fine reveals, of Testosterone Rex does not block the path to a better place - it is our complacency in ‘waiting’ patiently for an evolutionary change to occur. Thinking that men are from Mars and women are from Venus is about our values not science.This review was first posted here: http://dragonlaughing.tumblr.com/post... "

“So what happens when a scientist, under controlled laboratory conditions, simulates a first-wave feminist rodent movement by placing males in cages with pups but no females? Before too long you will see the male “mothering” the infant, in much the same way that females do. Feminism: 1. Sexual selection: nil.”
 Delusions of Gender: How Our Minds, Society, and Neurosexism Create Difference is one of my favorite psychology/science books of all-time: it’s funny, it’s clever, and it’s devastatingly sharp in cutting away the illusionist veil that many people still pretend hangs over the divide between boys and girls.So when its scientific successor,  Testosterone Rex: Myths of Sex, Science, and Society, came out, I knew I had to get my hands on it as soon as possible. And, as expected, it’s as good as the first – though I have to admit I enjoyed it slightly less because I’m not as hardcore into biology and hormones as I am into psychology. But that’s purely a personal preference.In this book, psychologist and researcher  Cordelia Fine takes a good, hard look at the influence of the hormone testosterone on humans and gender – effectively separating its presumed influence, and its scientific and biological influence. Just as in her previous book, she picks apart both research and popular or common opinion, giving us readers a critical overview of what testosterone does do and what it doesn’t. (Or what we might simply assume it to do rather than what it actually does.)I’ve heard people accuse Fine of cherry picking scientific data and not being able to explain away certain discrepancies in gender – such as higher statistics for men in terms of crime and rape – with her explanations and expositions of the workings of testosterone.I respectfully disagree. What Fine shows us with this book is that causal relations cannot just be applied to any and all things without evidence, or without critically examining just what such a causal relation might imply. An example of this would be, “If men are statistically more likely to commit a crime than women, then it must be due to testosterone, because that marks the main/biggest biological difference between men and women!”.I can see how someone could arrive at such a conclusion, but: in human nature, combining both psychology and biology, it’s almost impossible to subscribe an effect to one single variable (in this case, subscribing higher crime rates in men to testosterone). Especially with hormones, the interaction of a hormone with its host and that host’s direct environment can have a huge effect on the workings of said hormone.Not to mention that a variable might play a much smaller role than initially expected.Fine dives into both of these lines of thoughts (complex interaction versus actual role) into this book, which leads to a bunch of very interesting reinterpretations of existing research. She steps outside of the simple paradigm that says, “X makes Y happen” and looks at what exactly constitutes X, what influences both X and Y, and is it actually true that X makes Y happen?It’s a solid, well-researched book that doesn’t shy away from using field jargon (so be warned if you’re not fully at home in psychology/biology research) and forces its readers to look at common assumptions in a different way. Even as a fellow psychologist, it taught me a lot, and gave me plenty of insights to ponder upon.It’s also funny and wittily written, which makes it a more pleasant read throughout the drier research material. (Though doubtlessly some will find Fine’s references to feminism and jokes about sexism offensive.)"
222,0393355489,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3611893-dearbhla,5,"I read Fine's Delusions of Gender a few years ago and really enjoyed it, so when I saw she had another one coming out I knew I had to order it. It is just as good as Delusions, and I would recommend it to anyone to read.

In this book Fine takes a look at testosterone and asks is it really the reason behind financial crisis, risk taking, and the differences between the sexes. the short answer is no. The slightly longer, but still short version is that it has an important role to play but it is equally as important as all other hormones in the human body. For more go read the book, it is fascinating, interesting, funny and very readable. Fine has a great style. She weaves personal anecdotes in with scientific studies as well as her own speculation. She counters arguments with facts and figures, but never in a dry and boring way.It is also a most quotable book, if you follow me on tumblr you may have noticed, if not click here for a selection and if that doesn't prompt you to think about trying this book I don't know what will.One of my very favourite lines is Social events regulate gonadal events. I think it should be my new motto.But apart from the writing style what she says in the book is important. She never says that there aren't differences between men and women, but she emphasizes that we cannot accurately tell what is causing those differences. From the moment we are born we are influenced by both genes and environment, and sometimes environment has a greater influence. Never mind the fact that when you average everything out there are more differences between men (or women) than between the sexes. Also, sex is a spectrum, not an either or. Stereotypes and hardline ""men are like this"" views do nobody any good.People are people, and people are different to people in many many ways. And society and experience do a lot to shape people. If you think about the idea behind ""privilege"" for example you can see that influences how people of differing backgrounds see and act. It isn't what you were born with, it is how society around you that shapes what you were born with.I've skimmed a few of the negative reviews on Goodreads and many of them seem to say ""I don't agree with this so it is wrong"" and some say that Fine wants to proclaim that there are no differences between men and women. Well, I've read the book and she makes it perfectly clear that there are differences, both in humans and in other species, what she is looking at is how innate those differences are and can they be altered? Also across the whole species are the differences really there. And in some cases she argues that, yes, they are. In others no, the variables even out across a large sample. Fine also points to numerous studies that show that just because X has been the way for so long, it doesn't mean it can't ever be altered.Of course I came to the book on her side, so maybe I'm just agreeing with her because it supports my view of the world. I'm not a scientist and am not about to go through hundreds of studies in an attempt to prove myself wrong. However I have skimmed through some of those ""men are from mars"" type books, you know the sort that try to argue that all relationship differences exist because men are like this while women are like that, and in most cases I don't identify with the version of womanhood that they portray. So maybe I'm just an outlier, or maybe there is more to being a person than what is between your legs."

225,0393355489,http://goodreads.com/user/show/47667703-chris-chapman,5,"This is an awesome, exhaustively researched book, and yes it is readable. Read my GR friend Trevor's review, it says it all:https://www.goodreads.com/review/show...Just to add, it is interesting what this book says about one of the acrimonious debates in feminism - which I'll crassly summarise as smash the patriarchy vs lean in. Lean In: Women, Work, and the Will to Lead being Sheryl Sandberg's book which encourages women to work within the system but to much more aggressively put themselves forward and refuse to be ignored/underpaid/touched up etc. Fine doesn't mention the book but she does suggest the Lean In approach, as well as not only ignoring and leaving intact the structural barriers that exclude women, may also simply not work. She quotes one study which found that both female and male graduates of high-powered MBA courses were equally forthright in negotiating the pay package when they landed their first job. But guess what? Women's demands were met less often than men's. Because Fine's book is about hormones, her point is that it's not hormones that make men more aggressive in negotiating etc. It could just be, that after being knocked back again and again, maybe you just give up? The cost/benefit analysis is going to be different.I'm not going to downgrade my star rating because of the chirpy and not funny ""this is a science book but don't worry it's accessible"" stuff, which I imagine is a feature of a lot of popular science writing (I haven't read much, I'm just guessing).

Speculation is always allowed and even fruitful but there needs to be a clear delineation between fact and what has been surmised from that (this was starkly clear in the chapter regarding hormones and I was disappointed to find that the author spent an inordinate amount of time on testosterone and none on estrogen). I also felt that the book suffered from uneven handling of the many animal studies; sometimes they were used to show that humans are different and we can't use the results from those studies to compare to humans.....and then when the results of the studies aligned with an idea that the author liked then suddenly the results of those studies were extrapolated to humans as well. This hearkens back to the old saying - ""when you're a hammer everything looks like a nail""."

Fine discusses quite a variety of ways that the sexes are purportedly distinct, and argues that under scrutiny we discover that they are actually not so different. Many of the studies she cites to back these views up are very interesting, and she presents most of the topics in a very accessible way.That said, at times it seemed like she might have been arguing against a strawman. For example, at the beginning of one chapter Fine notes one quote by David Schmitt, who states that male humans have the ability to lend their sperm in the conception of 100 offspring within a single month by mating with many (100) different women. She then spends a large section of that chapter demonstrating how implausible this is. But what's really important is not whether male humans could produce 100 offspring a month, but merely whether they could consistently produce a significantly higher amount of offspring by acting polygynously than could female humans. This would suggest that male polygyny could be adaptive and thus that the tendency for men to act polygynously could be an adaptation. Of course it is implausible that men could produce 100 offspring in a month. But could they produce 1 a month? 2? 5? Fine does state afterwards that the males of some tribes whose behaviour probably resembles that of humans over much of our evolutionary history are expected to produce a maximum of 12-16 children, and women of those tribes 9-12. This suggests that a strategy of male polygyny would not be significantly more adaptive than monogamy, so there probably would not be an adaptation for male polygyny. I would have much preferred detailed examination of Fine's latter claim regarding the maximum offspring able to be produced by men in tribes that purportedly resemble humans throughout much of our evolutionary history. It seems to me that such discussion would be more relevant to serious debates about the adaptiveness of male polygyny. However, I get the impression that there are people who take serious, hardline approaches that are very similar to the ones Fine argues against in Testosterone Rex. Perhaps these people do believe that male humans can really produce 100 offspring a month, or at least some similarly absurdly high number. If that's the case, then I see the merit of Fine's discussion of the unlikelihood of men fathering 100 children a month. Of course, this is just one section among a larger book, and much of the book was not similarly frustrating. To summarise: much of the book was interesting; some parts seemed to be arguing against strawmen, but; it may be that these arguments are actually not strawmen (depending on the views of Fine's dialectical partners). In order to determine whether Fine successfully and absolutely defeats all aspects of the Testosterone Rex belief system I will have to read more about the differences (or lack thereof) between the sexes. Thanks to Cordelia Fine's interesting explication of and argumentation regarding these topics, I plan on undertaking such further education."
233,0393355489,http://goodreads.com/user/show/117566-mauri,3,"I forgot how funny Fine is - she writes in a tightly controlled, ""isn't it amusing how..."" sort of manner that both makes you laugh and realize that she is quite ticked off (and you should be too).In this, Fine tackles research about gender and sex, with a focus on knocking back a lot of the ""boys will be boys"" beliefs society holds dear.For example: male promiscuity. A man can impregnate hundreds of women in the time it takes a woman to gestate and bear one child, which she is usually bound to for years while that same man skips merrily from town to town. Therefore it makes sense that men want sex all the time and women don't. It's reproductively advantageous, duh.Fine merrily pokes holes in all of this. First, what women? Setting aside the number of women within a day's walk of the average caveman, Neolithic farmer, or 1800s city dweller, even in today's jet-setting world how many women are lining up to have sex with an endless line-up of horny men? Not just sex, but baby-making sex? And how many of those women are actually fertile at a given point of time? And while everyone can think of a story they heard about someone getting pregnant off a one night stand, I bet many more can think of couples taking months to conceive. Turns out this reproductive strategy may have only worked out for Genghis Khan and a few other despotic men throughout history, and, Fine points out, maybe that says more about despots than it does about men? In short, a lot of looking at scientific studies done on sex and gender that point out that there maybe? Might have? been a bit of bias going on. Less tightly constructed than Delusions of Gender: How Our Minds, Society, and Neurosexism Create Difference, Fine does meander a bit, but accessible to people whose eyes crossed a bit trying to read Women's Work, Men's Property: The Origins of Gender and Class. (Mine.)"
234,0393355489,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1348540-charlie,3,"Cordelia Fine sets up a well-known stalking horse in the shape of Testosterone Rex the king of hormones with a view to pulling him down and showing him to be a meaningless construct. She uses scientific studies as part of the technique for pulling him down, but also an appeal to ‘our values’. The Testosterone Rex construct which she pulls apart is the idea that boys will be boys, that the presence of testosterone makes men into naturally promiscuous hunters, risk takers and show-offs while the lack of it makes women into careful carers and nurturers. Fine needs to state her T Rex construct at the start of the book in order for the reader to know what she will be arguing against, however, I did not find that she made it clear until afterwards that this was not actually her view of the world. As a result, I nearly put the book down and left it before she was really ready to start. I found a lot of the science interesting, but I was somewhat sad that there was not more evidence for a wider range of elements to the story. The science seemed to be very strongly focussed around the risk-taking area. I guess this is the easiest part of the story to test and verify, but I would personally have liked a bit more stress on other areas too.The book states on the cover that it is a science book prize winner. It does not say it is also a feminist book. I am happy to read either or both kinds of book, but I picked this one up expecting something more dispassionate. The Author is however very passionate, she has a very definite agenda. She makes a good case for it with the evidence she uses, but as a scientist, that passion means that I have to wonder if the evidence she uses is cherry picked to make a point or not. I find that doubt tarnishes some apparently very good, interesting science for me. I would have preferred the science and the passion in two separate books."
235,0393355489,http://goodreads.com/user/show/17594936-colin,4,"I always find it hard to evaluate books like this. There are so many studies into human nature, human behaviour, sex differences, and for me, they raise more questions than they answer. How was that test administered? Were the men and women in the test into risk appetite all the same age? How was the question phrased? I invariably find myself doubting the scientific method, and then in the absence of reliable data points, measuring the writer's interpretation against my own experience. But of course that just means I'm layering my own bias on top of the writer's bias, which in turn is overlaid on the experimenter's experimental design. The result is a superficially plausible narrative, which I know will be contradicted by the next book I read on the same topic.Cordelia Fine does a good job of trying to combat the kinds of folk narrative explanations that thrive in all this confusion. She starts off with one of the hoariest of all - the idea that men have evolved to be unfaithful while women have evolved to be monogamous nest builders. This is one of the best known examples of sociobiology being drafted in to support a conclusion you know the researcher had in mind from the start and wanted to ""prove"". Fine's iconoclasm in taking aim at it seems admirable. She also takes care to present her evidence carefully, showing balanced results and not just trying to claim all the evidence points to one inevitable conclusion. This in marked contrast to - for example - Jordan Peterson who is forever pointing at stuff that happens in nature and implying that we just have to accept that the status quo is here to stay and resistance is futile. Give me a Cordelia Fine over a Jordan Peterson any day of the week. And she won't even tell me to tidy my room. I didn't find my hackles raising at any point, and although she editorialises strenuously on the meaning of the results, she's not trying to press the science into service or (as far as I can tell) manipulate the facts. Fair enough.The general gist is that there are differences between the sexes in some ways but that there was so much social conditioning overlaid on top of that that most of what we think of as immutable human nature can be stripped back if we, as a society, choose to do so. I think I'd put myself a little further towards the Stephen Pinker end of the spectrum but again, that's just me, maybe overlaying what I see around me, how I think and how women I know seem to think, how our daughter developed in what we thought was a fairly stereotype-free household... So it's a hit and miss, subjective interpretation of the facts but can any of us bring any better expertise to bear to judge between the competing claims of the people who have looked inside our brains and reckon they know what they've found there? Probably not."
236,0393355489,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2860188-eduardo-santiago,3,"So much research these days claims to find testosterone-this or hardwired-gender-difference-that. Risk-taking, competitiveness, ability, even childhood toy preference. Cordelia Fine somewhat exasperatedly follows up with crucial context—“the rest of the story,” if you will: yes, but this study didn’t consider corticoid levels; yes, but that other study neglected such-and-such findings; and most crucially yes, but it’s staggeringly difficult to isolate this effect from social and cultural factors. Nevertheless, she persiidentifies clever ways in which these issues have been studied, and the gist is: context matters. A lot.Science requires reproducibility. Reproducible results are best obtained when there are a small number of variables—hard to achieve with something as richly messy as a human life. Once one compensates for the factors overlooked in much research, plus publication bias, plus just plain built-in human bias, few effects survive scrutiny. Yes, we’re different—deliciously so, in my view!—but not in any way that affects ability. Not even in the slightest bit.Fine writes with a sardonic bite that worked well to start with but grew tiresome. I was also highly disappointed in her somewhat off-context quoting of Robert Sapolsky—a hero of mine—and her failure to acknowledge his groundbreaking work decades ago in breaking down testosterone myths. And, dear FSM, what has happened to proofreading? Much as I want to grant four stars, much as I think this is important work that needs to be read, I can only justify three. (Goodreads, could we have fractional stars please?)On a side note, I find myself fortunate to have read this just before and just after the 2018 Women’s March where I was surrounded by thousands of strong, powerful, capable human beings of all genders and colors, many of whom are living under the culturally-imposed “oh, you just aren’t able to do these sorts of things.” All of whom categorically reject that, as does Fine and as do I and, I trust, you. #resist.And on another side note: if you’re interested in these sorts of gender issues, I urge you to listen to this episode of the Hidden Brain podcast in which two progressive parents attempt to raise their children free of gender stereotypes and much loveliness ensues."

This book, cleverly written, does an outstanding job of decimating stereotypical beliefs that boys are boys and girls are girls because of innate, fixed differences. I used to think men were more prone to risk taking than women. It turns out that this isn’t true, for a few reasons! For example:1) risk taking studies have methodological flaws. For example, these studies typically focus on activities that are considered to be male-expertise. Different results are found if you consider female-expertise activities. Would you consider baking a very difficult soufflé for a dinner party? 2) risk taking studies ACTUALLY find that the most high-status people are most likely to take risks. In matrilineal society is women. In western society it is WHITE men followed by women and minorities. Etc.3) the actual risk to women of “risky” events proposed in these studies is MUCH HIGHER than the actual risk to men. Consider: would you go to the bus station at 11 PM for a chance to pick up $100? For whom is that obviously more risky- a 5’10” man or a 5’2” woman? Obviously women need the cash reward to be higher because they are literally facing MORE RISK. Change the situation so men are facing more risk, and the answers change.The book gives a careful data based treatment to many stereotypical beliefs, overturning widely held views about the impact of biological sex and sex hormones on the brain.

238,0393355489,http://goodreads.com/user/show/28668057-jasmine,3,"Cordelia Fine's Delusions of Gender was one of my favorite reads of the year, and so I was excited to pick up this sequel-in-spirit.It started out strong, combining Fine's delightful dry wit with a thorough review/critique of seminal works in the ""male/testestosterone = high risk/high reward = spray & pray mating strategy"" field. She then continued with a review of the many different ways male and female creatures compete for reproductive success. Although while I found this part interesting, I ultimately found tidbits like the two opposite mating strategies of the horned dung beetle to be less useful in my day-to-day experience of the world than the aspects of gender and science described in Delusions of Gender. The final portion I found to be a bit more unfocused. I found myself a little uncertain about what Fine or anyone else in the field takes home from experiments on risk versus reward between men and women. In this portion of the book particularly, she often repeated parts of Delusions of Gender - which left me feeling that perhaps this whole book could have been an extra set of chapters in the earlier volume rather than a stand-alone book.Still, I overall enjoyed the book, and would probably still read another book written by Fine - but I would recommend Delusions of Gender and not this one, as a starting point."

The book made a lot of good points about how environment and social conditions can adjust the concentration of testosterone in an individual, and how circumstances can bring out ""atypical"" behavior relative to the usual gender stereotypes, such as gentle, nurturing behavior in males. But as I see it, testosterone is still at the core of and key to competitiveness, aggression, and ambition in humans (and probably other animals as well). Women have some too, just not as much, and I believe there is still a strong correlation between testosterone level and ambition and related traits in women. I highly recommend listening to this podcast in conjunction with this book:This American Life: Testosteronehttps://www.thisamericanlife.org/220/...Transcript:https://www.thisamericanlife.org/220/...It left a deep impression on me, and also adds a lot to what you will read in this book should you decide to give it a try."

On the one hand, she crafts a very good and thorough argument for gender equality, attacking every conceivable statement which tries to make the existing gaps seem inevitable. Her arguments are filled with data taken from scientific studies and meta-analyses of the scientific literature. She explains that even some of the science is biased and concludes, many times over, that all the large gaps between the genders stem from cultural biases, which have constantly been reinforced throughout history. And based on the evidence she presents, I can do nothing else but wholeheartedly agree with her conclusions of culturally enforce artificial gender differences.On the other hand, the book is utterly repetitive. She states her conclusions from the start of the book, her arguments develop only slightly - repeating her conclusions over and over again, usually taking a popular counter-argument and battering it to a pulp and by pouring on it study after study which finds even a smidgen of evidence to support her claim. She tries to justify this aggressive crusade against gender-inequality by exaggerating the opposition. I scanned Joe Haldeman's book, Testosterone, for those glaring omissions she attributes to it – keeping testosterone only in the realm of male achievements. He does not omit to include the effects of testosterone in women and does mention the fuzziness of the results. I agree with her, though, that his tone is somewhat dismissive of the role testosterone plays in women's bodies and brains, but it's hard to distinguish between her presentation of real data and her consistently one-sided interpretation.She speaks of deeds, not words, to use in the fight for gender equality. But I'm afraid she misinterprets her mantra and uses words as a flurry of punches which hit everything and everyone who happens to be near her intended targets."

Fine is a skill-full, witty, insightful, and above all scientifically ruthless writer. Her greatest appeal is that she brings sharp objectivity to such an emotionally-charged discussion, and helps defend feminist and queer ideals with logic, fact, and perspective. One of the best books released this year, full of new information for me even though I read the psychology and neuroscience literature regularly. A heroic book.Fine begins with an elegant challenge to Darwin’s theory of sexual selection. This echoes the broad themes of Evolution’s Rainbow, but it des not appear in the references and the arguments are refined with greater precision and clarity. Sexual selection theory, which states that the low-investment sperm production in males mandates a competitive, aggressive, promiscuous mating strategy which cannot benefit females is supported by very little evidence. The 1945 study by Bateman with fruit flies which is often cited as the first impirical evidence of this showed “ The outcome of Bateman’s six series of matchmaking was the first scientific report of greater male variation in reproductive success. For example, 21 per cent of males failed to produce any off-spring, compared with only 4 per cent of females.” Yet Fine cites recent meta-analyses of Bateman’s own data which showed that the mutant fly lines he used to detect paternity of offspring overcounted fathers and underrepresented maternal mutations, and that his own findings showed greater offspring survival in promiscuous females. “ Proposed gains of female promiscuity include genetic benefits, healthier offspring, and the opportunity to set up sperm competitions that weed out inferior specimens.” Using statistics to explain poor analysis and biased publication of positive results, Fine show that there is just as much evidence that the traditionally “male” mating strategy is effective for females in some environments, and equally the “female” strategy can be effective for males. I particularly enjoyed the numerical analysis of the fecundity of a single man achieving more than 100 one-night-stands a year, still less likely than a monogamous man of fathering a single baby. “ (Indeed, a promiscuous man would need to have sex with more than 130 women just to have 90 per cent odds of outdoing the one baby a monogamous man might expect to father in a year.)” This simplistic view of “mating strategies” is made to seem outdated and juvenile.Fine then attacks the biology underlying these ecological assumptions, the idea that there are hard-wired genetics programmes, boulstered by hormones, which then dictate how a person will live their life. “ To confuse human (cultural) sexuality and (natural) reproduction is classically pseudo-scientific.” She dispels the idea that the most attractive men are wealthy and powerful whereas the most attractive women are merely young, by pooling data from dozens of cultures from urban China “But an analysis of actual matches made through an online dating Web site in China found that likes-attract again provided a much better explanation of the data than did potentials-attract.” to hunter-gatherer societies which demonstrated that humans are more attracted to those that they share traits in common with than there architypes. Fine shows that women underperform in laboratory tasks after being primed that these are “masculine” tasks as a form of social defence, and that ficticious male job applications are actually considered more favourably if the candidate admits to being poor at traditionally “feminine” activities. “ For many decades, researchers supposed that masculinity and femininity are polar ends of a single dimension: someone high in masculinity is therefore necessarily low in femininity, and vice versa.” Even the single traditionally masculine dimension of risk-taking is shown to be an uncorrelated mix of different psychological assessments of different situations (those who gamble are no more likely to take health or ethical risks etc.), and that findings that women are more risk averse also apply to dozens of other populations in society whom also face discrimination. “ Society seemed a significantly safer place to white males than it did to all other groups, including nonwhite men.” It is very difficult to objectively make a case that this T-Rex “hyper male” persona exists within the male population, and is not an extrapolation that blends many historical time periods and cultures into something fictional.“ These very open-ended outcomes would be more easily achieved by a developmental pathway that runs from sex to socialization to the brain (and hormones, as we’ll come to in a later chapter), rather than by an inflexible direct path from sex to brain.”Arguments for the essential, and probable, role of environment in human behaviour over hard-wired genetic determinism is skilfully and logically made. Queer identities are not the main focus of this book but are dealt with using sensitivity and intelligence. “If most of us were intersex in some way or another, the ubiquitous question, “Is it a boy or a girl?” wouldn’t be so compelling. And if the shape of our external genitalia fell on a continuum, with the majority of people in an ambiguous midrange shape, it’s an interesting question whether our sex would play such a key role in how we present ourselves to the world.” I hope to see future writing from her which might expand some of these tantalising hints.Fine’s treatment of the animal literature of sex differences is droll, thorough, and erudite. “ The development of testes from an “androgynous” gonad is an active, gene-directed process, but in the absence of the potent, male SRY gene, ovarian tissue just… happens, as the default?” She reveals amazingly underpublicized results. For example, male rats will care for young if there is no female in the cage to do it for them, showing that they have all the same innate behavioural tools as females. Also, chemically castrated macaques of high social status do not lose their power, aggression, or mating opportunities in the absence of testosterone. In many animals, including fish with whopping testicles, social status trusts blood testosterone levels and scientists are beginning to believe that hormones respond to social heirarchies, rather than a linear system the other way round. ““Social events regulate gonadal events.” Or to put it another way, just in case the significance of this sailed past unnoticed, cichlid testes are a social construction.” Even differences in hypocampal dendrites between the sexes are so condition-specific that it is impossible to even ascribe a “male” or “female” profile. “In other words, brief stress exposure reverses the “sex difference” for that particular brain characteristic.” Is being stressed more truly “male” than being relaxed, and which types of being stressed? Overall, this is a scholarly criticism of the often oversimplified debate surrounding sex/gender associated anatomy and the erroneous leap that this represents thinking. I could not fault the science or the writing. I’m just sad that it’s finished now.“Science writer and behavioural endocrinologist Richard Francis coined the term “Testosterone Rex” to poke fun at the mistaken conception of testosterone as a “super-actor”—the “plenipotent executor of selection’s demands” that simply “takes care of everything.””"
246,0393355489,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5847899-patrick,3,"When I picked this up, I thought this book might be about to try to persuade me that there are no innate differences between men and women beyond those that are self-evident, and that the differences we think might exist are all merely the result of social conditioning. And that is not actually what this book claims - it is, after all  nature and nurture but still...The book demolishes a particular cartoon 'biological essentialist' version of sex differences, and there probably are those who do actually subscribe to such a view (though I doubt any of them would pick this book up) but it did feel like it was skewering a straw man. All of which is fine, but very often, Fine seems to leave the balance to the footnotes. And while I'm in no way expert enough to offer my own informed view, I got the impression that she was sometimes being very deliberately selective in the studies she refers to in order to strengthen her pre-existing point of view ('policy-based evidence making as a long-time colleague put it, albeit in a very different context).For example, she does quite a good job of rubbishing the idea that all men are driven on some level by a desire to obtain a harem, but then I think she pushes the argument too far in trying to imply, without ever quite saying it, that there are no real differences between (the average) men and women's attitudes to casual sex at all. The fact that she cites in support a study by Teela Sanders about the fact that men who visit prostitutes very often go back to the same person over and over, but never stops to look at what I'd regard as the more fundamental question of why almost all prostitution is servicing the desires of male clients is just one example. And it turns out that the stuff she has at the beginning about fruit flies' mating behaviours is also a fairly selective version of the wider evidence on the topic (though I had to google that to find it out).As a whole, the book seemed uneven in that a great deal of space is given to how we are shaped by our social environment, and even how it can shape our very biology, but questions of how biology might shape the social world we construct are not really given much of an airing.All the same, I thought there was a fair amount of interest to found here: For example, the chapter on risk-taking, examining in more detail the cliched idea that men tend to take more risk than women was a quite illuminating exploration of what we actually mean by 'risk taking'. The idea, in particular that the concept had been very narrowly defined by those investigating risk-taking differences between the sexes to look specifically at a particular kind of physical risk and that this could be used to build a narrative that the 2008 (and presumably the 1929) financial crash was caused by the testosterone levels of (mainly male) city traders she shows to be a rather simplistic reading of the evidence. She also does quite a good job of questioning the validity of experiments exploring risk-taking or gambling behaviours in artificial environments where absolutely nothing is truly at stake.So worth a read, but not the comprehensive demolition of the idea that there are biologically determined differences between the average man and the average woman that the author sometimes seems to have set out to write."

Fine attempts to shine her light on common conceptions of gender based on outdated scientific views. While some sections were a little too sciencey (which is, of course, unsurprising!), she generally manages to use clear language to convey her argument. I felt a little more sociology might have supported the overall point even further, since gender is one of the ultimate multidisciplinary fields of this moment.I'd highly recommend this book to anyone who feels their blood boil when someone argues men are simply more likely to cheat, women are more caring because genes and 'boys will be boys'.

Not so Cordelia Fine in her new book Testosterone Rex: unmaking the myths of our gendered minds. Instead Fine leads with a scene of domestic normalcy, a family dinner where a discussion on desexing the new family pet dog moves on to taxidermy and the possibility of making the said canines testicles into a key ring. This almost deadpan start sets the scene for a witty riposte to those who insist on the testosterone myth that we, modern men and women, are fixed in an ancestral past that rewarded competitive males and caring females.Winner of the 2017 Royal Society Science Book Award, Testosterone Rex brings together evolutionary science, psychology, neuroscience and social history to move beyond old ‘nature versus nurture’ debates, and to explain ‘I think you’ll find it’s more complicated than men are from Mars and women are from Venus‘ and therefore why it’s time to unmake the tyrannical myth of Testosterone Rex. The author, Cordelia Fine, is a professor of the history and philosophy of science at the University of Melbourne. Fine’s earlier two books; A mind of its own (2006) and Delusions of gender (2010) were similarly insightful, intellectually pugnacious and drolly written. I remember being annoyed reading A mind of its own, making copious margin notes as I went - for me usually a good sign that a book has a lot to say and is challenging my existing ideas and/or sparking off new ones. Like Jonathan Swift, Fine is a writer who will “vex the world rather than divert it.” A worthy recipient of the Royal Society science book award.Fine tackles many of the classic experiments that have led to our myths around testosterone, maleness and competitiveness. One such example is a chapter long denouement of A. J. Bateman’s 1940s experiments on fruit flies and its later (1960s) elaboration by biologist Robert Trivers, which resulted in the almost universally accepted “Bateman’s principle” that males would do best (pace Darwin) by competing with other males in order to spread their cheap, mass-produced sperm among as many females as possible - while females should protect their precious eggs and be as selective as possible. Fine counters these experiments and the conclusions drawn from them, canvassing a large body of contemporary research that looks not only at the conclusions drawn, sexually reluctant females and promiscuous males, in addition underlining the biases that Bateman introduced, prejudicing his own results. All this is achieved with witty referencing to Maserati-driving boyfriends and the ever popular tails of the male Peacock.Fine then moves on to dismember the arguments that airily tie together sexual selection, evolutionary biology and consumer behaviour such as a Maserati -driving male giving a pair of Bulgari sunglasses as a male flaunting their resources. Fine asserts that for humans sexuality is far more than for reproduction. Reminding us: humans routinely engage in sexual pairings and acts, that not only often don’t - but actually can’t - lead to pregnancy. There are also many human sexual activities, like touching, kissing, and oral sex that likewise have no reproductive potential.The idea that we we have only to peel away the veneer of culture, learning, habit, fantasy and the true (natural) sexual being will emerge is pseudoscience - it is profoundly mistaken.Having demolished the past Rex myths Fine then proceeds to wittily tackle the current testosterone myths. If you were wondering Why can’t a woman be more like a man? or Are males (naturally) more risk-taking? Will I become a monstrous sexual predator if I increase the testosterone in my bloodstream? or If the Lehman brothers were sisters would we have had the recent global financial crisis? then read Testosterone Rex.Fine concludes with a grand challenge. Words are nice but often deeds are better - become less polite and more disruptive. Sexual equality is more than a lovely idea in principle. The science, Fine reveals, of Testosterone Rex does not block the path to a better place - it is our complacency in ‘waiting’ patiently for an evolutionary change to occur. Thinking that men are from Mars and women are from Venus is about our values not science.This review was first posted here: http://dragonlaughing.tumblr.com/post... "

“So what happens when a scientist, under controlled laboratory conditions, simulates a first-wave feminist rodent movement by placing males in cages with pups but no females? Before too long you will see the male “mothering” the infant, in much the same way that females do. Feminism: 1. Sexual selection: nil.”
 Delusions of Gender: How Our Minds, Society, and Neurosexism Create Difference is one of my favorite psychology/science books of all-time: it’s funny, it’s clever, and it’s devastatingly sharp in cutting away the illusionist veil that many people still pretend hangs over the divide between boys and girls.So when its scientific successor,  Testosterone Rex: Myths of Sex, Science, and Society, came out, I knew I had to get my hands on it as soon as possible. And, as expected, it’s as good as the first – though I have to admit I enjoyed it slightly less because I’m not as hardcore into biology and hormones as I am into psychology. But that’s purely a personal preference.In this book, psychologist and researcher  Cordelia Fine takes a good, hard look at the influence of the hormone testosterone on humans and gender – effectively separating its presumed influence, and its scientific and biological influence. Just as in her previous book, she picks apart both research and popular or common opinion, giving us readers a critical overview of what testosterone does do and what it doesn’t. (Or what we might simply assume it to do rather than what it actually does.)I’ve heard people accuse Fine of cherry picking scientific data and not being able to explain away certain discrepancies in gender – such as higher statistics for men in terms of crime and rape – with her explanations and expositions of the workings of testosterone.I respectfully disagree. What Fine shows us with this book is that causal relations cannot just be applied to any and all things without evidence, or without critically examining just what such a causal relation might imply. An example of this would be, “If men are statistically more likely to commit a crime than women, then it must be due to testosterone, because that marks the main/biggest biological difference between men and women!”.I can see how someone could arrive at such a conclusion, but: in human nature, combining both psychology and biology, it’s almost impossible to subscribe an effect to one single variable (in this case, subscribing higher crime rates in men to testosterone). Especially with hormones, the interaction of a hormone with its host and that host’s direct environment can have a huge effect on the workings of said hormone.Not to mention that a variable might play a much smaller role than initially expected.Fine dives into both of these lines of thoughts (complex interaction versus actual role) into this book, which leads to a bunch of very interesting reinterpretations of existing research. She steps outside of the simple paradigm that says, “X makes Y happen” and looks at what exactly constitutes X, what influences both X and Y, and is it actually true that X makes Y happen?It’s a solid, well-researched book that doesn’t shy away from using field jargon (so be warned if you’re not fully at home in psychology/biology research) and forces its readers to look at common assumptions in a different way. Even as a fellow psychologist, it taught me a lot, and gave me plenty of insights to ponder upon.It’s also funny and wittily written, which makes it a more pleasant read throughout the drier research material. (Though doubtlessly some will find Fine’s references to feminism and jokes about sexism offensive.)"
252,0393355489,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3611893-dearbhla,5,"I read Fine's Delusions of Gender a few years ago and really enjoyed it, so when I saw she had another one coming out I knew I had to order it. It is just as good as Delusions, and I would recommend it to anyone to read.

In this book Fine takes a look at testosterone and asks is it really the reason behind financial crisis, risk taking, and the differences between the sexes. the short answer is no. The slightly longer, but still short version is that it has an important role to play but it is equally as important as all other hormones in the human body. For more go read the book, it is fascinating, interesting, funny and very readable. Fine has a great style. She weaves personal anecdotes in with scientific studies as well as her own speculation. She counters arguments with facts and figures, but never in a dry and boring way.It is also a most quotable book, if you follow me on tumblr you may have noticed, if not click here for a selection and if that doesn't prompt you to think about trying this book I don't know what will.One of my very favourite lines is Social events regulate gonadal events. I think it should be my new motto.But apart from the writing style what she says in the book is important. She never says that there aren't differences between men and women, but she emphasizes that we cannot accurately tell what is causing those differences. From the moment we are born we are influenced by both genes and environment, and sometimes environment has a greater influence. Never mind the fact that when you average everything out there are more differences between men (or women) than between the sexes. Also, sex is a spectrum, not an either or. Stereotypes and hardline ""men are like this"" views do nobody any good.People are people, and people are different to people in many many ways. And society and experience do a lot to shape people. If you think about the idea behind ""privilege"" for example you can see that influences how people of differing backgrounds see and act. It isn't what you were born with, it is how society around you that shapes what you were born with.I've skimmed a few of the negative reviews on Goodreads and many of them seem to say ""I don't agree with this so it is wrong"" and some say that Fine wants to proclaim that there are no differences between men and women. Well, I've read the book and she makes it perfectly clear that there are differences, both in humans and in other species, what she is looking at is how innate those differences are and can they be altered? Also across the whole species are the differences really there. And in some cases she argues that, yes, they are. In others no, the variables even out across a large sample. Fine also points to numerous studies that show that just because X has been the way for so long, it doesn't mean it can't ever be altered.Of course I came to the book on her side, so maybe I'm just agreeing with her because it supports my view of the world. I'm not a scientist and am not about to go through hundreds of studies in an attempt to prove myself wrong. However I have skimmed through some of those ""men are from mars"" type books, you know the sort that try to argue that all relationship differences exist because men are like this while women are like that, and in most cases I don't identify with the version of womanhood that they portray. So maybe I'm just an outlier, or maybe there is more to being a person than what is between your legs."

And by publishing Intellectual Impostures the world got to see how many academics were scurrying to hide their nakedness behind century old desks.Cordelia Fine deals a new blow to the impostors. Say one Gijsbert Stoet who can declare: In the stone age, it was useful for men to be hunters and women to look after babies, and nature has helped by encoding some of these skills in the hardware of our brain. That still influences how we think today although he never encountered live stone age hominids, unless his priestly confessor can do channeling. That was written in jest, anybody can tell stone age people don't have souls as the precede the Garden of Eden by some 100.000 years. And is paid as a professor and researched by the British state to do his rain dance. In this sick Medieval game Cordelia Fine tries to bring some light.In the end, there is no controversy, only mostly old white men scared that their prized male offsprings will not enjoy their level of privilege because of some sort of biblical reenactment with the feminists playing Eve giving once more the dumb Adam the fruit of knowlege."
255,0393355489,http://goodreads.com/user/show/47667703-chris-chapman,5,"This is an awesome, exhaustively researched book, and yes it is readable. Read my GR friend Trevor's review, it says it all:https://www.goodreads.com/review/show...Just to add, it is interesting what this book says about one of the acrimonious debates in feminism - which I'll crassly summarise as smash the patriarchy vs lean in. Lean In: Women, Work, and the Will to Lead being Sheryl Sandberg's book which encourages women to work within the system but to much more aggressively put themselves forward and refuse to be ignored/underpaid/touched up etc. Fine doesn't mention the book but she does suggest the Lean In approach, as well as not only ignoring and leaving intact the structural barriers that exclude women, may also simply not work. She quotes one study which found that both female and male graduates of high-powered MBA courses were equally forthright in negotiating the pay package when they landed their first job. But guess what? Women's demands were met less often than men's. Because Fine's book is about hormones, her point is that it's not hormones that make men more aggressive in negotiating etc. It could just be, that after being knocked back again and again, maybe you just give up? The cost/benefit analysis is going to be different.I'm not going to downgrade my star rating because of the chirpy and not funny ""this is a science book but don't worry it's accessible"" stuff, which I imagine is a feature of a lot of popular science writing (I haven't read much, I'm just guessing). "
256,0393355489,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7089145-alisha,3,"3.5 stars.....more to come later but this was a mix of some really great science and a little bit of reaching too far to make conclusions that the author holds near and dear. Speculation is always allowed and even fruitful but there needs to be a clear delineation between fact and what has been surmised from that (this was starkly clear in the chapter regarding hormones and I was disappointed to find that the author spent an inordinate amount of time on testosterone and none on estrogen). I also felt that the book suffered from uneven handling of the many animal studies; sometimes they were used to show that humans are different and we can't use the results from those studies to compare to humans.....and then when the results of the studies aligned with an idea that the author liked then suddenly the results of those studies were extrapolated to humans as well. This hearkens back to the old saying - ""when you're a hammer everything looks like a nail""."

This book shatters the testosterone excuse for how men behave and explores the real evolutionary story in light of our cultures, traditions, and power relations.All around brilliant: as science writing, it is straight-forward, well argued, and hilarious. She also boldly claims to be a feminist writing a feminist science book--no doubt this will land her many detractors who will focus on her supposed bias instead of on the research she illuminates.Go, read this now."

I think the debunking of the myth is useful and asking questions and doing more research on gender is important, but I wasn't sure she made quite the case that she tried to make about the lack of meaningful differences. I want to read more by her though to see if her other books are more thorough. "

I felt like she was just making the same point (humans are complicated and not ruled by gender-specific hormones) for 300 pages.

262,0393355489,http://goodreads.com/user/show/30924713-kramer-thompson,3,"I am very new to the science behind gender/sex differences and similarities, and I found Testosterone Rex quite interesting. Fine discusses quite a variety of ways that the sexes are purportedly distinct, and argues that under scrutiny we discover that they are actually not so different. Many of the studies she cites to back these views up are very interesting, and she presents most of the topics in a very accessible way.That said, at times it seemed like she might have been arguing against a strawman. For example, at the beginning of one chapter Fine notes one quote by David Schmitt, who states that male humans have the ability to lend their sperm in the conception of 100 offspring within a single month by mating with many (100) different women. She then spends a large section of that chapter demonstrating how implausible this is. But what's really important is not whether male humans could produce 100 offspring a month, but merely whether they could consistently produce a significantly higher amount of offspring by acting polygynously than could female humans. This would suggest that male polygyny could be adaptive and thus that the tendency for men to act polygynously could be an adaptation. Of course it is implausible that men could produce 100 offspring in a month. But could they produce 1 a month? 2? 5? Fine does state afterwards that the males of some tribes whose behaviour probably resembles that of humans over much of our evolutionary history are expected to produce a maximum of 12-16 children, and women of those tribes 9-12. This suggests that a strategy of male polygyny would not be significantly more adaptive than monogamy, so there probably would not be an adaptation for male polygyny. I would have much preferred detailed examination of Fine's latter claim regarding the maximum offspring able to be produced by men in tribes that purportedly resemble humans throughout much of our evolutionary history. It seems to me that such discussion would be more relevant to serious debates about the adaptiveness of male polygyny. However, I get the impression that there are people who take serious, hardline approaches that are very similar to the ones Fine argues against in Testosterone Rex. Perhaps these people do believe that male humans can really produce 100 offspring a month, or at least some similarly absurdly high number. If that's the case, then I see the merit of Fine's discussion of the unlikelihood of men fathering 100 children a month. Of course, this is just one section among a larger book, and much of the book was not similarly frustrating. To summarise: much of the book was interesting; some parts seemed to be arguing against strawmen, but; it may be that these arguments are actually not strawmen (depending on the views of Fine's dialectical partners). In order to determine whether Fine successfully and absolutely defeats all aspects of the Testosterone Rex belief system I will have to read more about the differences (or lack thereof) between the sexes. Thanks to Cordelia Fine's interesting explication of and argumentation regarding these topics, I plan on undertaking such further education."
263,0393355489,http://goodreads.com/user/show/117566-mauri,3,"I forgot how funny Fine is - she writes in a tightly controlled, ""isn't it amusing how..."" sort of manner that both makes you laugh and realize that she is quite ticked off (and you should be too).In this, Fine tackles research about gender and sex, with a focus on knocking back a lot of the ""boys will be boys"" beliefs society holds dear.For example: male promiscuity. A man can impregnate hundreds of women in the time it takes a woman to gestate and bear one child, which she is usually bound to for years while that same man skips merrily from town to town. Therefore it makes sense that men want sex all the time and women don't. It's reproductively advantageous, duh.Fine merrily pokes holes in all of this. First, what women? Setting aside the number of women within a day's walk of the average caveman, Neolithic farmer, or 1800s city dweller, even in today's jet-setting world how many women are lining up to have sex with an endless line-up of horny men? Not just sex, but baby-making sex? And how many of those women are actually fertile at a given point of time? And while everyone can think of a story they heard about someone getting pregnant off a one night stand, I bet many more can think of couples taking months to conceive. Turns out this reproductive strategy may have only worked out for Genghis Khan and a few other despotic men throughout history, and, Fine points out, maybe that says more about despots than it does about men? In short, a lot of looking at scientific studies done on sex and gender that point out that there maybe? Might have? been a bit of bias going on. Less tightly constructed than Delusions of Gender: How Our Minds, Society, and Neurosexism Create Difference, Fine does meander a bit, but accessible to people whose eyes crossed a bit trying to read Women's Work, Men's Property: The Origins of Gender and Class. (Mine.)"
264,0393355489,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1348540-charlie,3,"Cordelia Fine sets up a well-known stalking horse in the shape of Testosterone Rex the king of hormones with a view to pulling him down and showing him to be a meaningless construct. She uses scientific studies as part of the technique for pulling him down, but also an appeal to ‘our values’. The Testosterone Rex construct which she pulls apart is the idea that boys will be boys, that the presence of testosterone makes men into naturally promiscuous hunters, risk takers and show-offs while the lack of it makes women into careful carers and nurturers. Fine needs to state her T Rex construct at the start of the book in order for the reader to know what she will be arguing against, however, I did not find that she made it clear until afterwards that this was not actually her view of the world. As a result, I nearly put the book down and left it before she was really ready to start. I found a lot of the science interesting, but I was somewhat sad that there was not more evidence for a wider range of elements to the story. The science seemed to be very strongly focussed around the risk-taking area. I guess this is the easiest part of the story to test and verify, but I would personally have liked a bit more stress on other areas too.The book states on the cover that it is a science book prize winner. It does not say it is also a feminist book. I am happy to read either or both kinds of book, but I picked this one up expecting something more dispassionate. The Author is however very passionate, she has a very definite agenda. She makes a good case for it with the evidence she uses, but as a scientist, that passion means that I have to wonder if the evidence she uses is cherry picked to make a point or not. I find that doubt tarnishes some apparently very good, interesting science for me. I would have preferred the science and the passion in two separate books."
265,0393355489,http://goodreads.com/user/show/17594936-colin,4,"I always find it hard to evaluate books like this. There are so many studies into human nature, human behaviour, sex differences, and for me, they raise more questions than they answer. How was that test administered? Were the men and women in the test into risk appetite all the same age? How was the question phrased? I invariably find myself doubting the scientific method, and then in the absence of reliable data points, measuring the writer's interpretation against my own experience. But of course that just means I'm layering my own bias on top of the writer's bias, which in turn is overlaid on the experimenter's experimental design. The result is a superficially plausible narrative, which I know will be contradicted by the next book I read on the same topic.Cordelia Fine does a good job of trying to combat the kinds of folk narrative explanations that thrive in all this confusion. She starts off with one of the hoariest of all - the idea that men have evolved to be unfaithful while women have evolved to be monogamous nest builders. This is one of the best known examples of sociobiology being drafted in to support a conclusion you know the researcher had in mind from the start and wanted to ""prove"". Fine's iconoclasm in taking aim at it seems admirable. She also takes care to present her evidence carefully, showing balanced results and not just trying to claim all the evidence points to one inevitable conclusion. This in marked contrast to - for example - Jordan Peterson who is forever pointing at stuff that happens in nature and implying that we just have to accept that the status quo is here to stay and resistance is futile. Give me a Cordelia Fine over a Jordan Peterson any day of the week. And she won't even tell me to tidy my room. I didn't find my hackles raising at any point, and although she editorialises strenuously on the meaning of the results, she's not trying to press the science into service or (as far as I can tell) manipulate the facts. Fair enough.The general gist is that there are differences between the sexes in some ways but that there was so much social conditioning overlaid on top of that that most of what we think of as immutable human nature can be stripped back if we, as a society, choose to do so. I think I'd put myself a little further towards the Stephen Pinker end of the spectrum but again, that's just me, maybe overlaying what I see around me, how I think and how women I know seem to think, how our daughter developed in what we thought was a fairly stereotype-free household... So it's a hit and miss, subjective interpretation of the facts but can any of us bring any better expertise to bear to judge between the competing claims of the people who have looked inside our brains and reckon they know what they've found there? Probably not."
266,0393355489,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2860188-eduardo-santiago,3,"So much research these days claims to find testosterone-this or hardwired-gender-difference-that. Risk-taking, competitiveness, ability, even childhood toy preference. Cordelia Fine somewhat exasperatedly follows up with crucial context—“the rest of the story,” if you will: yes, but this study didn’t consider corticoid levels; yes, but that other study neglected such-and-such findings; and most crucially yes, but it’s staggeringly difficult to isolate this effect from social and cultural factors. Nevertheless, she persiidentifies clever ways in which these issues have been studied, and the gist is: context matters. A lot.Science requires reproducibility. Reproducible results are best obtained when there are a small number of variables—hard to achieve with something as richly messy as a human life. Once one compensates for the factors overlooked in much research, plus publication bias, plus just plain built-in human bias, few effects survive scrutiny. Yes, we’re different—deliciously so, in my view!—but not in any way that affects ability. Not even in the slightest bit.Fine writes with a sardonic bite that worked well to start with but grew tiresome. I was also highly disappointed in her somewhat off-context quoting of Robert Sapolsky—a hero of mine—and her failure to acknowledge his groundbreaking work decades ago in breaking down testosterone myths. And, dear FSM, what has happened to proofreading? Much as I want to grant four stars, much as I think this is important work that needs to be read, I can only justify three. (Goodreads, could we have fractional stars please?)On a side note, I find myself fortunate to have read this just before and just after the 2018 Women’s March where I was surrounded by thousands of strong, powerful, capable human beings of all genders and colors, many of whom are living under the culturally-imposed “oh, you just aren’t able to do these sorts of things.” All of whom categorically reject that, as does Fine and as do I and, I trust, you. #resist.And on another side note: if you’re interested in these sorts of gender issues, I urge you to listen to this episode of the Hidden Brain podcast in which two progressive parents attempt to raise their children free of gender stereotypes and much loveliness ensues."
267,0393355489,http://goodreads.com/user/show/62793003-cody-mccoy,5,"Testosterone is not what you think it is. This book, cleverly written, does an outstanding job of decimating stereotypical beliefs that boys are boys and girls are girls because of innate, fixed differences. I used to think men were more prone to risk taking than women. It turns out that this isn’t true, for a few reasons! For example:1) risk taking studies have methodological flaws. For example, these studies typically focus on activities that are considered to be male-expertise. Different results are found if you consider female-expertise activities. Would you consider baking a very difficult soufflé for a dinner party? 2) risk taking studies ACTUALLY find that the most high-status people are most likely to take risks. In matrilineal society is women. In western society it is WHITE men followed by women and minorities. Etc.3) the actual risk to women of “risky” events proposed in these studies is MUCH HIGHER than the actual risk to men. Consider: would you go to the bus station at 11 PM for a chance to pick up $100? For whom is that obviously more risky- a 5’10” man or a 5’2” woman? Obviously women need the cash reward to be higher because they are literally facing MORE RISK. Change the situation so men are facing more risk, and the answers change.The book gives a careful data based treatment to many stereotypical beliefs, overturning widely held views about the impact of biological sex and sex hormones on the brain.

268,0393355489,http://goodreads.com/user/show/28668057-jasmine,3,"Cordelia Fine's Delusions of Gender was one of my favorite reads of the year, and so I was excited to pick up this sequel-in-spirit.It started out strong, combining Fine's delightful dry wit with a thorough review/critique of seminal works in the ""male/testestosterone = high risk/high reward = spray & pray mating strategy"" field. She then continued with a review of the many different ways male and female creatures compete for reproductive success. Although while I found this part interesting, I ultimately found tidbits like the two opposite mating strategies of the horned dung beetle to be less useful in my day-to-day experience of the world than the aspects of gender and science described in Delusions of Gender. The final portion I found to be a bit more unfocused. I found myself a little uncertain about what Fine or anyone else in the field takes home from experiments on risk versus reward between men and women. In this portion of the book particularly, she often repeated parts of Delusions of Gender - which left me feeling that perhaps this whole book could have been an extra set of chapters in the earlier volume rather than a stand-alone book.Still, I overall enjoyed the book, and would probably still read another book written by Fine - but I would recommend Delusions of Gender and not this one, as a starting point."
269,0393355489,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4239658-karen-chung,3,"This book was a fairly interesting, quick read, but I ended up convinced that testosterone is still the main source of male-female differences. The book made a lot of good points about how environment and social conditions can adjust the concentration of testosterone in an individual, and how circumstances can bring out ""atypical"" behavior relative to the usual gender stereotypes, such as gentle, nurturing behavior in males. But as I see it, testosterone is still at the core of and key to competitiveness, aggression, and ambition in humans (and probably other animals as well). Women have some too, just not as much, and I believe there is still a strong correlation between testosterone level and ambition and related traits in women. I highly recommend listening to this podcast in conjunction with this book:This American Life: Testosteronehttps://www.thisamericanlife.org/220/...Transcript:https://www.thisamericanlife.org/220/...It left a deep impression on me, and also adds a lot to what you will read in this book should you decide to give it a try."

On the one hand, she crafts a very good and thorough argument for gender equality, attacking every conceivable statement which tries to make the existing gaps seem inevitable. Her arguments are filled with data taken from scientific studies and meta-analyses of the scientific literature. She explains that even some of the science is biased and concludes, many times over, that all the large gaps between the genders stem from cultural biases, which have constantly been reinforced throughout history. And based on the evidence she presents, I can do nothing else but wholeheartedly agree with her conclusions of culturally enforce artificial gender differences.On the other hand, the book is utterly repetitive. She states her conclusions from the start of the book, her arguments develop only slightly - repeating her conclusions over and over again, usually taking a popular counter-argument and battering it to a pulp and by pouring on it study after study which finds even a smidgen of evidence to support her claim. She tries to justify this aggressive crusade against gender-inequality by exaggerating the opposition. I scanned Joe Haldeman's book, Testosterone, for those glaring omissions she attributes to it – keeping testosterone only in the realm of male achievements. He does not omit to include the effects of testosterone in women and does mention the fuzziness of the results. I agree with her, though, that his tone is somewhat dismissive of the role testosterone plays in women's bodies and brains, but it's hard to distinguish between her presentation of real data and her consistently one-sided interpretation.She speaks of deeds, not words, to use in the fight for gender equality. But I'm afraid she misinterprets her mantra and uses words as a flurry of punches which hit everything and everyone who happens to be near her intended targets."

If you're tired of having gender essentialism used to explain why men can never be nurses (testosterone precludes empathy and caregiving!), or why women will never be interested enough in business to be CEOs (maybe we should make calculators pink!), this is a popular science repackaging of the actual scientific articles which demonstrate that hormones often follow behavior, that social and cultural structures are often far more to blame for the way men and women behave (women are also interested in casual sex, when the deck isn't stacked to get them killed of socially shunned) and that taking GNC Testosto-Boost is not going to fix personal insecurities."

Fine is a skill-full, witty, insightful, and above all scientifically ruthless writer. Her greatest appeal is that she brings sharp objectivity to such an emotionally-charged discussion, and helps defend feminist and queer ideals with logic, fact, and perspective. One of the best books released this year, full of new information for me even though I read the psychology and neuroscience literature regularly. A heroic book.Fine begins with an elegant challenge to Darwin’s theory of sexual selection. This echoes the broad themes of Evolution’s Rainbow, but it des not appear in the references and the arguments are refined with greater precision and clarity. Sexual selection theory, which states that the low-investment sperm production in males mandates a competitive, aggressive, promiscuous mating strategy which cannot benefit females is supported by very little evidence. The 1945 study by Bateman with fruit flies which is often cited as the first impirical evidence of this showed “ The outcome of Bateman’s six series of matchmaking was the first scientific report of greater male variation in reproductive success. For example, 21 per cent of males failed to produce any off-spring, compared with only 4 per cent of females.” Yet Fine cites recent meta-analyses of Bateman’s own data which showed that the mutant fly lines he used to detect paternity of offspring overcounted fathers and underrepresented maternal mutations, and that his own findings showed greater offspring survival in promiscuous females. “ Proposed gains of female promiscuity include genetic benefits, healthier offspring, and the opportunity to set up sperm competitions that weed out inferior specimens.” Using statistics to explain poor analysis and biased publication of positive results, Fine show that there is just as much evidence that the traditionally “male” mating strategy is effective for females in some environments, and equally the “female” strategy can be effective for males. I particularly enjoyed the numerical analysis of the fecundity of a single man achieving more than 100 one-night-stands a year, still less likely than a monogamous man of fathering a single baby. “ (Indeed, a promiscuous man would need to have sex with more than 130 women just to have 90 per cent odds of outdoing the one baby a monogamous man might expect to father in a year.)” This simplistic view of “mating strategies” is made to seem outdated and juvenile.Fine then attacks the biology underlying these ecological assumptions, the idea that there are hard-wired genetics programmes, boulstered by hormones, which then dictate how a person will live their life. “ To confuse human (cultural) sexuality and (natural) reproduction is classically pseudo-scientific.” She dispels the idea that the most attractive men are wealthy and powerful whereas the most attractive women are merely young, by pooling data from dozens of cultures from urban China “But an analysis of actual matches made through an online dating Web site in China found that likes-attract again provided a much better explanation of the data than did potentials-attract.” to hunter-gatherer societies which demonstrated that humans are more attracted to those that they share traits in common with than there architypes. Fine shows that women underperform in laboratory tasks after being primed that these are “masculine” tasks as a form of social defence, and that ficticious male job applications are actually considered more favourably if the candidate admits to being poor at traditionally “feminine” activities. “ For many decades, researchers supposed that masculinity and femininity are polar ends of a single dimension: someone high in masculinity is therefore necessarily low in femininity, and vice versa.” Even the single traditionally masculine dimension of risk-taking is shown to be an uncorrelated mix of different psychological assessments of different situations (those who gamble are no more likely to take health or ethical risks etc.), and that findings that women are more risk averse also apply to dozens of other populations in society whom also face discrimination. “ Society seemed a significantly safer place to white males than it did to all other groups, including nonwhite men.” It is very difficult to objectively make a case that this T-Rex “hyper male” persona exists within the male population, and is not an extrapolation that blends many historical time periods and cultures into something fictional.“ These very open-ended outcomes would be more easily achieved by a developmental pathway that runs from sex to socialization to the brain (and hormones, as we’ll come to in a later chapter), rather than by an inflexible direct path from sex to brain.”Arguments for the essential, and probable, role of environment in human behaviour over hard-wired genetic determinism is skilfully and logically made. Queer identities are not the main focus of this book but are dealt with using sensitivity and intelligence. “If most of us were intersex in some way or another, the ubiquitous question, “Is it a boy or a girl?” wouldn’t be so compelling. And if the shape of our external genitalia fell on a continuum, with the majority of people in an ambiguous midrange shape, it’s an interesting question whether our sex would play such a key role in how we present ourselves to the world.” I hope to see future writing from her which might expand some of these tantalising hints.Fine’s treatment of the animal literature of sex differences is droll, thorough, and erudite. “ The development of testes from an “androgynous” gonad is an active, gene-directed process, but in the absence of the potent, male SRY gene, ovarian tissue just… happens, as the default?” She reveals amazingly underpublicized results. For example, male rats will care for young if there is no female in the cage to do it for them, showing that they have all the same innate behavioural tools as females. Also, chemically castrated macaques of high social status do not lose their power, aggression, or mating opportunities in the absence of testosterone. In many animals, including fish with whopping testicles, social status trusts blood testosterone levels and scientists are beginning to believe that hormones respond to social heirarchies, rather than a linear system the other way round. ““Social events regulate gonadal events.” Or to put it another way, just in case the significance of this sailed past unnoticed, cichlid testes are a social construction.” Even differences in hypocampal dendrites between the sexes are so condition-specific that it is impossible to even ascribe a “male” or “female” profile. “In other words, brief stress exposure reverses the “sex difference” for that particular brain characteristic.” Is being stressed more truly “male” than being relaxed, and which types of being stressed? Overall, this is a scholarly criticism of the often oversimplified debate surrounding sex/gender associated anatomy and the erroneous leap that this represents thinking. I could not fault the science or the writing. I’m just sad that it’s finished now.“Science writer and behavioural endocrinologist Richard Francis coined the term “Testosterone Rex” to poke fun at the mistaken conception of testosterone as a “super-actor”—the “plenipotent executor of selection’s demands” that simply “takes care of everything.””"
276,0393355489,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5847899-patrick,3,"When I picked this up, I thought this book might be about to try to persuade me that there are no innate differences between men and women beyond those that are self-evident, and that the differences we think might exist are all merely the result of social conditioning. And that is not actually what this book claims - it is, after all  nature and nurture but still...The book demolishes a particular cartoon 'biological essentialist' version of sex differences, and there probably are those who do actually subscribe to such a view (though I doubt any of them would pick this book up) but it did feel like it was skewering a straw man. All of which is fine, but very often, Fine seems to leave the balance to the footnotes. And while I'm in no way expert enough to offer my own informed view, I got the impression that she was sometimes being very deliberately selective in the studies she refers to in order to strengthen her pre-existing point of view ('policy-based evidence making as a long-time colleague put it, albeit in a very different context).For example, she does quite a good job of rubbishing the idea that all men are driven on some level by a desire to obtain a harem, but then I think she pushes the argument too far in trying to imply, without ever quite saying it, that there are no real differences between (the average) men and women's attitudes to casual sex at all. The fact that she cites in support a study by Teela Sanders about the fact that men who visit prostitutes very often go back to the same person over and over, but never stops to look at what I'd regard as the more fundamental question of why almost all prostitution is servicing the desires of male clients is just one example. And it turns out that the stuff she has at the beginning about fruit flies' mating behaviours is also a fairly selective version of the wider evidence on the topic (though I had to google that to find it out).As a whole, the book seemed uneven in that a great deal of space is given to how we are shaped by our social environment, and even how it can shape our very biology, but questions of how biology might shape the social world we construct are not really given much of an airing.All the same, I thought there was a fair amount of interest to found here: For example, the chapter on risk-taking, examining in more detail the cliched idea that men tend to take more risk than women was a quite illuminating exploration of what we actually mean by 'risk taking'. The idea, in particular that the concept had been very narrowly defined by those investigating risk-taking differences between the sexes to look specifically at a particular kind of physical risk and that this could be used to build a narrative that the 2008 (and presumably the 1929) financial crash was caused by the testosterone levels of (mainly male) city traders she shows to be a rather simplistic reading of the evidence. She also does quite a good job of questioning the validity of experiments exploring risk-taking or gambling behaviours in artificial environments where absolutely nothing is truly at stake.So worth a read, but not the comprehensive demolition of the idea that there are biologically determined differences between the average man and the average woman that the author sometimes seems to have set out to write."

Fine attempts to shine her light on common conceptions of gender based on outdated scientific views. While some sections were a little too sciencey (which is, of course, unsurprising!), she generally manages to use clear language to convey her argument. I felt a little more sociology might have supported the overall point even further, since gender is one of the ultimate multidisciplinary fields of this moment.I'd highly recommend this book to anyone who feels their blood boil when someone argues men are simply more likely to cheat, women are more caring because genes and 'boys will be boys'.

Not so Cordelia Fine in her new book Testosterone Rex: unmaking the myths of our gendered minds. Instead Fine leads with a scene of domestic normalcy, a family dinner where a discussion on desexing the new family pet dog moves on to taxidermy and the possibility of making the said canines testicles into a key ring. This almost deadpan start sets the scene for a witty riposte to those who insist on the testosterone myth that we, modern men and women, are fixed in an ancestral past that rewarded competitive males and caring females.Winner of the 2017 Royal Society Science Book Award, Testosterone Rex brings together evolutionary science, psychology, neuroscience and social history to move beyond old ‘nature versus nurture’ debates, and to explain ‘I think you’ll find it’s more complicated than men are from Mars and women are from Venus‘ and therefore why it’s time to unmake the tyrannical myth of Testosterone Rex. The author, Cordelia Fine, is a professor of the history and philosophy of science at the University of Melbourne. Fine’s earlier two books; A mind of its own (2006) and Delusions of gender (2010) were similarly insightful, intellectually pugnacious and drolly written. I remember being annoyed reading A mind of its own, making copious margin notes as I went - for me usually a good sign that a book has a lot to say and is challenging my existing ideas and/or sparking off new ones. Like Jonathan Swift, Fine is a writer who will “vex the world rather than divert it.” A worthy recipient of the Royal Society science book award.Fine tackles many of the classic experiments that have led to our myths around testosterone, maleness and competitiveness. One such example is a chapter long denouement of A. J. Bateman’s 1940s experiments on fruit flies and its later (1960s) elaboration by biologist Robert Trivers, which resulted in the almost universally accepted “Bateman’s principle” that males would do best (pace Darwin) by competing with other males in order to spread their cheap, mass-produced sperm among as many females as possible - while females should protect their precious eggs and be as selective as possible. Fine counters these experiments and the conclusions drawn from them, canvassing a large body of contemporary research that looks not only at the conclusions drawn, sexually reluctant females and promiscuous males, in addition underlining the biases that Bateman introduced, prejudicing his own results. All this is achieved with witty referencing to Maserati-driving boyfriends and the ever popular tails of the male Peacock.Fine then moves on to dismember the arguments that airily tie together sexual selection, evolutionary biology and consumer behaviour such as a Maserati -driving male giving a pair of Bulgari sunglasses as a male flaunting their resources. Fine asserts that for humans sexuality is far more than for reproduction. Reminding us: humans routinely engage in sexual pairings and acts, that not only often don’t - but actually can’t - lead to pregnancy. There are also many human sexual activities, like touching, kissing, and oral sex that likewise have no reproductive potential.The idea that we we have only to peel away the veneer of culture, learning, habit, fantasy and the true (natural) sexual being will emerge is pseudoscience - it is profoundly mistaken.Having demolished the past Rex myths Fine then proceeds to wittily tackle the current testosterone myths. If you were wondering Why can’t a woman be more like a man? or Are males (naturally) more risk-taking? Will I become a monstrous sexual predator if I increase the testosterone in my bloodstream? or If the Lehman brothers were sisters would we have had the recent global financial crisis? then read Testosterone Rex.Fine concludes with a grand challenge. Words are nice but often deeds are better - become less polite and more disruptive. Sexual equality is more than a lovely idea in principle. The science, Fine reveals, of Testosterone Rex does not block the path to a better place - it is our complacency in ‘waiting’ patiently for an evolutionary change to occur. Thinking that men are from Mars and women are from Venus is about our values not science.This review was first posted here: http://dragonlaughing.tumblr.com/post... "

“So what happens when a scientist, under controlled laboratory conditions, simulates a first-wave feminist rodent movement by placing males in cages with pups but no females? Before too long you will see the male “mothering” the infant, in much the same way that females do. Feminism: 1. Sexual selection: nil.”
 Delusions of Gender: How Our Minds, Society, and Neurosexism Create Difference is one of my favorite psychology/science books of all-time: it’s funny, it’s clever, and it’s devastatingly sharp in cutting away the illusionist veil that many people still pretend hangs over the divide between boys and girls.So when its scientific successor,  Testosterone Rex: Myths of Sex, Science, and Society, came out, I knew I had to get my hands on it as soon as possible. And, as expected, it’s as good as the first – though I have to admit I enjoyed it slightly less because I’m not as hardcore into biology and hormones as I am into psychology. But that’s purely a personal preference.In this book, psychologist and researcher  Cordelia Fine takes a good, hard look at the influence of the hormone testosterone on humans and gender – effectively separating its presumed influence, and its scientific and biological influence. Just as in her previous book, she picks apart both research and popular or common opinion, giving us readers a critical overview of what testosterone does do and what it doesn’t. (Or what we might simply assume it to do rather than what it actually does.)I’ve heard people accuse Fine of cherry picking scientific data and not being able to explain away certain discrepancies in gender – such as higher statistics for men in terms of crime and rape – with her explanations and expositions of the workings of testosterone.I respectfully disagree. What Fine shows us with this book is that causal relations cannot just be applied to any and all things without evidence, or without critically examining just what such a causal relation might imply. An example of this would be, “If men are statistically more likely to commit a crime than women, then it must be due to testosterone, because that marks the main/biggest biological difference between men and women!”.I can see how someone could arrive at such a conclusion, but: in human nature, combining both psychology and biology, it’s almost impossible to subscribe an effect to one single variable (in this case, subscribing higher crime rates in men to testosterone). Especially with hormones, the interaction of a hormone with its host and that host’s direct environment can have a huge effect on the workings of said hormone.Not to mention that a variable might play a much smaller role than initially expected.Fine dives into both of these lines of thoughts (complex interaction versus actual role) into this book, which leads to a bunch of very interesting reinterpretations of existing research. She steps outside of the simple paradigm that says, “X makes Y happen” and looks at what exactly constitutes X, what influences both X and Y, and is it actually true that X makes Y happen?It’s a solid, well-researched book that doesn’t shy away from using field jargon (so be warned if you’re not fully at home in psychology/biology research) and forces its readers to look at common assumptions in a different way. Even as a fellow psychologist, it taught me a lot, and gave me plenty of insights to ponder upon.It’s also funny and wittily written, which makes it a more pleasant read throughout the drier research material. (Though doubtlessly some will find Fine’s references to feminism and jokes about sexism offensive.)"
282,0393355489,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3611893-dearbhla,5,"I read Fine's Delusions of Gender a few years ago and really enjoyed it, so when I saw she had another one coming out I knew I had to order it. It is just as good as Delusions, and I would recommend it to anyone to read.

In this book Fine takes a look at testosterone and asks is it really the reason behind financial crisis, risk taking, and the differences between the sexes. the short answer is no. The slightly longer, but still short version is that it has an important role to play but it is equally as important as all other hormones in the human body. For more go read the book, it is fascinating, interesting, funny and very readable. Fine has a great style. She weaves personal anecdotes in with scientific studies as well as her own speculation. She counters arguments with facts and figures, but never in a dry and boring way.It is also a most quotable book, if you follow me on tumblr you may have noticed, if not click here for a selection and if that doesn't prompt you to think about trying this book I don't know what will.One of my very favourite lines is Social events regulate gonadal events. I think it should be my new motto.But apart from the writing style what she says in the book is important. She never says that there aren't differences between men and women, but she emphasizes that we cannot accurately tell what is causing those differences. From the moment we are born we are influenced by both genes and environment, and sometimes environment has a greater influence. Never mind the fact that when you average everything out there are more differences between men (or women) than between the sexes. Also, sex is a spectrum, not an either or. Stereotypes and hardline ""men are like this"" views do nobody any good.People are people, and people are different to people in many many ways. And society and experience do a lot to shape people. If you think about the idea behind ""privilege"" for example you can see that influences how people of differing backgrounds see and act. It isn't what you were born with, it is how society around you that shapes what you were born with.I've skimmed a few of the negative reviews on Goodreads and many of them seem to say ""I don't agree with this so it is wrong"" and some say that Fine wants to proclaim that there are no differences between men and women. Well, I've read the book and she makes it perfectly clear that there are differences, both in humans and in other species, what she is looking at is how innate those differences are and can they be altered? Also across the whole species are the differences really there. And in some cases she argues that, yes, they are. In others no, the variables even out across a large sample. Fine also points to numerous studies that show that just because X has been the way for so long, it doesn't mean it can't ever be altered.Of course I came to the book on her side, so maybe I'm just agreeing with her because it supports my view of the world. I'm not a scientist and am not about to go through hundreds of studies in an attempt to prove myself wrong. However I have skimmed through some of those ""men are from mars"" type books, you know the sort that try to argue that all relationship differences exist because men are like this while women are like that, and in most cases I don't identify with the version of womanhood that they portray. So maybe I'm just an outlier, or maybe there is more to being a person than what is between your legs."

Read my GR friend Trevor's review, it says it all:https://www.goodreads.com/review/show...Just to add, it is interesting what this book says about one of the acrimonious debates in feminism - which I'll crassly summarise as smash the patriarchy vs lean in. Lean In: Women, Work, and the Will to Lead being Sheryl Sandberg's book which encourages women to work within the system but to much more aggressively put themselves forward and refuse to be ignored/underpaid/touched up etc. Fine doesn't mention the book but she does suggest the Lean In approach, as well as not only ignoring and leaving intact the structural barriers that exclude women, may also simply not work. She quotes one study which found that both female and male graduates of high-powered MBA courses were equally forthright in negotiating the pay package when they landed their first job. But guess what? Women's demands were met less often than men's. Because Fine's book is about hormones, her point is that it's not hormones that make men more aggressive in negotiating etc. It could just be, that after being knocked back again and again, maybe you just give up? The cost/benefit analysis is going to be different.I'm not going to downgrade my star rating because of the chirpy and not funny ""this is a science book but don't worry it's accessible"" stuff, which I imagine is a feature of a lot of popular science writing (I haven't read much, I'm just guessing).

Speculation is always allowed and even fruitful but there needs to be a clear delineation between fact and what has been surmised from that (this was starkly clear in the chapter regarding hormones and I was disappointed to find that the author spent an inordinate amount of time on testosterone and none on estrogen). I also felt that the book suffered from uneven handling of the many animal studies; sometimes they were used to show that humans are different and we can't use the results from those studies to compare to humans.....and then when the results of the studies aligned with an idea that the author liked then suddenly the results of those studies were extrapolated to humans as well. This hearkens back to the old saying - ""when you're a hammer everything looks like a nail""."

Fine discusses quite a variety of ways that the sexes are purportedly distinct, and argues that under scrutiny we discover that they are actually not so different. Many of the studies she cites to back these views up are very interesting, and she presents most of the topics in a very accessible way.That said, at times it seemed like she might have been arguing against a strawman. For example, at the beginning of one chapter Fine notes one quote by David Schmitt, who states that male humans have the ability to lend their sperm in the conception of 100 offspring within a single month by mating with many (100) different women. She then spends a large section of that chapter demonstrating how implausible this is. But what's really important is not whether male humans could produce 100 offspring a month, but merely whether they could consistently produce a significantly higher amount of offspring by acting polygynously than could female humans. This would suggest that male polygyny could be adaptive and thus that the tendency for men to act polygynously could be an adaptation. Of course it is implausible that men could produce 100 offspring in a month. But could they produce 1 a month? 2? 5? Fine does state afterwards that the males of some tribes whose behaviour probably resembles that of humans over much of our evolutionary history are expected to produce a maximum of 12-16 children, and women of those tribes 9-12. This suggests that a strategy of male polygyny would not be significantly more adaptive than monogamy, so there probably would not be an adaptation for male polygyny. I would have much preferred detailed examination of Fine's latter claim regarding the maximum offspring able to be produced by men in tribes that purportedly resemble humans throughout much of our evolutionary history. It seems to me that such discussion would be more relevant to serious debates about the adaptiveness of male polygyny. However, I get the impression that there are people who take serious, hardline approaches that are very similar to the ones Fine argues against in Testosterone Rex. Perhaps these people do believe that male humans can really produce 100 offspring a month, or at least some similarly absurdly high number. If that's the case, then I see the merit of Fine's discussion of the unlikelihood of men fathering 100 children a month. Of course, this is just one section among a larger book, and much of the book was not similarly frustrating. To summarise: much of the book was interesting; some parts seemed to be arguing against strawmen, but; it may be that these arguments are actually not strawmen (depending on the views of Fine's dialectical partners). In order to determine whether Fine successfully and absolutely defeats all aspects of the Testosterone Rex belief system I will have to read more about the differences (or lack thereof) between the sexes. Thanks to Cordelia Fine's interesting explication of and argumentation regarding these topics, I plan on undertaking such further education."
293,0393355489,http://goodreads.com/user/show/117566-mauri,3,"I forgot how funny Fine is - she writes in a tightly controlled, ""isn't it amusing how..."" sort of manner that both makes you laugh and realize that she is quite ticked off (and you should be too).In this, Fine tackles research about gender and sex, with a focus on knocking back a lot of the ""boys will be boys"" beliefs society holds dear.For example: male promiscuity. A man can impregnate hundreds of women in the time it takes a woman to gestate and bear one child, which she is usually bound to for years while that same man skips merrily from town to town. Therefore it makes sense that men want sex all the time and women don't. It's reproductively advantageous, duh.Fine merrily pokes holes in all of this. First, what women? Setting aside the number of women within a day's walk of the average caveman, Neolithic farmer, or 1800s city dweller, even in today's jet-setting world how many women are lining up to have sex with an endless line-up of horny men? Not just sex, but baby-making sex? And how many of those women are actually fertile at a given point of time? And while everyone can think of a story they heard about someone getting pregnant off a one night stand, I bet many more can think of couples taking months to conceive. Turns out this reproductive strategy may have only worked out for Genghis Khan and a few other despotic men throughout history, and, Fine points out, maybe that says more about despots than it does about men? In short, a lot of looking at scientific studies done on sex and gender that point out that there maybe? Might have? been a bit of bias going on. Less tightly constructed than Delusions of Gender: How Our Minds, Society, and Neurosexism Create Difference, Fine does meander a bit, but accessible to people whose eyes crossed a bit trying to read Women's Work, Men's Property: The Origins of Gender and Class. (Mine.)"
294,0393355489,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1348540-charlie,3,"Cordelia Fine sets up a well-known stalking horse in the shape of Testosterone Rex the king of hormones with a view to pulling him down and showing him to be a meaningless construct. She uses scientific studies as part of the technique for pulling him down, but also an appeal to ‘our values’. The Testosterone Rex construct which she pulls apart is the idea that boys will be boys, that the presence of testosterone makes men into naturally promiscuous hunters, risk takers and show-offs while the lack of it makes women into careful carers and nurturers. Fine needs to state her T Rex construct at the start of the book in order for the reader to know what she will be arguing against, however, I did not find that she made it clear until afterwards that this was not actually her view of the world. As a result, I nearly put the book down and left it before she was really ready to start. I found a lot of the science interesting, but I was somewhat sad that there was not more evidence for a wider range of elements to the story. The science seemed to be very strongly focussed around the risk-taking area. I guess this is the easiest part of the story to test and verify, but I would personally have liked a bit more stress on other areas too.The book states on the cover that it is a science book prize winner. It does not say it is also a feminist book. I am happy to read either or both kinds of book, but I picked this one up expecting something more dispassionate. The Author is however very passionate, she has a very definite agenda. She makes a good case for it with the evidence she uses, but as a scientist, that passion means that I have to wonder if the evidence she uses is cherry picked to make a point or not. I find that doubt tarnishes some apparently very good, interesting science for me. I would have preferred the science and the passion in two separate books."
295,0393355489,http://goodreads.com/user/show/17594936-colin,4,"I always find it hard to evaluate books like this. There are so many studies into human nature, human behaviour, sex differences, and for me, they raise more questions than they answer. How was that test administered? Were the men and women in the test into risk appetite all the same age? How was the question phrased? I invariably find myself doubting the scientific method, and then in the absence of reliable data points, measuring the writer's interpretation against my own experience. But of course that just means I'm layering my own bias on top of the writer's bias, which in turn is overlaid on the experimenter's experimental design. The result is a superficially plausible narrative, which I know will be contradicted by the next book I read on the same topic.Cordelia Fine does a good job of trying to combat the kinds of folk narrative explanations that thrive in all this confusion. She starts off with one of the hoariest of all - the idea that men have evolved to be unfaithful while women have evolved to be monogamous nest builders. This is one of the best known examples of sociobiology being drafted in to support a conclusion you know the researcher had in mind from the start and wanted to ""prove"". Fine's iconoclasm in taking aim at it seems admirable. She also takes care to present her evidence carefully, showing balanced results and not just trying to claim all the evidence points to one inevitable conclusion. This in marked contrast to - for example - Jordan Peterson who is forever pointing at stuff that happens in nature and implying that we just have to accept that the status quo is here to stay and resistance is futile. Give me a Cordelia Fine over a Jordan Peterson any day of the week. And she won't even tell me to tidy my room. I didn't find my hackles raising at any point, and although she editorialises strenuously on the meaning of the results, she's not trying to press the science into service or (as far as I can tell) manipulate the facts. Fair enough.The general gist is that there are differences between the sexes in some ways but that there was so much social conditioning overlaid on top of that that most of what we think of as immutable human nature can be stripped back if we, as a society, choose to do so. I think I'd put myself a little further towards the Stephen Pinker end of the spectrum but again, that's just me, maybe overlaying what I see around me, how I think and how women I know seem to think, how our daughter developed in what we thought was a fairly stereotype-free household... So it's a hit and miss, subjective interpretation of the facts but can any of us bring any better expertise to bear to judge between the competing claims of the people who have looked inside our brains and reckon they know what they've found there? Probably not."

Risk-taking, competitiveness, ability, even childhood toy preference. Cordelia Fine somewhat exasperatedly follows up with crucial context—“the rest of the story,” if you will: yes, but this study didn’t consider corticoid levels; yes, but that other study neglected such-and-such findings; and most crucially yes, but it’s staggeringly difficult to isolate this effect from social and cultural factors. Nevertheless, she persiidentifies clever ways in which these issues have been studied, and the gist is: context matters. A lot.Science requires reproducibility. Reproducible results are best obtained when there are a small number of variables—hard to achieve with something as richly messy as a human life. Once one compensates for the factors overlooked in much research, plus publication bias, plus just plain built-in human bias, few effects survive scrutiny. Yes, we’re different—deliciously so, in my view!—but not in any way that affects ability. Not even in the slightest bit.Fine writes with a sardonic bite that worked well to start with but grew tiresome. I was also highly disappointed in her somewhat off-context quoting of Robert Sapolsky—a hero of mine—and her failure to acknowledge his groundbreaking work decades ago in breaking down testosterone myths. And, dear FSM, what has happened to proofreading? Much as I want to grant four stars, much as I think this is important work that needs to be read, I can only justify three. (Goodreads, could we have fractional stars please?)On a side note, I find myself fortunate to have read this just before and just after the 2018 Women’s March where I was surrounded by thousands of strong, powerful, capable human beings of all genders and colors, many of whom are living under the culturally-imposed “oh, you just aren’t able to do these sorts of things.” All of whom categorically reject that, as does Fine and as do I and, I trust, you. #resist.And on another side note: if you’re interested in these sorts of gender issues, I urge you to listen to this episode of the Hidden Brain podcast in which two progressive parents attempt to raise their children free of gender stereotypes and much loveliness ensues."

This book, cleverly written, does an outstanding job of decimating stereotypical beliefs that boys are boys and girls are girls because of innate, fixed differences. I used to think men were more prone to risk taking than women. It turns out that this isn’t true, for a few reasons! For example:1) risk taking studies have methodological flaws. For example, these studies typically focus on activities that are considered to be male-expertise. Different results are found if you consider female-expertise activities. Would you consider baking a very difficult soufflé for a dinner party? 2) risk taking studies ACTUALLY find that the most high-status people are most likely to take risks. In matrilineal society is women. In western society it is WHITE men followed by women and minorities. Etc.3) the actual risk to women of “risky” events proposed in these studies is MUCH HIGHER than the actual risk to men. Consider: would you go to the bus station at 11 PM for a chance to pick up $100? For whom is that obviously more risky- a 5’10” man or a 5’2” woman? Obviously women need the cash reward to be higher because they are literally facing MORE RISK. Change the situation so men are facing more risk, and the answers change.The book gives a careful data based treatment to many stereotypical beliefs, overturning widely held views about the impact of biological sex and sex hormones on the brain. THANK YOU CORDELIA FINE!!! "
298,0393355489,http://goodreads.com/user/show/28668057-jasmine,3,"Cordelia Fine's Delusions of Gender was one of my favorite reads of the year, and so I was excited to pick up this sequel-in-spirit.It started out strong, combining Fine's delightful dry wit with a thorough review/critique of seminal works in the ""male/testestosterone = high risk/high reward = spray & pray mating strategy"" field. She then continued with a review of the many different ways male and female creatures compete for reproductive success. Although while I found this part interesting, I ultimately found tidbits like the two opposite mating strategies of the horned dung beetle to be less useful in my day-to-day experience of the world than the aspects of gender and science described in Delusions of Gender. The final portion I found to be a bit more unfocused. I found myself a little uncertain about what Fine or anyone else in the field takes home from experiments on risk versus reward between men and women. In this portion of the book particularly, she often repeated parts of Delusions of Gender - which left me feeling that perhaps this whole book could have been an extra set of chapters in the earlier volume rather than a stand-alone book.Still, I overall enjoyed the book, and would probably still read another book written by Fine - but I would recommend Delusions of Gender and not this one, as a starting point."
299,0393355489,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4239658-karen-chung,3,"This book was a fairly interesting, quick read, but I ended up convinced that testosterone is still the main source of male-female differences. The book made a lot of good points about how environment and social conditions can adjust the concentration of testosterone in an individual, and how circumstances can bring out ""atypical"" behavior relative to the usual gender stereotypes, such as gentle, nurturing behavior in males. But as I see it, testosterone is still at the core of and key to competitiveness, aggression, and ambition in humans (and probably other animals as well). Women have some too, just not as much, and I believe there is still a strong correlation between testosterone level and ambition and related traits in women. I highly recommend listening to this podcast in conjunction with this book:This American Life: Testosteronehttps://www.thisamericanlife.org/220/...Transcript:https://www.thisamericanlife.org/220/...It left a deep impression on me, and also adds a lot to what you will read in this book should you decide to give it a try."
