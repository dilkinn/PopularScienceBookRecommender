0,1439108277,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1394928-laura,4,"This man proves that teachers make a difference. That a good teacher can make anyone care about his topic. I loved math in school, but when I got to calculus, for some reason, I just couldn't understand it. And so I decided to skip physics altogether. However, I really wanted to read the book Einstein: His Life and Universe, because I think its author, Walter Isaacson, is a genius. It seemed like the perfect marriage of author and subject! But I have never liked science, as it was taught in school. Too much memorization, not enough excitement. And in high school, bad teachers. Meanies! I felt like I needed some type of physics background to understand Einstein.Because of Professor Lewin, I am now fascinated by science. I never thought this could happen, but his picture on the cover of the book had me questioning my preconceived notions. The audiobook was also available at one of the local libraries, so I thought I'd take a chance. I'm so glad I did. He quite simply loves physics, and his enthusiasm and passion is contagious.Walter Isaacson, with his book Benjamin Franklin: An American Life, showed me that history can be the opposite of dull if one finds the right book. This can be that book for you if you think physics is boring. Lewin blew my mind in the first chapter, as he explained in real terms the vastness of the universe. He explores stars, the magic of a straw, rainbows (in some depth), and the physics behind musical instruments, plus black holes, X-rays, and much more. He provides examples that put the ""wow"" back in to science, making abstract concepts concrete, and real. I had so many light bulb moments. To really appreciate this man's gift, you must see him in the classroom. Thanks to MIT's Open Courseware, you can. Here is the link to the list of lectures for his course titled ""Physics I: Classical Mechanics"".http://ocw.mit.edu/courses/physics/8-...I promise you, you won't be bored. I'll never forget this book or its author."
1,1439108277,http://goodreads.com/user/show/21177142-roger,3,"Walter Lewin was a professor of physics at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) until his retirement in 2009 and was well known for his popular lectures on physics which appeared on the MIT OpenCourseWare website - that is until MIT indefinitely suspended access to Lewin's courses on OpenCourseWare in late 2014 ""after its investigation of a serious matter"" (to quote the message that now appears on the OpenCourseWare website when you click on some of the links in Lewin's book). As I don't know the outcome the investigations I will restrict myself here to this specific comment from the website but those intrigued as to what this serious matter was are free to search online.The book is a strange one, both in terms of its contents and its style of writing. The first nine chapters address a few selected areas of physics, such as bodies in motion, electricity, magnetism, rainbows, conservation of energy, but leave many other areas untouched; the final six chapters focus on the author's main area of research, namely x-ray astronomy. Undoubtedly, the book is unbalanced in terms of what it covers and doesn't cover. However, this is not so much a book that attempts to explain physics, but rather a book that explains how Lewin taught physics. Thus the book provides a platform, especially in the earlier chapters, for Lewin to describe some of the bizarre demonstrations he would perform in front of students, one in particular which appeared quite dangerous although his faith in the reproducibility of physics ensured his safety. The style of writing was not to my liking. I'm not sure who he was expecting to read the book but to my mind he comes across as somewhat patronising, assuming perhaps that his readers know nothing of physics. In reality, I suspect most readers are quite clued up on the subject, and are the reading the book largely to see how Lewin approached the subject. Nevertheless, his passion and energy for both physics and education come across in abundance and it is easy to see why he had such a good reputation as a teacher."

What counts is not what you cover, but what you uncover.""."
3,1439108277,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3744803-chris,4,"I would love to have taken one of Walter Lewin's classes. His teaching style is fun and energetic, and he seems to love to get his students involved in his experiments. The first part of the book is a series of 20 to 30 minute segments on various topics about the physics of everyday things. The topics range from how airplanes fly to the maximum depth a snorkler can handle and why to how we measure the distances of stars. The second half of the books discusses his own career in research using x-ray telescopes. This part is not quite as fun as the first half, but still worth a read.Note that I listened to the audio version of this book, and I had to give it my full attention, or else I wasn't able to absorb everything he was saying. I thoroughly enjoyed listening and would recommend it to anyone who has a curiosity about nature and why things work the way they do."
4,1439108277,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5994781,5,"I might be too excited about this book; read with a grain of salt. If there’s an Oscar for hilariously explaining the world through physics to the layperson, ًWalter Lewin should get two. Not that I grasped everything, several things went over my head no doubt, but I enjoyed reading about them because he doesn’t take himself too seriously (I hate people who do). Added bonus: there’s the littlest amount of math here, which is great because I’m allergic. It’s called dyscalculia. That basically means I can’t handle numbers bigger than five. So if someone like me could enjoy this book, then it must be amazing!"

6,1439108277,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9992918-anne-swartjes,4,"When I saw the Dutch ratings on this book (hardly 1 star) I was utterly shocked. I had heard so many great stories about Walter Lewin, appearing in a very well-known Dutch TV-show and captivating thousands of ears of interest. I, unfortunately, haven't yet had the opportunity to experience one of his lectures, but I certainly will do some research soon. I heard that this man did a magnificent job on making serious physics understandable for less-but-still-genius-human-beings like you and me (I get cheesy every now and then) and that's why I, as someone who loves science but doesn't have all that much of a genius mind, bought the book the moment I saw it in the bookstore (also because it was father's day and my father said this man is truly genius, literally and figuratively). One of the only reasons why I didn't rate this book five stars, is because I read the Dutch translated version and sometimes that was a bit confusing. From the moment I started reading this book I was captivated by his easy way of writing and I was able to flow right into the wonders of science and experience them myself. What I particularly loved about this book was Lewin's enthusiasm and his explicit love for science he is constantly trying to give to his readers, as a gift. Because he's so enthusiastic about science, you get enthusiastic too, automatically. An other thing that I admired was how Lewin managed to explain the simple wonders we see every day, but most of us do not pay attention anymore because we take them for granted. Lewin explains why the sky is blue, why clouds are white, why rainbows are curved and how to spot them in an efficient way, he teaches us about black holes, about gravity, about energy and much more, all the interesting parts of physics (as far as I can tell) are explained in a rather simple way. I do have to admit that I followed physics classes for five years in High School, so I can only say that I had some background knowledge on physics before reading this book, that's why I could skip some parts of it. In the end though, Lewin is starting to lose its pace and he converts to a faster way of explaining, which turns out to be quite confusing, consequently I haven't understood all of his last few chapters. I would definitely recommend this book for people whose interests are with science (even if it's just a little bit) and want to learn about the simple wonders of the world and the universe, finding them quite complex when reading about them. Discover the mysteries and wonders of science and let Lewin take you on his tour through the universe."
7,1439108277,http://goodreads.com/user/show/32069991-hari-kumar,5,"This book was brought accidentally to me by my brother. For the Love of Physics is one of my most favorite and loving science books of all time. It tells about the lives of both the Physics and Proff.Lewin. Dr.Lewin has taught theworld to look through the equations which many teachers and professors failed to do (If they at least knew it could be done, like my Physics teachers), and Proff.Lewin had made them a bunch of criminals (for teaching bad). It has a great and astonishing explanation from the atom's core to the giant black holes in our elegant universe, with a mix of many stories of the development of mankind in this field of Physics."
8,1439108277,http://goodreads.com/user/show/62110496-r-ramachandran,5,"This book is not intended to teach physics to those who have studied physics and to those who pursue that subject professionally. To those who have forgotten their physics lessons, this will be a great recaller. It brings back all the pleasures that got lost in all the years after the college days.To those who still view the world and the life there in, in a way learned to look in their old physics classes, though not living by physics, this book will help clear any fog they collected on the way. For me it was like a newly tested pair of reading glasses which brought in to focus many blurred images. A wonderful book written with passion."
9,1439108277,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2105523-bob-nichols,3,"Interesting tidbits from this book:Lewin believes that Newton is the greatest physicist of all time (Einstein is next) because “his discoveries were so fundamental and so diverse.”Though the universe’s age is estimated to be “about” 13.7 billion years old, Lewin writes that “the edge of the observable universe is about 47 billion light-years away from us in every direction.” This is because space has “expanded enormously since the big bang,” noting Hubble’s law (“the velocity at which galaxies move away from us is directly proportional to their distance from us. The farther away a galaxy is, the faster it is racing away.”)Lewin clarifies the somewhat confusing free fall terminology: “Free fall is when the force acting upon you is exclusively gravitational, and no other forces act on you.” The author writes that less that 20% of an airplane’s lift due to the shape of the wing where the air passing above the shaped wing speeds up relative to the air passing underneath. (Bernoulli’s principle). Reactive lift accounts for the rest (80% or greater). It is named for Newton’s third law. It occurs when air, “moving from the front of the wing to the back, is pushed downward by the wing. That’s the ‘action.’ That action must be met by an equal reaction of air pushing upward, so there is upward lift on the wing.” Controlling reaction lift is tricky, he states, especially at takeoffs and landings.“Interstellar and intergalactic space,” Lewin writes, “are millions of times closer to a vacuum than the best vacuum we can make on Earth.” But, even so, space is not empty. Matter that floats “around in space has…identifiable characteristics,” which is plasma (ionized gasses – charged particles “such as hydrogen nuclei [protons] and electrons-of widely varying density.”) Lewin goes on the state that “more than 99.9 percent of all observable matter in the universe is plasma.” On a night flight from the northeastern U.S. to Europe, sit on the left side of the airplane to see the aurora Borealis (northern lights – where the sun’s charged particles (solar wind) are directed into our atmosphere at the magnetic poles.“The temperature at the core of our own sun…produces energy at a rate equivalent to more than a billion hydrogen bombs per second.” In a supernova core collapse, “the pressure in the core can no longer hold out against the powerful pressure due to gravity, and the core collapses onto itself, causing an outward supernova explosion….The core collapses in milliseconds, and the matter falling in -- it actually races in at fantastic speeds, nearly a quarter the speed of light – raises the temperature inside to …about ten thousand times hotter than the core of our Sun.” Lewin also writes that “a core-collapse supernova emits two hundred times the energy that our sun has produced in the past 5 billion years, and all that energy is released in roughly 1 second—and 99 percent comes out in neutrinos!”After some supernova core collapses, neutron stars are formed as remnants, with mass 1.4 times the sun’s tightly compacted into a city size space, and that “a teaspoon of neutron matter would weigh 100 million tons on Earth.” The neutron star in the Crab Nebula rotates 30 times a second; the fastest known neutron star rotates at 716 times per second. After other supernova core collapses, a black hole is formed. At the center of a black hole lies a singularity, “a point with zero volume and infinite density.”A third of the stars in the night sky are actually binary stars (“binaries”). Sirius, “the brightest star in the sky,” is a “binary system made up of two stars known as Sirius A and Sirius B.” The Earth and the Moon are a binary system. “If you draw a line from the center of the Earth to the center of the Moon, there is a point on that line where the gravitational force toward the Moon is equal but opposite to the gravitational force toward the Earth.” What’s interesting about this statement is that “relative intensity” beyond any exact balance point seems inherent to gravitational and electromagnetic forces.Lewin writes that gravity distorts the fabric of spacetime, “pushing bodies into orbit through geometry.” It’s interesting that he uses “pushing” as opposed to the pulling of gravity’s attractive force.

They start studying physics, their quest to understanding the language of the universe.

They're so busy conversing in the language of the universe that they forget about their own language. They forget to look around and see what the universe is telling them. Not just writing a bunch of equations that make no sense to anyone.My journey has just been like that, and I thank Professor Lewin for re-opening that eye I had lost. The eye to see the beauty of the universe. The eye to see the reality hidden beneath the abstract mathematical equations.A very highly recommended book for anyone interested in physics. :)"

He teaches physics by holding experiments in class, and backs them up with formulas. He teaches not to cover the details in physics, but to uncover the beauty of the world thru physics. Check out his experiments on YouTube, they are actually cool. The last quarter of the book went into too much technical details on his area of expertise: X-Ray - that was really torturous to get thru. "

15,1439108277,http://goodreads.com/user/show/29931726-joel,4,"The author was deeply involved in X-ray astronomy research in the 1970s, and his narrative of his experiences is really fascinating. A few of the earlier chapters are a bit basic in terms of the physics concepts he covers (conservation of energy, Faraday’s law, etc.), but in the later chapters, he tells the story of how the field of X-ray astronomy grew, and in personal involvement. He talks a lot about Cyg X-1 and even mentions Tom Bolton and his discovery of the black hole at the Dunlop Observatory right here in Toronto (and Stephen Hawking’s bet!). There's also a good deal about his personal stories, like surviving the Holocaust and his enamoration with art.I found the book really interesting and entertaining – and not what I expected; I thought it would be a pretty basic introduction to first-year undergrad physics and his MIT course, but was pleasantly surprised that he talks a lot about his personal experiences as a physicist/astronomer at a very exciting time. There are some quite amazing stories in there."

How nice of him to continue touching so many lives and inspiring people to love Physics. Of course, I also love it. After all, I'm a physicist too. "

19,1439108277,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3265556-converse,4," Walter Lewin is a professor of physics at MIT, where he teaches several of the introductory physics courses. These courses, which are available on the web at http://ocw.mit.edu/index.htm, are apparently very popular. I can't vouch for them, as I haven't looked at any of them yet. I can say that the book is a nice blend of popular science and memoir. The book was written with a co-author, Warren Goldstein, who is a professor of history at the University of Hartford.   The book begins by explaining how Lewin, who was born in the Netherlands a few years before the beginning of the Second World War, came to work at MIT. His boyhood was marred by the German invasion of the Netherlands and the subsequent murder of several of Lewin's Jewish relatives (on his father's side) by the Nazi's and the temporary disappearance of his father into hiding. After graduate school in the Netherlands, his expertise with regard to measurements of gamma rays from radioactive materials got him an invitation to work at MIT where a group investiating astronomical sources of X-rays thought that his skills would be useful in this new arena. In this early part of the book the authors show their skill at blending both an explanation of physics (what is radioactivity? what are gamma rays) with biographical material in way that enhances both, rather than leading to jarring transitions. The next several chapters then focus more on physics topcs physics topics, such as the laws of motion, gravity, electricity, magnetism, with some relativity and quantum mechanics discussed as needed. The topics are covered mainly at a qualitative level, with few equations. I think that readers who are unfamilar with these topics would gain a good start on a qualitative understanding of these topics. The discussions of the classroom demonstrations that Lewin uses at MIT helps to make the concepts more easily understood. There are frequent web links given so readers can look up examples or demonstrations of phenomena relevant to the topic at hand. There is also a short color photo insert, devoted mainly to either rainbows, one of his favorite topics, or to his research interest in X-rays produced by astronomical objects.   In the later chapters the book more resembles a memoir, as the co-authors describe Lewin's efforts to observe astronomical sources of X-rays, a goal made difficult by the generally fortunate circumstance that the earth's atmosphere absorbs most of them before they get to the surface. One way of getting a detector high enough in the atmosphere to detect X-rays is to attach it to a balloon, and Lewin did that several times in his career, a task made more difficult that the best launch site was in Australia. The co-authors do a good job emphasizing the necessity of money in experimental science, explaining why scientists spend much of their time writing grant proposals to pay for the equipment and travel, not to mention salaries for graduate students and postdoctoral associates. We then move on to discussing the interpretation of the results of X-ray observations, a subject which nicely makes use of topics discussed earlier and introduces new subjects, such as black holes and neutron stars. The latter turn out to be the main X-ray sources in the sky. The book ends with Lewin's thoughts on how both great science and great art (he is an art collector and has collaborated with artists in their work) both involve the creation of new and informative ways of interpreting the world. "
20,1439108277,http://goodreads.com/user/show/48807739-gautam-krishna,4,"A lovely perspective of looking at the daily world. Walter Lewin simply spoke my mind. My ideology of teaching: Teach not what to think, but how to think."
21,1439108277,http://goodreads.com/user/show/760700-ray,4,"In this book, Dr. Lewin deciphers many confusing aspects of natural phenomenon which surround us. The mysteries of rainbows and sound, electricity and magnetism, etc., are brought within our grasp of understanding after listening to Lewin's discussions. He uses layman's terms, for the most part, and gives simple yet practical examples to make his point. He seems genuinely interested in opening a new sense of understanding of the many seemingly complex things which surround us. However, I suspect Dr. Lewin started with the simpler examples, which many people will have a familiarity with and an intuitive sense about, and then gradually introduced topics which for me, where more difficult to grasp. His latter topics dealing with the stars and supernovas, pulsars, neutron starts, stellar x-ray sources, and less familiar units of measure took a toll on my ability to absorb. In those areas, I strongly suspect that the audio book version, which I listened to, should have been replaced by the bound book to allow a more personal pace, and to allow examination of some diagrams or drawings. Nonetheless, Dr. Lewin succeeded in most areas to demonstrate an ability to take seemingly complex phenomenon, and explain them in everyman's terms, bringing a much improved sense of understanding to us all. With fewer and fewer Americans studying science, this book can provide useful insights into better understanding the world we live in.  "
22,1439108277,http://goodreads.com/user/show/18273418-j-r,4,"You have to understand before reading this, that Lewin has a genuine love of both physics and education. His love is shown plainly in the pages, and while he leaves much to doubt, it's clear the reader should explore to learn more. There is an abundant amount of resources out there for the pop-physicist to read, but most books gloss over the smaller things that are deemed ""uninteresting"" and go for really big physics stuff. Lewin's book, on the other hand does something incredible. Lewin takes the ordinary and makes you realize how extraordinary it really is. His take on rainbows will have you both laughing and looking around like a mad man whenever one is in the sky. Your friends will mock you for taking their polarized glasses and showing them how it disappears. But you will do it anyway, because Lewin showed you just how amazing it is! The professor, takes the most subtle of physics and turns it into something much better he turns it into something you look for on a daily level. This book could not have come from a mind with a lesser understanding of our world. "
23,1439108277,http://goodreads.com/user/show/163039-kevin-hanks,4,"Great book written by what sounds to be a great teacher. He tries to condense the material from several of his MIT introductory physics classes into book format. I've learned that his class lectures have become quite popular on Youtube and that this book is an attempt to expand on that popularity and reach an even wider audience. I say bravo! I loved his simple explanations and obvious love of the topics. Because of the format, he was forced to describe several of his more famous physics demonstrations which, I of course looked up on Youtube to watch, and they were fascinating! He's teaching very basic principles, but doing so in a fun way that makes you want to learn more. I wish more teachers/professors tried as hard to make their subjects interesting and fun."
24,1439108277,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5570143-tnahsin-garg,4,"Being a fan of Dr. Lewin, I picked up this one to clear my head of all the literary stuff that I've been reading. And turned out, it was quite a delightful read. While it wouldn't be fair to criticize the book on terms of prose, so if you're picking this book up, you better be interested in science! While most of the concepts revolved around basic physics, and could be boring to a science major, but the real beauty is the way Walter explains them in the most basic sense. I particularly liked his in depth tackling of static electricity and rainbows - the 2 most commonly misunderstood phenomena. "
25,1439108277,http://goodreads.com/user/show/18370648-mishehu,5,"5 stars for the sheer joy the author takes in teaching his readers. As popular physics treatments go, there's not much here an interested reader isn't likely to have encountered elsewhere -- other than the author's account of his own very interesting scientific autobiography. But there's great pleasure to be had in seeing the whole history and enterprise of physics through the eyes of this boyishly enthusiastic guide. It's no wonder Lewin's classes are as widely admired as they are. I plan to watch them myself one day. It was a pleasure reading this book. "
26,1439108277,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2531665-charlene,4,"Lewin's personal narrative is likely to grab most readers right away. His life, from a childhood spent hiding from Nazis to a grown man who became a world renowned physicist, is inspiring to say the least. Lewin's love of physics oozes out of him on every page, in every lecture, and seemingly in his every day life. It is easy to see why his lectures are so popular. In this book, Lewin brought key ideas from his lecture series to the reader. After relating basic concepts of physics, Lewin detailed his research in x-ray astronomy and how we came to ""see"" the cosmos. "
27,1439108277,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1310120-lisa,4,"Reading this book is almost like being at one of Prof. Lewin's lectures! (For those who haven't had the opportunity, he provides links to some of them on MIT's OpenCourseWare site.) The only difference between this and the actual lectures is that he requires less math background on the reader's part than is expected from MIT freshmen- there's very little in the way of math or equations. If you're even a little interested in physics, check it out!"

In this book, Walter tries to make physics accessible to everyone. I do not know if it a success. Being on the path to becoming a physicist (I'm currently doing a PhD), I willingly admit that I was sometimes lost, even on things I already know... I am not sure if it comes from the fact that I was listening to an audio version, which may be intrinsically difficult to follow whenever Walter drops numbers in, or if it comes from the fact that, well, it is just not that easy to follow.The one thing he absolutely succeeds at doing though, is displaying how happy physics makes him, and his passion is quite contagious.The book is kind of separated in two parts : One would be general things about physics, where Walter brushes the big subjects of classical physics : mechanics, waves, electromagnetism, that sort of things, and a second part where he talks about the field he worked in for his whole career (besides being a teacher) : gamma ray physics.I found the second part so much better. Because it is really in this one that the passion of Mr. Lewin for physics shines. He takes a subject that may sound really dry to the uneducated and explains at length how exciting it is. And it works. I am really interested in knowing more about gamma rays now."

That combination is rare, but Walter Lewin (a fellow Dutchman) is definitely one of them.To give you an example: I have read about the science behind rainbows more times than I can count, but it was never as clear and intuitive as in this book.I especially liked the first half, where each chapter dives into an aspect of physics with great examples and then moves on. After that the scope of the book changes to Lewin's own background as a researcher of X-rays, which takes up a relatively much bigger chunk than the other areas. That's understandable given the author's history, but it feels a bit uneven.Don't let that stand in your way though, I highly enjoyed this and recommend it to everybody that's even remotely interested in physics.

I have seen his videos on youtube before reading this book. I did not know that was him until he mentioned the videos in this book. He seems like such a fun teacher to have. I really wish I had teachers like this when I was younger. This makes me want to go back to college. Physics can be fun. It doesn't have to be over complicated math problems. Physics is the way to uncover all of the rules that govern this universe. It is like deciphering the source code of the Matrix, then executing a program and predicting the outcome based on the code. Get the math right and your predictions will come true 99.99% of the time. There is something very beautiful in that truth that this teacher tries to relay to his students and readers by coming up with fun and interesting experiments that prove the math is correct. The outcome is always the same. We can read the source code of the universe and predict the future.

45,1439108277,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8742827-jack,5,"A great teacher helps you understandThere’s a difference between knowing a subject and understanding it. You can know physics by being adept at using math and knowing equations well enough to solve problems and still not have a deep understanding of the underlying reasons why things are true. I’ve watched Walter Lewin’s courses and he is one of the best at getting students to see underlying reasons behind physics. By showing people how things work and how truths were derived he communicates some thing far beyond jus learning equations. This book, in a very concise way, does the same thing. It lints the way to understanding. Love the book."
46,1439108277,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6163938-antonis,3,"I discovered Walter Lewin’s MIT lectures on YouTube and I thoroughly enjoyed them. That incited me to buy his book which I found rather disappointing and unbalanced. In roughly the first half of the book, Lewin presents a selection of simple physical concepts illustrating them with everyday examples. The second half of the book, however, is much more autobiographical and exclusively focused on X-ray astronomy, Lewin’s area of research, which is presented in a very detailed manner. I also did not like the tone of the writing: it seems to be assuming that the reader has had no previous exposure to physics and algebra, not even of the high-school variety."
47,1439108277,http://goodreads.com/user/show/37336945-mirco-blaser,4,"A very informative and approach to some very interesting fields of physics. I loved how the enthusiasm from his lectures can be felt in the book as well, you can just tell how much Walter Lewin loves to talk about physics.The first half of the book was a really good read and quite easy to understand too. But unfortunately as soon as he gets into astrophysics and especially x-rays, I felt kind of lost. When you don’t have a background in the field some parts are hard to understand to be honest. Anyway, I still thought this was a great read."
48,1439108277,http://goodreads.com/user/show/27678334-eric,4,"It was good to be forced to re-read and reconsider much of what I have learned from experience and in the physics classroom over the years. Much of the narrative was told with just enough humor to keep it entertaining and enough math to keep it interesting. Towards the end, with what I can only consider his 'side trip' into art, we get a glimpse into Lewin's humanity. If you are a cosmologist with an interest in radio telescopes, this may be your avenue to learn of one of the pioneers of the field, assuming you are not already one of his disciples. Well worth the listen."
49,1439108277,http://goodreads.com/user/show/88546190-harenderjeet-arora,5,"It's a great reflection of the lectures by Professor Walter Lewin. Reading the book is like as if Professor Lewin himself is talking to you. Explanations of various concepts are vivid and easy to understand, even for those who haven't gone through all his lectures. Each chapter unravels the mystery behind various phenomenons like Rainbows, Lightning, X-Rays from outer space, and the list goes on.So if you want to enjoy physics without worrying about dealing with equations, this is the book you should read."

But life is so funny. You get things when you no more find any means of putting them into productive use. Walter Lewin makes the subject so interesting that a physics-phobic like me could breeze through the book without an iota of boredom. I would recommend this book to all teachers dealing with physics and assure that students would fall in love with physics and probably with their teacher too. "
51,1439108277,http://goodreads.com/user/show/97599556-adhiraj-jain,4,"A great, fun and engaging read. I never loved physics but this book helped me find some spark in this fascinating subject. Known for his unique and engaging lectures at MIT, the author tries to explain simple concepts and phenomena such as black holes, x ray astronomy, rainbows, pressure in straws, newton laws, electricity and magnetism, etc in a fun way. It is a part biography of the authors life in astrophysics and teaching while also being popular science book for masses. Worth a read for anyone interested in physics."
52,1439108277,http://goodreads.com/user/show/14734538-roberto-rigolin-f-lopes,4,"Love. Physics. You need a brilliant teacher to make the connection. Good news. Lewin's lectures are on YouTube. Some uncover the beauty of ""mundane"" physics; stuff happening around you right now. You may catch a ""rainbow disease"" but will also gather some evidence that love and physics can go together. This book complements his lectures with a biographical twist. Also sharing his education, interest in art and research on x-ray astronomy."
53,1439108277,http://goodreads.com/user/show/13065643-koori,4,"Beautiful explanations of physics, I would recommend this book to high school graduates in order to get them interested in science.The book only became kind of tedious on the X-ray chapters (perhaps due to astronomy not being a topic that particularly excites me much), and it also began narrating more about personal experiences of the author's career which was a bit less interesting to me than the more educational and light-hearted first chapters.Other than that, a magnificent book."
54,1439108277,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5916868-vicky-liu,4,I had the great luck (unappreciated at the time) to learn electricity & magnetism (8.02?) with Professor Lewin. He made physics come a live in a way it never did before. I will always remember his lecture on rainbows and his passionate speech about how knowing the physics behind rainbows make him appreciate it all the more. I've taken that message to heart and have always sought to continue learning throughout my life. Reading this book reminded me of that. Thank you professor Lewin!
55,1439108277,http://goodreads.com/user/show/60300248-parbel-saha,5,"I wish, if I could have attended his classes. I have watched some online and that made more excited to grab two copies. This books helped me to visualize many aspects of classical and everyday physics. Physics explained like short stories with so many interesting examples, will definitely make you fall in love with the book, the person and physics. I would quote : "" If you think physics is hard and boring perhaps, you have had a boring physics teacher. "" "
56,1439108277,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1146888-aron,3,"I have no doubt Lewin is a fantastic teacher. The anecdotes about his life were quite interesting as were the stories of how he teaches. But he covers way too much ground in this short book so the explanations are rushed and often unclear. If I knew nothing about physics, I dont think I would be able to follow at all. I think I’ll watch his online classes because I didn’t come away Learning a lot of new stuff from this book."

I can only tell you how to approach while reading this book.Just go on reading this book even if you don't understand few things. This is one book which you may need to reread, to be honest I have to. It will definitely make you love physics but only if you already have a crush on physics!"
58,1439108277,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4797201-rajendra-dave,4,"The first two-thirds of the book is excellent. It inspires and shows how to teach physics in particular and any subject in general. Its ability to make intricate concepts appear simple stems directly from the deep understanding of them that the author has. Unfortunately in its later part, the book digresses to the author's career as an astrophysicist. And it ends with his love of art! These digressions ruin an otherwise excellent book. "
59,1439108277,http://goodreads.com/user/show/64255987-karam-droby,5,"Lewin has written this book for the sake of translation the truly astounding, groundbreaking, sometimes even revolutionary discoveries of his fellow physicists into concept and language intelligent, curious laypeople can really get hold of - to make a bridge between the world of professional scientists and our world."
60,1439108277,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10325427-mahesan-vasudevan,4,"Walter Lewin predicted that it would change the way I look at the world after I finish the book. Well, he is indeed true.

I didn't know it until reading this book, but Walter Lewin is renowned as one of those professors.In For the Love of Physics, astrophysicist and former MIT professor Lewin offers a physics textbook for the layperson, for the rest of us. With infectious enthusiasm and readily apparent expertise, he frames up everyday occurrences like rainbows, drinking straws, musical instruments and static electricity, pulling them apart into the bare essentials, all defined and perfectly predictable by the laws of physics.The latter half of the book gets a bit more technical and a bit less charming as he ventures into his own territory of X-rays research, balloon astronomy and the high-school'ish antics of the science community. But even here there are immersive sections on black holes, binary stars and other galactic phenomena of almost unfathomable scale.Unfortunately, I learned while reading this book that MIT cut ties with Lewin after an online harassment investigation. It's tough to find heroes these days, but his lessons have certainly changed how I view the universe around me for the better."
99,1439108277,http://goodreads.com/user/show/77179179-cl-ment-moissard,4,"I mean, who on Earth doesn't like Walter Lewin ?He is just cool, and absolutely in love with Physics. In this book, Walter tries to make physics accessible to everyone. I do not know if it a success. Being on the path to becoming a physicist (I'm currently doing a PhD), I willingly admit that I was sometimes lost, even on things I already know... I am not sure if it comes from the fact that I was listening to an audio version, which may be intrinsically difficult to follow whenever Walter drops numbers in, or if it comes from the fact that, well, it is just not that easy to follow.The one thing he absolutely succeeds at doing though, is displaying how happy physics makes him, and his passion is quite contagious.The book is kind of separated in two parts : One would be general things about physics, where Walter brushes the big subjects of classical physics : mechanics, waves, electromagnetism, that sort of things, and a second part where he talks about the field he worked in for his whole career (besides being a teacher) : gamma ray physics.I found the second part so much better. Because it is really in this one that the passion of Mr. Lewin for physics shines. He takes a subject that may sound really dry to the uneducated and explains at length how exciting it is. And it works. I am really interested in knowing more about gamma rays now."
100,1439108277,http://goodreads.com/user/show/36069918-ramon-van-dam,4,"I've read a lot of books about physics the last couple of years; partially because it's an amazing subject that will always be interesting to me, but also because it's one of the corners of non-fiction writing where authors can really excel.In order to be able to successfully write about it, not only do they have to fully understand it themselves, they also need to be great teachers. That combination is rare, but Walter Lewin (a fellow Dutchman) is definitely one of them.To give you an example: I have read about the science behind rainbows more times than I can count, but it was never as clear and intuitive as in this book.I especially liked the first half, where each chapter dives into an aspect of physics with great examples and then moves on. After that the scope of the book changes to Lewin's own background as a researcher of X-rays, which takes up a relatively much bigger chunk than the other areas. That's understandable given the author's history, but it feels a bit uneven.Don't let that stand in your way though, I highly enjoyed this and recommend it to everybody that's even remotely interested in physics. In fact, if you're a teenager or if you have children of that age I would suggest you put it high on the list right now."
101,1439108277,http://goodreads.com/user/show/37644039-erik-molnar,4,"Excellent book on physics. This was written by an MIT professor whom has a very unique way of teaching. I have seen his videos on youtube before reading this book. I did not know that was him until he mentioned the videos in this book. He seems like such a fun teacher to have. I really wish I had teachers like this when I was younger. This makes me want to go back to college. Physics can be fun. It doesn't have to be over complicated math problems. Physics is the way to uncover all of the rules that govern this universe. It is like deciphering the source code of the Matrix, then executing a program and predicting the outcome based on the code. Get the math right and your predictions will come true 99.99% of the time. There is something very beautiful in that truth that this teacher tries to relay to his students and readers by coming up with fun and interesting experiments that prove the math is correct. The outcome is always the same. We can read the source code of the universe and predict the future. Now if only people were that simple to understand.No knowledge of high level math required to appreciate this book. "

This book takes us inside the beauty of life, the beauty of physics- it graciously blends facts and explanations. I loved it!""That’s yet another thing that I love about experimental physics; it lets us “touch” the invisible.""""Physics has explained the beauty and fragility of rainbows, the existence of black holes, why the planets move the way they do, what goes on when a star explodes, why a spinning ice skater speeds up when she draws in her arms, why astronauts are weightless in space, how elements were formed in the universe, when our universe began, how a flute makes music, how we generate electricity that drives our bodies as well as our economy, and what the big bang sounded like.

104,1439108277,http://goodreads.com/user/show/32529104-jose-mari,4,"In my view, teaching is the highest form of empathy. Excellent Teachers do no only yearn for people to understand concepts but they also engage their students to embrace and apply the teachings. Admittedly, the technical content of the book may not be new but the enthusiasm and excitement of the author on his work makes it contagious. No matter how difficult a subject or challenging a task, great Teachers have the ability to nurture with an invisible hand young seeds.

You can know physics by being adept at using math and knowing equations well enough to solve problems and still not have a deep understanding of the underlying reasons why things are true. I’ve watched Walter Lewin’s courses and he is one of the best at getting students to see underlying reasons behind physics. By showing people how things work and how truths were derived he communicates some thing far beyond jus learning equations. This book, in a very concise way, does the same thing.

With infectious enthusiasm and readily apparent expertise, he frames up everyday occurrences like rainbows, drinking straws, musical instruments and static electricity, pulling them apart into the bare essentials, all defined and perfectly predictable by the laws of physics.The latter half of the book gets a bit more technical and a bit less charming as he ventures into his own territory of X-rays research, balloon astronomy and the high-school'ish antics of the science community. But even here there are immersive sections on black holes, binary stars and other galactic phenomena of almost unfathomable scale.Unfortunately, I learned while reading this book that MIT cut ties with Lewin after an online harassment investigation. It's tough to find heroes these days, but his lessons have certainly changed how I view the universe around me for the better."

In this book, Walter tries to make physics accessible to everyone. I do not know if it a success. Being on the path to becoming a physicist (I'm currently doing a PhD), I willingly admit that I was sometimes lost, even on things I already know... I am not sure if it comes from the fact that I was listening to an audio version, which may be intrinsically difficult to follow whenever Walter drops numbers in, or if it comes from the fact that, well, it is just not that easy to follow.The one thing he absolutely succeeds at doing though, is displaying how happy physics makes him, and his passion is quite contagious.The book is kind of separated in two parts : One would be general things about physics, where Walter brushes the big subjects of classical physics : mechanics, waves, electromagnetism, that sort of things, and a second part where he talks about the field he worked in for his whole career (besides being a teacher) : gamma ray physics.I found the second part so much better. Because it is really in this one that the passion of Mr. Lewin for physics shines. He takes a subject that may sound really dry to the uneducated and explains at length how exciting it is. And it works. I am really interested in knowing more about gamma rays now."

That combination is rare, but Walter Lewin (a fellow Dutchman) is definitely one of them.To give you an example: I have read about the science behind rainbows more times than I can count, but it was never as clear and intuitive as in this book.I especially liked the first half, where each chapter dives into an aspect of physics with great examples and then moves on. After that the scope of the book changes to Lewin's own background as a researcher of X-rays, which takes up a relatively much bigger chunk than the other areas. That's understandable given the author's history, but it feels a bit uneven.Don't let that stand in your way though, I highly enjoyed this and recommend it to everybody that's even remotely interested in physics.

I have seen his videos on youtube before reading this book. I did not know that was him until he mentioned the videos in this book. He seems like such a fun teacher to have. I really wish I had teachers like this when I was younger. This makes me want to go back to college. Physics can be fun. It doesn't have to be over complicated math problems. Physics is the way to uncover all of the rules that govern this universe. It is like deciphering the source code of the Matrix, then executing a program and predicting the outcome based on the code. Get the math right and your predictions will come true 99.99% of the time. There is something very beautiful in that truth that this teacher tries to relay to his students and readers by coming up with fun and interesting experiments that prove the math is correct. The outcome is always the same. We can read the source code of the universe and predict the future.

I’ve watched Walter Lewin’s courses and he is one of the best at getting students to see underlying reasons behind physics. By showing people how things work and how truths were derived he communicates some thing far beyond jus learning equations. This book, in a very concise way, does the same thing.

In roughly the first half of the book, Lewin presents a selection of simple physical concepts illustrating them with everyday examples. The second half of the book, however, is much more autobiographical and exclusively focused on X-ray astronomy, Lewin’s area of research, which is presented in a very detailed manner. I also did not like the tone of the writing: it seems to be assuming that the reader has had no previous exposure to physics and algebra, not even of the high-school variety."

But unfortunately as soon as he gets into astrophysics and especially x-rays, I felt kind of lost. When you don’t have a background in the field some parts are hard to understand to be honest.

It is a part biography of the authors life in astrophysics and teaching while also being popular science book for masses. Worth a read for anyone interested in physics."

He made physics come a live in a way it never did before. I will always remember his lecture on rainbows and his passionate speech about how knowing the physics behind rainbows make him appreciate it all the more. I've taken that message to heart and have always sought to continue learning throughout my life. Reading this book reminded me of that. Thank you professor Lewin!

In this book, Walter tries to make physics accessible to everyone. I do not know if it a success. Being on the path to becoming a physicist (I'm currently doing a PhD), I willingly admit that I was sometimes lost, even on things I already know... I am not sure if it comes from the fact that I was listening to an audio version, which may be intrinsically difficult to follow whenever Walter drops numbers in, or if it comes from the fact that, well, it is just not that easy to follow.The one thing he absolutely succeeds at doing though, is displaying how happy physics makes him, and his passion is quite contagious.The book is kind of separated in two parts : One would be general things about physics, where Walter brushes the big subjects of classical physics : mechanics, waves, electromagnetism, that sort of things, and a second part where he talks about the field he worked in for his whole career (besides being a teacher) : gamma ray physics.I found the second part so much better. Because it is really in this one that the passion of Mr. Lewin for physics shines. He takes a subject that may sound really dry to the uneducated and explains at length how exciting it is. And it works. I am really interested in knowing more about gamma rays now."
190,1439108277,http://goodreads.com/user/show/36069918-ramon-van-dam,4,"I've read a lot of books about physics the last couple of years; partially because it's an amazing subject that will always be interesting to me, but also because it's one of the corners of non-fiction writing where authors can really excel.In order to be able to successfully write about it, not only do they have to fully understand it themselves, they also need to be great teachers. That combination is rare, but Walter Lewin (a fellow Dutchman) is definitely one of them.To give you an example: I have read about the science behind rainbows more times than I can count, but it was never as clear and intuitive as in this book.I especially liked the first half, where each chapter dives into an aspect of physics with great examples and then moves on. After that the scope of the book changes to Lewin's own background as a researcher of X-rays, which takes up a relatively much bigger chunk than the other areas. That's understandable given the author's history, but it feels a bit uneven.Don't let that stand in your way though, I highly enjoyed this and recommend it to everybody that's even remotely interested in physics. In fact, if you're a teenager or if you have children of that age I would suggest you put it high on the list right now."
191,1439108277,http://goodreads.com/user/show/37644039-erik-molnar,4,"Excellent book on physics. This was written by an MIT professor whom has a very unique way of teaching. I have seen his videos on youtube before reading this book. I did not know that was him until he mentioned the videos in this book. He seems like such a fun teacher to have. I really wish I had teachers like this when I was younger. This makes me want to go back to college. Physics can be fun. It doesn't have to be over complicated math problems. Physics is the way to uncover all of the rules that govern this universe. It is like deciphering the source code of the Matrix, then executing a program and predicting the outcome based on the code. Get the math right and your predictions will come true 99.99% of the time. There is something very beautiful in that truth that this teacher tries to relay to his students and readers by coming up with fun and interesting experiments that prove the math is correct. The outcome is always the same. We can read the source code of the universe and predict the future. Now if only people were that simple to understand.No knowledge of high level math required to appreciate this book. "

This book takes us inside the beauty of life, the beauty of physics- it graciously blends facts and explanations. I loved it!""That’s yet another thing that I love about experimental physics; it lets us “touch” the invisible.""""Physics has explained the beauty and fragility of rainbows, the existence of black holes, why the planets move the way they do, what goes on when a star explodes, why a spinning ice skater speeds up when she draws in her arms, why astronauts are weightless in space, how elements were formed in the universe, when our universe began, how a flute makes music, how we generate electricity that drives our bodies as well as our economy, and what the big bang sounded like.

"
194,1439108277,http://goodreads.com/user/show/32529104-jose-mari,4,"In my view, teaching is the highest form of empathy. Excellent Teachers do no only yearn for people to understand concepts but they also engage their students to embrace and apply the teachings. Admittedly, the technical content of the book may not be new but the enthusiasm and excitement of the author on his work makes it contagious. No matter how difficult a subject or challenging a task, great Teachers have the ability to nurture with an invisible hand young seeds. Watch his lectures in YouTube and emulate his ways whenever you need to impart any topic in your class, at the workplace, or even with your children. You will be inspired.

195,1439108277,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8742827-jack,5,"A great teacher helps you understandThere’s a difference between knowing a subject and understanding it. You can know physics by being adept at using math and knowing equations well enough to solve problems and still not have a deep understanding of the underlying reasons why things are true. I’ve watched Walter Lewin’s courses and he is one of the best at getting students to see underlying reasons behind physics. By showing people how things work and how truths were derived he communicates some thing far beyond jus learning equations. This book, in a very concise way, does the same thing. It lints the way to understanding. Love the book."
196,1439108277,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6163938-antonis,3,"I discovered Walter Lewin’s MIT lectures on YouTube and I thoroughly enjoyed them. That incited me to buy his book which I found rather disappointing and unbalanced. In roughly the first half of the book, Lewin presents a selection of simple physical concepts illustrating them with everyday examples. The second half of the book, however, is much more autobiographical and exclusively focused on X-ray astronomy, Lewin’s area of research, which is presented in a very detailed manner. I also did not like the tone of the writing: it seems to be assuming that the reader has had no previous exposure to physics and algebra, not even of the high-school variety."
197,1439108277,http://goodreads.com/user/show/37336945-mirco-blaser,4,"A very informative and approach to some very interesting fields of physics. I loved how the enthusiasm from his lectures can be felt in the book as well, you can just tell how much Walter Lewin loves to talk about physics.The first half of the book was a really good read and quite easy to understand too. But unfortunately as soon as he gets into astrophysics and especially x-rays, I felt kind of lost. When you don’t have a background in the field some parts are hard to understand to be honest. Anyway, I still thought this was a great read."
198,1439108277,http://goodreads.com/user/show/27678334-eric,4,"It was good to be forced to re-read and reconsider much of what I have learned from experience and in the physics classroom over the years. Much of the narrative was told with just enough humor to keep it entertaining and enough math to keep it interesting. Towards the end, with what I can only consider his 'side trip' into art, we get a glimpse into Lewin's humanity. If you are a cosmologist with an interest in radio telescopes, this may be your avenue to learn of one of the pioneers of the field, assuming you are not already one of his disciples. Well worth the listen."
199,1439108277,http://goodreads.com/user/show/88546190-harenderjeet-arora,5,"It's a great reflection of the lectures by Professor Walter Lewin. Reading the book is like as if Professor Lewin himself is talking to you. Explanations of various concepts are vivid and easy to understand, even for those who haven't gone through all his lectures. Each chapter unravels the mystery behind various phenomenons like Rainbows, Lightning, X-Rays from outer space, and the list goes on.So if you want to enjoy physics without worrying about dealing with equations, this is the book you should read."

That combination is rare, but Walter Lewin (a fellow Dutchman) is definitely one of them.To give you an example: I have read about the science behind rainbows more times than I can count, but it was never as clear and intuitive as in this book.I especially liked the first half, where each chapter dives into an aspect of physics with great examples and then moves on. After that the scope of the book changes to Lewin's own background as a researcher of X-rays, which takes up a relatively much bigger chunk than the other areas. That's understandable given the author's history, but it feels a bit uneven.Don't let that stand in your way though, I highly enjoyed this and recommend it to everybody that's even remotely interested in physics.

I have seen his videos on youtube before reading this book. I did not know that was him until he mentioned the videos in this book. He seems like such a fun teacher to have. I really wish I had teachers like this when I was younger. This makes me want to go back to college. Physics can be fun. It doesn't have to be over complicated math problems. Physics is the way to uncover all of the rules that govern this universe. It is like deciphering the source code of the Matrix, then executing a program and predicting the outcome based on the code. Get the math right and your predictions will come true 99.99% of the time. There is something very beautiful in that truth that this teacher tries to relay to his students and readers by coming up with fun and interesting experiments that prove the math is correct. The outcome is always the same. We can read the source code of the universe and predict the future.

I’ve watched Walter Lewin’s courses and he is one of the best at getting students to see underlying reasons behind physics. By showing people how things work and how truths were derived he communicates some thing far beyond jus learning equations. This book, in a very concise way, does the same thing.

That incited me to buy his book which I found rather disappointing and unbalanced. In roughly the first half of the book, Lewin presents a selection of simple physical concepts illustrating them with everyday examples. The second half of the book, however, is much more autobiographical and exclusively focused on X-ray astronomy, Lewin’s area of research, which is presented in a very detailed manner. I also did not like the tone of the writing: it seems to be assuming that the reader has had no previous exposure to physics and algebra, not even of the high-school variety."

But unfortunately as soon as he gets into astrophysics and especially x-rays, I felt kind of lost. When you don’t have a background in the field some parts are hard to understand to be honest.

What’s his secret? “I introduce people to their own world,” he says, “the world they live in and are familiar with, but don’t approach like a physicist—yet. If I talk about waves on water, I ask them to do certain experiments in their bathtubs; they can relate to that. They can relate to rainbows. That’s one of the things I love about physics: you get to explain anything. And that can be a wonderful experience—for them and for me. I make them love physics!

I didn't know it until reading this book, but Walter Lewin is renowned as one of those professors.In For the Love of Physics, astrophysicist and former MIT professor Lewin offers a physics textbook for the layperson, for the rest of us. With infectious enthusiasm and readily apparent expertise, he frames up everyday occurrences like rainbows, drinking straws, musical instruments and static electricity, pulling them apart into the bare essentials, all defined and perfectly predictable by the laws of physics.The latter half of the book gets a bit more technical and a bit less charming as he ventures into his own territory of X-rays research, balloon astronomy and the high-school'ish antics of the science community. But even here there are immersive sections on black holes, binary stars and other galactic phenomena of almost unfathomable scale.Unfortunately, I learned while reading this book that MIT cut ties with Lewin after an online harassment investigation. It's tough to find heroes these days, but his lessons have certainly changed how I view the universe around me for the better."

In this book, Walter tries to make physics accessible to everyone. I do not know if it a success. Being on the path to becoming a physicist (I'm currently doing a PhD), I willingly admit that I was sometimes lost, even on things I already know... I am not sure if it comes from the fact that I was listening to an audio version, which may be intrinsically difficult to follow whenever Walter drops numbers in, or if it comes from the fact that, well, it is just not that easy to follow.The one thing he absolutely succeeds at doing though, is displaying how happy physics makes him, and his passion is quite contagious.The book is kind of separated in two parts : One would be general things about physics, where Walter brushes the big subjects of classical physics : mechanics, waves, electromagnetism, that sort of things, and a second part where he talks about the field he worked in for his whole career (besides being a teacher) : gamma ray physics.I found the second part so much better. Because it is really in this one that the passion of Mr. Lewin for physics shines. He takes a subject that may sound really dry to the uneducated and explains at length how exciting it is.

I would quote : "" If you think physics is hard and boring perhaps, you have had a boring physics teacher. "" "

But he covers way too much ground in this short book so the explanations are rushed and often unclear. If I knew nothing about physics, I dont think I would be able to follow at all. I think I’ll watch his online classes because I didn’t come away Learning a lot of new stuff from this book."

I can only tell you how to approach while reading this book.Just go on reading this book even if you don't understand few things. This is one book which you may need to reread, to be honest I have to. It will definitely make you love physics but only if you already have a crush on physics!"

It inspires and shows how to teach physics in particular and any subject in general. Its ability to make intricate concepts appear simple stems directly from the deep understanding of them that the author has. Unfortunately in its later part, the book digresses to the author's career as an astrophysicist. And it ends with his love of art! These digressions ruin an otherwise excellent book. "

What’s his secret? “I introduce people to their own world,” he says, “the world they live in and are familiar with, but don’t approach like a physicist—yet. If I talk about waves on water, I ask them to do certain experiments in their bathtubs; they can relate to that. They can relate to rainbows. That’s one of the things I love about physics: you get to explain anything. And that can be a wonderful experience—for them and for me. I make them love physics! Sometimes, when my students get really engaged, the classes almost feel like happenings.”"
278,1439108277,http://goodreads.com/user/show/33608347-gregory-paige,4,"The lucky ones among us were fortunate enough to have at least one teacher or professor whose passion and preparation transformed difficult, tedious or plain ol' boring classroom material into lessons we couldn't wait to explore. I didn't know it until reading this book, but Walter Lewin is renowned as one of those professors.In For the Love of Physics, astrophysicist and former MIT professor Lewin offers a physics textbook for the layperson, for the rest of us. With infectious enthusiasm and readily apparent expertise, he frames up everyday occurrences like rainbows, drinking straws, musical instruments and static electricity, pulling them apart into the bare essentials, all defined and perfectly predictable by the laws of physics.The latter half of the book gets a bit more technical and a bit less charming as he ventures into his own territory of X-rays research, balloon astronomy and the high-school'ish antics of the science community. But even here there are immersive sections on black holes, binary stars and other galactic phenomena of almost unfathomable scale.Unfortunately, I learned while reading this book that MIT cut ties with Lewin after an online harassment investigation. It's tough to find heroes these days, but his lessons have certainly changed how I view the universe around me for the better."
279,1439108277,http://goodreads.com/user/show/77179179-cl-ment-moissard,4,"I mean, who on Earth doesn't like Walter Lewin ?He is just cool, and absolutely in love with Physics. In this book, Walter tries to make physics accessible to everyone. I do not know if it a success. Being on the path to becoming a physicist (I'm currently doing a PhD), I willingly admit that I was sometimes lost, even on things I already know... I am not sure if it comes from the fact that I was listening to an audio version, which may be intrinsically difficult to follow whenever Walter drops numbers in, or if it comes from the fact that, well, it is just not that easy to follow.The one thing he absolutely succeeds at doing though, is displaying how happy physics makes him, and his passion is quite contagious.The book is kind of separated in two parts : One would be general things about physics, where Walter brushes the big subjects of classical physics : mechanics, waves, electromagnetism, that sort of things, and a second part where he talks about the field he worked in for his whole career (besides being a teacher) : gamma ray physics.I found the second part so much better. Because it is really in this one that the passion of Mr. Lewin for physics shines. He takes a subject that may sound really dry to the uneducated and explains at length how exciting it is. And it works. I am really interested in knowing more about gamma rays now."
280,1439108277,http://goodreads.com/user/show/36069918-ramon-van-dam,4,"I've read a lot of books about physics the last couple of years; partially because it's an amazing subject that will always be interesting to me, but also because it's one of the corners of non-fiction writing where authors can really excel.In order to be able to successfully write about it, not only do they have to fully understand it themselves, they also need to be great teachers. That combination is rare, but Walter Lewin (a fellow Dutchman) is definitely one of them.To give you an example: I have read about the science behind rainbows more times than I can count, but it was never as clear and intuitive as in this book.I especially liked the first half, where each chapter dives into an aspect of physics with great examples and then moves on. After that the scope of the book changes to Lewin's own background as a researcher of X-rays, which takes up a relatively much bigger chunk than the other areas. That's understandable given the author's history, but it feels a bit uneven.Don't let that stand in your way though, I highly enjoyed this and recommend it to everybody that's even remotely interested in physics. In fact, if you're a teenager or if you have children of that age I would suggest you put it high on the list right now."
281,1439108277,http://goodreads.com/user/show/37644039-erik-molnar,4,"Excellent book on physics. This was written by an MIT professor whom has a very unique way of teaching. I have seen his videos on youtube before reading this book. I did not know that was him until he mentioned the videos in this book. He seems like such a fun teacher to have. I really wish I had teachers like this when I was younger. This makes me want to go back to college. Physics can be fun. It doesn't have to be over complicated math problems. Physics is the way to uncover all of the rules that govern this universe. It is like deciphering the source code of the Matrix, then executing a program and predicting the outcome based on the code. Get the math right and your predictions will come true 99.99% of the time. There is something very beautiful in that truth that this teacher tries to relay to his students and readers by coming up with fun and interesting experiments that prove the math is correct. The outcome is always the same. We can read the source code of the universe and predict the future. Now if only people were that simple to understand.No knowledge of high level math required to appreciate this book. "

Reading it I was fascinated to discover the wonderful heart and brilliant mind of a man gifted to give us deep insight into the world we live in. This book takes us inside the beauty of life, the beauty of physics- it graciously blends facts and explanations. I loved it!""That’s yet another thing that I love about experimental physics; it lets us “touch” the invisible.""""Physics has explained the beauty and fragility of rainbows, the existence of black holes, why the planets move the way they do, what goes on when a star explodes, why a spinning ice skater speeds up when she draws in her arms, why astronauts are weightless in space, how elements were formed in the universe, when our universe began, how a flute makes music, how we generate electricity that drives our bodies as well as our economy, and what the big bang sounded like. It has charted the smallest reaches of subatomic space."""
283,1439108277,http://goodreads.com/user/show/63329372-cruz-angel,4,"It's clear to me that Walter Lewin lives physics, and transmits this feeling to the reader but I think this book is a supplement for the online lessons, so if you forgot about your physics lessons or you think it's too difficult for you, this is a good book to be imbued with the wonders of nature.The wonders of Electricity and the mysteries of magnetism chapters made me remember how important Maxwell work were and watching the online classes of these topics kept me wondering that we often live without curiosity, so for me this was really an astonishing goal to achieve.The chapters about his work on X-Rays are the perfect complement to introduce you into the astrophysics research and why astronomers are amazed about their discoveries, so this book makes you think like a child and keep you wondering about everything you see, and if you watch his videotaped lessons online you won't stop watching them. "
284,1439108277,http://goodreads.com/user/show/32529104-jose-mari,4,"In my view, teaching is the highest form of empathy. Excellent Teachers do no only yearn for people to understand concepts but they also engage their students to embrace and apply the teachings. Admittedly, the technical content of the book may not be new but the enthusiasm and excitement of the author on his work makes it contagious. No matter how difficult a subject or challenging a task, great Teachers have the ability to nurture with an invisible hand young seeds. Watch his lectures in YouTube and emulate his ways whenever you need to impart any topic in your class, at the workplace, or even with your children. You will be inspired.

285,1439108277,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8742827-jack,5,"A great teacher helps you understandThere’s a difference between knowing a subject and understanding it. You can know physics by being adept at using math and knowing equations well enough to solve problems and still not have a deep understanding of the underlying reasons why things are true. I’ve watched Walter Lewin’s courses and he is one of the best at getting students to see underlying reasons behind physics. By showing people how things work and how truths were derived he communicates some thing far beyond jus learning equations. This book, in a very concise way, does the same thing. It lints the way to understanding. Love the book."
286,1439108277,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6163938-antonis,3,"I discovered Walter Lewin’s MIT lectures on YouTube and I thoroughly enjoyed them. That incited me to buy his book which I found rather disappointing and unbalanced. In roughly the first half of the book, Lewin presents a selection of simple physical concepts illustrating them with everyday examples. The second half of the book, however, is much more autobiographical and exclusively focused on X-ray astronomy, Lewin’s area of research, which is presented in a very detailed manner. I also did not like the tone of the writing: it seems to be assuming that the reader has had no previous exposure to physics and algebra, not even of the high-school variety."
287,1439108277,http://goodreads.com/user/show/37336945-mirco-blaser,4,"A very informative and approach to some very interesting fields of physics. I loved how the enthusiasm from his lectures can be felt in the book as well, you can just tell how much Walter Lewin loves to talk about physics.The first half of the book was a really good read and quite easy to understand too. But unfortunately as soon as he gets into astrophysics and especially x-rays, I felt kind of lost. When you don’t have a background in the field some parts are hard to understand to be honest. Anyway, I still thought this was a great read."
288,1439108277,http://goodreads.com/user/show/27678334-eric,4,"It was good to be forced to re-read and reconsider much of what I have learned from experience and in the physics classroom over the years. Much of the narrative was told with just enough humor to keep it entertaining and enough math to keep it interesting. Towards the end, with what I can only consider his 'side trip' into art, we get a glimpse into Lewin's humanity. If you are a cosmologist with an interest in radio telescopes, this may be your avenue to learn of one of the pioneers of the field, assuming you are not already one of his disciples. Well worth the listen."
289,1439108277,http://goodreads.com/user/show/88546190-harenderjeet-arora,5,"It's a great reflection of the lectures by Professor Walter Lewin. Reading the book is like as if Professor Lewin himself is talking to you. Explanations of various concepts are vivid and easy to understand, even for those who haven't gone through all his lectures. Each chapter unravels the mystery behind various phenomenons like Rainbows, Lightning, X-Rays from outer space, and the list goes on.So if you want to enjoy physics without worrying about dealing with equations, this is the book you should read."

But life is so funny. You get things when you no more find any means of putting them into productive use. Walter Lewin makes the subject so interesting that a physics-phobic like me could breeze through the book without an iota of boredom. I would recommend this book to all teachers dealing with physics and assure that students would fall in love with physics and probably with their teacher too. "

Known for his unique and engaging lectures at MIT, the author tries to explain simple concepts and phenomena such as black holes, x ray astronomy, rainbows, pressure in straws, newton laws, electricity and magnetism, etc in a fun way. It is a part biography of the authors life in astrophysics and teaching while also being popular science book for masses. Worth a read for anyone interested in physics."

Some uncover the beauty of ""mundane"" physics; stuff happening around you right now. You may catch a ""rainbow disease"" but will also gather some evidence that love and physics can go together. This book complements his lectures with a biographical twist. Also sharing his education, interest in art and research on x-ray astronomy."

I've taken that message to heart and have always sought to continue learning throughout my life. Reading this book reminded me of that. Thank you professor Lewin!
