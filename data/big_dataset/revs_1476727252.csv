This book wasn't as research-heavy as Stiff nor was it as focused as Good Mourning but I certainly enjoyed listening it. This one was able to give a fascinating medical examiner's perspective on the deceased.As described in the title, this book covers the bodies Judy Melinek tacked throughout her residency in a New York morgue. She starts with the natural causes, meanders through a few murders and a couple of heart-wrenching cases. All the while she keeps an upbeat tone. Gallows humor, if you will. But, about halfway through the book, all trace of that lightness disappears.9/11 happens and Judy Melinek is in the city. With no one else to turn to, she and the rest of the morgue team has the nearly unimaginable task of processing the twin towers bodies. She was completely overwhelmed and distraught and yet manages to hold her own despite the mountains of bodies in freezers for her to categorize and identify. I felt overwhelmed just reading this. I hadn't read the back of the book before reading this, so I was completely blindsided by the 9/11 tie-in. This is certainly a riveting read - though you may want to read it on an empty stomach if you are squeamish.YouTube | Blog | Instagram | Twitter | Snapchat @miranda.reads Happy Reading!"

It's chock full of interesting deaths and fascinating details on the science of the human body.I was gripped from the first page as Dr. Melinek begins her journey of training to be a medical examiner in New York City, 2001. She obviously found time (who knows how?!?!) to record in her daily journal for two years. Little did she realize she was about to play a crucial part as one of the investigators in America's greatest human tragedy. As a new trainee, she was thrown into 9/11 to sift through semi-truck trailers full of body parts, jet fuel and ash. She relates this horrific experience with humbleness and gratitude for the first responders. It is a sobering, deeply touching account for the reader. The 9/11 section is basically only one chapter of this terrific book. Mostly, the author relays the various stupid things humans do to themselves and each other that cause death. She has strong opinions against suicide (her own father hung himself when she was 13) and I found her candor on the subject profound and endearing. She never comes across as preachy.If you have the stomach for forensic science, I think you will love this book as much as I did. Truly one of the most compelling books I've read in awhile!"
2,1476727252,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5903843-matt,4,"While the world of medicine is likely beyond the comprehension of many, there is always an interest in some of the more bizarre cases that make their way onto the public’s radar. These types of medical situations are anomalies, according to Dr. Judy Melinek, MD and TJ Mitchell, citing that the vast majority of medical cases are not worthy of a script on prime time television. After leaving her surgical residency, Melinek leapt at the chance to enrol in one focussed on pathology, with significant interest in the forensic arm of the field. This led to a two-year fellowship in the Office of the Chief Medical Examiner in New York, where Melinek was able to see some of her most exciting and interesting cases, described throughout the book. While many think of a medical examiner as being one who deals in homicides, Melinek explains that there are many types of life-ending situations that ended up before her. Some were quite serious, including the man who leapt five storeys to his death and fractured numerous bones, while others were overly comical, like the man who died from complications with his metal penile implant. Not only does the job require an examination of the body to determine the matter of death, but can be quite contentious if the family disagrees or the matter makes its way to court. Melinek explains that her job can be quite stressful, especially as the body is not always forthcoming with evidence of what has happened and witnesses can inject their own bias surrounding the events leading to the end of life. Melinek may have a humours side, but her work also subjects her to numerous cases of horrible death or suffering, not the least of which was the fallout of the September 11, 2001 disaster, where she and her team (alongside many others) were tasked with identifying remains and trying to bring closure for many. Full of oddities that many readers will likely feel must be real—as this stuff could never be made up—the book will education as well as entertain the curious reader. Perfect for those who have an affinity for all things medical and enjoy some of the funnier predicaments in which people can find themselves at the point of death. A lighter read for those who want to absorb rather than construct strong opinions. Melinek and Mitchell have created an interesting piece here, serving to dispel the myths of television dramatization of the former’s job as well as presenting some of the more interesting parts of work as a medical examiner. The authors do a masterful job of explaining the medical nuances of the work and injecting a less than intensely serious aspect, which can sometimes help to make the vignettes more alluring. At no time should the reader feel that the profession is anything but serious, though there are so many interesting files that must cross the desk of a medical examiner that they are forced to find some of the lighter sides to get through the day. I can only suspect that many of the names (and some facts) have been fudged, as the authors freely offer names and situations to help the reader feel as though they are in the middle of the situation at hand. Told in a straightforward manner with some medical jargon (which is fully explained), the reader is given a decent dose of the profession without drowning in the minutiae. Melinek and Mitchell divide the book’s chapter’s up to discuss a specific theme and choose a central case, whose narrative builds throughout, as well as some minor side vignettes to exemplify some of the arguments being presented. This not only allows the reader to have a better handle on the topic, but see it from multiple perspectives. As I am a big fan of forensic medicine, this book was right up my alley and served as a wonderful way to sit back and relax after some high-intensity reading of late.Kudos, Dr. Melinek and Mr. Mitchell, for this wonderful piece, that served the purpose I needed. I will keep my eyes open for anything else you may write, though will steer clear of any medical journals, even though some of the findings would surely be eye-opening. Love/hate the review?

3,1476727252,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2172096-barbara,4,"4.5 starsThe work of a medical examiner (ME) is endlessly fascinating to the public, as evidenced by the many TV shows that feature forensic pathologists - like Quincy; Law and Order; CSI; NCIS; Rizzoli and Isles; Hawaii-Five-O and others. In fiction, pathologists often resolve their cases quickly - making lightning fast determinations, intuiting what happened, and (often) nabbing the culprit themselves.This is very different from real life, where toxicology and DNA tests take months to process, coroners' findings are relayed to police detectives, and the cops (hopefully) nab the perp. Moreover, in reality, most deaths are due to natural causes, disease, accidents, undetected anatomical defects, mental illness, and so on - and no crimes are involved.In this enlightening and entertaining book, Dr. Judy Melinek describes her two years as a forensic pathology fellow at the 'Office of the Chief Medical Examiner' (OCME) in New York, where she honed her chops as an ME. Dr. Judy MelinekThe ME's job is to determine the cause and manner of death in cases where the deceased dies suddenly, violently, unexpectedly, in suspicious circumstances, etc.When Melinek graduated from UCLA Medical School in 1996, she wanted to be a surgeon. The surgical residency was grueling, however, and Melinek feared making a mistake that would kill a patient. Thus, Melinek switched her specialty to forensic pathology. Melinek's interest in the field may have stemmed, in part, from the suicide of her father at age 38, when she was 13 years old - an event she discusses extensively in the book.Melinek, her husband J.T. Mitchell (the co-author of this book), and their baby Daniel settled down in New York in 2001.Dr. Judy Melinek and her husband J.T. Mitchell There, Melinek began work at the OCME under the tutelage of Dr. Charles Hirsch - whom she describes as ""a pipe-smoking, avuncular doctor out of a Norman Rockwell painting."" Dr. Charles HirschAmong other things, Hirsch held morning rounds and afternoon rounds, at which the medical examiners presented their findings and discussed what to write on death certificates about the cause and manner of death. These determinations were made using a variety of means, such as: the autopsy; visiting the death scene; reviewing medical records; speaking to witnesses; consulting detectives; and so on.....all while collecting evidence that might be used in court.When assigned a body to autopsy, the first thing an ME does is examine the person's external characteristics, and make a record of bruises, cuts, scrapes, scars, tattoos, burns, needle marks, and so on. The ME then goes on to probe the inside of the body, and these procedures are thoroughly described in the book.Medical examiner noting a body's external characteristicsDuring her two years at the OCME Melinek worked on a wide variety of cases, including victims of the World Trade Center disaster; people who contracted anthrax from a bioterrorism scare; and bodies from American Airlines Flight 587 - which crashed in NYC. To provide a feel for Melinek's job, I'll give examples of some of the cases she worked on or observed.Cable GuyA man dubbed 'Cable Guy' smoked crystal meth before walking his dogs, and accidentally locked himself out of his 9th floor apartment. Instead of calling a locksmith, Cable Guy tied his dogs to the doorknob, went up to the roof, tied a cable around his chest, and tried to rappel down to his open window one floor down. The cable broke and the man fell to his death. Melinek's autopsy showed a fractured skull and shattered ribs that cut through the victim's lungs, esophagus, aorta, and pulmonary artery. The death was ruled accidental. The dogs were fine.Grisly Industrial AccidentAn egg roll factory has a combination shredder-mixer that fills a whole room. The shredder in a Manhattan plant blew apart while spinning, and sent the central drum and blade flying. The blade amputated the arm of one worker, and shrapnel injured two other employees. The metal cylinder landed on the upper chest and neck of a fourth worker, who was pinned to the floor and crushed. Melinek found that the man's head was uninjured and he was fully conscious until he died of suffocation. The unfortunate victim's death was ruled accidental.AlcoholismMelinek performed scores of autopsies on people who died of acute or chronic alcohol intoxication. Melinek's last autopsy in New York was on a victim who died of acute AND chronic alcohol poisoning. A man's dead body was found on the steps of a church in winter. After getting the results of toxicological tests, Melinek determined that the deceased - a chronic alcoholic who had lived on the streets for 30 years - was fall down drunk when he fell asleep and died of hypothermia. The death was ruled an accident.Drug OverdoseDeaths from a drug overdose are fairly common, the typical victim being young and otherwise healthy. To fill out the death certificate, Melinek would usually just wait for the toxicology report and write in the cause of death. Drug overdose autopsies were usually quick and easy.....unless the family of the victim couldn't accept the truth.Robert Ward was a 28-year-old white man with a history of alcoholism and drug abuse. One day Robert went out with friends, and was later found dead in his apartment. His mom, Mrs. Ward, didn't want her son autopsied: ""Don't touch my baby."" An autopsy was required by law, however, and the toxicology report took four months to reach Melinek's office.During that time Mrs. Ward called Melinek at least twice a week, insisting 'Bobby didn't do drugs', and offering other theories for his death. These included: bad sushi, poisonous beer, misuse of a friend's asthma medication, anthrax, Nyquil, and dust mites.When the toxicology report was finally completed, it showed a lethal concoction of heroin, cocaine, and the sedative diazepam.....and Melinek ruled Ward's death an accident. However Mrs. Ward couldn't let it go, and now insisted that Bobby's death was a homicide, the fault of the dealer who sold him the drugs.The Bucket BugabooA police officer brought the OCME a goop-filled bucket that looked like it might contain a dead fetus. An ME carefully emptied the pail, which contained a statuette of kissing angels, maraschino cherries, and a couple of two-foot-long donkey dongs. No fetus. The consensus was that this was probably a Santeria love potion.....not a case for the OCME. (LOL)SuicidesMelinek saw many suicides. These cases were fairly easy to diagnose, especially when they required premeditation and planning - like suicide by hanging, which causes ligature marks on the neck and purple hands and feet. Other suicides during Melinek's tenure at the OCME included people who jumped into the East River, and victims who leapt from the balcony of the Marriott Marquis Hotel in Times Square. The hotel jumpers might have expected a smooth fall to the ground, but they generally pinballed and bumped into structures, severing their limbs and scattering their brains all over.Sometimes apparent 'suicides' were actually homicides or accidents, and the ME's final determination depended on investigation of the death scene; information provided by families and police detectives; a suicide note; and so on.Attack on the World Trade CenterOn September 11, 2001 - nine weeks after Melinek started work at the OCME - two planes collided with the World Trade Center, causing thousands of deaths. The bodies of the victims came to the OCME, and Melinek was one of 30 doctors who worked to identify the remains and assemble evidence of mass murder. Many of the victims had been smashed to bits, and the MEs had to treat each specimen - be it a hand, a toe, a scrap of tissue, etc. - as if it were an entire body.....the goal being to identify the deceased.The bodies and body parts arrived by the truckload, and after DNA was collected, each 'specimen' was assigned to an ME. Melinek's first 'body' was a smashed head and torso - limbs gone, body missing below the naval - which was burned black and smelled of jet fuel. The MEs' sole task was identification, so each doctor tried to use fingerprints, distinguishing marks, personal possessions - whatever they could find - to ID the victims. This was a daunting task that took eight months, during which 'ordinary' autopsies also had to be done. Needless to say, Melinek and her colleagues were overwhelmed.Anthrax ScareThe World Trade Center situation was exacerbated by the anthrax scare, which began a week after 9/11. Someone started sending letters containing anthrax germs to news agencies in New York and Florida, and to politicians in Washington DC. Several people died, and the OCME began to get myriad phone calls from frightened citizens. Moreover, the OCME's technicians were too scared to assist with autopsies, so Melinek and the other MEs had to work alone (or assist each other).Plane CrashAs if 9/11 and the anthrax scare weren't bad enough, New York experienced a major plane wreck in November, 2001. American Airlines Flight 587 crashed soon after taking off from JFK International Airport, killing all 261 souls aboard, as well as five people on the ground. Again the victims' remains were taken to the OCME, where the mauled, twisted, charred, kerosene-contaminated body parts were identified. The cause of the crash - at first thought to be terrorism - was determined to be pilot error.In spite of it all, Melinek enjoyed her job and the 'trial by fire' she endured while working at the OCME. During her time there, Melinek performed 262 autopsies, made 13 court appearances, and had another baby. After completing her two-year fellowship in forensic pathology in 2002, Melinek did a one-year fellowship in neuropathology, then took a job in San Jose, California. Since then Melinek has performed thousands more autopsies.In summary, Melinek notes that she loves the work, the medicine, and the science; she also loves the non-medical aspects of the job, including counseling families, collaborating with detectives, and testifying in court. Sounds good to me!I enjoyed the book, which contains numerous compelling stories about Melinek's - and her colleagues - work, as well as amusing tidbits about the authors' personal lives. I'd recommend this memoir to everyone interested in forensic pathology.You can follow my reviews at https://reviewsbybarbsaffer.blogspot...."
4,1476727252,http://goodreads.com/user/show/45248887-greta-g,4,"A long time ago, I had to attend an autopsy for my work, concerning a case of a fatal accident. I wasn't glad with it, because the only time I saw a dead person up until then, was some 15 years earlier, when I was twelve. It was my nephew, of the same age, who had died in the bathroom after he fell while bathing and broke his neck. I still remember it clearly because we (my dad and I) had to wait in the hospital for about an hour and I was really nervous by the time we could visit him. I ran away in panic from the morgue in the hospital, horrified by the view of my dead nephew. They hadn't succeeded in closing his eyes properly, so one eye was closed and the other eye was still open. And it seemed like he was looking at me with this one, lifeless eye. So I left the room, shocked with this view. When I got in the corridor, there was a man whose half face and neck where covered with a horrible birthmark. At that particular moment, it scared the hell out of me. So that was my first experience with a dead person, and that really gave me a scare. I ended up sending a colleague from the office to attend the autopsy, because at the last moment I was too anxious to go myself. The only dead persons I saw later in my life were my parents, after they deceased in the hospital. I came across more cases where unnatural death was involved for my work, but reading about those deaths, and even looking at photographs, however horrific, didn't scare me very much because I was able to objectify all this gruesome stuff (and omit the worst details ;)Although I'm scared to death about death, I'm also attracted to it. After all, we all have to die. It's not a happy thought, for none of us, but we all hope we will die quietly, without pain and anxiety, in our own bed, while we're sleeping. Or just drop dead somewhere and die instantly, in a flash. Get it over and done with quickly. But that's not always the case. As a matter of fact, dying can be very traumatic. And probably few people know this better than a Medical Examiner. Hospital pathologists perform autopsies only on patients who have died of natural causes. A Medical Examiner investigates traumatic deaths, but also natural deaths when they are sudden or unexpected, and they perform autopsies in order to identify the cause of death (medical reason) and the manner of death, which can be natural, an accident, a homicide, a suicide, an overdose, a therapeutic complication, a medical negligence or of ""undetermined etiology"" (this translates as ""fuck-if-I-know""). Judy Melinek, the author of this book, writes about her experiences during her 2-year fellowship as a forensic pathologist at the New York City Office of Chief Medical Examiner (OCME). She didn't start off wanting to be a forensic pathologist. She wanted to be a surgeon and heal people. But she quitted her surgery residency because she wasn't happy with the highly demanding training. She ended up loving her work as a pathologist, as she's happy to learn something new about the human body every day. But she also loves the non-medical aspects of the job ; the counseling of families, collaborating with detectives, testifying in court. She loves her task of performing the last and most thorough physical exam a person will ever have and figuring out what went wrong in the body. This love for her work shines through on every page of this book. Her book is a dead honest testimony of her work. Each body tells a story, she says, and she shares these stories with us, readers. There's the miserable story of a man, freezing to death ;The story of a man rescued from a fire in his home, only to die three hours later ;The story of a pregnant woman who died after a hit-and-run car accident ; The story of a man with an eggshell skull fracture ;The sudden death of a schizophrenic woman ;A young man struck by lightning ; Stories of drug abuse ;A floater ;Several homicides ;Several suicides ;A case of anthrax poisoning ; Unsettling stories of the handling of the remains from the 9/11 victims ;A couple of cases of death as a result of medical or surgical intervention and a case of medical screwup. These stories are engagingly told and are sometimes really witty, for instance the case of the ""cable guy""(view spoiler)[This guy had been smoking crystal meth and took his two dogs on a walk. When he returned, he found he had locked himself out of his ninth-floor apartment. Instead of calling a locksmith, he formulated a plan. He tied the dogs to the doorknob, went up to the roof, and pried open the television cable distribution box. Then he unplugged a coaxial cable and tied it around his chest. He then stepped over to the edge of the roof and began to lower himself down, to his open apartment window. The coaxial cable broke under his weight, and he fell eight stories and landed on the sidewalk. That was a really bad plan! (hide spoiler)] sometimes heartbreaking, but always captivating. It's a very unique and personal book, and I highly recommend it. 8/10"
5,1476727252,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1237196-petra-x,5,"I am so enjoying this book. The author has this strangely cheery tone. She loves her job and the corpses and loves especially discussing really bad wounds and how the people (whom she generally addresses by their first names) got them. Very odd. Maybe this is how professional pathologists and other forensic professionals really are and they are just kind of serious and sad in front of us ""civilians""."
6,1476727252,http://goodreads.com/user/show/32532051-montzalee-wittmann,5," Working Stiff: Two Years, 262 Bodies, and the Making of a Medical Examiner by Judy Melinek, T.J. Mitchell, Tanya Eby (Narrator) is a terrific audio book I picked up from the library! Wow! I have been a RN all my life and now retired but those faint of heart may not be able to read this. It is a bit detailed at what a medical examiner really does for a living and not the TV version. I was fascinated and horrified at some of the things that came through, maybe not at the bodies but what people do to people or what people will do to get out of work. This only covers the time she is at New York but it is during that time that the World Trade Center is hit. The tragic and gruesome chapters there were jarring. This is a book I am glad I came across. None of the details of the work bothered me having seen so much in my life as a nurse but just want to warn those with stomachs weaker than mine to be warned. Great book, hope everyone that can read it, will. It is the audio version and the narrator was perfect for this book, spot on!"
7,1476727252,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1849990-carole,5,"Working Stiff: Two Years, 262 Bodies, and the Making of a Medical Examiner by Judy Melinek and T.J. Mitchell is a fascinating look into the world of a New York City medical examiner. Melinek hits the ground running in her new position examining victims of suicide, accidents, homicide and all forms of violent deaths. She also visits scenes where the bodies have been found. The book is written with a sense of dark humour, but is not offensive or disrespectful of the deceased that find their way to her examining table. Major events in NYC are depicted such as 9/11. The book demonstrates that the life of a medical examiner is not as easy or glamorous as we see repeatedly on tv or film. It is difficult, painstaking work that most of us can only imagine. Though the subject matter is serious, Dr. Melinek has written an enthralling account of the work she does. Highly recommended."
8,1476727252,http://goodreads.com/user/show/695116-jim,4,"A very good book that's guaranteed to ruin CSI for you. (I quit watching years ago.) She does a great job describing what a busy city morgue is like. How she manages to wait for months for paperwork, deals with the crazed public, overworked police, & more just popped so realistically. A 'rush' on a tox screen meant only waiting a week, while a month wasn't unusual. She had to balance knowing part of the picture with releasing the body to relatives while accurately assessing the sort of death it was. Far too often, she only knows half the story & has to move on. Sometimes she comes in on the second half.Her statistics on suicides & attempts were interesting. IIRC, men manage to kill themselves 3 times as often as women, but women make 3 times as many attempts. They're just not very good at it, while guys seem to be good at it even when they don't mean to be. Yet more proof that the sexes are equal, but certainly not the same.How a death certificate is filled out & why was somewhat different than I thought. What constitutes accidental death, homicide, & medical misadventure was interesting. There were far fewer murders than I thought there would be, but some of the stories were pretty horrific. She does a good job describing what she could determine & what she couldn't. Fascinating.Her husband & co-writer T.J. Mitchell must be quite a guy. The chapter on her work during 9/11 & some of the stories she brought home would have had me hovering like a helicopter. I loved the way he supported her.She could certainly cuss like a sailor at times. Can't say as I blame her. Not a lot of it in the book, but she certainly didn't clean anything up for the squeamish. Her descriptions were accurate & sometimes quite grotesque. Probably not a good book to read during lunch.She dwells a bit too much on her father's suicide. While I learned quite a bit the first time she mentioned it, by the end of the book, I was pretty tired of hearing about it.Overall, very well read & a good book. It didn't seem all that long for all that it covered. Highly recommended.20150619 - I just had to add a link to a Cracked.com article: ""We Light Your Scrotum On Fire: 6 Realities Of The Morgue""http://www.cracked.com/personal-exper...Read at your own risk.

9,1476727252,http://goodreads.com/user/show/12620745-debbie-dj,4,"Can I just say OMG!I learned a lot about exactly what a forensic pathologist does, and let me just say again, OMG!Judy Melinek details every sort of disease and injury possible in a human body. Her account of her very worst case almost had me doubled over, but I was also fascinated. Hmm, not sure what this says about me!I've got to mention her account of 9/11 as she was one of the pathologists involved in trying to identify all the bodies. Her details and descriptions were more horrifying than anything I have ever read. Definitely not for the faint of heart, but truly captivating!"
10,1476727252,http://goodreads.com/user/show/479633-eva,3,"3.5 stars. The memoirs of a forensic pathologist during the years of her fellowship, which placed her in NYC during the September 11 terrorist attack, helping to tag, bag, and attempt to identify the remains of victims from the WTC (as well as seeing an anthrax victim, and helping autopsy victims of a infamous plane crash.) It was co-written by her husband, who has an English degree from Harvard (more about that later).Disclaimer: I am a medical doctor, but I am a geriatric psychiatrist. I had to attend autopsies as part of my medical school curriculum, and since we get all the questionable deaths in the state of New Mexico at our Office of the Medical Investigator, I had the privilege of seeing 1 natural death, 3 homicides, and 3 suicides, including one ""decomp"", on the day I was there. I also was informed there was a bag of bones someone had found in a barn they thought might be human, and attended a brain cutting where the brain of a 22 week gestation fetus was sliced, as well as a man who had a fungal infection that was easily visible in many of the slices. So, I have some context for picturing the stuff she's talking about in this book. (Although she talks about how respectful they are with the deceased's testicles....that must vary from location to location, since in one of the suicides I saw that was clearly a gun shot wound to the head, the pathologist still removed both testicles and sliced them up completely. Anyway. Minor point.)To end the disclaimer, I thought autopsies were pretty disgusting. I respect what forensic pathologists do, but I have no illusions about the nitty-gritty of autopsies. That said, I thought she did a great job describing for the lay person what an autopsy is like, what the point of it is, the legal implications of the death determination, etc. And she certainly had a lot of fascinating cases and unusual experiences. The book is very readable and, if you're OK with icky, often quite entertaining and thought-provoking.My critcisms of the book are basically two- first, that it really does read as if it were written by two people, yet always in the first person singular, which made it feel kind of awkwardly constructed to me. It's always the author speaking, but it feels like she would write up an interesting case she saw, then her husband would come behind and add the finishing English major touches to take it from being too much physician speak and more accessible to the general reader. ""Ummm, hon, that part was great, but we're kind of going to alienate the readers if we don't throw in a warm, humanistic anecdote right about now to soften the part about the maggots eating the guy's eyeballs."" I can't be sure that's how it was or how much of the writing and editing he did, but based on the different tones of certain sections of the book, I get the feeling he did a lot of work- I mean, he's essentially listed as a coauthor. Secondly, the author is certainly more than entitled to personal feelings and reactions to all of the experiences she had. However, she herself goes to great pains to emphasize the necessity of objectivity when speaking as a physician, and not rushing to judgment. As a physician who works with mentally ill patients, I want to emphasize that it is *not* the consensus of the medical community that people who commit suicide are selfish, which the author states she believes over and over again. I understand that she feels that way (""It's a goddamned selfish act, suicide, if you ask me"" ""He was sober. I couldn't blame drugs. I could only and still blame [her father]"") and as I said, she is entitled to her feelings, including anger toward her father.I just wish that when writing this book, she had gone to greater lengths to separate out her feelings about the suicide of her father as an individual from her knowledge about mental illness as a physician and scientist. There is a lot of research on suicide out there, and a lot of correlations between certain risk factors and completed or attempted suicides, and I have never seen any studies correlating levels of selfishness with suicidality (not really sure how you'd conduct such a study, but I digress). I'll just stop there because this is not the forum for reviewing the latest research into the causes and prevention of suicide, but suffice it to say that judging and shaming people who are having suicidal ideation by telling them how ""selfish"" they are is unlikely to prevent a single person suffering from depression from killing themselves.I mean, she passes harsher judgment upon people- especially fathers of teenage girls- who commit suicide than she does on a woman who murders her 4 year old, drug traders who torture someone and garrot them, or terrorists who commit mass murder or mail anthrax to innocent people. The lashing out against suicides was the antithesis of the objective, accepting tone of the rest of the book, and it was pretty jarring. You can try to empathize with a child abuser or crack addict, but no mercy for suicidal people? Ouch.Overall a decently written and engaging book for any reader interested in the topic."

Judy Melinek is my Patronus!Yes, that feels right.Goddamn, this was some good stuff.Dr. Judy Melinek – amazing human being and most badass bitch I’ve read about it since I can’t even remember when – takes you on a journey through the first two years of her career after she started a forensic pathology fellowship at the Office of the Chief Medical Examiner in New York City.I swear to Jebus, this bitch is living the dreams I would have had if I hadn’t recognized early on in my life that I have zero talent or brain cells dedicated to understanding science.The romanticized/dramatized version of being an M.E. is that it’s all homicides all the time, and that you’re in the shit with the detectives solving crimes.And that’s really not at all accurate. I mean I totally knew that on a logically level, but I still love those crime shows. So sue me.Truly, I think the hardest part about being an M.E. would be all the times you don’t get to be a part of unravelling the full mystery of what happened to someone. There were multiple times in this book where Dr. M had to just say “okay, that’s it” even though she knew there was more to discover, or that the detectives weren’t doing their jobs fully. That would be wildly frustrating to me, so maybe it’s a good thing I’m a dumb-dumb.Despite Dr. M spending most of her time doing autopsies on seemingly regular deaths – drug overdoses, alcoholics, car accidents and medical complications – trust me when I say, it is still a completely engaging ride and that will never bore you. I was totally into every case discussed and every medical explanation thrown my way. It is just completely chalked full of compelling stories and autopsies and the unique characters who surrounded her at work.Dr. M makes pathology more fun or more humbling than any show on TV has ever managed.And she does it by simply being honest. Honest about the struggles, the completely gross-out moments, the heartbreaking moments and the frustrating ones.She talks about how the uterus of a pregnant woman ejected from her body after a plane crash. She talks about a man who died from complications due to his penile implant. She talks about the constant phone calls from parents who would beg her to change the cause of death on a death certificate because they just couldn’t accept that their child had willingly done drugs and overdosed. And she talks about the work she did during 9-11.This section of the book was the shortest, but it was the most powerful for me. Dr. M and a team of pathologist worked for endless hours trying to piece together the identities of those who passed at the twin towers.It really shed a light on the work that officials did and the mental toll it took on them. There’s some part of me that just never thought about the medical, more behind-the-scenes side of that event.Dr. M explains how sometimes all they had to work with to identify a victim was a hand or a body part or a wedding ring with an engraving. There were so many bodies that they would be delivered to the team of pathologists on construction trucks. There was so little space to store everything that the bodies were then kept in the trucks, instead of in pathology coolers, as they tried to sort out bones and fragments and organs and limbs. Certain trucks would be only for separated random bodies parts. Other trucks would be for intact bodies that could be identified. There were trucks that held only firefighters and police officers who had died working through the disaster.Omg, and then there was anthrax! She was even involved in an anthrax attack!GUYS. THIS IS JUST. SO. FUN.You know, fun in a totally tragic kind of way. I’m not crazy.Through all of the “shop-talk” and explanation of what it means to do her job overall, Dr. M injects personal opinions and information about herself, her marriage and her children, that served to ground the book and add a layer of humanity to the otherwise gruesome, and sometimes funny, stories.I feel like I know Dr. M and that I understand what it means to do the work she does; how many facets there are to it, which are much more than just TV show entertainment.From the medical and science-side, to the human side where she councils families and is a shoulder to cry on or is a punching bag, down to the legal side of working with law enforcement and testifying in court.This was a super insightful and fulfilling read for me and I have nothing but praise for the woman behind the words. If you have any interest whatsoever in forensic science, read this book!⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ | 5 stars."
12,1476727252,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5875398-rebecca,4,"If you, like me, have a morbid fascination with the mechanics and aftermath of death (see 
The Removers
 by Andrew Meredith), you should love this book. Melinek is a forensic pathologist whose father committed suicide – perhaps an early source of her obsession with dead bodies. An exchange with her husband (co-writer T.J. Mitchell) early on gives a flavor of her macabre tone: “‘We even call it an “eggshell skull fracture.” Isn’t that cool?’ ‘No,’ T.J. replied, suddenly ashen. ‘No, it isn’t.’ I’m not a ghoulish person. I’m a guileless, sunny optimist, in fact.”Over her two years with New York City’s Office of the Chief Medical Examiner, 2000-2002, Melinek performed 262 autopsies, 27 of them on homicides. Regarding bullet wounds, she writes: “Fishing around inside a dead guy for a little chunk of jagged metal that can cut right through my gloves and skin is one workplace challenge I wish I didn’t face.” The Worst Way to Die that she ever observed (because people do persist in asking her the question) was a guy thrown down a manhole – he basically steamed alive; his organs and blood vessels all cooked solid, like sausage meat.Most notably, Melinek spent eight months identifying 9/11 remains at NYC tent stations. Passersby wouldn’t have known that those lines of trailers all held bodies – or, rather, partial bodies: “Truck One held whole bodies; Truck Two, bodies that were not complete; Truck Three, body parts; and Truck Four held fragments.” She also had one case towards the beginning of the anthrax outbreak.Only once did my curiosity shade into disgust, and that was with this passage on household pets: “Your faithful golden retriever might sit next to your dead body for days, starving, but the tabby won’t. Your pet cat will eat you right away, with no qualms at all. Like any opportunistic scavenger, it will start with your eyeballs and lips. I’ve seen the result.” I certainly had cause to look askance at my cat after that.Many people’s interest will have been piqued by forensics dramas on TV, but bear in mind that this is more House than CSI: blackly humorous writing about the human body, including some medical whodunits. “Mine is a gruesome job, but for a scientist with a love for the mechanics of the human body, a great one.” Melinek largely avoids jargon and doctor-speak, making this a very reader-friendly, enjoyable memoir.In the end, I was left with just two questions: How much did her stay-at-home dad husband contribute? And why did she wait so long before publishing this book? The 2001 material is intriguing, but starts to seem dated. (Perhaps she waited over a decade to let the pain of 9/11 become less raw?) In any case, better late than never."

Forensic Pathologists study the causes and effects of human diseases and injury in this UNPUTDOWNABLE non-fiction novel that I found extremely interesting, informative and, at times, SCARY AS HELL! It had me thinking about what I put in my body for sustenance, checking out the whites of my eyes and worrying about occasional slightly swollen ankles.Be forewarned this book is not for those with a weak constitution as there are very graphic descriptions of numerous autopsies and real life accident and murder scenes.....some that will break your heart, and others (view spoiler)[like maggots scurrying about under the clothes of dead bodies (hide spoiler)] that will give you the creeps; AND if you want to know the worst way to die a pathologist has ever seen, it too will be described here. (view spoiler)[(oh the poor young man who was steamed alive like a lobster) (hide spoiler)]Some explanations of the mechanics of the human body are truly remarkable, and the clues pathologists find hidden in a cadaver are quite amazing, but (being a cat lover and owner) there is one comparison I will NEVER EVER forget.....(view spoiler)[ a faithful dog might lovingly lay by its master's side and starve itself while you lay dead, but a cat, being a scavenger, will eat you right away starting with your eyeballs and lips with no qualms at all! Ewwwww!>(I plan to have a chat with Maggie the cat) (hide spoiler)]After reading this well-written and enlightening novel, I have a new respect for Pathologists everywhere as I have always wondered why and how they can deal with cadavers day after day, and that answer is here too......to help the living.......and, last but not least, I must end by saying that the portion of this book relating to the treatment of the victims of 9-11 was pretty hard to take, but written in a respectful and heartfelt manner. (as was the entire book)Highly recommend this fascinating debut, and hope to see more from this author(s)."

She moves there with her husband TJ and young son Daniel and begins her work at the Office of the Chief Medical Examiner. I became so engrossed in listening to the different cases, that I ended up staying up all night listening to the entire thing.I try not to read too much of the hype info before I get into the book, so I wasn’t aware of the 2 disasters that she worked on in the two years she worked there, plus the anthrax thing. It was mind-blowing the experiences she had in her time there and the amount she grew as a professional. I found this to be a very moving and amazing look at a medical examiner’s office and work behind the scenes as to what they do and how they operate. She had some great teachers and mentors there that gave her invaluable advice. I just love this kind of book.My BookZone blog review:https://wordpress.com/post/bookblog20..."

Fiction, sci-fi, fantasy, young adult, biographies, science, history... You name it!But there’s no denying that some are a lot easier to read than others. While I love reading about people’s lives and absorbing facts, I’d be kidding myself if I thought those books took the same amount of time or effort as a well written novel. No matter how well written said non-fiction book is in and of itself. Working Stiff was different. It could be the fact that I always wanted to get into forensics, or my own morbid fascination with the things people do to one another. It could be that it was written in a way that is accessible to the layperson, and that the grouping similar manners of death led to fewer chapters and a very smooth read. Whatever the cause, I devoured this book!The rest of this review can be found here!"

Mitchell, have written a superb book about Dr. Melinek's experience as a forensic pathologist in NYC. She discusses the horrible and hectic time right after 9-11 and gives experienced insight into the many cases--including similarities and differences--on which she's worked. This book is a valuable reference that contains many movingly true stories."

Had to stop reading early on after the author made the following statement regarding a cancer patient who took his own life: ""He had also left a suicide note to his wife, telling her she shouldn't have to nurse him through another course of chemo. But suicide is a selfish act, and he wasn't really thinking about her."" I know the author was writing from a place still affected by the experience with her own father (she wrote about him on pg. 37: ""He was probably thinking, as my first suicide case was probably thinking, 'She'll be better off without me.' But no. That perspective is self-absorbed and misguided."") I truly sympathize, but I also found it both misinformed and downright irresponsible for a medical professional to put forth statements like that as fact without even considering additional background information. Just couldn't read the rest. "

She uproots her family and moves to New York, beginning her training two months before September 11th.Nobody cares about when you're alive, but lots of people take interest when you are dead.I wasn't sure what to expect from this book. I expected some good advice.Don't jaywalk. Use your seatbelt when you drive. Better yet, stay out of your car and get some exercise. Watch your weight. If you are a smoker, stop right now. Guns put holes in people.I also expected to be scared A LOT by the various ways you could suddenly wind up on an autopsy table. And while she does touch on one of the worst ways in her opinion to die, most of her encounters with the dead were easily avoidable.Staying alive, as it turns out, is mostly common sense.And I expected to learn some fascinating and disgusting things about the human body. Like how hairless shins with a variety of other things is a symptom of heart failure.But all expectations aside hearing the struggle of balancing being a mother, a wife and a woman who deals with death daily quickly made this an engrossing read. It isn't all about the bodies. It is also about the woman behind the bodies. Holding the scalpel.However the chapter on being a pathologist in New York during the events of September 11, 2001 was probably the toughest part of this book to read and ultimately the most powerful. I'd recommend this for that part alone. You didn't hear a lot about the medical examiners after the events, but ultimately they gave a lot of relief to a lot of families.I am just glad I didn't read this before my son's ""minor surgery"". Or I would have been a wreck.Minor surgery is surgery someone else has."

""Taceant colloquia. Effugiat risus. Hic locus est ubi mors gaudet succurrere vitae.""
 -- posted at the lobby wall of the Office of Chief Medical Examiner of the City of New York (*translation: ""Let conversation cease. Let laughter flee. This is the place where death delights to help the living."")After graduating from UCLA's medical school in the mid-90's Dr. Judy Melinek began a surgical residency in her husband's hometown of Boston. After a year she soured on the almost-unrealistic demands and fatigue that came with such a position. She then switched to forensic pathology, and spent four years as a resident at UCLA before accepting a position in New York City's Office of Chief Medical Examiner (""New York OCME was the place to pursue [the career]"") in the summer of 2001.Dr. Melinek gives the reader a vivid front-row seat to her experiences as an assistant medical examiner, detailing the procedures and several of the unique cases she was involved in during her two years at NY-OCME. She dispels some of the myths / inaccuracies (such as ""everyone thinks 'murder' when you say you work as a medical examiner, but [actual] homicides are rare"") usually shown in TV crime series. It is presented in a straightforward and comprehensible manner, while she also displays a steady sense of humor (also shared by her numerous and dependable colleagues) and often mentions her loving family, and both sound critical to have to work in such as position.The approximate last quarter of the book focuses on her office's work in the immediate aftermath of 9/11 and the subsequent, long-running investigation. Though this was of course one of America's worst days in recent memory, the important work performed by Dr. Melinek and OCME spanned several months. Like one of the review blurbs said, it was indeed ""morbidly fascinating"" about how the medical examiner's office dealt with the sudden and massive influx of bodies and body parts.I understand that Melinek's next project (again with husband / co-author TJ Mitchell) is a ""medical examiner - detective fiction series."" This should give Patricia Cornwell some cause for concern. :-)"

But this..THIS....is all of that and more! Descriptive stories and backgrounds of Dr. Melinek's cases kept me turning the pages and bf I knew it I really couldn't put it down! This is definitely NOT for the weak stomachs..I loss my appetite a few times throughout the book...BUT..I would not change that for anything! I LEARNED SO MUCH! The amount of detail and time in which Dr. Melinek spent on these cases in her book was just right! There is a chapter on 9/11...(yes, she worked at the NYC Medical Examiners office during that time) it is shocking and horribly tragic but really puts into perspective what they would not report about on television...and for good reason! I knew it was bad but the stories she shares coming to her from the ""pile"" are earth shattering. I HIGHLY recommend this book. 5+ stars. I only wish it was longer and she could've dove into more of her cases!! "

Her job is to determine cause of death and she discusses many of her cases, including murders, suicides, accidents, natural death and more.She was part of the 9/11 recovery team and gives a heart-rending account of the process of finding human remains, categorizing them and returning confirmation to the families anxiously awaiting news of their loved one.If you are curious, like me, and can handle blood, guts and carnage then this extremely informative and captivating book is not to be missed."
24,1476727252,http://goodreads.com/user/show/39353094-diabolica,4,"Hands down I think this is one of the best books I've ever read containing factual medical information. Despite her introduction, preparing readers for a disaster, I was launched into stories of each autopsy and their medical counterparts and Melinek's own takeaways from each case. I've never had a novel change the career I'd wanted to pursue, but this book has definitely caused me to start thinking about my options. Melinek's descriptions are true and accurate, but by no means are they boring. Not to mention, she does not skip out on the gorier bits about her job: the smell, the nauseating maggots, and the grief that can come with some cases. Melinek does an amazing job of capturing her job, and its effect on her personal life too. "
25,1476727252,http://goodreads.com/user/show/34744063-captive-audience,1,"WARNING: This book treats suicide in a very offhanded, offensive manner. If you have ever dealt with suicide or had suicidal thoughts and that sort of attitude might cause problems for you, I STRONGLY RECOMMEND that you pass on reading it.There. That’s the TL;DR version out of the way. Now let’s get into the meat and potatoes of why I dislike this book, and with another warning: I will be directly quoting this author’s statements about suicide. Please don’t read on if you think it’s going to upset you.(view spoiler)[I ended up having to quit. I wanted to like it, I really did. I think books like this are fascinating. I really enjoyed Stiff by Mary Roach. And most of it was okay, but her attitude toward suicide is... well, let's use her own word: selfish. She doesn't consider – or the occasional time she does, she makes it clear she doesn’t care - what suicides have to be going through in order to take such a drastic step. She thinks only of her own experience, which was her own father. And you know what, it's understandable that she should be angry, that she should have a harder time with suicides than other deaths, whatever. But if she can call suicide 'selfish' based on a single personal experience with it, I have certainly earned the right in return to call her thoughtless for waving off such a horrible thing as suicide with a single word – and such a judgmental, dismissive, callous word.And it isn't just once. Every damn time the subject comes up she seems to feel the need to remind us of her opinion. But let’s begin with her beginning:My father committed suicide at age thirty-eight. I was thirteen.People kept coming up to me during his funeral and saying the same thing: “I’m so sorry.” I hated that. It roused me out of my numbness, to anger. All I could think to say was, “Why are you saying you’re sorry? It’s not your fault!” It was his fault alone. My father was a psychiatrist and knew full well, professionally and personally, that he should have sought help. He knew the protocol; he had asked his own patients the three diagnostic questions all of us learn in medical school when we believe someone is having suicidal ideations. First, “Do you want to hurt yourself or kill yourself?” If the answer is yes, then you are supposed to ask, “Do you have a plan?” If again the patient answers yes, the final question is, “What is that plan?” If your patient has a credible suicide plan, he or she needs to be hospitalized. My father’s suicide plan was to hang himself, an act that requires considerable determination. After he succeeded in carrying out that plan, I spent many years angry at him, for betraying himself and for abandoning me.""Now that is awful. I really do feel for that poor 13 year old girl that was dealt such an awful, tragic blow. And I can understand why she might have spent many years being angry and not wanting to think about her father’s side of things. But eventually, might you not consider that if your father, a trained medical professional with expertise in psychiatry, could fall to the demon of suicide, maybe, just maybe there’s more to suicide than just ‘selfishness’, as if her dad was the kid at the birthday party who ate all the candy before the other kids could get to it. As if, if ‘selfish’ was all it took to drive a person to suicide, we wouldn’t all have been to a LOT more funerals and dealt with a LOT fewer assholes in our lives. But no. She apparently went through her own medical training without learning any more about the subject of suicide, or mental illness. Or at least without taking any of it in.""Selfish"". What a term to use for a condition in which the victim's self-worth is so non-existent that they are absolutely convinced that self-annihilation will be better for everyone they know and love than to continue to be a presence in their life.The second case that Sunday was my first investigation of a suicide, a fifty-year-old man with a medical history of head and throat cancer who had slashed his own neck after getting the news from his oncologist that his cancer might have metastasized. The autopsy wasn’t difficult. For one thing, it was dry: An adult has about a gallon and a half of blood, and the MLI reported that this guy had left most of his on the floor of his bathroom. He had also left a suicide note to his wife, telling her she shouldn’t have to nurse him through another course of chemo. But suicide is a selfish act, and he wasn’t really thinking about her. She was the one who found the body. Anything the woman might have suffered if his cancer came back would have been better than finding her husband there on the floor of their bathroom, awash in his own blood, stone-cold dead.I’m not going to argue that she’s right that nobody is actually better off when a loved one kills themselves. That is true. I also won’t argue that it’s infinitely worse when they’re the ones to find them. That is also true. Suicide hurts more than the people who die to it. That is very, very true. What I’m arguing is this woman’s attitude toward the suicide itself. At times, she comes THIS CLOSE to suggesting that she has some hint of understanding:Survivors of suicides come in two varieties: those who never speak of the event, and those who talk about it frankly and freely. I belong to the second variety. I really do believe that hushing up suicides enables more suicides. My medical school training cemented this belief with current scientific and sociological theory, and my job as a forensic pathologist has further reinforced it with experience in grief counseling.You might expect that dealing with the families of suicides would be hard, but usually it isn’t. They are generally supportive, and even appreciative, of the job I have to do. Many of them accept the news right away and sometimes reveal that they had been expecting it—the final defeat in a years-long battle against mental illness.YES! Yes, yes, yes, she brought up mental illness! And she is aware that silence breeds more suicides! Surely this is where she says “after thinking of suicide for years as simply ‘selfish’, I realized after working so closely and intimately with it that there was clearly more to their stories than that.” Buuuuuuut… no. Just a few paragraphs later, she sweeps it all away again with:Though I understand in the most intimate and clinical way how my father died, I will never know why. It’s a goddamned selfish act, suicide, if you ask me.Okay. So she’s back to shaming people who have considered or committed suicide and ignoring everything that might be happening in their lives to push them so far. That’s nice. Who’s the selfish person again?There's also thoughtless bullshit like this:The cops like to say, “Once a suicide, always a suicide.” It’s callous and cynical, and very often true.Right. Because there's NO other early possible reason, like maybe that cops tend to deal more with people who are in circumstances not amendable to coping with depression and other mental illnesses that lead to suicide, which gives them an extremely slanted view on suicide on the whole, no that's SILLY, clearly ONCE A SUICIDE ALWAYS A SUICIDE. Christ.Her description of reading her father's autopsy report:My dad hadn’t left a suicide note, and I was hoping to find in the result of the postmortem examination some hidden clue, something I could see with a medical examiner’s eye that might help me understand why he killed himself.Umm... MENTAL ILLNESS? Remember when you brought that up all by yourself ages ago??? And her final summary of said report:The decedent had significant heart disease for a young man—probably those White Castle hamburgers he loved so much. He also had a fatty liver, but the toxicology report found no cocaine, no heroin, no alcohol in his system.He was sober. I couldn’t blame drugs. I could only and still blame Menachem [her dad].*headdesk**headdesk**headdesk*You want to talk about selfish people, I’ve never read the words of someone so determined to avoid any thought whatsoever about the possible causes of suicide. And maybe it’s because she’s frightened. Understandable. She does mention that at one point she was scared she’d commit suicide because her dad did. But she said, “suicide is not a disease”, so she must have given some thought to it. Just not enough to try and consider that maybe her dad isn’t just a selfish person. Maybe she’s still angry at her dad. Understandable. But she’s had a lot of medical training – she knows that mental illness is a cause. She has had some exposure to psychiatry as a child, and I would think she had *some* on her way through medical training. But whatever it is… being frightened or angry are *reasons* for the sort of horrible things she’s saying. Neither are excuses.She is right again, by the way - suicide is not a 'disease' in that it doesn't spread as predictably as a normal disease, nor is it as easily stopped as many diseases. It can get to anyone. She or others like her *ought* to be afraid of becoming suicidal, because ""I am a selfish person for even thinking of killing myself"" is a good, healthy food - for the kind of thoughts that start you down the road to suicide.It’s around this point that I quit. I just couldn’t keep reading. In fact it turned me off so much that I put down my book and spent two months arguing myself into keeping going. I was putting off reading other books waiting to finish this one, and I kept arguing with myself and then procrastinating by doing *anything* else at all. Which is frustrating, because a) I really really love reading and b) I really enjoy this sort of topic. But I get a sick, angry feeling in my throat and stomach every time she starts going on like this and it has completely ruined an otherwise fascinating book where, as I already stated, she manages to be very professional toward the people she discusses and doesn’t make personal judgments against their lifestyles.I would like to end this review by quoting someone who did commit suicide, and who understood the driving force intimately and clearly. David Foster Wallace died on September 12, 2008 – a suicide. He was a talented author. He was popular. He had a loving wife. He also had depression. He fought it – [and he lost]( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_F...). Long before then – in 1996 – he wrote this:The so-called 'psychotically depressed' person who tries to kill herself doesn't do so out of quote 'hopelessness' or any abstract conviction that life's assets and debits do not square. And surely not because death seems suddenly appealing. The person in whom Its invisible agony reaches a certain unendurable level will kill herself the same way a trapped person will eventually jump from the window of a burning high-rise. Make no mistake about people who leap from burning windows. Their terror of falling from a great height is still just as great as it would be for you or me standing spec-ulatively at the same window just checking out the view; i.e. the fear of falling remains a constant. The variable here is the other terror, the fire's flames: when the flames get close enough, falling to death becomes the slightly less terrible of two terrors. It's not desiring the fall; it's terror of the flames. And yet nobody down on the sidewalk, looking up and yelling 'Don't!' and 'Hang on!', can understand the jump. Not really. You'd have to have personally been trapped and felt flames to really understand a terror way beyond falling.It was a work of fiction, but it has reached out to many, many people who’ve dealt with mental illness and suicide attempts and spoken to them. It has given them a thrill of joy to find words so perfectly expressing what they’re going through. And it is all I have at my disposal to fight against words like “selfish” used by people like Judy Melinek - people who somehow simultaneously expect the mentally ill to consider their viewpoint in a rational and thoughtful manner, but cannot or will not take the time as (presumably) mentally stable people to consider the viewpoint of the mentally ill. (hide spoiler)]Perhaps it may appear that I'm biased in giving this book a 1 star rating because she hit a sore spot. But I consider that a lack of professionalism in a book dealing with such a topic justifies a low rating, and I would be just as offended if she treated any of her other subjects in the same manner."
26,1476727252,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9936091-aura,5,Dr. Melinek tells a fascinating tale of her days as medical examiner in NYC. I am not great fan of crime and forensic shows on TV. This book is not like that but more about the details of the daily work of medical doctors in the morgue. What happened? What actually caused the death of a person? Dr. Melinek details in a clinical way how an autopsy is detective work on a dead body. I dont know if it is something I needed to know but it was utterly fascinating to find out the worst way someone died and also the funniest cause of death she ever encountered. I enjoyed reading this a lot and in a strange way it was not macabre.
27,1476727252,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5542358-hil,4,"It was fascinating to learn about the life of a medical examiner, especially one who was working in New York City on September 11th, 2001. Dr. Melinek does a great job of describing the process and investigation that goes into determining cause and manner of death. I think many people assume that the medical examiner's determination is based solely on what is revealed by the autopsy, but Melinek also describes the process of interviewing friends, family and emergency personnel to determine the circumstances surroundings someone's life and death. Her explanation of how autopsies are conducted and what can be determined from the state of the body is written clearly, without too much medical jargon that might make it difficult to understand. My one complaint about Working Stiff was that Dr. Melinek has very strong opinions on suicide, describing it as a ""selfish act"" more than once. Her own father took his life when Judy Melinek was only thirteen and his suicide was devastating to her. I realize that everyone who has experienced the suicide of a loved one deals with it in different ways and clearly Dr. Melinek has tried to go out of her way to console the families of suicide victims in the course of her work, but I still found some of her statements a bit harsh and jarring. "
28,1476727252,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11869072-jeanette,5,"Is this non-fiction recital of two years' cases of performing NYC autopsies for the Coroner's designations perfect? Of course not. But it is blunt, honest, and Judy Melinek also resists all the usual Doctor syndrome aspects of hiding a personality, bias, feelings of an individual- behind the badge and highly authoritarian onus of the M.D. that is behind her name.Rarely am I tempted to do a synopsis, rather than a reaction. For this one I am sorely tempted to tell you far more than just my take. Some of these chapters are absolutely unique in SPECIFIC information. Stated too within medical and official jargon, and then often translated for her layman's tale. She tells us what she sees. She tells us what her job is. It is not what many TV shows or court room scenes leave you to believe it is. She is not a lawyer, or a Homicide Detective. Although she constantly detects and she does appear in court on some occasions. Her onus first and foremost is to put one of six things on a legal and official death certificate. NYC has six categories only, and the full explanation is terse, as well. Some states or countries have 5 or 7. It often takes months to fill that one line.They are: Suicide, Homicide, Disease, Accident, Medical Complication/Interaction, or Undecided/Undetermined. That's it. Before the book is finished, you will read of some few cases that are being determined over months of time between THREE of these categories. Determination between not just two, but three, all strong possibilities before the final decision is put on the Death Certificate line. And often times grand jury or some other jurisdiction is waiting for that line to be printed. Because timing of demise, situations of opposing or serendipity causes, and physical proofs may oppose themselves in category or clues when their origin or sequential consequence order is unknown. When she finds a real zebra amongst the horses, she proclaims ""Isn't that cool!"" and tells you why. Many readers may not parse with her interjections. Or become highly offended. But reading what these hours include, as far as I am concerned she can say anything she wants to, and in any mood or tone at that. This job has been rather glorified on TV. And you hear lots of details about body parts or descriptions of the testing done on them, but none are in the degree that you hear about here in this book. If you don't care for the medical and intense detail, this survey is not for you.She was working during 9/11, fairly new in fact. She leaves that portion of her time in NYC for nearer to the end of the book. There are good reasons for it. I knew with my head and my heart, but I didn't REALLY know. You know after reading her sorting lines, blocks of refrigerated trucks. She also had near the end of her stint, a 250 plus person air crash (all fatal plus 5 more on the ground). By comparing those two events' autopsy results, you understand what is missing in one and not the other.She covers too, not only the exact issues and context of her own health and life that with some serendipity switched her surgeon's role into one that was more conducive to sleeping and a family life. But also the special sense she has of solving hard problems that are often quite different or original biology. If a doctor is dead tired, fainting sick and not able to remain standing for 40 hours straight, there is always a better way to practice. And ""The patient will still be dead tomorrow, and they don't mind waiting."" Others warn readers who may have queasy stomachs. I would warn far more to those who want a PC formula ""nice-nice"" emotive condolence for life's meanest and grimmest occasions. This is not a lady who seeks to condole first. She often surmounts to do just that visceral connection and much more. But she is not phony in calling a situation what it is NOT in order to help grievers rationalize a cozier self acceptance. Many might well be offended. To me it was absolutely refreshing. And also most highly trustworthy for ACTUAL good intent and concern, at that. Give me a Doctor like this rather than one who mouths all the platitudes.She is the daughter of a brilliant doctor who was a suicide at 38. Those suicide cases she reviews were worth the reading of this book alone. Because I have been one of those people who have witnessed the exact kinds of events she details. The train jump, the building jump. I never go to a place of open balconies or 20 floor atriums without thinking about it. People like myself who have seen them are forever affected. Affect, as in feelings. You can't erase it. It doesn't look like the movies or chewy horror film special effects. That's usually because it hits all kinds of things on the way down for one thing. Almost always, it is not all there. You will learn why 7 bullet holes require different tracking methods and why one or two is so much easier. And why nearly the first rule right now in autopsy is taking off all the piercing and attached decoration, noting scars, tattoos in great detail, sometimes with drawings. This book taught me more about how a corpse could reveal as completely bloodless (rare occurrence with a certain instant velocity death- the bone marrow absorbs all the blood), how a blood transfusion can cause an antibody crisis/ fatal reaction (blood hook up transfer starts- bad back pain instantly- yell like hell)and several other exact factual context situations that I had never read upon any detail before this book. She doesn't cut out the depth either for their ""solving"" situation. Anyone who is depressed, lives in a city, drives a car, thinks suicide is a way to make things easier for the survivors, or is going to die. All of those people should read this book.

29,1476727252,http://goodreads.com/user/show/28831526-jean,5,"Truth is sometimes stranger than fiction, which is why Dr. Judy Melinek’s book, Working Stiff: Two Years, 262 Bodies, and the Making of a Medical Examiner, is a fascinating read for fiction writers and others, especially those with cast iron stomachs. Melinek is a forensic pathologist who teams up with author husband TJ Mitchell to recall stories and lessons learned while serving as a pathology fellow at the New York City Office of the Chief Medical Examiner.Does anyone set out to establish oneself in a career in forensic pathology? Judy Melinek did not. She did, however, want to be a surgeon. But once she determined that the arduous hours of surgical residency were not what she wanted for her marriage or her soon-to-be-born child, she took advantage of the fellowship opportunity in New York. Her husband, who becomes a stay-at-home dad, is incredibly supportive, even though he seems aghast at some of the autopsies she performs. After all, this is not the usual, “Honey, how was your day?” kind of a job.Dr. Melinek writes with intelligence, with humor, and yes, with graphic detail. Authors, you can’t make some of this stuff up! When she uses doctor-speak, she generally follows up with layman’s terms. I suspect that her husband had something to do with that, although she also credits her mentor, Dr. Charles Hirsch, for that advice. In fact, she has great respect for Hirsch and learned a great deal under his tutelage.Many of the death scenes she describes are horrific, the kind that made me want to cover my eyes and practically pinch my nose as I imagined the details. The most challenging events of her tenure, I imagine, were the back-to-back-to-back headliners in 2001. First, there was the tragedy that occurred on September 11 when two jetliners crashed into the twin towers of the World Trade Center. Dr. Melinek chronicles these days and weeks, recalling the emotions, the fatigue, and the sheer enormity of the task of tagging and identifying bodies and body parts. The team had barely finished this task when the anthrax scare happened. Then, just when she and two other colleagues were about to get a respite from the morgue by attending a conference in Washington, D.C., a major plane crash forced them to return to NYC to autopsy mangled bodies.What demanding, even disturbing work! As Dr. Melinek implies, it requires not only fortitude, but also intellectual curiosity, empathy, and compassion. She states that she is often asked how she can do what she does. She quotes others as saying, “You get used to it.” Her response is more human, “It’s about the living. You and me. I do it for you.” Her father was a psychiatrist who committed suicide when she was thirteen. Judy feels compassion for survivors of suicide victims. In her opinion, suicide is “a selfish act.” To me, this reveals the deep-seated pain of someone who has lost a loved one, and she is entitled to that. Some may see it as disrespectful or unfeeling toward persons with mental illness, and perhaps they, too, have a point. Overall, I was impressed with Melinek as a savvy, diligent clinician who can do a difficult job and still maintain her sense of humor and go home to her family at night. It seems to me that that takes a pretty special person. If I were a writer of mysteries, I would be thrilled to add this book to my reference shelf.5 stars"

It's a graphic yet tasteful and respectful memoir of a New York medical examiner's grisly career and how she coped with it over time, as well as how her work helped grieving families and friends find closure."
31,1476727252,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5028851-cathryn,5,"While I was reading this book I kept walking around my house saying ""This is fascinating."" to the point that I started the sentence and my daughter finished it. I don't read much non-fiction but I have a fascination with death and what happens to your body after you die. That's why I picked this up. Maybe it's because we don't really talk about it as a society. It's too taboo or gross or a combination of both I don't know.This book covers the first year of Dr. Melinek's fellowship in NYC as a medical examiner. She doesn't go through all 262 cases but picks highlights to show was is involved in the different types of death. She does a really good job of breaking down all the medical jargon into laymen's terms without sounding condescending. Part of an MEs training is to learn how to do that since they deal with grieving family members. Each case is its own little story and I was surprised at how much detective work an ME actually does. If there is no criminal homicide for the police to investigate (and only about 30% of autopsy cases are criminal in nature) it is up to the ME to piece together what happened and not just physically. They have to understand the circumstances surrounding the death and that involves some legwork.The final section of the book is about 9/11. Melinek was only 9 weeks into her fellowship when this happened. I've heard a lot of stories about the brave work of the firefighters and police on that day but I haven't heard anything about the MEs. The only medical stories I've heard were about all the doctors and nurses waiting at the hospitals for the wounded to come in and how devastated they were when only a fraction of the number expected showed up. Now imagine what all the MEs had to go through. It was heartbreaking and interesting at the same time. They were able to identify approximately half of those that died that day. Considering what they had to work with it's pretty amazing.If you have any interest in this area I highly recommend picking up this book."
32,1476727252,http://goodreads.com/user/show/52700401-abbie-hooton,5,"If you have any sense of morbid fascination with the dead and what happens, then this is definitely worth a read. I am a big fan of crime novels, and with a boyfriend in the police, crime and murder is definitely something that interests me. This book goes into detail about how many different ways people die on an everyday occurrence, while going into detail her checklist of things that she does when doing a post mortem. This book answered every curiosity I had about post mortems and what exactly it is they do with a body. It also showed me how unexpected and random life can be; some of the accidents and medical mistakes that caused deaths throughout this really did make me think. Another thing I really appreciated is how she has shown that women can have the big career and still have a home life; something I think more women need to hear, too often we're told there's a choice and I think Melinek proved that you can indeed have both. "
33,1476727252,http://goodreads.com/user/show/773729-kelly,4,"Once I became an eyewitness to death, I found that nearly every unexpected fatality I investigated was either the result of something dangerously mundane, or of something predictably hazardous. So don't jaywalk...You know that yellow line on the subway platform? It's there for a reason. Staying alive, as it turns out, is mostly common sense. Judy MelinekAfter reading this book I really wish I had become a medical examiner...weird I know ;-) It was fascinating. The one thing that would probably make me quit that job though would be the smell of a decomposing body...It hits you--an assault, not a scent. You flinch, heave back in revulsion. It invades your throat, assails your taste buds, even stings your eyes.The maggot talk just validated my wish to be immediately sealed in a metal drawer in a mausoleum after I die. I also knew there had to be a reason I'm allergic to cats...they will eat you immediately after you die. Whereas dogs will just stay by you for days on end. The last quarter of this book was completely spellbinding, in my opinion. She was a NYC Medical Examiner on 9/11. She heard and saw that low flying jetliner when she was hurrying to work that morning. It is even more horrific through her eyes than what I heard and saw on the news. She tagged body pieces (and the descriptions of their condition were awful)...many refrigerated tractor trailers' worth of body parts, a small number of intact bodies.The limbs had all been amputated. The torso was transected below the navel. The remains were entirely black--burned and covered in soot. The head...the head wasn't recognizable as a head, except that it had hair and was attached to the neck. The smell of jet fuel was so strong it made me dizzy. I could tell just by looking at the open body bag that this person had been mashed, burned, dropped from a height, and slashed by sharp forces. I had seen people killed by subway trains and speeding cars, run over by trucks, crushed by industrial equipment, fallen from great heights, burned, and battered--but never all at the same time.I examined the surface of the leg--and came across something that made me stare. Fragments of a personal bank check, complete with routing number and a partially legible name, were embedded under the skin, buried deep in the muscle tissue....an X-ray had revealed a woman's severed hand, complete with wedding ring, entirely embedded inside the chest wall of a man's intact torso.This quote from the Chief Medical Examiner at the time is haunting: People were jumping or falling from the buildings. They seemed to take forever to fall, tumbling through the air. They would hit the pavement with a loud thud--very loud--and bounce, and land again. The sounds of the bodies hitting the ground echoed off the buildings, one after another, over and over. I've added some great quotes from this book...hopefully they will show below this review. "
34,1476727252,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4968643-david,2,"Published a dozen years after Dr. Melinek’s two year stint in the NYC Office of the Chief Medical Examiner the cases and experiences she describes are flat, lifeless and incomplete. With all of that time between the events and the publishing of the book the authors should have conducted some degree of research to round out the stories of the cadavers she autopsied. The frequent quoted conversations had me wondering how accurate the dialogue was. And how could stories from the NYC medical examiner’s be so uninteresting?The book started off strongly and Dr. Melinek's perspective on suicide was powerful and interesting. However the book lost its unique voice soon thereafter. The stories simply weren’t compelling and there were hints of smugness, impatience and pettiness that made her seem less nice than the image she was going for (she took some condescending cheap shots at peoples’ appearances that had nothing to do with the stories at hand - the woman with the nose job, the fat guy, just to name two instances).As to the autopsies there are plenty of the sickening descriptions you might expect. Sometimes the authors seemed to rely on technical language with little explanation to create a ‘wow’ factor. If you have pet cats or are expecting to have surgery in the near future you might want to skip this one for either of those reasons alone.One final complaint: the authors played up the wittiness of Dr. Hirsch’s epigrams as if he were some magical combination of Confucius and Henny Youngman. Unfortunately the many decade old quotes fell far short of that mark. Maybe they simply forgot his precise quotes after all of those years."
35,1476727252,http://goodreads.com/user/show/23100707-jean,4,"This is a memoir of a forensic pathologist. After medical school Dr. Melinek started a residency program to be a surgeon. She took time off from work to have a baby and decided to change her specialty and become a pathologist. She attended UCLA for her pathology and forensic training and was accepted at the NYC Medical Examiner’s Office for her one-year forensic residency training program. After she completed the program she stayed on in the medical examiner’s office for another one-year residency program in forensic neuropathology.Dr. Melinek was only two months into her residency when the September 11 terrorist attack happened. She provides a firsthand account of events at the medical examiner’s office of that fateful event. She also covers the anthrax bio-terrorism attack in NYC and the crash of American Airlines flight 587. As the residency program was two years she also got to cover the routine murders, suicides and accidents normally dealt with by the medical examiner. Dr. Melinek reveals the day to day life of a forensic pathologist. She also provides some background information, for example: how a death certificate is filled out and why; what constitutes accidental death or homicide and so on. I found the information on the type of bullets and their effect on the body interesting as well as the general information of ballistics. Overall a most fascinating memoir.Dr. Melinek wrote the book with her husband, T. J. Mitchell. They met at Harvard where he was an English major. He works as a screenwriter and script editor.Tanya Eby does a good job narrating the book. Eby is a voice over artist and an award winning audiobook narrator."

I like Melinek's voice and style of writing and her irreverent way of looking at death. I love the way she describes her reaction to shows featuring characters doing her job - the fact that they go to every crime scene, the women wear their good high-heeled shoes, they actually help with the investigation. From now on CSI will be light-hearted crime fiction, in the same league as those 'cosy mysteries' that feature little old lady super-sleuths, not a realistic look into the life of a medical examiner. I can see the irony and humour in some of the causes of death that she sees (although, not when contemplating my own future). For example, an unfortunate worker having his morning coffee gets hit in the head by a giant crane, a crane so large that he is practically crumpled into the ground like an aluminium can. Although, at the same time reading medical nonfiction does hit a bit close to home for someone only weeks away from having major surgery to remove a 9 x 7 cm suspicious mass, along with 25% of her liver. Maybe I shouldn't be reading this right now... So far I'm enjoying it despite the negative thoughts it's bringing up. To be continued...12/3 - Not as bad as I thought it was going to be re bringing up disturbing thoughts, except for one of the later chapters focussing on deaths due to 'medical misadventures' or 'therapeutic complications' as Melinek puts it - when a patient dies during non-emergent surgery due to surgeon error. Reading about the ordeal Melinek and her fellow medical examiners went through in the aftermath of September 11 was a little tough, even for someone who's never been to New York - body bags becoming body part bags becoming body bit bags (a lump of skin, a piece of an intestine) and thinking of all the families who don't KNOW what happened to their father, mother, son, daughter. That was really sad. I do wonder how she remembered the details of all these cases, from 14 years ago, so vividly, even seeming to repeat conversations word for word. I also wonder how she managed to get all the patient's families to agree to have their family member's death story revealed in the ME's memoir. There was no mention anywhere of the names having been changed to protect the surviving family members, so I have to assume that all those names are real. Whatever the case, highly recommended to those with a strong stomach and a lack of anxiety regarding all the ways they and their loved ones could die.PopSugar 2015 Reading Challenge: A Memoir"

This is the place where Death delights to help the living.’I am completely, over the top, irrationally fond of books about medicine and/or the macabre and apparently have the extremely annoying habit of sharing choice trivia I pick up in these books, to the horror of my friends (so those of you that I see offline, brace yourselves for some really gruesome tidbits)This book takes the form of memoir, forensic crime investigation, pathology and weird-shit-people-die-from stories. The author seems to be quite an optimistic ray of sunshine in an industry that leans towards the dark and depressing. She conveys the stories at times with humor, at times with sadness but always with compassion and respect.“People ask me all the time, “What’s the worst way to die you’ve ever seen?” I assure them, “You don’t want to know.” She was right. I should not have wanted to know. All I can say is I will never eat lobster again, EVER.She is frank and outspoken about suicide and whether I agree with her views or not, I could sympathize with her. Having lived through her own fathers suicide at the age of 13 it clearly left scars still visible in her adult life.I heard about this author from a GR friend’s review and also knew beforehand that she was most famous for the 8 months she provided medical support in the 9/11 aftermath. What I did not expect was how much of an emotional read Chapter 10 would be for me. I have the utmost respect for each and every person who was involved in the First Responder teams and everyone else that assisted them. Every doctor has to cultivate compassion, to learn it and then practice it. To confront death every day, to see it for yourself, you have to love the living. Would I recommend this? YES absolutely, but then again I have an extreme bias towards books like this so perhaps my judgment cannot be trusted. Oh and a word of warning, if you are overly sensitive or have a weak stomach perhaps this book is not for you."

Sometimes the stats are informative and funny (if you die alone with your pet, the dog will lay by your body in mourning.... your cat? Will start eating you that day)I was enjoying this read as a light-hearted read (as much as the content would allow of course)... until I got to the 9/11 chapters. It didn't even occur to me as I was reading what year she had started being an ME, and then suddenly she started a chapter with September 11, 2001, and I went ""oh. crap""The last part of the book was really hard for me. I put it down several times because I nearly cried. I still relive that day so vividly and reading her account of that awful morning- then the task she had of trying to identify only body parts or small pieces of DNA just killed me. I obviously knew the carnage of that day but it just never occurred to me that they barely pulled bodies out of the World Trade Center, it was particles of people. Of the thousands of people killed, only 291 bodies in tact were found. There are still over 1,000 people who never had remains found. These chapters were just terrible and I found myself tearing up. If you're a fan of CSI, Law and Order, etc those type of shows I highly recommend this book. "

So if you've ever wondered what it's like to be a real forensic pathologist, here's your chance.Perhaps most notably, Melinek was in NYC during the Sept 11th attacks and was thus part of the grueling identification process, which often depended on DNA extracted from lone teeth as a means of identification. Her description of that process is nothing short of sobering. I'd never really thought much about the condition of the bodies. Interesting read and competently written."

Better yet, stay out of the car, and get some exercise. Watch your weight. If you’re a smoker stop right now. If you aren’t, don’t start. Guns put holes in people. Drugs are bad…Staying alive is mostly common sense.”This is intriguing story, told in a personable and conversational way, with black humour, personal insights, some interesting characters and plenty of passion. You can feel this doctor’s affinity for her role and the pride she has for revealing the cause of death, particularly in homicide cases where she “speaks on behalf of the dead.” This narrative is told with honesty that sometimes catches you unaware, particularly when the author discusses suicides and neonatal and child deaths; so sad. The life of an Medical Examiner is dissected and probed and all is revealed; the ugliness of death, the stench, the maggots, the sloughing skin, the reek of alcohol, the worry of infection but all is told is a calm and meaning full manner – this is not “voyeur of the dead” material, this is life (because death also affects the living), death and some deaths are good deaths and some… you really should not ask about.Throughout this narrative the authors’ voices carry you on a journey, you walk side by side with the rookie M.E and take lessons with her, then suddenly the world changes, the tone changes and it is chilling. The terrorist attacks on September 11, 2001 on the World Trade Centre towers and other threats shake up the world and have a very personal direct impact on Dr Melinek; she sees firsthand the destruction and violation of life. This section of the book is…overwhelmingly sad and horrific, the work of the first responders and the medical staff tasked with identifying the human remains is a mammoth and heartbreakingly poignant.

I've always had a fascination for stuff that some people find a bit dark - true crime stories, biographies of serial killers, etc. So this book was right up my alley. Overall, the book does a good job of weaving together stories of a job that's rather morbid and dark with insights into the author's life and the lives of those she has a duty to - the dead and their families, who need answers and resolution. Some of the stories are weird, some of them will make you shake your head, some of them are just outright sad. For me, they reinforced the fact that I'm not cut out for this sort of work, as much as I enjoy reading about it. There is a chapter on the aftermath of 9/11 and I must warn who lived in New York or who was greatly impacted by the events that it is not an easy chapter to get through. Some may wish to skip it entirely. For me it was a reminder and more insight into just how truly awful that day was, and made my heart break all over again. I admire people like Judy, really - they do the work that most of us won't and can't do, and provide a vital service to our communities because of it. Books like this provide insight and remind us how important these sorts of jobs are, even if we never think about them."
45,1476727252,http://goodreads.com/user/show/13814810-ella,2,"Although this book provides an interesting look into the experiences of the author's forensic pathology residency, there are a number of aspects on which I would like to comment more critically. Most importantly, I was very unsettled by Melinek's simplistic conception of suicide and suicidal ideations. She repeatedly and violently asserts that suicide is ""selfish"". Despite Melinek's own early personal exposure to her father's suicide, she neither addresses the context nor engages with any of the complexity surrounding mental health issues. Claiming so assertively that ""suicide is a selfish act"" without considering the factors beyond the individual, the larger social institutions, and the failure of these systems further upstream, is, to me, a rather self-serving assessment. Rhetoric is powerful and I worry about the unintended consequences of Melinek's assertions on this subject. Looking more superficially, I disliked the book's organization. The timeline is established primarily through reference to her second pregnancy and to specific cases. However, the author bounces around considerably during the 2 year period in which the majority of the narrative occurs. This was more of an annoyance then it was seriously disruptive."
46,1476727252,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2079470-cheryl,4,"Dr. Judy Melinek has written a close up, personal account of the time she spent working as a forensic pathologist in the Office of the Chief Medical Examiner of New York City. While there, she performed autopsies on casualties of accidents, homicides, and suicides. In addition to performing autopsies, Dr. Melinek, in some cases, found it necessary and revealing to investigate scenes where bodies were discovered. Another part of her responsibilities involved counseling grieving family members as well as providing court testimony in cases of homicide.Dr. Melinek gives very graphic and detailed accounts of many of her cases. Most poignant and heartwrenching was the description of the work performed by forensic pathologists on the victims of the World Trade Center catastrophe on September 11, 2001, and the days and months afterward. Everyone who worked those cases was forever changed by the experience.Told with compassion and humility, Working Stiff is an unforgettable book. However, it may not appeal to everyone because of the very graphic and gruesome detail included in the casework. "
47,1476727252,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1484029-mikey-b,4,"Obviously the topic of forensics is always of interest; albeit a somewhat macabre one. So from that point of view this book is an obvious winner.However I did find the number of autopsies discussed made for quantity over quality giving the book a somewhat flippant feel (OK the subtitle clearly state 262 bodies so I was warned). Also the book had a lot of medical jargon, some of which was well explained, some not.The most poignant chapter was on the days after September 11, 2001 when the author and her colleagues were overwhelmed by an utter devastation they had never before encountered.Overall I felt the author was writing more for herself than for an audience. Many autopsies were left dangling (like Errico Lavagnino) where we do not know the cause of death. There were too many family and co-worker conversations which made the narrative unnecessarily auto-biographical. And at the risk of being politically incorrect I became irritated by reading about the author’s pregnancies."

It was sciency and then I ended up listening to a huge chunk today to finish and it was AMAZING.It has all the disgusting, gory details that you would hope for. There's obscure diagnoses and freak accidents. There were times I would say ""UGH"" out loud while working and listening. She tells you what is the worst way to die...and it is BAD.She was also a part of the team that worked on cataloguing all of the World Trade Center remains from 9/11 and that section is the most haunting.

This is a personal account of Judy Melinek's two years working as a forensic pathologist with the Office of the Chief Medical Examiner in New York. I have found out information about decomposing bodies, burns and dismemberment that I did not know were possible. And given that Judy's time there encompassed September 11, 2001 and the scale that OCME had to deal with in deaths is beyond comprehension.As terrible as some of the accounts were, it was also a fitting tribute to the unsung heroes who give their time to answer questions for those who are still living and need resolution, justice or just consolation.If however, you find something like Agatha Christie or Midsummer Murders confronting and grisly then you may wish to steer clear."

Melinek has a way of delivering the story with both clinical observation and compassion. It's a very candid glimpse into the world of a medical examiner, and it's done very well. The chapter on 9/11 was chilling and heartbreaking, and hearing about it from the perspective from someone working with the massive amounts of casualties really made it feel like those days were happening all over again. Not for the faint of heart, but very well worth the time. And a must read for any writer considering a character in this field. "

The author describes things with compassion, and gives a good overview of various aspects of the job. Especially sobering was the work done after 9/11. Wow - I thought I had some ideas of what happened, but I never comprehended how truly horrible the aftermath was. I have even more respect for all of the heroes that kept working and dealing with all of that, as well as those who died. Anyway, it was a good book and well worth reading."

Watch your weight. If you’re a smoker stop right now. If you aren’t, don’t start. Guns put holes in people. Drugs are bad. You know that yellow line on the subway platform? It's there for a reason. Staying alive, as it turns out, is mostly common sense.”This is the advice of Judy Melinek, the author of Working Stiff: Two Years, 262 Bodies, and the Making of a Medical Examiner, gleaned from her experience as an assistant medical examiner in New York City. From 2001 to 2003 Melinek performed hundreds of autopsies on the victims of homicides, suicides, accidents, natural diseases, therapeutic complications, and undetermined causes, that crossed her table. Melinek's very first post mortem involved the death of a young man, a heroin addict diagnosed with sickle-cell trait who died in hospital, her second an elderly man who sustained severe burns in a house fire, the third a pregnant woman, the victim of a hit and run. In general, each chapter of Working Stiff groups together cases by manner of death, detailing Melinek's examination of patients young and old, male and female, destitute and wealthy, and everything in between. The final chapters focus on the medical examiners office's role in the wake of the Twin Towers collapse on September 11, and the crash of American Airlines flight 587. The narrative is very readable, almost conversational in tone, and mostly free of the medical jargon one might expect. Melinek is at all times respectful but not humourless, sharing both professional perspective and personal observations. I do feel compelled to warn the unwary reader that this isn't a book for the squeamish with its graphic record of gruesome injury and detailed descriptions of the forensic autopsy process.What shines through is Melinek's passion and commitment to her job as she works to investigate and determine the cause and manner of death, comfort the bereaved, provide assistance to the justice system and ""speak for the dead"".Informative, entertaining and engaging Working Stiff is a fascinating account of the work of a medical examiner, well told by Judy Melinek and her husband T.J. Mitchell. * I gave the book an extra 1/2 star for Judy's admission she wears ""sensible shoes and a Medical Examiner windbreaker"" during her rare visits to crime scenes - not six inch stiletto's and Armani suits. "
55,1476727252,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1740304-linda,4,"Dr. Melinek was originally studying to be a surgeon. But the grueling conditions of her surgical residency were taking their toll on her life and health, and the health of patients. Honestly, the description of what is expected of surgical residents scared the shit out of me. I know, we’ve seen it in TV dramas… no sleep, inhuman hours. But the reality is that nobody could possibly function well under those conditions, and our lives depend on surgeons being at their best. It makes me wonder if some regulation should be put into place similar to that for pilots and truck drivers. Anyway, her quitting her surgical residency for the more civilized routine of a medical examiner is what brings us to this book.Her descriptions of how she does her work, in conjunction with law enforcement, to determine cause of death… and more important, manner of death, was fascinating. Manner of death includes Homicide, Suicide, Accidental, Natural, and Undetermined. Dr. Melinek provides vivid anecdotes of each of these, and it’s very interesting. She does not come across as a morbid person, and in fact enjoys the work for the comfort it can provide the living.She tells us of having worked as a Medical Examiner in NYC through the 9/11 attacks and the subsequent anthrax scare, which is as overwhelming as you would imagine.There’s only one thing I was a little triggered by, and it has nothing to do with the gruesome descriptions of death and the methodical dissection of corpses. Dr. Melinek survived her own tragedy when her beloved father took his own life while she was a girl. And whenever she discusses her findings of suicide, there remains an understandable bitterness. It allows her to be more empathetic to other survivors, which is wonderful. But her vehement assertion that all people who commit suicide are selfish hit me wrong. I am also the survivor of a loved one who took her own life, though not a parent. My own conclusion is that none of us can know the pain and suffering that another person endures. And they deserve compassion more than derision. I’m not condemning her perspective as less valid than mine, it just made it a little hard for me to read at points.3.67 stars"
56,1476727252,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4089241-liralen,4,"I'm stumped. This would normally go on my hypothetical list of jobs I never knew I didn't want, except I did know I wouldn't want this job. I just love reading about it. 'Jobs I Only Want to Read About'?Erm. Anyway. Melinek turned from surgery to forensic pathology after realising that both career paths would let her cut up bodies but pathology would also let her get more than three hours of sleep (and the patients wouldn't argue). Here she details cases she saw during her two years in New York City, where she learned the ropes. Suicides and overdoses—so many overdoses—and accidents and medical errors. More overdoses. Murders. Early in her career but late in the book, victims of 9/11.Melinek displays a fair amount of glee in discussing some of the more interesting cases—I rather think she and Mary Roach would get along—while managing to remain respectful of the individuals (deceased and family) involved. She's descriptive enough that I actually took a break mid-book to read something lighter, which I don't usually feel the need to do...I recommend reading this, but not while eating!Towards the end of the book, Melinek talks about the attacks on the World Trade Center in 2001, when she'd been working as a medical examiner for only a few months. To me it was the strongest section of the book—it has the most consistent storyline of the book, and although that (and the American Airlines crash of November 2001) is the most hectic, case-after-case-body-after-body time she describes, in some ways it's the least hectic section of the book—more time taken to slow down and connect her personal experience with her professional experience. Up to that point I was enjoying the stories but finding the transitions somewhat lacking (or perhaps too good, as she segued neatly from body to body to body), but the pieces really fell into place for me later on in the book.I'll never be a doctor, much less a medical examiner, and I'm so many kinds of okay with that. But a reader of books like this? Yes please."

Like the accidents whose victims the author attended to, morbid curiousity prevented me from looking away. I wouldn't recommend it to the squeamish and, as others have noted, she is particularly opinionated about suicide and tends to come across as highly unsympathetic.2 stars out of 5.

59,1476727252,http://goodreads.com/user/show/678841-kim,4,"Working Stiff discusses Judy Melinek's two years working for the New York City OCME (Office of the Chief Medical Examiner), which began in 2001 and ended in 2002. Although the WTC attack happened only six weeks after she began work and the plane crash in Queens four weeks after that, the book is not about these two disasters but her experience and teachings from the autopsies of ""regular"" New Yorkers, and all the different ways that they die.I found the subject matter fascinating. This sort of pathology is something I had considered and briefly, in medical school, I spent time in the ME's office. I was immediately repelled by the odor of decomposition. ""You get used to it,"" was what the medical examiners and detectives told me, but I was pretty sure that wasn't true. Years later, I know that there are certain things we learn to put up with in our line of work and others that just strain our personal limits. So - kudos to Judy Melinek and others like her who are able to handle the stench of decomposition when it is present and do this job. On the plus side: Melinek does an incredible job documenting how ordinary and not-so-ordinary people die, what happens to our bodies after we die, and how medical examiners piece together our last hours and moments of life. The scientific and technical details are amazing. She discusses numerous cases - murders and natural causes, ""therapeutic complications"" (as a physician, I really like that), innumerable accidental deaths, suicides. As she states in the beginning of the book, ""Staying alive, as it turns out, is mostly common sense."" So true.Like everyone else old enough to pay attention, I remember where I was on September 11, 2001; and exactly what I was doing when I found out what was going on; and exactly what I was doing when those towers fell. Years later it is still something that brings me to tears: the horror, the fear, the magnitude of loss. The people who gave of themselves to save others and lost their own lives as a consequence. Melinek provides an entirely fresh, gruesome, devastating look at an old story which is both horrifying (""an X-ray had revealed a woman's severed hand, complete with wedding ring, entirely embedded within the chest wall of a man's intact torso"") and educational (""the individual pieces of recovered remains numbered 19,956""). I admit I cried for these people and their families, and for the people who worked to identify them after the fact. I don't know how you wrap your head around that and emerge intact, although I suppose it's pretty much like anything else: one foot in front of the other until it's far enough behind you.On the downside: Another reviewer has mentioned the lack of an index, which I thoroughly agree with. I own an e-book, so it's moderately easier to find things, but this is still a lack. I agree that the book lacks an ""arc,"" which makes it difficult to read at times. I really enjoyed it, but I read the individual vignettes - because that is mostly what they are - over many months. I am not sure if the book would have been better if Melinek had begun at the beginning of the two years and used her personal growth as a story arc or if this was the best option if she did not want the entire book dominated by 9/11. While I understand her wish to make the book about forensics and not about 9/11, I think the lack of an arc is a detriment.However, overall this is an interesting - if not super quick - read. I really enjoyed it and for anyone looking to learn a little more about this subject it is a worthwhile read."

I don't read much non-fiction but I have a fascination with death and what happens to your body after you die. That's why I picked this up. Maybe it's because we don't really talk about it as a society. It's too taboo or gross or a combination of both I don't know.This book covers the first year of Dr. Melinek's fellowship in NYC as a medical examiner. She doesn't go through all 262 cases but picks highlights to show was is involved in the different types of death. She does a really good job of breaking down all the medical jargon into laymen's terms without sounding condescending. Part of an MEs training is to learn how to do that since they deal with grieving family members. Each case is its own little story and I was surprised at how much detective work an ME actually does. If there is no criminal homicide for the police to investigate (and only about 30% of autopsy cases are criminal in nature) it is up to the ME to piece together what happened and not just physically. They have to understand the circumstances surrounding the death and that involves some legwork.The final section of the book is about 9/11. Melinek was only 9 weeks into her fellowship when this happened. I've heard a lot of stories about the brave work of the firefighters and police on that day but I haven't heard anything about the MEs. The only medical stories I've heard were about all the doctors and nurses waiting at the hospitals for the wounded to come in and how devastated they were when only a fraction of the number expected showed up. Now imagine what all the MEs had to go through. It was heartbreaking and interesting at the same time. They were able to identify approximately half of those that died that day. Considering what they had to work with it's pretty amazing.If you have any interest in this area I highly recommend picking up this book."

I am a big fan of crime novels, and with a boyfriend in the police, crime and murder is definitely something that interests me. This book goes into detail about how many different ways people die on an everyday occurrence, while going into detail her checklist of things that she does when doing a post mortem. This book answered every curiosity I had about post mortems and what exactly it is they do with a body. It also showed me how unexpected and random life can be; some of the accidents and medical mistakes that caused deaths throughout this really did make me think. Another thing I really appreciated is how she has shown that women can have the big career and still have a home life; something I think more women need to hear, too often we're told there's a choice and I think Melinek proved that you can indeed have both.

So don't jaywalk...You know that yellow line on the subway platform? It's there for a reason. Staying alive, as it turns out, is mostly common sense. Judy MelinekAfter reading this book I really wish I had become a medical examiner...weird I know ;-) It was fascinating. The one thing that would probably make me quit that job though would be the smell of a decomposing body...It hits you--an assault, not a scent. You flinch, heave back in revulsion. It invades your throat, assails your taste buds, even stings your eyes.The maggot talk just validated my wish to be immediately sealed in a metal drawer in a mausoleum after I die. I also knew there had to be a reason I'm allergic to cats...they will eat you immediately after you die. Whereas dogs will just stay by you for days on end. The last quarter of this book was completely spellbinding, in my opinion. She was a NYC Medical Examiner on 9/11. She heard and saw that low flying jetliner when she was hurrying to work that morning. It is even more horrific through her eyes than what I heard and saw on the news. She tagged body pieces (and the descriptions of their condition were awful)...many refrigerated tractor trailers' worth of body parts, a small number of intact bodies.The limbs had all been amputated. The torso was transected below the navel. The remains were entirely black--burned and covered in soot. The head...the head wasn't recognizable as a head, except that it had hair and was attached to the neck. The smell of jet fuel was so strong it made me dizzy. I could tell just by looking at the open body bag that this person had been mashed, burned, dropped from a height, and slashed by sharp forces. I had seen people killed by subway trains and speeding cars, run over by trucks, crushed by industrial equipment, fallen from great heights, burned, and battered--but never all at the same time.I examined the surface of the leg--and came across something that made me stare. Fragments of a personal bank check, complete with routing number and a partially legible name, were embedded under the skin, buried deep in the muscle tissue....an X-ray had revealed a woman's severed hand, complete with wedding ring, entirely embedded inside the chest wall of a man's intact torso.This quote from the Chief Medical Examiner at the time is haunting: People were jumping or falling from the buildings. They seemed to take forever to fall, tumbling through the air. They would hit the pavement with a loud thud--very loud--and bounce, and land again. The sounds of the bodies hitting the ground echoed off the buildings, one after another, over and over. I've added some great quotes from this book...hopefully they will show below this review. "
64,1476727252,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4968643-david,2,"Published a dozen years after Dr. Melinek’s two year stint in the NYC Office of the Chief Medical Examiner the cases and experiences she describes are flat, lifeless and incomplete. With all of that time between the events and the publishing of the book the authors should have conducted some degree of research to round out the stories of the cadavers she autopsied. The frequent quoted conversations had me wondering how accurate the dialogue was. And how could stories from the NYC medical examiner’s be so uninteresting?The book started off strongly and Dr. Melinek's perspective on suicide was powerful and interesting. However the book lost its unique voice soon thereafter. The stories simply weren’t compelling and there were hints of smugness, impatience and pettiness that made her seem less nice than the image she was going for (she took some condescending cheap shots at peoples’ appearances that had nothing to do with the stories at hand - the woman with the nose job, the fat guy, just to name two instances).As to the autopsies there are plenty of the sickening descriptions you might expect. Sometimes the authors seemed to rely on technical language with little explanation to create a ‘wow’ factor. If you have pet cats or are expecting to have surgery in the near future you might want to skip this one for either of those reasons alone.One final complaint: the authors played up the wittiness of Dr. Hirsch’s epigrams as if he were some magical combination of Confucius and Henny Youngman. Unfortunately the many decade old quotes fell far short of that mark. Maybe they simply forgot his precise quotes after all of those years."
65,1476727252,http://goodreads.com/user/show/23100707-jean,4,"This is a memoir of a forensic pathologist. After medical school Dr. Melinek started a residency program to be a surgeon. She took time off from work to have a baby and decided to change her specialty and become a pathologist. She attended UCLA for her pathology and forensic training and was accepted at the NYC Medical Examiner’s Office for her one-year forensic residency training program. After she completed the program she stayed on in the medical examiner’s office for another one-year residency program in forensic neuropathology.Dr. Melinek was only two months into her residency when the September 11 terrorist attack happened. She provides a firsthand account of events at the medical examiner’s office of that fateful event. She also covers the anthrax bio-terrorism attack in NYC and the crash of American Airlines flight 587. As the residency program was two years she also got to cover the routine murders, suicides and accidents normally dealt with by the medical examiner. Dr. Melinek reveals the day to day life of a forensic pathologist. She also provides some background information, for example: how a death certificate is filled out and why; what constitutes accidental death or homicide and so on. I found the information on the type of bullets and their effect on the body interesting as well as the general information of ballistics. Overall a most fascinating memoir.Dr. Melinek wrote the book with her husband, T. J. Mitchell. They met at Harvard where he was an English major. He works as a screenwriter and script editor.Tanya Eby does a good job narrating the book. Eby is a voice over artist and an award winning audiobook narrator."

I like Melinek's voice and style of writing and her irreverent way of looking at death. I love the way she describes her reaction to shows featuring characters doing her job - the fact that they go to every crime scene, the women wear their good high-heeled shoes, they actually help with the investigation. From now on CSI will be light-hearted crime fiction, in the same league as those 'cosy mysteries' that feature little old lady super-sleuths, not a realistic look into the life of a medical examiner. I can see the irony and humour in some of the causes of death that she sees (although, not when contemplating my own future). For example, an unfortunate worker having his morning coffee gets hit in the head by a giant crane, a crane so large that he is practically crumpled into the ground like an aluminium can. Although, at the same time reading medical nonfiction does hit a bit close to home for someone only weeks away from having major surgery to remove a 9 x 7 cm suspicious mass, along with 25% of her liver. Maybe I shouldn't be reading this right now... So far I'm enjoying it despite the negative thoughts it's bringing up. To be continued...12/3 - Not as bad as I thought it was going to be re bringing up disturbing thoughts, except for one of the later chapters focussing on deaths due to 'medical misadventures' or 'therapeutic complications' as Melinek puts it - when a patient dies during non-emergent surgery due to surgeon error. Reading about the ordeal Melinek and her fellow medical examiners went through in the aftermath of September 11 was a little tough, even for someone who's never been to New York - body bags becoming body part bags becoming body bit bags (a lump of skin, a piece of an intestine) and thinking of all the families who don't KNOW what happened to their father, mother, son, daughter. That was really sad. I do wonder how she remembered the details of all these cases, from 14 years ago, so vividly, even seeming to repeat conversations word for word. I also wonder how she managed to get all the patient's families to agree to have their family member's death story revealed in the ME's memoir. There was no mention anywhere of the names having been changed to protect the surviving family members, so I have to assume that all those names are real.

This is the place where Death delights to help the living.’I am completely, over the top, irrationally fond of books about medicine and/or the macabre and apparently have the extremely annoying habit of sharing choice trivia I pick up in these books, to the horror of my friends (so those of you that I see offline, brace yourselves for some really gruesome tidbits)This book takes the form of memoir, forensic crime investigation, pathology and weird-shit-people-die-from stories. The author seems to be quite an optimistic ray of sunshine in an industry that leans towards the dark and depressing. She conveys the stories at times with humor, at times with sadness but always with compassion and respect.“People ask me all the time, “What’s the worst way to die you’ve ever seen?” I assure them, “You don’t want to know.” She was right. I should not have wanted to know. All I can say is I will never eat lobster again, EVER.She is frank and outspoken about suicide and whether I agree with her views or not, I could sympathize with her. Having lived through her own fathers suicide at the age of 13 it clearly left scars still visible in her adult life.I heard about this author from a GR friend’s review and also knew beforehand that she was most famous for the 8 months she provided medical support in the 9/11 aftermath. What I did not expect was how much of an emotional read Chapter 10 would be for me. I have the utmost respect for each and every person who was involved in the First Responder teams and everyone else that assisted them. Every doctor has to cultivate compassion, to learn it and then practice it. To confront death every day, to see it for yourself, you have to love the living. Would I recommend this? YES absolutely, but then again I have an extreme bias towards books like this so perhaps my judgment cannot be trusted. Oh and a word of warning, if you are overly sensitive or have a weak stomach perhaps this book is not for you."
70,1476727252,http://goodreads.com/user/show/20229277-alissa-patrick,4,"I really loved this book. This is a non-fiction account of a woman's 2 year stint as a New York Medical Examiner, a profession I always found fascinating even though it gives me the heebie jeebies. The stories are of course gross at times (doing the autopsy of a construction worker who had a beam fall on his head). Sometimes the stats are informative and funny (if you die alone with your pet, the dog will lay by your body in mourning.... your cat? Will start eating you that day)I was enjoying this read as a light-hearted read (as much as the content would allow of course)... until I got to the 9/11 chapters. It didn't even occur to me as I was reading what year she had started being an ME, and then suddenly she started a chapter with September 11, 2001, and I went ""oh. crap""The last part of the book was really hard for me. I put it down several times because I nearly cried. I still relive that day so vividly and reading her account of that awful morning- then the task she had of trying to identify only body parts or small pieces of DNA just killed me. I obviously knew the carnage of that day but it just never occurred to me that they barely pulled bodies out of the World Trade Center, it was particles of people. Of the thousands of people killed, only 291 bodies in tact were found. There are still over 1,000 people who never had remains found. These chapters were just terrible and I found myself tearing up. If you're a fan of CSI, Law and Order, etc those type of shows I highly recommend this book. "
71,1476727252,http://goodreads.com/user/show/28627991-gina,5,"Dr. Judy Melinek had just begun training to become a medical examiner just two weeks prior to the horrific 9/11 attacks in New York. Dr. Melinek threw herself into her schooling and then her work, a determined young woman who truly wants to help solve the mysteries of some deaths and help bring closure to grieving families.In this book, she talks of heartbreak, loss, unusual cases, and her own personal viewpoint of the aftermath of 9/11, the bio-terrorist attacks that followed, plane crashes, investigation of sometimes gruesome death scenes, and how she copes with what many find impossible to look at and cannot fathom why some people even do that job.Obviously, this is not a lighthearted romp. It is, however, an important book. It made me very thankful for people that do these types of jobs. "
72,1476727252,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9779623-shaun,4,"This book is a collaboration between Judy Melinek and her husband T.J. Mitchell. Together they describe Judy's time training in forensic pathology at NYC Medical Examiner's Office. So if you've ever wondered what it's like to be a real forensic pathologist, here's your chance.Perhaps most notably, Melinek was in NYC during the Sept 11th attacks and was thus part of the grueling identification process, which often depended on DNA extracted from lone teeth as a means of identification. Her description of that process is nothing short of sobering. I'd never really thought much about the condition of the bodies. Interesting read and competently written."

Better yet, stay out of the car, and get some exercise. Watch your weight. If you’re a smoker stop right now. If you aren’t, don’t start. Guns put holes in people. Drugs are bad…Staying alive is mostly common sense.”This is intriguing story, told in a personable and conversational way, with black humour, personal insights, some interesting characters and plenty of passion. You can feel this doctor’s affinity for her role and the pride she has for revealing the cause of death, particularly in homicide cases where she “speaks on behalf of the dead.” This narrative is told with honesty that sometimes catches you unaware, particularly when the author discusses suicides and neonatal and child deaths; so sad. The life of an Medical Examiner is dissected and probed and all is revealed; the ugliness of death, the stench, the maggots, the sloughing skin, the reek of alcohol, the worry of infection but all is told is a calm and meaning full manner – this is not “voyeur of the dead” material, this is life (because death also affects the living), death and some deaths are good deaths and some… you really should not ask about.Throughout this narrative the authors’ voices carry you on a journey, you walk side by side with the rookie M.E and take lessons with her, then suddenly the world changes, the tone changes and it is chilling. The terrorist attacks on September 11, 2001 on the World Trade Centre towers and other threats shake up the world and have a very personal direct impact on Dr Melinek; she sees firsthand the destruction and violation of life. This section of the book is…overwhelmingly sad and horrific, the work of the first responders and the medical staff tasked with identifying the human remains is a mammoth and heartbreakingly poignant. All involved in the rescue and recovery deserve our thanks.This is truly a remarkable book told with respect and passion. "
74,1476727252,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3067217-kerri-book-hoarder,4,"This book isn't for those with a weak stomach, and, well - it should probably be avoided if you're eating, too. I've always had a fascination for stuff that some people find a bit dark - true crime stories, biographies of serial killers, etc. So this book was right up my alley. Overall, the book does a good job of weaving together stories of a job that's rather morbid and dark with insights into the author's life and the lives of those she has a duty to - the dead and their families, who need answers and resolution. Some of the stories are weird, some of them will make you shake your head, some of them are just outright sad. For me, they reinforced the fact that I'm not cut out for this sort of work, as much as I enjoy reading about it. There is a chapter on the aftermath of 9/11 and I must warn who lived in New York or who was greatly impacted by the events that it is not an easy chapter to get through. Some may wish to skip it entirely. For me it was a reminder and more insight into just how truly awful that day was, and made my heart break all over again. I admire people like Judy, really - they do the work that most of us won't and can't do, and provide a vital service to our communities because of it. Books like this provide insight and remind us how important these sorts of jobs are, even if we never think about them."
75,1476727252,http://goodreads.com/user/show/13814810-ella,2,"Although this book provides an interesting look into the experiences of the author's forensic pathology residency, there are a number of aspects on which I would like to comment more critically. Most importantly, I was very unsettled by Melinek's simplistic conception of suicide and suicidal ideations. She repeatedly and violently asserts that suicide is ""selfish"". Despite Melinek's own early personal exposure to her father's suicide, she neither addresses the context nor engages with any of the complexity surrounding mental health issues. Claiming so assertively that ""suicide is a selfish act"" without considering the factors beyond the individual, the larger social institutions, and the failure of these systems further upstream, is, to me, a rather self-serving assessment. Rhetoric is powerful and I worry about the unintended consequences of Melinek's assertions on this subject. Looking more superficially, I disliked the book's organization. The timeline is established primarily through reference to her second pregnancy and to specific cases. However, the author bounces around considerably during the 2 year period in which the majority of the narrative occurs. This was more of an annoyance then it was seriously disruptive."
76,1476727252,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2079470-cheryl,4,"Dr. Judy Melinek has written a close up, personal account of the time she spent working as a forensic pathologist in the Office of the Chief Medical Examiner of New York City. While there, she performed autopsies on casualties of accidents, homicides, and suicides. In addition to performing autopsies, Dr. Melinek, in some cases, found it necessary and revealing to investigate scenes where bodies were discovered. Another part of her responsibilities involved counseling grieving family members as well as providing court testimony in cases of homicide.Dr. Melinek gives very graphic and detailed accounts of many of her cases. Most poignant and heartwrenching was the description of the work performed by forensic pathologists on the victims of the World Trade Center catastrophe on September 11, 2001, and the days and months afterward. Everyone who worked those cases was forever changed by the experience.Told with compassion and humility, Working Stiff is an unforgettable book. However, it may not appeal to everyone because of the very graphic and gruesome detail included in the casework. "
77,1476727252,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1484029-mikey-b,4,"Obviously the topic of forensics is always of interest; albeit a somewhat macabre one. So from that point of view this book is an obvious winner.However I did find the number of autopsies discussed made for quantity over quality giving the book a somewhat flippant feel (OK the subtitle clearly state 262 bodies so I was warned). Also the book had a lot of medical jargon, some of which was well explained, some not.The most poignant chapter was on the days after September 11, 2001 when the author and her colleagues were overwhelmed by an utter devastation they had never before encountered.Overall I felt the author was writing more for herself than for an audience. Many autopsies were left dangling (like Errico Lavagnino) where we do not know the cause of death. There were too many family and co-worker conversations which made the narrative unnecessarily auto-biographical. And at the risk of being politically incorrect I became irritated by reading about the author’s pregnancies."
78,1476727252,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3772692-jenny-bunting,4,"I wasn't so sure about this memoir when I first started it. It was sciency and then I ended up listening to a huge chunk today to finish and it was AMAZING.It has all the disgusting, gory details that you would hope for. There's obscure diagnoses and freak accidents. There were times I would say ""UGH"" out loud while working and listening. She tells you what is the worst way to die...and it is BAD.She was also a part of the team that worked on cataloguing all of the World Trade Center remains from 9/11 and that section is the most haunting. This is what makes it special and a must read for anyone who is interested in dead body memoirs/non-fiction.If you enjoyed Smoke Gets in Your Eyes and Stiff, you will most definitely like this memoir. If anyone knows of similar memoirs, please suggest them or recommend them to me."

This is a personal account of Judy Melinek's two years working as a forensic pathologist with the Office of the Chief Medical Examiner in New York. I have found out information about decomposing bodies, burns and dismemberment that I did not know were possible. And given that Judy's time there encompassed September 11, 2001 and the scale that OCME had to deal with in deaths is beyond comprehension.As terrible as some of the accounts were, it was also a fitting tribute to the unsung heroes who give their time to answer questions for those who are still living and need resolution, justice or just consolation.If however, you find something like Agatha Christie or Midsummer Murders confronting and grisly then you may wish to steer clear."
80,1476727252,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5500554-stacy-green,4,"I started this book for research but it quickly became much more than that. Melinek has a way of delivering the story with both clinical observation and compassion. It's a very candid glimpse into the world of a medical examiner, and it's done very well. The chapter on 9/11 was chilling and heartbreaking, and hearing about it from the perspective from someone working with the massive amounts of casualties really made it feel like those days were happening all over again. Not for the faint of heart, but very well worth the time. And a must read for any writer considering a character in this field. "

The author describes things with compassion, and gives a good overview of various aspects of the job. Especially sobering was the work done after 9/11. Wow - I thought I had some ideas of what happened, but I never comprehended how truly horrible the aftermath was. I have even more respect for all of the heroes that kept working and dealing with all of that, as well as those who died. Anyway, it was a good book and well worth reading."

The idea of the smells, maggots, and questionable fluids...ah man eww, but the worse would be seeing children or pregnant women (which the author said were the hardest cases to work on).

Staying alive, as it turns out, is mostly common sense.”This is the advice of Judy Melinek, the author of Working Stiff: Two Years, 262 Bodies, and the Making of a Medical Examiner, gleaned from her experience as an assistant medical examiner in New York City. From 2001 to 2003 Melinek performed hundreds of autopsies on the victims of homicides, suicides, accidents, natural diseases, therapeutic complications, and undetermined causes, that crossed her table. Melinek's very first post mortem involved the death of a young man, a heroin addict diagnosed with sickle-cell trait who died in hospital, her second an elderly man who sustained severe burns in a house fire, the third a pregnant woman, the victim of a hit and run. In general, each chapter of Working Stiff groups together cases by manner of death, detailing Melinek's examination of patients young and old, male and female, destitute and wealthy, and everything in between. The final chapters focus on the medical examiners office's role in the wake of the Twin Towers collapse on September 11, and the crash of American Airlines flight 587. The narrative is very readable, almost conversational in tone, and mostly free of the medical jargon one might expect. Melinek is at all times respectful but not humourless, sharing both professional perspective and personal observations. I do feel compelled to warn the unwary reader that this isn't a book for the squeamish with its graphic record of gruesome injury and detailed descriptions of the forensic autopsy process.What shines through is Melinek's passion and commitment to her job as she works to investigate and determine the cause and manner of death, comfort the bereaved, provide assistance to the justice system and ""speak for the dead"".Informative, entertaining and engaging Working Stiff is a fascinating account of the work of a medical examiner, well told by Judy Melinek and her husband T.J. Mitchell. * I gave the book an extra 1/2 star for Judy's admission she wears ""sensible shoes and a Medical Examiner windbreaker"" during her rare visits to crime scenes - not six inch stiletto's and Armani suits. "
85,1476727252,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1740304-linda,4,"Dr. Melinek was originally studying to be a surgeon. But the grueling conditions of her surgical residency were taking their toll on her life and health, and the health of patients. Honestly, the description of what is expected of surgical residents scared the shit out of me. I know, we’ve seen it in TV dramas… no sleep, inhuman hours. But the reality is that nobody could possibly function well under those conditions, and our lives depend on surgeons being at their best. It makes me wonder if some regulation should be put into place similar to that for pilots and truck drivers. Anyway, her quitting her surgical residency for the more civilized routine of a medical examiner is what brings us to this book.Her descriptions of how she does her work, in conjunction with law enforcement, to determine cause of death… and more important, manner of death, was fascinating. Manner of death includes Homicide, Suicide, Accidental, Natural, and Undetermined. Dr. Melinek provides vivid anecdotes of each of these, and it’s very interesting. She does not come across as a morbid person, and in fact enjoys the work for the comfort it can provide the living.She tells us of having worked as a Medical Examiner in NYC through the 9/11 attacks and the subsequent anthrax scare, which is as overwhelming as you would imagine.There’s only one thing I was a little triggered by, and it has nothing to do with the gruesome descriptions of death and the methodical dissection of corpses. Dr. Melinek survived her own tragedy when her beloved father took his own life while she was a girl. And whenever she discusses her findings of suicide, there remains an understandable bitterness. It allows her to be more empathetic to other survivors, which is wonderful. But her vehement assertion that all people who commit suicide are selfish hit me wrong. I am also the survivor of a loved one who took her own life, though not a parent. My own conclusion is that none of us can know the pain and suffering that another person endures. And they deserve compassion more than derision. I’m not condemning her perspective as less valid than mine, it just made it a little hard for me to read at points.3.67 stars"
86,1476727252,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4089241-liralen,4,"I'm stumped. This would normally go on my hypothetical list of jobs I never knew I didn't want, except I did know I wouldn't want this job. I just love reading about it. 'Jobs I Only Want to Read About'?Erm. Anyway. Melinek turned from surgery to forensic pathology after realising that both career paths would let her cut up bodies but pathology would also let her get more than three hours of sleep (and the patients wouldn't argue). Here she details cases she saw during her two years in New York City, where she learned the ropes. Suicides and overdoses—so many overdoses—and accidents and medical errors. More overdoses. Murders. Early in her career but late in the book, victims of 9/11.Melinek displays a fair amount of glee in discussing some of the more interesting cases—I rather think she and Mary Roach would get along—while managing to remain respectful of the individuals (deceased and family) involved. She's descriptive enough that I actually took a break mid-book to read something lighter, which I don't usually feel the need to do...I recommend reading this, but not while eating!Towards the end of the book, Melinek talks about the attacks on the World Trade Center in 2001, when she'd been working as a medical examiner for only a few months. To me it was the strongest section of the book—it has the most consistent storyline of the book, and although that (and the American Airlines crash of November 2001) is the most hectic, case-after-case-body-after-body time she describes, in some ways it's the least hectic section of the book—more time taken to slow down and connect her personal experience with her professional experience. Up to that point I was enjoying the stories but finding the transitions somewhat lacking (or perhaps too good, as she segued neatly from body to body to body), but the pieces really fell into place for me later on in the book.I'll never be a doctor, much less a medical examiner, and I'm so many kinds of okay with that. But a reader of books like this? Yes please."

I imagine it was cathartic for the writer to share, but a lot of this book made me squirm with discomfort. Like the accidents whose victims the author attended to, morbid curiousity prevented me from looking away. I wouldn't recommend it to the squeamish and, as others have noted, she is particularly opinionated about suicide and tends to come across as highly unsympathetic.2 stars out of 5. It grows very repetitive very quickly and I began skimming about halfway through."

The only issue I had was that there were so many stories - bodies - and that the story itself was too fragmented. Other than this, absolutely a fascinating read. "
89,1476727252,http://goodreads.com/user/show/678841-kim,4,"Working Stiff discusses Judy Melinek's two years working for the New York City OCME (Office of the Chief Medical Examiner), which began in 2001 and ended in 2002. Although the WTC attack happened only six weeks after she began work and the plane crash in Queens four weeks after that, the book is not about these two disasters but her experience and teachings from the autopsies of ""regular"" New Yorkers, and all the different ways that they die.I found the subject matter fascinating. This sort of pathology is something I had considered and briefly, in medical school, I spent time in the ME's office. I was immediately repelled by the odor of decomposition. ""You get used to it,"" was what the medical examiners and detectives told me, but I was pretty sure that wasn't true. Years later, I know that there are certain things we learn to put up with in our line of work and others that just strain our personal limits. So - kudos to Judy Melinek and others like her who are able to handle the stench of decomposition when it is present and do this job. On the plus side: Melinek does an incredible job documenting how ordinary and not-so-ordinary people die, what happens to our bodies after we die, and how medical examiners piece together our last hours and moments of life. The scientific and technical details are amazing. She discusses numerous cases - murders and natural causes, ""therapeutic complications"" (as a physician, I really like that), innumerable accidental deaths, suicides. As she states in the beginning of the book, ""Staying alive, as it turns out, is mostly common sense."" So true.Like everyone else old enough to pay attention, I remember where I was on September 11, 2001; and exactly what I was doing when I found out what was going on; and exactly what I was doing when those towers fell. Years later it is still something that brings me to tears: the horror, the fear, the magnitude of loss. The people who gave of themselves to save others and lost their own lives as a consequence. Melinek provides an entirely fresh, gruesome, devastating look at an old story which is both horrifying (""an X-ray had revealed a woman's severed hand, complete with wedding ring, entirely embedded within the chest wall of a man's intact torso"") and educational (""the individual pieces of recovered remains numbered 19,956""). I admit I cried for these people and their families, and for the people who worked to identify them after the fact. I don't know how you wrap your head around that and emerge intact, although I suppose it's pretty much like anything else: one foot in front of the other until it's far enough behind you.On the downside: Another reviewer has mentioned the lack of an index, which I thoroughly agree with. I own an e-book, so it's moderately easier to find things, but this is still a lack. I agree that the book lacks an ""arc,"" which makes it difficult to read at times. I really enjoyed it, but I read the individual vignettes - because that is mostly what they are - over many months. I am not sure if the book would have been better if Melinek had begun at the beginning of the two years and used her personal growth as a story arc or if this was the best option if she did not want the entire book dominated by 9/11. While I understand her wish to make the book about forensics and not about 9/11, I think the lack of an arc is a detriment.However, overall this is an interesting - if not super quick - read. I really enjoyed it and for anyone looking to learn a little more about this subject it is a worthwhile read."

91,1476727252,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5028851-cathryn,5,"While I was reading this book I kept walking around my house saying ""This is fascinating."" to the point that I started the sentence and my daughter finished it. I don't read much non-fiction but I have a fascination with death and what happens to your body after you die. That's why I picked this up. Maybe it's because we don't really talk about it as a society. It's too taboo or gross or a combination of both I don't know.This book covers the first year of Dr. Melinek's fellowship in NYC as a medical examiner. She doesn't go through all 262 cases but picks highlights to show was is involved in the different types of death. She does a really good job of breaking down all the medical jargon into laymen's terms without sounding condescending. Part of an MEs training is to learn how to do that since they deal with grieving family members. Each case is its own little story and I was surprised at how much detective work an ME actually does. If there is no criminal homicide for the police to investigate (and only about 30% of autopsy cases are criminal in nature) it is up to the ME to piece together what happened and not just physically. They have to understand the circumstances surrounding the death and that involves some legwork.The final section of the book is about 9/11. Melinek was only 9 weeks into her fellowship when this happened. I've heard a lot of stories about the brave work of the firefighters and police on that day but I haven't heard anything about the MEs. The only medical stories I've heard were about all the doctors and nurses waiting at the hospitals for the wounded to come in and how devastated they were when only a fraction of the number expected showed up. Now imagine what all the MEs had to go through. It was heartbreaking and interesting at the same time. They were able to identify approximately half of those that died that day. Considering what they had to work with it's pretty amazing.If you have any interest in this area I highly recommend picking up this book."

I am a big fan of crime novels, and with a boyfriend in the police, crime and murder is definitely something that interests me. This book goes into detail about how many different ways people die on an everyday occurrence, while going into detail her checklist of things that she does when doing a post mortem. This book answered every curiosity I had about post mortems and what exactly it is they do with a body. It also showed me how unexpected and random life can be; some of the accidents and medical mistakes that caused deaths throughout this really did make me think. Another thing I really appreciated is how she has shown that women can have the big career and still have a home life; something I think more women need to hear, too often we're told there's a choice and I think Melinek proved that you can indeed have both.

Judy MelinekAfter reading this book I really wish I had become a medical examiner...weird I know ;-) It was fascinating. The one thing that would probably make me quit that job though would be the smell of a decomposing body...It hits you--an assault, not a scent. You flinch, heave back in revulsion. It invades your throat, assails your taste buds, even stings your eyes.The maggot talk just validated my wish to be immediately sealed in a metal drawer in a mausoleum after I die. I also knew there had to be a reason I'm allergic to cats...they will eat you immediately after you die. Whereas dogs will just stay by you for days on end. The last quarter of this book was completely spellbinding, in my opinion. She was a NYC Medical Examiner on 9/11. She heard and saw that low flying jetliner when she was hurrying to work that morning. It is even more horrific through her eyes than what I heard and saw on the news. She tagged body pieces (and the descriptions of their condition were awful)...many refrigerated tractor trailers' worth of body parts, a small number of intact bodies.The limbs had all been amputated. The torso was transected below the navel. The remains were entirely black--burned and covered in soot. The head...the head wasn't recognizable as a head, except that it had hair and was attached to the neck. The smell of jet fuel was so strong it made me dizzy. I could tell just by looking at the open body bag that this person had been mashed, burned, dropped from a height, and slashed by sharp forces. I had seen people killed by subway trains and speeding cars, run over by trucks, crushed by industrial equipment, fallen from great heights, burned, and battered--but never all at the same time.I examined the surface of the leg--and came across something that made me stare. Fragments of a personal bank check, complete with routing number and a partially legible name, were embedded under the skin, buried deep in the muscle tissue....an X-ray had revealed a woman's severed hand, complete with wedding ring, entirely embedded inside the chest wall of a man's intact torso.This quote from the Chief Medical Examiner at the time is haunting: People were jumping or falling from the buildings. They seemed to take forever to fall, tumbling through the air. They would hit the pavement with a loud thud--very loud--and bounce, and land again. The sounds of the bodies hitting the ground echoed off the buildings, one after another, over and over. I've added some great quotes from this book...hopefully they will show below this review. "
94,1476727252,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4968643-david,2,"Published a dozen years after Dr. Melinek’s two year stint in the NYC Office of the Chief Medical Examiner the cases and experiences she describes are flat, lifeless and incomplete. With all of that time between the events and the publishing of the book the authors should have conducted some degree of research to round out the stories of the cadavers she autopsied. The frequent quoted conversations had me wondering how accurate the dialogue was. And how could stories from the NYC medical examiner’s be so uninteresting?The book started off strongly and Dr. Melinek's perspective on suicide was powerful and interesting. However the book lost its unique voice soon thereafter. The stories simply weren’t compelling and there were hints of smugness, impatience and pettiness that made her seem less nice than the image she was going for (she took some condescending cheap shots at peoples’ appearances that had nothing to do with the stories at hand - the woman with the nose job, the fat guy, just to name two instances).As to the autopsies there are plenty of the sickening descriptions you might expect. Sometimes the authors seemed to rely on technical language with little explanation to create a ‘wow’ factor. If you have pet cats or are expecting to have surgery in the near future you might want to skip this one for either of those reasons alone.One final complaint: the authors played up the wittiness of Dr. Hirsch’s epigrams as if he were some magical combination of Confucius and Henny Youngman. Unfortunately the many decade old quotes fell far short of that mark. Maybe they simply forgot his precise quotes after all of those years."
95,1476727252,http://goodreads.com/user/show/23100707-jean,4,"This is a memoir of a forensic pathologist. After medical school Dr. Melinek started a residency program to be a surgeon. She took time off from work to have a baby and decided to change her specialty and become a pathologist. She attended UCLA for her pathology and forensic training and was accepted at the NYC Medical Examiner’s Office for her one-year forensic residency training program. After she completed the program she stayed on in the medical examiner’s office for another one-year residency program in forensic neuropathology.Dr. Melinek was only two months into her residency when the September 11 terrorist attack happened. She provides a firsthand account of events at the medical examiner’s office of that fateful event. She also covers the anthrax bio-terrorism attack in NYC and the crash of American Airlines flight 587. As the residency program was two years she also got to cover the routine murders, suicides and accidents normally dealt with by the medical examiner. Dr. Melinek reveals the day to day life of a forensic pathologist. She also provides some background information, for example: how a death certificate is filled out and why; what constitutes accidental death or homicide and so on. I found the information on the type of bullets and their effect on the body interesting as well as the general information of ballistics. Overall a most fascinating memoir.Dr. Melinek wrote the book with her husband, T. J. Mitchell. They met at Harvard where he was an English major. He works as a screenwriter and script editor.Tanya Eby does a good job narrating the book. Eby is a voice over artist and an award winning audiobook narrator."

I like Melinek's voice and style of writing and her irreverent way of looking at death. I love the way she describes her reaction to shows featuring characters doing her job - the fact that they go to every crime scene, the women wear their good high-heeled shoes, they actually help with the investigation. From now on CSI will be light-hearted crime fiction, in the same league as those 'cosy mysteries' that feature little old lady super-sleuths, not a realistic look into the life of a medical examiner. I can see the irony and humour in some of the causes of death that she sees (although, not when contemplating my own future). For example, an unfortunate worker having his morning coffee gets hit in the head by a giant crane, a crane so large that he is practically crumpled into the ground like an aluminium can. Although, at the same time reading medical nonfiction does hit a bit close to home for someone only weeks away from having major surgery to remove a 9 x 7 cm suspicious mass, along with 25% of her liver. Maybe I shouldn't be reading this right now... So far I'm enjoying it despite the negative thoughts it's bringing up. To be continued...12/3 - Not as bad as I thought it was going to be re bringing up disturbing thoughts, except for one of the later chapters focussing on deaths due to 'medical misadventures' or 'therapeutic complications' as Melinek puts it - when a patient dies during non-emergent surgery due to surgeon error. Reading about the ordeal Melinek and her fellow medical examiners went through in the aftermath of September 11 was a little tough, even for someone who's never been to New York - body bags becoming body part bags becoming body bit bags (a lump of skin, a piece of an intestine) and thinking of all the families who don't KNOW what happened to their father, mother, son, daughter. That was really sad. I do wonder how she remembered the details of all these cases, from 14 years ago, so vividly, even seeming to repeat conversations word for word. I also wonder how she managed to get all the patient's families to agree to have their family member's death story revealed in the ME's memoir. There was no mention anywhere of the names having been changed to protect the surviving family members, so I have to assume that all those names are real. Whatever the case, highly recommended to those with a strong stomach and a lack of anxiety regarding all the ways they and their loved ones could die.PopSugar 2015 Reading Challenge: A Memoir"

This is the place where Death delights to help the living.’I am completely, over the top, irrationally fond of books about medicine and/or the macabre and apparently have the extremely annoying habit of sharing choice trivia I pick up in these books, to the horror of my friends (so those of you that I see offline, brace yourselves for some really gruesome tidbits)This book takes the form of memoir, forensic crime investigation, pathology and weird-shit-people-die-from stories. The author seems to be quite an optimistic ray of sunshine in an industry that leans towards the dark and depressing. She conveys the stories at times with humor, at times with sadness but always with compassion and respect.“People ask me all the time, “What’s the worst way to die you’ve ever seen?” I assure them, “You don’t want to know.” She was right. I should not have wanted to know. All I can say is I will never eat lobster again, EVER.She is frank and outspoken about suicide and whether I agree with her views or not, I could sympathize with her. Having lived through her own fathers suicide at the age of 13 it clearly left scars still visible in her adult life.I heard about this author from a GR friend’s review and also knew beforehand that she was most famous for the 8 months she provided medical support in the 9/11 aftermath. What I did not expect was how much of an emotional read Chapter 10 would be for me. I have the utmost respect for each and every person who was involved in the First Responder teams and everyone else that assisted them. Every doctor has to cultivate compassion, to learn it and then practice it. To confront death every day, to see it for yourself, you have to love the living. Would I recommend this? YES absolutely, but then again I have an extreme bias towards books like this so perhaps my judgment cannot be trusted. Oh and a word of warning, if you are overly sensitive or have a weak stomach perhaps this book is not for you."
100,1476727252,http://goodreads.com/user/show/20229277-alissa-patrick,4,"I really loved this book. This is a non-fiction account of a woman's 2 year stint as a New York Medical Examiner, a profession I always found fascinating even though it gives me the heebie jeebies. The stories are of course gross at times (doing the autopsy of a construction worker who had a beam fall on his head). Sometimes the stats are informative and funny (if you die alone with your pet, the dog will lay by your body in mourning.... your cat? Will start eating you that day)I was enjoying this read as a light-hearted read (as much as the content would allow of course)... until I got to the 9/11 chapters. It didn't even occur to me as I was reading what year she had started being an ME, and then suddenly she started a chapter with September 11, 2001, and I went ""oh. crap""The last part of the book was really hard for me. I put it down several times because I nearly cried. I still relive that day so vividly and reading her account of that awful morning- then the task she had of trying to identify only body parts or small pieces of DNA just killed me. I obviously knew the carnage of that day but it just never occurred to me that they barely pulled bodies out of the World Trade Center, it was particles of people. Of the thousands of people killed, only 291 bodies in tact were found. There are still over 1,000 people who never had remains found. These chapters were just terrible and I found myself tearing up. If you're a fan of CSI, Law and Order, etc those type of shows I highly recommend this book. "

Dr. Melinek threw herself into her schooling and then her work, a determined young woman who truly wants to help solve the mysteries of some deaths and help bring closure to grieving families.In this book, she talks of heartbreak, loss, unusual cases, and her own personal viewpoint of the aftermath of 9/11, the bio-terrorist attacks that followed, plane crashes, investigation of sometimes gruesome death scenes, and how she copes with what many find impossible to look at and cannot fathom why some people even do that job.Obviously, this is not a lighthearted romp. It is, however, an important book. It made me very thankful for people that do these types of jobs. "
102,1476727252,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9779623-shaun,4,"This book is a collaboration between Judy Melinek and her husband T.J. Mitchell. Together they describe Judy's time training in forensic pathology at NYC Medical Examiner's Office. So if you've ever wondered what it's like to be a real forensic pathologist, here's your chance.Perhaps most notably, Melinek was in NYC during the Sept 11th attacks and was thus part of the grueling identification process, which often depended on DNA extracted from lone teeth as a means of identification. Her description of that process is nothing short of sobering. I'd never really thought much about the condition of the bodies. Interesting read and competently written."

Better yet, stay out of the car, and get some exercise. Watch your weight. If you’re a smoker stop right now. If you aren’t, don’t start. Guns put holes in people. Drugs are bad…Staying alive is mostly common sense.”This is intriguing story, told in a personable and conversational way, with black humour, personal insights, some interesting characters and plenty of passion. You can feel this doctor’s affinity for her role and the pride she has for revealing the cause of death, particularly in homicide cases where she “speaks on behalf of the dead.” This narrative is told with honesty that sometimes catches you unaware, particularly when the author discusses suicides and neonatal and child deaths; so sad. The life of an Medical Examiner is dissected and probed and all is revealed; the ugliness of death, the stench, the maggots, the sloughing skin, the reek of alcohol, the worry of infection but all is told is a calm and meaning full manner – this is not “voyeur of the dead” material, this is life (because death also affects the living), death and some deaths are good deaths and some… you really should not ask about.Throughout this narrative the authors’ voices carry you on a journey, you walk side by side with the rookie M.E and take lessons with her, then suddenly the world changes, the tone changes and it is chilling. The terrorist attacks on September 11, 2001 on the World Trade Centre towers and other threats shake up the world and have a very personal direct impact on Dr Melinek; she sees firsthand the destruction and violation of life. This section of the book is…overwhelmingly sad and horrific, the work of the first responders and the medical staff tasked with identifying the human remains is a mammoth and heartbreakingly poignant. All involved in the rescue and recovery deserve our thanks.This is truly a remarkable book told with respect and passion. "

I've always had a fascination for stuff that some people find a bit dark - true crime stories, biographies of serial killers, etc. So this book was right up my alley. Overall, the book does a good job of weaving together stories of a job that's rather morbid and dark with insights into the author's life and the lives of those she has a duty to - the dead and their families, who need answers and resolution. Some of the stories are weird, some of them will make you shake your head, some of them are just outright sad. For me, they reinforced the fact that I'm not cut out for this sort of work, as much as I enjoy reading about it. There is a chapter on the aftermath of 9/11 and I must warn who lived in New York or who was greatly impacted by the events that it is not an easy chapter to get through. Some may wish to skip it entirely. For me it was a reminder and more insight into just how truly awful that day was, and made my heart break all over again. I admire people like Judy, really - they do the work that most of us won't and can't do, and provide a vital service to our communities because of it. Books like this provide insight and remind us how important these sorts of jobs are, even if we never think about them."
105,1476727252,http://goodreads.com/user/show/13814810-ella,2,"Although this book provides an interesting look into the experiences of the author's forensic pathology residency, there are a number of aspects on which I would like to comment more critically. Most importantly, I was very unsettled by Melinek's simplistic conception of suicide and suicidal ideations. She repeatedly and violently asserts that suicide is ""selfish"". Despite Melinek's own early personal exposure to her father's suicide, she neither addresses the context nor engages with any of the complexity surrounding mental health issues. Claiming so assertively that ""suicide is a selfish act"" without considering the factors beyond the individual, the larger social institutions, and the failure of these systems further upstream, is, to me, a rather self-serving assessment. Rhetoric is powerful and I worry about the unintended consequences of Melinek's assertions on this subject. Looking more superficially, I disliked the book's organization. The timeline is established primarily through reference to her second pregnancy and to specific cases. However, the author bounces around considerably during the 2 year period in which the majority of the narrative occurs. This was more of an annoyance then it was seriously disruptive."
106,1476727252,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2079470-cheryl,4,"Dr. Judy Melinek has written a close up, personal account of the time she spent working as a forensic pathologist in the Office of the Chief Medical Examiner of New York City. While there, she performed autopsies on casualties of accidents, homicides, and suicides. In addition to performing autopsies, Dr. Melinek, in some cases, found it necessary and revealing to investigate scenes where bodies were discovered. Another part of her responsibilities involved counseling grieving family members as well as providing court testimony in cases of homicide.Dr. Melinek gives very graphic and detailed accounts of many of her cases. Most poignant and heartwrenching was the description of the work performed by forensic pathologists on the victims of the World Trade Center catastrophe on September 11, 2001, and the days and months afterward. Everyone who worked those cases was forever changed by the experience.Told with compassion and humility, Working Stiff is an unforgettable book. However, it may not appeal to everyone because of the very graphic and gruesome detail included in the casework. "
107,1476727252,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1484029-mikey-b,4,"Obviously the topic of forensics is always of interest; albeit a somewhat macabre one. So from that point of view this book is an obvious winner.However I did find the number of autopsies discussed made for quantity over quality giving the book a somewhat flippant feel (OK the subtitle clearly state 262 bodies so I was warned). Also the book had a lot of medical jargon, some of which was well explained, some not.The most poignant chapter was on the days after September 11, 2001 when the author and her colleagues were overwhelmed by an utter devastation they had never before encountered.Overall I felt the author was writing more for herself than for an audience. Many autopsies were left dangling (like Errico Lavagnino) where we do not know the cause of death. There were too many family and co-worker conversations which made the narrative unnecessarily auto-biographical. And at the risk of being politically incorrect I became irritated by reading about the author’s pregnancies."

There's obscure diagnoses and freak accidents. There were times I would say ""UGH"" out loud while working and listening. She tells you what is the worst way to die...and it is BAD.She was also a part of the team that worked on cataloguing all of the World Trade Center remains from 9/11 and that section is the most haunting.

This is a personal account of Judy Melinek's two years working as a forensic pathologist with the Office of the Chief Medical Examiner in New York. I have found out information about decomposing bodies, burns and dismemberment that I did not know were possible. And given that Judy's time there encompassed September 11, 2001 and the scale that OCME had to deal with in deaths is beyond comprehension.As terrible as some of the accounts were, it was also a fitting tribute to the unsung heroes who give their time to answer questions for those who are still living and need resolution, justice or just consolation.If however, you find something like Agatha Christie or Midsummer Murders confronting and grisly then you may wish to steer clear."

Melinek has a way of delivering the story with both clinical observation and compassion. It's a very candid glimpse into the world of a medical examiner, and it's done very well. The chapter on 9/11 was chilling and heartbreaking, and hearing about it from the perspective from someone working with the massive amounts of casualties really made it feel like those days were happening all over again. Not for the faint of heart, but very well worth the time. And a must read for any writer considering a character in this field. "

Staying alive, as it turns out, is mostly common sense.”This is the advice of Judy Melinek, the author of Working Stiff: Two Years, 262 Bodies, and the Making of a Medical Examiner, gleaned from her experience as an assistant medical examiner in New York City. From 2001 to 2003 Melinek performed hundreds of autopsies on the victims of homicides, suicides, accidents, natural diseases, therapeutic complications, and undetermined causes, that crossed her table. Melinek's very first post mortem involved the death of a young man, a heroin addict diagnosed with sickle-cell trait who died in hospital, her second an elderly man who sustained severe burns in a house fire, the third a pregnant woman, the victim of a hit and run. In general, each chapter of Working Stiff groups together cases by manner of death, detailing Melinek's examination of patients young and old, male and female, destitute and wealthy, and everything in between. The final chapters focus on the medical examiners office's role in the wake of the Twin Towers collapse on September 11, and the crash of American Airlines flight 587. The narrative is very readable, almost conversational in tone, and mostly free of the medical jargon one might expect. Melinek is at all times respectful but not humourless, sharing both professional perspective and personal observations. I do feel compelled to warn the unwary reader that this isn't a book for the squeamish with its graphic record of gruesome injury and detailed descriptions of the forensic autopsy process.What shines through is Melinek's passion and commitment to her job as she works to investigate and determine the cause and manner of death, comfort the bereaved, provide assistance to the justice system and ""speak for the dead"".Informative, entertaining and engaging Working Stiff is a fascinating account of the work of a medical examiner, well told by Judy Melinek and her husband T.J. Mitchell. * I gave the book an extra 1/2 star for Judy's admission she wears ""sensible shoes and a Medical Examiner windbreaker"" during her rare visits to crime scenes - not six inch stiletto's and Armani suits.

115,1476727252,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1740304-linda,4,"Dr. Melinek was originally studying to be a surgeon. But the grueling conditions of her surgical residency were taking their toll on her life and health, and the health of patients. Honestly, the description of what is expected of surgical residents scared the shit out of me. I know, we’ve seen it in TV dramas… no sleep, inhuman hours. But the reality is that nobody could possibly function well under those conditions, and our lives depend on surgeons being at their best. It makes me wonder if some regulation should be put into place similar to that for pilots and truck drivers. Anyway, her quitting her surgical residency for the more civilized routine of a medical examiner is what brings us to this book.Her descriptions of how she does her work, in conjunction with law enforcement, to determine cause of death… and more important, manner of death, was fascinating. Manner of death includes Homicide, Suicide, Accidental, Natural, and Undetermined. Dr. Melinek provides vivid anecdotes of each of these, and it’s very interesting. She does not come across as a morbid person, and in fact enjoys the work for the comfort it can provide the living.She tells us of having worked as a Medical Examiner in NYC through the 9/11 attacks and the subsequent anthrax scare, which is as overwhelming as you would imagine.There’s only one thing I was a little triggered by, and it has nothing to do with the gruesome descriptions of death and the methodical dissection of corpses. Dr. Melinek survived her own tragedy when her beloved father took his own life while she was a girl. And whenever she discusses her findings of suicide, there remains an understandable bitterness. It allows her to be more empathetic to other survivors, which is wonderful. But her vehement assertion that all people who commit suicide are selfish hit me wrong. I am also the survivor of a loved one who took her own life, though not a parent. My own conclusion is that none of us can know the pain and suffering that another person endures. And they deserve compassion more than derision. I’m not condemning her perspective as less valid than mine, it just made it a little hard for me to read at points.3.67 stars"

This would normally go on my hypothetical list of jobs I never knew I didn't want, except I did know I wouldn't want this job. I just love reading about it. 'Jobs I Only Want to Read About'?Erm. Anyway. Melinek turned from surgery to forensic pathology after realising that both career paths would let her cut up bodies but pathology would also let her get more than three hours of sleep (and the patients wouldn't argue). Here she details cases she saw during her two years in New York City, where she learned the ropes. Suicides and overdoses—so many overdoses—and accidents and medical errors. More overdoses. Murders. Early in her career but late in the book, victims of 9/11.Melinek displays a fair amount of glee in discussing some of the more interesting cases—I rather think she and Mary Roach would get along—while managing to remain respectful of the individuals (deceased and family) involved. She's descriptive enough that I actually took a break mid-book to read something lighter, which I don't usually feel the need to do...I recommend reading this, but not while eating!Towards the end of the book, Melinek talks about the attacks on the World Trade Center in 2001, when she'd been working as a medical examiner for only a few months. To me it was the strongest section of the book—it has the most consistent storyline of the book, and although that (and the American Airlines crash of November 2001) is the most hectic, case-after-case-body-after-body time she describes, in some ways it's the least hectic section of the book—more time taken to slow down and connect her personal experience with her professional experience. Up to that point I was enjoying the stories but finding the transitions somewhat lacking (or perhaps too good, as she segued neatly from body to body to body), but the pieces really fell into place for me later on in the book.I'll never be a doctor, much less a medical examiner, and I'm so many kinds of okay with that.

119,1476727252,http://goodreads.com/user/show/678841-kim,4,"Working Stiff discusses Judy Melinek's two years working for the New York City OCME (Office of the Chief Medical Examiner), which began in 2001 and ended in 2002. Although the WTC attack happened only six weeks after she began work and the plane crash in Queens four weeks after that, the book is not about these two disasters but her experience and teachings from the autopsies of ""regular"" New Yorkers, and all the different ways that they die.I found the subject matter fascinating. This sort of pathology is something I had considered and briefly, in medical school, I spent time in the ME's office. I was immediately repelled by the odor of decomposition. ""You get used to it,"" was what the medical examiners and detectives told me, but I was pretty sure that wasn't true. Years later, I know that there are certain things we learn to put up with in our line of work and others that just strain our personal limits. So - kudos to Judy Melinek and others like her who are able to handle the stench of decomposition when it is present and do this job. On the plus side: Melinek does an incredible job documenting how ordinary and not-so-ordinary people die, what happens to our bodies after we die, and how medical examiners piece together our last hours and moments of life. The scientific and technical details are amazing. She discusses numerous cases - murders and natural causes, ""therapeutic complications"" (as a physician, I really like that), innumerable accidental deaths, suicides. As she states in the beginning of the book, ""Staying alive, as it turns out, is mostly common sense."" So true.Like everyone else old enough to pay attention, I remember where I was on September 11, 2001; and exactly what I was doing when I found out what was going on; and exactly what I was doing when those towers fell. Years later it is still something that brings me to tears: the horror, the fear, the magnitude of loss. The people who gave of themselves to save others and lost their own lives as a consequence. Melinek provides an entirely fresh, gruesome, devastating look at an old story which is both horrifying (""an X-ray had revealed a woman's severed hand, complete with wedding ring, entirely embedded within the chest wall of a man's intact torso"") and educational (""the individual pieces of recovered remains numbered 19,956""). I admit I cried for these people and their families, and for the people who worked to identify them after the fact. I don't know how you wrap your head around that and emerge intact, although I suppose it's pretty much like anything else: one foot in front of the other until it's far enough behind you.On the downside: Another reviewer has mentioned the lack of an index, which I thoroughly agree with. I own an e-book, so it's moderately easier to find things, but this is still a lack. I agree that the book lacks an ""arc,"" which makes it difficult to read at times. I really enjoyed it, but I read the individual vignettes - because that is mostly what they are - over many months. I am not sure if the book would have been better if Melinek had begun at the beginning of the two years and used her personal growth as a story arc or if this was the best option if she did not want the entire book dominated by 9/11. While I understand her wish to make the book about forensics and not about 9/11, I think the lack of an arc is a detriment.However, overall this is an interesting - if not super quick - read. I really enjoyed it and for anyone looking to learn a little more about this subject it is a worthwhile read."

It's a graphic yet tasteful and respectful memoir of a New York medical examiner's grisly career and how she coped with it over time, as well as how her work helped grieving families and friends find closure."
121,1476727252,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5028851-cathryn,5,"While I was reading this book I kept walking around my house saying ""This is fascinating."" to the point that I started the sentence and my daughter finished it. I don't read much non-fiction but I have a fascination with death and what happens to your body after you die. That's why I picked this up. Maybe it's because we don't really talk about it as a society. It's too taboo or gross or a combination of both I don't know.This book covers the first year of Dr. Melinek's fellowship in NYC as a medical examiner. She doesn't go through all 262 cases but picks highlights to show was is involved in the different types of death. She does a really good job of breaking down all the medical jargon into laymen's terms without sounding condescending. Part of an MEs training is to learn how to do that since they deal with grieving family members. Each case is its own little story and I was surprised at how much detective work an ME actually does. If there is no criminal homicide for the police to investigate (and only about 30% of autopsy cases are criminal in nature) it is up to the ME to piece together what happened and not just physically. They have to understand the circumstances surrounding the death and that involves some legwork.The final section of the book is about 9/11. Melinek was only 9 weeks into her fellowship when this happened. I've heard a lot of stories about the brave work of the firefighters and police on that day but I haven't heard anything about the MEs. The only medical stories I've heard were about all the doctors and nurses waiting at the hospitals for the wounded to come in and how devastated they were when only a fraction of the number expected showed up. Now imagine what all the MEs had to go through. It was heartbreaking and interesting at the same time. They were able to identify approximately half of those that died that day. Considering what they had to work with it's pretty amazing.If you have any interest in this area I highly recommend picking up this book."
122,1476727252,http://goodreads.com/user/show/52700401-abbie-hooton,5,"If you have any sense of morbid fascination with the dead and what happens, then this is definitely worth a read. I am a big fan of crime novels, and with a boyfriend in the police, crime and murder is definitely something that interests me. This book goes into detail about how many different ways people die on an everyday occurrence, while going into detail her checklist of things that she does when doing a post mortem. This book answered every curiosity I had about post mortems and what exactly it is they do with a body. It also showed me how unexpected and random life can be; some of the accidents and medical mistakes that caused deaths throughout this really did make me think. Another thing I really appreciated is how she has shown that women can have the big career and still have a home life; something I think more women need to hear, too often we're told there's a choice and I think Melinek proved that you can indeed have both. "
123,1476727252,http://goodreads.com/user/show/773729-kelly,4,"Once I became an eyewitness to death, I found that nearly every unexpected fatality I investigated was either the result of something dangerously mundane, or of something predictably hazardous. So don't jaywalk...You know that yellow line on the subway platform? It's there for a reason. Staying alive, as it turns out, is mostly common sense. Judy MelinekAfter reading this book I really wish I had become a medical examiner...weird I know ;-) It was fascinating. The one thing that would probably make me quit that job though would be the smell of a decomposing body...It hits you--an assault, not a scent. You flinch, heave back in revulsion. It invades your throat, assails your taste buds, even stings your eyes.The maggot talk just validated my wish to be immediately sealed in a metal drawer in a mausoleum after I die. I also knew there had to be a reason I'm allergic to cats...they will eat you immediately after you die. Whereas dogs will just stay by you for days on end. The last quarter of this book was completely spellbinding, in my opinion. She was a NYC Medical Examiner on 9/11. She heard and saw that low flying jetliner when she was hurrying to work that morning. It is even more horrific through her eyes than what I heard and saw on the news. She tagged body pieces (and the descriptions of their condition were awful)...many refrigerated tractor trailers' worth of body parts, a small number of intact bodies.The limbs had all been amputated. The torso was transected below the navel. The remains were entirely black--burned and covered in soot. The head...the head wasn't recognizable as a head, except that it had hair and was attached to the neck. The smell of jet fuel was so strong it made me dizzy. I could tell just by looking at the open body bag that this person had been mashed, burned, dropped from a height, and slashed by sharp forces. I had seen people killed by subway trains and speeding cars, run over by trucks, crushed by industrial equipment, fallen from great heights, burned, and battered--but never all at the same time.I examined the surface of the leg--and came across something that made me stare. Fragments of a personal bank check, complete with routing number and a partially legible name, were embedded under the skin, buried deep in the muscle tissue....an X-ray had revealed a woman's severed hand, complete with wedding ring, entirely embedded inside the chest wall of a man's intact torso.This quote from the Chief Medical Examiner at the time is haunting: People were jumping or falling from the buildings. They seemed to take forever to fall, tumbling through the air. They would hit the pavement with a loud thud--very loud--and bounce, and land again. The sounds of the bodies hitting the ground echoed off the buildings, one after another, over and over. I've added some great quotes from this book...hopefully they will show below this review. "
124,1476727252,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4968643-david,2,"Published a dozen years after Dr. Melinek’s two year stint in the NYC Office of the Chief Medical Examiner the cases and experiences she describes are flat, lifeless and incomplete. With all of that time between the events and the publishing of the book the authors should have conducted some degree of research to round out the stories of the cadavers she autopsied. The frequent quoted conversations had me wondering how accurate the dialogue was. And how could stories from the NYC medical examiner’s be so uninteresting?The book started off strongly and Dr. Melinek's perspective on suicide was powerful and interesting. However the book lost its unique voice soon thereafter. The stories simply weren’t compelling and there were hints of smugness, impatience and pettiness that made her seem less nice than the image she was going for (she took some condescending cheap shots at peoples’ appearances that had nothing to do with the stories at hand - the woman with the nose job, the fat guy, just to name two instances).As to the autopsies there are plenty of the sickening descriptions you might expect. Sometimes the authors seemed to rely on technical language with little explanation to create a ‘wow’ factor. If you have pet cats or are expecting to have surgery in the near future you might want to skip this one for either of those reasons alone.One final complaint: the authors played up the wittiness of Dr. Hirsch’s epigrams as if he were some magical combination of Confucius and Henny Youngman. Unfortunately the many decade old quotes fell far short of that mark. Maybe they simply forgot his precise quotes after all of those years."
125,1476727252,http://goodreads.com/user/show/23100707-jean,4,"This is a memoir of a forensic pathologist. After medical school Dr. Melinek started a residency program to be a surgeon. She took time off from work to have a baby and decided to change her specialty and become a pathologist. She attended UCLA for her pathology and forensic training and was accepted at the NYC Medical Examiner’s Office for her one-year forensic residency training program. After she completed the program she stayed on in the medical examiner’s office for another one-year residency program in forensic neuropathology.Dr. Melinek was only two months into her residency when the September 11 terrorist attack happened. She provides a firsthand account of events at the medical examiner’s office of that fateful event. She also covers the anthrax bio-terrorism attack in NYC and the crash of American Airlines flight 587. As the residency program was two years she also got to cover the routine murders, suicides and accidents normally dealt with by the medical examiner. Dr. Melinek reveals the day to day life of a forensic pathologist. She also provides some background information, for example: how a death certificate is filled out and why; what constitutes accidental death or homicide and so on. I found the information on the type of bullets and their effect on the body interesting as well as the general information of ballistics. Overall a most fascinating memoir.Dr. Melinek wrote the book with her husband, T. J. Mitchell. They met at Harvard where he was an English major. He works as a screenwriter and script editor.Tanya Eby does a good job narrating the book. Eby is a voice over artist and an award winning audiobook narrator."

I like Melinek's voice and style of writing and her irreverent way of looking at death. I love the way she describes her reaction to shows featuring characters doing her job - the fact that they go to every crime scene, the women wear their good high-heeled shoes, they actually help with the investigation. From now on CSI will be light-hearted crime fiction, in the same league as those 'cosy mysteries' that feature little old lady super-sleuths, not a realistic look into the life of a medical examiner. I can see the irony and humour in some of the causes of death that she sees (although, not when contemplating my own future). For example, an unfortunate worker having his morning coffee gets hit in the head by a giant crane, a crane so large that he is practically crumpled into the ground like an aluminium can. Although, at the same time reading medical nonfiction does hit a bit close to home for someone only weeks away from having major surgery to remove a 9 x 7 cm suspicious mass, along with 25% of her liver. Maybe I shouldn't be reading this right now... So far I'm enjoying it despite the negative thoughts it's bringing up. To be continued...12/3 - Not as bad as I thought it was going to be re bringing up disturbing thoughts, except for one of the later chapters focussing on deaths due to 'medical misadventures' or 'therapeutic complications' as Melinek puts it - when a patient dies during non-emergent surgery due to surgeon error. Reading about the ordeal Melinek and her fellow medical examiners went through in the aftermath of September 11 was a little tough, even for someone who's never been to New York - body bags becoming body part bags becoming body bit bags (a lump of skin, a piece of an intestine) and thinking of all the families who don't KNOW what happened to their father, mother, son, daughter. That was really sad. I do wonder how she remembered the details of all these cases, from 14 years ago, so vividly, even seeming to repeat conversations word for word. I also wonder how she managed to get all the patient's families to agree to have their family member's death story revealed in the ME's memoir. There was no mention anywhere of the names having been changed to protect the surviving family members, so I have to assume that all those names are real. Whatever the case, highly recommended to those with a strong stomach and a lack of anxiety regarding all the ways they and their loved ones could die.PopSugar 2015 Reading Challenge: A Memoir"

This is the place where Death delights to help the living.’I am completely, over the top, irrationally fond of books about medicine and/or the macabre and apparently have the extremely annoying habit of sharing choice trivia I pick up in these books, to the horror of my friends (so those of you that I see offline, brace yourselves for some really gruesome tidbits)This book takes the form of memoir, forensic crime investigation, pathology and weird-shit-people-die-from stories. The author seems to be quite an optimistic ray of sunshine in an industry that leans towards the dark and depressing. She conveys the stories at times with humor, at times with sadness but always with compassion and respect.“People ask me all the time, “What’s the worst way to die you’ve ever seen?” I assure them, “You don’t want to know.” She was right. I should not have wanted to know. All I can say is I will never eat lobster again, EVER.She is frank and outspoken about suicide and whether I agree with her views or not, I could sympathize with her. Having lived through her own fathers suicide at the age of 13 it clearly left scars still visible in her adult life.I heard about this author from a GR friend’s review and also knew beforehand that she was most famous for the 8 months she provided medical support in the 9/11 aftermath. What I did not expect was how much of an emotional read Chapter 10 would be for me. I have the utmost respect for each and every person who was involved in the First Responder teams and everyone else that assisted them. Every doctor has to cultivate compassion, to learn it and then practice it. To confront death every day, to see it for yourself, you have to love the living. Would I recommend this? YES absolutely, but then again I have an extreme bias towards books like this so perhaps my judgment cannot be trusted. Oh and a word of warning, if you are overly sensitive or have a weak stomach perhaps this book is not for you."
130,1476727252,http://goodreads.com/user/show/20229277-alissa-patrick,4,"I really loved this book. This is a non-fiction account of a woman's 2 year stint as a New York Medical Examiner, a profession I always found fascinating even though it gives me the heebie jeebies. The stories are of course gross at times (doing the autopsy of a construction worker who had a beam fall on his head). Sometimes the stats are informative and funny (if you die alone with your pet, the dog will lay by your body in mourning.... your cat? Will start eating you that day)I was enjoying this read as a light-hearted read (as much as the content would allow of course)... until I got to the 9/11 chapters. It didn't even occur to me as I was reading what year she had started being an ME, and then suddenly she started a chapter with September 11, 2001, and I went ""oh. crap""The last part of the book was really hard for me. I put it down several times because I nearly cried. I still relive that day so vividly and reading her account of that awful morning- then the task she had of trying to identify only body parts or small pieces of DNA just killed me. I obviously knew the carnage of that day but it just never occurred to me that they barely pulled bodies out of the World Trade Center, it was particles of people. Of the thousands of people killed, only 291 bodies in tact were found. There are still over 1,000 people who never had remains found. These chapters were just terrible and I found myself tearing up. If you're a fan of CSI, Law and Order, etc those type of shows I highly recommend this book. "

It is, however, an important book. It made me very thankful for people that do these types of jobs. "

Together they describe Judy's time training in forensic pathology at NYC Medical Examiner's Office. So if you've ever wondered what it's like to be a real forensic pathologist, here's your chance.Perhaps most notably, Melinek was in NYC during the Sept 11th attacks and was thus part of the grueling identification process, which often depended on DNA extracted from lone teeth as a means of identification. Her description of that process is nothing short of sobering. I'd never really thought much about the condition of the bodies. Interesting read and competently written."

Better yet, stay out of the car, and get some exercise. Watch your weight. If you’re a smoker stop right now. If you aren’t, don’t start. Guns put holes in people. Drugs are bad…Staying alive is mostly common sense.”This is intriguing story, told in a personable and conversational way, with black humour, personal insights, some interesting characters and plenty of passion. You can feel this doctor’s affinity for her role and the pride she has for revealing the cause of death, particularly in homicide cases where she “speaks on behalf of the dead.” This narrative is told with honesty that sometimes catches you unaware, particularly when the author discusses suicides and neonatal and child deaths; so sad. The life of an Medical Examiner is dissected and probed and all is revealed; the ugliness of death, the stench, the maggots, the sloughing skin, the reek of alcohol, the worry of infection but all is told is a calm and meaning full manner – this is not “voyeur of the dead” material, this is life (because death also affects the living), death and some deaths are good deaths and some… you really should not ask about.Throughout this narrative the authors’ voices carry you on a journey, you walk side by side with the rookie M.E and take lessons with her, then suddenly the world changes, the tone changes and it is chilling. The terrorist attacks on September 11, 2001 on the World Trade Centre towers and other threats shake up the world and have a very personal direct impact on Dr Melinek; she sees firsthand the destruction and violation of life. This section of the book is…overwhelmingly sad and horrific, the work of the first responders and the medical staff tasked with identifying the human remains is a mammoth and heartbreakingly poignant. All involved in the rescue and recovery deserve our thanks.This is truly a remarkable book told with respect and passion. "

I've always had a fascination for stuff that some people find a bit dark - true crime stories, biographies of serial killers, etc. So this book was right up my alley. Overall, the book does a good job of weaving together stories of a job that's rather morbid and dark with insights into the author's life and the lives of those she has a duty to - the dead and their families, who need answers and resolution. Some of the stories are weird, some of them will make you shake your head, some of them are just outright sad. For me, they reinforced the fact that I'm not cut out for this sort of work, as much as I enjoy reading about it. There is a chapter on the aftermath of 9/11 and I must warn who lived in New York or who was greatly impacted by the events that it is not an easy chapter to get through. Some may wish to skip it entirely. For me it was a reminder and more insight into just how truly awful that day was, and made my heart break all over again. I admire people like Judy, really - they do the work that most of us won't and can't do, and provide a vital service to our communities because of it. Books like this provide insight and remind us how important these sorts of jobs are, even if we never think about them."
135,1476727252,http://goodreads.com/user/show/13814810-ella,2,"Although this book provides an interesting look into the experiences of the author's forensic pathology residency, there are a number of aspects on which I would like to comment more critically. Most importantly, I was very unsettled by Melinek's simplistic conception of suicide and suicidal ideations. She repeatedly and violently asserts that suicide is ""selfish"". Despite Melinek's own early personal exposure to her father's suicide, she neither addresses the context nor engages with any of the complexity surrounding mental health issues. Claiming so assertively that ""suicide is a selfish act"" without considering the factors beyond the individual, the larger social institutions, and the failure of these systems further upstream, is, to me, a rather self-serving assessment. Rhetoric is powerful and I worry about the unintended consequences of Melinek's assertions on this subject. Looking more superficially, I disliked the book's organization. The timeline is established primarily through reference to her second pregnancy and to specific cases. However, the author bounces around considerably during the 2 year period in which the majority of the narrative occurs. This was more of an annoyance then it was seriously disruptive."
136,1476727252,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2079470-cheryl,4,"Dr. Judy Melinek has written a close up, personal account of the time she spent working as a forensic pathologist in the Office of the Chief Medical Examiner of New York City. While there, she performed autopsies on casualties of accidents, homicides, and suicides. In addition to performing autopsies, Dr. Melinek, in some cases, found it necessary and revealing to investigate scenes where bodies were discovered. Another part of her responsibilities involved counseling grieving family members as well as providing court testimony in cases of homicide.Dr. Melinek gives very graphic and detailed accounts of many of her cases. Most poignant and heartwrenching was the description of the work performed by forensic pathologists on the victims of the World Trade Center catastrophe on September 11, 2001, and the days and months afterward. Everyone who worked those cases was forever changed by the experience.Told with compassion and humility, Working Stiff is an unforgettable book.

So from that point of view this book is an obvious winner.However I did find the number of autopsies discussed made for quantity over quality giving the book a somewhat flippant feel (OK the subtitle clearly state 262 bodies so I was warned). Also the book had a lot of medical jargon, some of which was well explained, some not.The most poignant chapter was on the days after September 11, 2001 when the author and her colleagues were overwhelmed by an utter devastation they had never before encountered.Overall I felt the author was writing more for herself than for an audience. Many autopsies were left dangling (like Errico Lavagnino) where we do not know the cause of death. There were too many family and co-worker conversations which made the narrative unnecessarily auto-biographical. And at the risk of being politically incorrect I became irritated by reading about the author’s pregnancies."

There's obscure diagnoses and freak accidents. There were times I would say ""UGH"" out loud while working and listening. She tells you what is the worst way to die...and it is BAD.She was also a part of the team that worked on cataloguing all of the World Trade Center remains from 9/11 and that section is the most haunting.

This is a personal account of Judy Melinek's two years working as a forensic pathologist with the Office of the Chief Medical Examiner in New York. I have found out information about decomposing bodies, burns and dismemberment that I did not know were possible. And given that Judy's time there encompassed September 11, 2001 and the scale that OCME had to deal with in deaths is beyond comprehension.As terrible as some of the accounts were, it was also a fitting tribute to the unsung heroes who give their time to answer questions for those who are still living and need resolution, justice or just consolation.If however, you find something like Agatha Christie or Midsummer Murders confronting and grisly then you may wish to steer clear."

Melinek has a way of delivering the story with both clinical observation and compassion. It's a very candid glimpse into the world of a medical examiner, and it's done very well. The chapter on 9/11 was chilling and heartbreaking, and hearing about it from the perspective from someone working with the massive amounts of casualties really made it feel like those days were happening all over again.

I have even more respect for all of the heroes that kept working and dealing with all of that, as well as those who died. Anyway, it was a good book and well worth reading."

The idea of the smells, maggots, and questionable fluids...ah man eww, but the worse would be seeing children or pregnant women (which the author said were the hardest cases to work on).

Watch your weight. If you’re a smoker stop right now. If you aren’t, don’t start. Guns put holes in people. Drugs are bad. You know that yellow line on the subway platform? It's there for a reason. Staying alive, as it turns out, is mostly common sense.”This is the advice of Judy Melinek, the author of Working Stiff: Two Years, 262 Bodies, and the Making of a Medical Examiner, gleaned from her experience as an assistant medical examiner in New York City. From 2001 to 2003 Melinek performed hundreds of autopsies on the victims of homicides, suicides, accidents, natural diseases, therapeutic complications, and undetermined causes, that crossed her table. Melinek's very first post mortem involved the death of a young man, a heroin addict diagnosed with sickle-cell trait who died in hospital, her second an elderly man who sustained severe burns in a house fire, the third a pregnant woman, the victim of a hit and run. In general, each chapter of Working Stiff groups together cases by manner of death, detailing Melinek's examination of patients young and old, male and female, destitute and wealthy, and everything in between. The final chapters focus on the medical examiners office's role in the wake of the Twin Towers collapse on September 11, and the crash of American Airlines flight 587. The narrative is very readable, almost conversational in tone, and mostly free of the medical jargon one might expect. Melinek is at all times respectful but not humourless, sharing both professional perspective and personal observations. I do feel compelled to warn the unwary reader that this isn't a book for the squeamish with its graphic record of gruesome injury and detailed descriptions of the forensic autopsy process.What shines through is Melinek's passion and commitment to her job as she works to investigate and determine the cause and manner of death, comfort the bereaved, provide assistance to the justice system and ""speak for the dead"".Informative, entertaining and engaging Working Stiff is a fascinating account of the work of a medical examiner, well told by Judy Melinek and her husband T.J. Mitchell. * I gave the book an extra 1/2 star for Judy's admission she wears ""sensible shoes and a Medical Examiner windbreaker"" during her rare visits to crime scenes - not six inch stiletto's and Armani suits.

145,1476727252,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1740304-linda,4,"Dr. Melinek was originally studying to be a surgeon. But the grueling conditions of her surgical residency were taking their toll on her life and health, and the health of patients. Honestly, the description of what is expected of surgical residents scared the shit out of me. I know, we’ve seen it in TV dramas… no sleep, inhuman hours. But the reality is that nobody could possibly function well under those conditions, and our lives depend on surgeons being at their best. It makes me wonder if some regulation should be put into place similar to that for pilots and truck drivers. Anyway, her quitting her surgical residency for the more civilized routine of a medical examiner is what brings us to this book.Her descriptions of how she does her work, in conjunction with law enforcement, to determine cause of death… and more important, manner of death, was fascinating. Manner of death includes Homicide, Suicide, Accidental, Natural, and Undetermined. Dr. Melinek provides vivid anecdotes of each of these, and it’s very interesting. She does not come across as a morbid person, and in fact enjoys the work for the comfort it can provide the living.She tells us of having worked as a Medical Examiner in NYC through the 9/11 attacks and the subsequent anthrax scare, which is as overwhelming as you would imagine.There’s only one thing I was a little triggered by, and it has nothing to do with the gruesome descriptions of death and the methodical dissection of corpses. Dr. Melinek survived her own tragedy when her beloved father took his own life while she was a girl. And whenever she discusses her findings of suicide, there remains an understandable bitterness. It allows her to be more empathetic to other survivors, which is wonderful. But her vehement assertion that all people who commit suicide are selfish hit me wrong. I am also the survivor of a loved one who took her own life, though not a parent. My own conclusion is that none of us can know the pain and suffering that another person endures. And they deserve compassion more than derision. I’m not condemning her perspective as less valid than mine, it just made it a little hard for me to read at points.3.67 stars"

This would normally go on my hypothetical list of jobs I never knew I didn't want, except I did know I wouldn't want this job. I just love reading about it. 'Jobs I Only Want to Read About'?Erm. Anyway. Melinek turned from surgery to forensic pathology after realising that both career paths would let her cut up bodies but pathology would also let her get more than three hours of sleep (and the patients wouldn't argue). Here she details cases she saw during her two years in New York City, where she learned the ropes. Suicides and overdoses—so many overdoses—and accidents and medical errors. More overdoses. Murders. Early in her career but late in the book, victims of 9/11.Melinek displays a fair amount of glee in discussing some of the more interesting cases—I rather think she and Mary Roach would get along—while managing to remain respectful of the individuals (deceased and family) involved. She's descriptive enough that I actually took a break mid-book to read something lighter, which I don't usually feel the need to do...I recommend reading this, but not while eating!Towards the end of the book, Melinek talks about the attacks on the World Trade Center in 2001, when she'd been working as a medical examiner for only a few months. To me it was the strongest section of the book—it has the most consistent storyline of the book, and although that (and the American Airlines crash of November 2001) is the most hectic, case-after-case-body-after-body time she describes, in some ways it's the least hectic section of the book—more time taken to slow down and connect her personal experience with her professional experience. Up to that point I was enjoying the stories but finding the transitions somewhat lacking (or perhaps too good, as she segued neatly from body to body to body), but the pieces really fell into place for me later on in the book.I'll never be a doctor, much less a medical examiner, and I'm so many kinds of okay with that. But a reader of books like this? Yes please."

The only issue I had was that there were so many stories - bodies - and that the story itself was too fragmented. Other than this, absolutely a fascinating read. "
149,1476727252,http://goodreads.com/user/show/678841-kim,4,"Working Stiff discusses Judy Melinek's two years working for the New York City OCME (Office of the Chief Medical Examiner), which began in 2001 and ended in 2002. Although the WTC attack happened only six weeks after she began work and the plane crash in Queens four weeks after that, the book is not about these two disasters but her experience and teachings from the autopsies of ""regular"" New Yorkers, and all the different ways that they die.I found the subject matter fascinating. This sort of pathology is something I had considered and briefly, in medical school, I spent time in the ME's office. I was immediately repelled by the odor of decomposition. ""You get used to it,"" was what the medical examiners and detectives told me, but I was pretty sure that wasn't true. Years later, I know that there are certain things we learn to put up with in our line of work and others that just strain our personal limits. So - kudos to Judy Melinek and others like her who are able to handle the stench of decomposition when it is present and do this job. On the plus side: Melinek does an incredible job documenting how ordinary and not-so-ordinary people die, what happens to our bodies after we die, and how medical examiners piece together our last hours and moments of life. The scientific and technical details are amazing. She discusses numerous cases - murders and natural causes, ""therapeutic complications"" (as a physician, I really like that), innumerable accidental deaths, suicides. As she states in the beginning of the book, ""Staying alive, as it turns out, is mostly common sense."" So true.Like everyone else old enough to pay attention, I remember where I was on September 11, 2001; and exactly what I was doing when I found out what was going on; and exactly what I was doing when those towers fell. Years later it is still something that brings me to tears: the horror, the fear, the magnitude of loss. The people who gave of themselves to save others and lost their own lives as a consequence. Melinek provides an entirely fresh, gruesome, devastating look at an old story which is both horrifying (""an X-ray had revealed a woman's severed hand, complete with wedding ring, entirely embedded within the chest wall of a man's intact torso"") and educational (""the individual pieces of recovered remains numbered 19,956""). I admit I cried for these people and their families, and for the people who worked to identify them after the fact. I don't know how you wrap your head around that and emerge intact, although I suppose it's pretty much like anything else: one foot in front of the other until it's far enough behind you.On the downside: Another reviewer has mentioned the lack of an index, which I thoroughly agree with. I own an e-book, so it's moderately easier to find things, but this is still a lack. I agree that the book lacks an ""arc,"" which makes it difficult to read at times. I really enjoyed it, but I read the individual vignettes - because that is mostly what they are - over many months. I am not sure if the book would have been better if Melinek had begun at the beginning of the two years and used her personal growth as a story arc or if this was the best option if she did not want the entire book dominated by 9/11. While I understand her wish to make the book about forensics and not about 9/11, I think the lack of an arc is a detriment.However, overall this is an interesting - if not super quick - read. I really enjoyed it and for anyone looking to learn a little more about this subject it is a worthwhile read."

I don't read much non-fiction but I have a fascination with death and what happens to your body after you die. That's why I picked this up. Maybe it's because we don't really talk about it as a society. It's too taboo or gross or a combination of both I don't know.This book covers the first year of Dr. Melinek's fellowship in NYC as a medical examiner. She doesn't go through all 262 cases but picks highlights to show was is involved in the different types of death. She does a really good job of breaking down all the medical jargon into laymen's terms without sounding condescending. Part of an MEs training is to learn how to do that since they deal with grieving family members. Each case is its own little story and I was surprised at how much detective work an ME actually does. If there is no criminal homicide for the police to investigate (and only about 30% of autopsy cases are criminal in nature) it is up to the ME to piece together what happened and not just physically. They have to understand the circumstances surrounding the death and that involves some legwork.The final section of the book is about 9/11. Melinek was only 9 weeks into her fellowship when this happened. I've heard a lot of stories about the brave work of the firefighters and police on that day but I haven't heard anything about the MEs. The only medical stories I've heard were about all the doctors and nurses waiting at the hospitals for the wounded to come in and how devastated they were when only a fraction of the number expected showed up. Now imagine what all the MEs had to go through. It was heartbreaking and interesting at the same time. They were able to identify approximately half of those that died that day. Considering what they had to work with it's pretty amazing.If you have any interest in this area I highly recommend picking up this book."

I am a big fan of crime novels, and with a boyfriend in the police, crime and murder is definitely something that interests me. This book goes into detail about how many different ways people die on an everyday occurrence, while going into detail her checklist of things that she does when doing a post mortem. This book answered every curiosity I had about post mortems and what exactly it is they do with a body. It also showed me how unexpected and random life can be; some of the accidents and medical mistakes that caused deaths throughout this really did make me think. Another thing I really appreciated is how she has shown that women can have the big career and still have a home life; something I think more women need to hear, too often we're told there's a choice and I think Melinek proved that you can indeed have both.

So don't jaywalk...You know that yellow line on the subway platform? It's there for a reason. Staying alive, as it turns out, is mostly common sense. Judy MelinekAfter reading this book I really wish I had become a medical examiner...weird I know ;-) It was fascinating. The one thing that would probably make me quit that job though would be the smell of a decomposing body...It hits you--an assault, not a scent. You flinch, heave back in revulsion. It invades your throat, assails your taste buds, even stings your eyes.The maggot talk just validated my wish to be immediately sealed in a metal drawer in a mausoleum after I die. I also knew there had to be a reason I'm allergic to cats...they will eat you immediately after you die. Whereas dogs will just stay by you for days on end. The last quarter of this book was completely spellbinding, in my opinion. She was a NYC Medical Examiner on 9/11. She heard and saw that low flying jetliner when she was hurrying to work that morning. It is even more horrific through her eyes than what I heard and saw on the news. She tagged body pieces (and the descriptions of their condition were awful)...many refrigerated tractor trailers' worth of body parts, a small number of intact bodies.The limbs had all been amputated. The torso was transected below the navel. The remains were entirely black--burned and covered in soot. The head...the head wasn't recognizable as a head, except that it had hair and was attached to the neck. The smell of jet fuel was so strong it made me dizzy. I could tell just by looking at the open body bag that this person had been mashed, burned, dropped from a height, and slashed by sharp forces. I had seen people killed by subway trains and speeding cars, run over by trucks, crushed by industrial equipment, fallen from great heights, burned, and battered--but never all at the same time.I examined the surface of the leg--and came across something that made me stare. Fragments of a personal bank check, complete with routing number and a partially legible name, were embedded under the skin, buried deep in the muscle tissue....an X-ray had revealed a woman's severed hand, complete with wedding ring, entirely embedded inside the chest wall of a man's intact torso.This quote from the Chief Medical Examiner at the time is haunting: People were jumping or falling from the buildings. They seemed to take forever to fall, tumbling through the air. They would hit the pavement with a loud thud--very loud--and bounce, and land again. The sounds of the bodies hitting the ground echoed off the buildings, one after another, over and over. I've added some great quotes from this book...hopefully they will show below this review. "
154,1476727252,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4968643-david,2,"Published a dozen years after Dr. Melinek’s two year stint in the NYC Office of the Chief Medical Examiner the cases and experiences she describes are flat, lifeless and incomplete. With all of that time between the events and the publishing of the book the authors should have conducted some degree of research to round out the stories of the cadavers she autopsied. The frequent quoted conversations had me wondering how accurate the dialogue was. And how could stories from the NYC medical examiner’s be so uninteresting?The book started off strongly and Dr. Melinek's perspective on suicide was powerful and interesting. However the book lost its unique voice soon thereafter. The stories simply weren’t compelling and there were hints of smugness, impatience and pettiness that made her seem less nice than the image she was going for (she took some condescending cheap shots at peoples’ appearances that had nothing to do with the stories at hand - the woman with the nose job, the fat guy, just to name two instances).As to the autopsies there are plenty of the sickening descriptions you might expect. Sometimes the authors seemed to rely on technical language with little explanation to create a ‘wow’ factor. If you have pet cats or are expecting to have surgery in the near future you might want to skip this one for either of those reasons alone.One final complaint: the authors played up the wittiness of Dr. Hirsch’s epigrams as if he were some magical combination of Confucius and Henny Youngman. Unfortunately the many decade old quotes fell far short of that mark. Maybe they simply forgot his precise quotes after all of those years."
155,1476727252,http://goodreads.com/user/show/23100707-jean,4,"This is a memoir of a forensic pathologist. After medical school Dr. Melinek started a residency program to be a surgeon. She took time off from work to have a baby and decided to change her specialty and become a pathologist. She attended UCLA for her pathology and forensic training and was accepted at the NYC Medical Examiner’s Office for her one-year forensic residency training program. After she completed the program she stayed on in the medical examiner’s office for another one-year residency program in forensic neuropathology.Dr. Melinek was only two months into her residency when the September 11 terrorist attack happened. She provides a firsthand account of events at the medical examiner’s office of that fateful event. She also covers the anthrax bio-terrorism attack in NYC and the crash of American Airlines flight 587. As the residency program was two years she also got to cover the routine murders, suicides and accidents normally dealt with by the medical examiner. Dr. Melinek reveals the day to day life of a forensic pathologist. She also provides some background information, for example: how a death certificate is filled out and why; what constitutes accidental death or homicide and so on. I found the information on the type of bullets and their effect on the body interesting as well as the general information of ballistics. Overall a most fascinating memoir.Dr. Melinek wrote the book with her husband, T. J. Mitchell. They met at Harvard where he was an English major. He works as a screenwriter and script editor.Tanya Eby does a good job narrating the book. Eby is a voice over artist and an award winning audiobook narrator."

I like Melinek's voice and style of writing and her irreverent way of looking at death. I love the way she describes her reaction to shows featuring characters doing her job - the fact that they go to every crime scene, the women wear their good high-heeled shoes, they actually help with the investigation. From now on CSI will be light-hearted crime fiction, in the same league as those 'cosy mysteries' that feature little old lady super-sleuths, not a realistic look into the life of a medical examiner. I can see the irony and humour in some of the causes of death that she sees (although, not when contemplating my own future). For example, an unfortunate worker having his morning coffee gets hit in the head by a giant crane, a crane so large that he is practically crumpled into the ground like an aluminium can. Although, at the same time reading medical nonfiction does hit a bit close to home for someone only weeks away from having major surgery to remove a 9 x 7 cm suspicious mass, along with 25% of her liver. Maybe I shouldn't be reading this right now... So far I'm enjoying it despite the negative thoughts it's bringing up. To be continued...12/3 - Not as bad as I thought it was going to be re bringing up disturbing thoughts, except for one of the later chapters focussing on deaths due to 'medical misadventures' or 'therapeutic complications' as Melinek puts it - when a patient dies during non-emergent surgery due to surgeon error. Reading about the ordeal Melinek and her fellow medical examiners went through in the aftermath of September 11 was a little tough, even for someone who's never been to New York - body bags becoming body part bags becoming body bit bags (a lump of skin, a piece of an intestine) and thinking of all the families who don't KNOW what happened to their father, mother, son, daughter. That was really sad. I do wonder how she remembered the details of all these cases, from 14 years ago, so vividly, even seeming to repeat conversations word for word. I also wonder how she managed to get all the patient's families to agree to have their family member's death story revealed in the ME's memoir. There was no mention anywhere of the names having been changed to protect the surviving family members, so I have to assume that all those names are real. Whatever the case, highly recommended to those with a strong stomach and a lack of anxiety regarding all the ways they and their loved ones could die.PopSugar 2015 Reading Challenge: A Memoir"

This is the place where Death delights to help the living.’I am completely, over the top, irrationally fond of books about medicine and/or the macabre and apparently have the extremely annoying habit of sharing choice trivia I pick up in these books, to the horror of my friends (so those of you that I see offline, brace yourselves for some really gruesome tidbits)This book takes the form of memoir, forensic crime investigation, pathology and weird-shit-people-die-from stories. The author seems to be quite an optimistic ray of sunshine in an industry that leans towards the dark and depressing. She conveys the stories at times with humor, at times with sadness but always with compassion and respect.“People ask me all the time, “What’s the worst way to die you’ve ever seen?” I assure them, “You don’t want to know.” She was right. I should not have wanted to know. All I can say is I will never eat lobster again, EVER.She is frank and outspoken about suicide and whether I agree with her views or not, I could sympathize with her. Having lived through her own fathers suicide at the age of 13 it clearly left scars still visible in her adult life.I heard about this author from a GR friend’s review and also knew beforehand that she was most famous for the 8 months she provided medical support in the 9/11 aftermath. What I did not expect was how much of an emotional read Chapter 10 would be for me. I have the utmost respect for each and every person who was involved in the First Responder teams and everyone else that assisted them. Every doctor has to cultivate compassion, to learn it and then practice it. To confront death every day, to see it for yourself, you have to love the living. Would I recommend this? YES absolutely, but then again I have an extreme bias towards books like this so perhaps my judgment cannot be trusted. Oh and a word of warning, if you are overly sensitive or have a weak stomach perhaps this book is not for you."

Sometimes the stats are informative and funny (if you die alone with your pet, the dog will lay by your body in mourning.... your cat?

It didn't even occur to me as I was reading what year she had started being an ME, and then suddenly she started a chapter with September 11, 2001, and I went ""oh. crap""The last part of the book was really hard for me. I put it down several times because I nearly cried. I still relive that day so vividly and reading her account of that awful morning- then the task she had of trying to identify only body parts or small pieces of DNA just killed me. I obviously knew the carnage of that day but it just never occurred to me that they barely pulled bodies out of the World Trade Center, it was particles of people. Of the thousands of people killed, only 291 bodies in tact were found. There are still over 1,000 people who never had remains found. These chapters were just terrible and I found myself tearing up.

Drugs are bad…Staying alive is mostly common sense.”This is intriguing story, told in a personable and conversational way, with black humour, personal insights, some interesting characters and plenty of passion. You can feel this doctor’s affinity for her role and the pride she has for revealing the cause of death, particularly in homicide cases where she “speaks on behalf of the dead.” This narrative is told with honesty that sometimes catches you unaware, particularly when the author discusses suicides and neonatal and child deaths; so sad. The life of an Medical Examiner is dissected and probed and all is revealed; the ugliness of death, the stench, the maggots, the sloughing skin, the reek of alcohol, the worry of infection but all is told is a calm and meaning full manner – this is not “voyeur of the dead” material, this is life (because death also affects the living), death and some deaths are good deaths and some… you really should not ask about.Throughout this narrative the authors’ voices carry you on a journey, you walk side by side with the rookie M.E and take lessons with her, then suddenly the world changes, the tone changes and it is chilling. The terrorist attacks on September 11, 2001 on the World Trade Centre towers and other threats shake up the world and have a very personal direct impact on Dr Melinek; she sees firsthand the destruction and violation of life. This section of the book is…overwhelmingly sad and horrific, the work of the first responders and the medical staff tasked with identifying the human remains is a mammoth and heartbreakingly poignant.

I've always had a fascination for stuff that some people find a bit dark - true crime stories, biographies of serial killers, etc. So this book was right up my alley. Overall, the book does a good job of weaving together stories of a job that's rather morbid and dark with insights into the author's life and the lives of those she has a duty to - the dead and their families, who need answers and resolution. Some of the stories are weird, some of them will make you shake your head, some of them are just outright sad. For me, they reinforced the fact that I'm not cut out for this sort of work, as much as I enjoy reading about it. There is a chapter on the aftermath of 9/11 and I must warn who lived in New York or who was greatly impacted by the events that it is not an easy chapter to get through. Some may wish to skip it entirely. For me it was a reminder and more insight into just how truly awful that day was, and made my heart break all over again. I admire people like Judy, really - they do the work that most of us won't and can't do, and provide a vital service to our communities because of it. Books like this provide insight and remind us how important these sorts of jobs are, even if we never think about them."
165,1476727252,http://goodreads.com/user/show/13814810-ella,2,"Although this book provides an interesting look into the experiences of the author's forensic pathology residency, there are a number of aspects on which I would like to comment more critically. Most importantly, I was very unsettled by Melinek's simplistic conception of suicide and suicidal ideations. She repeatedly and violently asserts that suicide is ""selfish"". Despite Melinek's own early personal exposure to her father's suicide, she neither addresses the context nor engages with any of the complexity surrounding mental health issues. Claiming so assertively that ""suicide is a selfish act"" without considering the factors beyond the individual, the larger social institutions, and the failure of these systems further upstream, is, to me, a rather self-serving assessment. Rhetoric is powerful and I worry about the unintended consequences of Melinek's assertions on this subject. Looking more superficially, I disliked the book's organization. The timeline is established primarily through reference to her second pregnancy and to specific cases. However, the author bounces around considerably during the 2 year period in which the majority of the narrative occurs. This was more of an annoyance then it was seriously disruptive."
166,1476727252,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2079470-cheryl,4,"Dr. Judy Melinek has written a close up, personal account of the time she spent working as a forensic pathologist in the Office of the Chief Medical Examiner of New York City. While there, she performed autopsies on casualties of accidents, homicides, and suicides. In addition to performing autopsies, Dr. Melinek, in some cases, found it necessary and revealing to investigate scenes where bodies were discovered. Another part of her responsibilities involved counseling grieving family members as well as providing court testimony in cases of homicide.Dr. Melinek gives very graphic and detailed accounts of many of her cases. Most poignant and heartwrenching was the description of the work performed by forensic pathologists on the victims of the World Trade Center catastrophe on September 11, 2001, and the days and months afterward. Everyone who worked those cases was forever changed by the experience.Told with compassion and humility, Working Stiff is an unforgettable book. However, it may not appeal to everyone because of the very graphic and gruesome detail included in the casework. "
167,1476727252,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1484029-mikey-b,4,"Obviously the topic of forensics is always of interest; albeit a somewhat macabre one. So from that point of view this book is an obvious winner.However I did find the number of autopsies discussed made for quantity over quality giving the book a somewhat flippant feel (OK the subtitle clearly state 262 bodies so I was warned). Also the book had a lot of medical jargon, some of which was well explained, some not.The most poignant chapter was on the days after September 11, 2001 when the author and her colleagues were overwhelmed by an utter devastation they had never before encountered.Overall I felt the author was writing more for herself than for an audience. Many autopsies were left dangling (like Errico Lavagnino) where we do not know the cause of death. There were too many family and co-worker conversations which made the narrative unnecessarily auto-biographical. And at the risk of being politically incorrect I became irritated by reading about the author’s pregnancies."

It was sciency and then I ended up listening to a huge chunk today to finish and it was AMAZING.It has all the disgusting, gory details that you would hope for. There's obscure diagnoses and freak accidents. There were times I would say ""UGH"" out loud while working and listening. She tells you what is the worst way to die...and it is BAD.She was also a part of the team that worked on cataloguing all of the World Trade Center remains from 9/11 and that section is the most haunting. This is what makes it special and a must read for anyone who is interested in dead body memoirs/non-fiction.If you enjoyed Smoke Gets in Your Eyes and Stiff, you will most definitely like this memoir.

This is a personal account of Judy Melinek's two years working as a forensic pathologist with the Office of the Chief Medical Examiner in New York. I have found out information about decomposing bodies, burns and dismemberment that I did not know were possible. And given that Judy's time there encompassed September 11, 2001 and the scale that OCME had to deal with in deaths is beyond comprehension.As terrible as some of the accounts were, it was also a fitting tribute to the unsung heroes who give their time to answer questions for those who are still living and need resolution, justice or just consolation.If however, you find something like Agatha Christie or Midsummer Murders confronting and grisly then you may wish to steer clear."

Melinek has a way of delivering the story with both clinical observation and compassion. It's a very candid glimpse into the world of a medical examiner, and it's done very well. The chapter on 9/11 was chilling and heartbreaking, and hearing about it from the perspective from someone working with the massive amounts of casualties really made it feel like those days were happening all over again. Not for the faint of heart, but very well worth the time. And a must read for any writer considering a character in this field. "

The author describes things with compassion, and gives a good overview of various aspects of the job. Especially sobering was the work done after 9/11. Wow - I thought I had some ideas of what happened, but I never comprehended how truly horrible the aftermath was. I have even more respect for all of the heroes that kept working and dealing with all of that, as well as those who died. Anyway, it was a good book and well worth reading."

The idea of the smells, maggots, and questionable fluids...ah man eww, but the worse would be seeing children or pregnant women (which the author said were the hardest cases to work on).

Watch your weight. If you’re a smoker stop right now. If you aren’t, don’t start. Guns put holes in people. Drugs are bad. You know that yellow line on the subway platform? It's there for a reason. Staying alive, as it turns out, is mostly common sense.”This is the advice of Judy Melinek, the author of Working Stiff: Two Years, 262 Bodies, and the Making of a Medical Examiner, gleaned from her experience as an assistant medical examiner in New York City. From 2001 to 2003 Melinek performed hundreds of autopsies on the victims of homicides, suicides, accidents, natural diseases, therapeutic complications, and undetermined causes, that crossed her table. Melinek's very first post mortem involved the death of a young man, a heroin addict diagnosed with sickle-cell trait who died in hospital, her second an elderly man who sustained severe burns in a house fire, the third a pregnant woman, the victim of a hit and run. In general, each chapter of Working Stiff groups together cases by manner of death, detailing Melinek's examination of patients young and old, male and female, destitute and wealthy, and everything in between. The final chapters focus on the medical examiners office's role in the wake of the Twin Towers collapse on September 11, and the crash of American Airlines flight 587. The narrative is very readable, almost conversational in tone, and mostly free of the medical jargon one might expect. Melinek is at all times respectful but not humourless, sharing both professional perspective and personal observations. I do feel compelled to warn the unwary reader that this isn't a book for the squeamish with its graphic record of gruesome injury and detailed descriptions of the forensic autopsy process.What shines through is Melinek's passion and commitment to her job as she works to investigate and determine the cause and manner of death, comfort the bereaved, provide assistance to the justice system and ""speak for the dead"".Informative, entertaining and engaging Working Stiff is a fascinating account of the work of a medical examiner, well told by Judy Melinek and her husband T.J. Mitchell. * I gave the book an extra 1/2 star for Judy's admission she wears ""sensible shoes and a Medical Examiner windbreaker"" during her rare visits to crime scenes - not six inch stiletto's and Armani suits. "
175,1476727252,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1740304-linda,4,"Dr. Melinek was originally studying to be a surgeon. But the grueling conditions of her surgical residency were taking their toll on her life and health, and the health of patients. Honestly, the description of what is expected of surgical residents scared the shit out of me. I know, we’ve seen it in TV dramas… no sleep, inhuman hours. But the reality is that nobody could possibly function well under those conditions, and our lives depend on surgeons being at their best. It makes me wonder if some regulation should be put into place similar to that for pilots and truck drivers. Anyway, her quitting her surgical residency for the more civilized routine of a medical examiner is what brings us to this book.Her descriptions of how she does her work, in conjunction with law enforcement, to determine cause of death… and more important, manner of death, was fascinating. Manner of death includes Homicide, Suicide, Accidental, Natural, and Undetermined. Dr. Melinek provides vivid anecdotes of each of these, and it’s very interesting. She does not come across as a morbid person, and in fact enjoys the work for the comfort it can provide the living.She tells us of having worked as a Medical Examiner in NYC through the 9/11 attacks and the subsequent anthrax scare, which is as overwhelming as you would imagine.There’s only one thing I was a little triggered by, and it has nothing to do with the gruesome descriptions of death and the methodical dissection of corpses. Dr. Melinek survived her own tragedy when her beloved father took his own life while she was a girl. And whenever she discusses her findings of suicide, there remains an understandable bitterness. It allows her to be more empathetic to other survivors, which is wonderful. But her vehement assertion that all people who commit suicide are selfish hit me wrong. I am also the survivor of a loved one who took her own life, though not a parent. My own conclusion is that none of us can know the pain and suffering that another person endures. And they deserve compassion more than derision. I’m not condemning her perspective as less valid than mine, it just made it a little hard for me to read at points.3.67 stars"
176,1476727252,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4089241-liralen,4,"I'm stumped. This would normally go on my hypothetical list of jobs I never knew I didn't want, except I did know I wouldn't want this job. I just love reading about it. 'Jobs I Only Want to Read About'?Erm. Anyway. Melinek turned from surgery to forensic pathology after realising that both career paths would let her cut up bodies but pathology would also let her get more than three hours of sleep (and the patients wouldn't argue). Here she details cases she saw during her two years in New York City, where she learned the ropes. Suicides and overdoses—so many overdoses—and accidents and medical errors. More overdoses. Murders. Early in her career but late in the book, victims of 9/11.Melinek displays a fair amount of glee in discussing some of the more interesting cases—I rather think she and Mary Roach would get along—while managing to remain respectful of the individuals (deceased and family) involved. She's descriptive enough that I actually took a break mid-book to read something lighter, which I don't usually feel the need to do...I recommend reading this, but not while eating!Towards the end of the book, Melinek talks about the attacks on the World Trade Center in 2001, when she'd been working as a medical examiner for only a few months. To me it was the strongest section of the book—it has the most consistent storyline of the book, and although that (and the American Airlines crash of November 2001) is the most hectic, case-after-case-body-after-body time she describes, in some ways it's the least hectic section of the book—more time taken to slow down and connect her personal experience with her professional experience. Up to that point I was enjoying the stories but finding the transitions somewhat lacking (or perhaps too good, as she segued neatly from body to body to body), but the pieces really fell into place for me later on in the book.I'll never be a doctor, much less a medical examiner, and I'm so many kinds of okay with that. But a reader of books like this? Yes please."

Like the accidents whose victims the author attended to, morbid curiousity prevented me from looking away. I wouldn't recommend it to the squeamish and, as others have noted, she is particularly opinionated about suicide and tends to come across as highly unsympathetic.2 stars out of 5.

179,1476727252,http://goodreads.com/user/show/678841-kim,4,"Working Stiff discusses Judy Melinek's two years working for the New York City OCME (Office of the Chief Medical Examiner), which began in 2001 and ended in 2002. Although the WTC attack happened only six weeks after she began work and the plane crash in Queens four weeks after that, the book is not about these two disasters but her experience and teachings from the autopsies of ""regular"" New Yorkers, and all the different ways that they die.I found the subject matter fascinating. This sort of pathology is something I had considered and briefly, in medical school, I spent time in the ME's office. I was immediately repelled by the odor of decomposition. ""You get used to it,"" was what the medical examiners and detectives told me, but I was pretty sure that wasn't true. Years later, I know that there are certain things we learn to put up with in our line of work and others that just strain our personal limits. So - kudos to Judy Melinek and others like her who are able to handle the stench of decomposition when it is present and do this job. On the plus side: Melinek does an incredible job documenting how ordinary and not-so-ordinary people die, what happens to our bodies after we die, and how medical examiners piece together our last hours and moments of life. The scientific and technical details are amazing. She discusses numerous cases - murders and natural causes, ""therapeutic complications"" (as a physician, I really like that), innumerable accidental deaths, suicides. As she states in the beginning of the book, ""Staying alive, as it turns out, is mostly common sense."" So true.Like everyone else old enough to pay attention, I remember where I was on September 11, 2001; and exactly what I was doing when I found out what was going on; and exactly what I was doing when those towers fell. Years later it is still something that brings me to tears: the horror, the fear, the magnitude of loss. The people who gave of themselves to save others and lost their own lives as a consequence. Melinek provides an entirely fresh, gruesome, devastating look at an old story which is both horrifying (""an X-ray had revealed a woman's severed hand, complete with wedding ring, entirely embedded within the chest wall of a man's intact torso"") and educational (""the individual pieces of recovered remains numbered 19,956""). I admit I cried for these people and their families, and for the people who worked to identify them after the fact. I don't know how you wrap your head around that and emerge intact, although I suppose it's pretty much like anything else: one foot in front of the other until it's far enough behind you.On the downside: Another reviewer has mentioned the lack of an index, which I thoroughly agree with. I own an e-book, so it's moderately easier to find things, but this is still a lack. I agree that the book lacks an ""arc,"" which makes it difficult to read at times. I really enjoyed it, but I read the individual vignettes - because that is mostly what they are - over many months. I am not sure if the book would have been better if Melinek had begun at the beginning of the two years and used her personal growth as a story arc or if this was the best option if she did not want the entire book dominated by 9/11. While I understand her wish to make the book about forensics and not about 9/11, I think the lack of an arc is a detriment.However, overall this is an interesting - if not super quick - read. I really enjoyed it and for anyone looking to learn a little more about this subject it is a worthwhile read."

I don't read much non-fiction but I have a fascination with death and what happens to your body after you die. That's why I picked this up. Maybe it's because we don't really talk about it as a society. It's too taboo or gross or a combination of both I don't know.This book covers the first year of Dr. Melinek's fellowship in NYC as a medical examiner. She doesn't go through all 262 cases but picks highlights to show was is involved in the different types of death. She does a really good job of breaking down all the medical jargon into laymen's terms without sounding condescending. Part of an MEs training is to learn how to do that since they deal with grieving family members. Each case is its own little story and I was surprised at how much detective work an ME actually does. If there is no criminal homicide for the police to investigate (and only about 30% of autopsy cases are criminal in nature) it is up to the ME to piece together what happened and not just physically. They have to understand the circumstances surrounding the death and that involves some legwork.The final section of the book is about 9/11. Melinek was only 9 weeks into her fellowship when this happened. I've heard a lot of stories about the brave work of the firefighters and police on that day but I haven't heard anything about the MEs. The only medical stories I've heard were about all the doctors and nurses waiting at the hospitals for the wounded to come in and how devastated they were when only a fraction of the number expected showed up. Now imagine what all the MEs had to go through. It was heartbreaking and interesting at the same time. They were able to identify approximately half of those that died that day. Considering what they had to work with it's pretty amazing.If you have any interest in this area I highly recommend picking up this book."

I am a big fan of crime novels, and with a boyfriend in the police, crime and murder is definitely something that interests me. This book goes into detail about how many different ways people die on an everyday occurrence, while going into detail her checklist of things that she does when doing a post mortem. This book answered every curiosity I had about post mortems and what exactly it is they do with a body. It also showed me how unexpected and random life can be; some of the accidents and medical mistakes that caused deaths throughout this really did make me think. Another thing I really appreciated is how she has shown that women can have the big career and still have a home life; something I think more women need to hear, too often we're told there's a choice and I think Melinek proved that you can indeed have both.

So don't jaywalk...You know that yellow line on the subway platform? It's there for a reason. Staying alive, as it turns out, is mostly common sense. Judy MelinekAfter reading this book I really wish I had become a medical examiner...weird I know ;-) It was fascinating. The one thing that would probably make me quit that job though would be the smell of a decomposing body...It hits you--an assault, not a scent. You flinch, heave back in revulsion. It invades your throat, assails your taste buds, even stings your eyes.The maggot talk just validated my wish to be immediately sealed in a metal drawer in a mausoleum after I die. I also knew there had to be a reason I'm allergic to cats...they will eat you immediately after you die. Whereas dogs will just stay by you for days on end. The last quarter of this book was completely spellbinding, in my opinion. She was a NYC Medical Examiner on 9/11. She heard and saw that low flying jetliner when she was hurrying to work that morning. It is even more horrific through her eyes than what I heard and saw on the news. She tagged body pieces (and the descriptions of their condition were awful)...many refrigerated tractor trailers' worth of body parts, a small number of intact bodies.The limbs had all been amputated. The torso was transected below the navel. The remains were entirely black--burned and covered in soot. The head...the head wasn't recognizable as a head, except that it had hair and was attached to the neck. The smell of jet fuel was so strong it made me dizzy. I could tell just by looking at the open body bag that this person had been mashed, burned, dropped from a height, and slashed by sharp forces. I had seen people killed by subway trains and speeding cars, run over by trucks, crushed by industrial equipment, fallen from great heights, burned, and battered--but never all at the same time.I examined the surface of the leg--and came across something that made me stare. Fragments of a personal bank check, complete with routing number and a partially legible name, were embedded under the skin, buried deep in the muscle tissue....an X-ray had revealed a woman's severed hand, complete with wedding ring, entirely embedded inside the chest wall of a man's intact torso.This quote from the Chief Medical Examiner at the time is haunting: People were jumping or falling from the buildings. They seemed to take forever to fall, tumbling through the air. They would hit the pavement with a loud thud--very loud--and bounce, and land again. The sounds of the bodies hitting the ground echoed off the buildings, one after another, over and over. I've added some great quotes from this book...hopefully they will show below this review. "
184,1476727252,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4968643-david,2,"Published a dozen years after Dr. Melinek’s two year stint in the NYC Office of the Chief Medical Examiner the cases and experiences she describes are flat, lifeless and incomplete. With all of that time between the events and the publishing of the book the authors should have conducted some degree of research to round out the stories of the cadavers she autopsied. The frequent quoted conversations had me wondering how accurate the dialogue was. And how could stories from the NYC medical examiner’s be so uninteresting?The book started off strongly and Dr. Melinek's perspective on suicide was powerful and interesting. However the book lost its unique voice soon thereafter. The stories simply weren’t compelling and there were hints of smugness, impatience and pettiness that made her seem less nice than the image she was going for (she took some condescending cheap shots at peoples’ appearances that had nothing to do with the stories at hand - the woman with the nose job, the fat guy, just to name two instances).As to the autopsies there are plenty of the sickening descriptions you might expect. Sometimes the authors seemed to rely on technical language with little explanation to create a ‘wow’ factor. If you have pet cats or are expecting to have surgery in the near future you might want to skip this one for either of those reasons alone.One final complaint: the authors played up the wittiness of Dr. Hirsch’s epigrams as if he were some magical combination of Confucius and Henny Youngman. Unfortunately the many decade old quotes fell far short of that mark. Maybe they simply forgot his precise quotes after all of those years."
185,1476727252,http://goodreads.com/user/show/23100707-jean,4,"This is a memoir of a forensic pathologist. After medical school Dr. Melinek started a residency program to be a surgeon. She took time off from work to have a baby and decided to change her specialty and become a pathologist. She attended UCLA for her pathology and forensic training and was accepted at the NYC Medical Examiner’s Office for her one-year forensic residency training program. After she completed the program she stayed on in the medical examiner’s office for another one-year residency program in forensic neuropathology.Dr. Melinek was only two months into her residency when the September 11 terrorist attack happened. She provides a firsthand account of events at the medical examiner’s office of that fateful event. She also covers the anthrax bio-terrorism attack in NYC and the crash of American Airlines flight 587. As the residency program was two years she also got to cover the routine murders, suicides and accidents normally dealt with by the medical examiner. Dr. Melinek reveals the day to day life of a forensic pathologist. She also provides some background information, for example: how a death certificate is filled out and why; what constitutes accidental death or homicide and so on. I found the information on the type of bullets and their effect on the body interesting as well as the general information of ballistics. Overall a most fascinating memoir.Dr. Melinek wrote the book with her husband, T. J. Mitchell. They met at Harvard where he was an English major. He works as a screenwriter and script editor.Tanya Eby does a good job narrating the book. Eby is a voice over artist and an award winning audiobook narrator."

I like Melinek's voice and style of writing and her irreverent way of looking at death. I love the way she describes her reaction to shows featuring characters doing her job - the fact that they go to every crime scene, the women wear their good high-heeled shoes, they actually help with the investigation. From now on CSI will be light-hearted crime fiction, in the same league as those 'cosy mysteries' that feature little old lady super-sleuths, not a realistic look into the life of a medical examiner. I can see the irony and humour in some of the causes of death that she sees (although, not when contemplating my own future). For example, an unfortunate worker having his morning coffee gets hit in the head by a giant crane, a crane so large that he is practically crumpled into the ground like an aluminium can. Although, at the same time reading medical nonfiction does hit a bit close to home for someone only weeks away from having major surgery to remove a 9 x 7 cm suspicious mass, along with 25% of her liver. Maybe I shouldn't be reading this right now... So far I'm enjoying it despite the negative thoughts it's bringing up. To be continued...12/3 - Not as bad as I thought it was going to be re bringing up disturbing thoughts, except for one of the later chapters focussing on deaths due to 'medical misadventures' or 'therapeutic complications' as Melinek puts it - when a patient dies during non-emergent surgery due to surgeon error. Reading about the ordeal Melinek and her fellow medical examiners went through in the aftermath of September 11 was a little tough, even for someone who's never been to New York - body bags becoming body part bags becoming body bit bags (a lump of skin, a piece of an intestine) and thinking of all the families who don't KNOW what happened to their father, mother, son, daughter. That was really sad. I do wonder how she remembered the details of all these cases, from 14 years ago, so vividly, even seeming to repeat conversations word for word. I also wonder how she managed to get all the patient's families to agree to have their family member's death story revealed in the ME's memoir. There was no mention anywhere of the names having been changed to protect the surviving family members, so I have to assume that all those names are real. Whatever the case, highly recommended to those with a strong stomach and a lack of anxiety regarding all the ways they and their loved ones could die.PopSugar 2015 Reading Challenge: A Memoir"

This is the place where Death delights to help the living.’I am completely, over the top, irrationally fond of books about medicine and/or the macabre and apparently have the extremely annoying habit of sharing choice trivia I pick up in these books, to the horror of my friends (so those of you that I see offline, brace yourselves for some really gruesome tidbits)This book takes the form of memoir, forensic crime investigation, pathology and weird-shit-people-die-from stories. The author seems to be quite an optimistic ray of sunshine in an industry that leans towards the dark and depressing. She conveys the stories at times with humor, at times with sadness but always with compassion and respect.“People ask me all the time, “What’s the worst way to die you’ve ever seen?” I assure them, “You don’t want to know.” She was right. I should not have wanted to know. All I can say is I will never eat lobster again, EVER.She is frank and outspoken about suicide and whether I agree with her views or not, I could sympathize with her. Having lived through her own fathers suicide at the age of 13 it clearly left scars still visible in her adult life.I heard about this author from a GR friend’s review and also knew beforehand that she was most famous for the 8 months she provided medical support in the 9/11 aftermath. What I did not expect was how much of an emotional read Chapter 10 would be for me. I have the utmost respect for each and every person who was involved in the First Responder teams and everyone else that assisted them. Every doctor has to cultivate compassion, to learn it and then practice it. To confront death every day, to see it for yourself, you have to love the living. Would I recommend this? YES absolutely, but then again I have an extreme bias towards books like this so perhaps my judgment cannot be trusted. Oh and a word of warning, if you are overly sensitive or have a weak stomach perhaps this book is not for you."
190,1476727252,http://goodreads.com/user/show/20229277-alissa-patrick,4,"I really loved this book. This is a non-fiction account of a woman's 2 year stint as a New York Medical Examiner, a profession I always found fascinating even though it gives me the heebie jeebies. The stories are of course gross at times (doing the autopsy of a construction worker who had a beam fall on his head). Sometimes the stats are informative and funny (if you die alone with your pet, the dog will lay by your body in mourning.... your cat? Will start eating you that day)I was enjoying this read as a light-hearted read (as much as the content would allow of course)... until I got to the 9/11 chapters. It didn't even occur to me as I was reading what year she had started being an ME, and then suddenly she started a chapter with September 11, 2001, and I went ""oh. crap""The last part of the book was really hard for me. I put it down several times because I nearly cried. I still relive that day so vividly and reading her account of that awful morning- then the task she had of trying to identify only body parts or small pieces of DNA just killed me. I obviously knew the carnage of that day but it just never occurred to me that they barely pulled bodies out of the World Trade Center, it was particles of people. Of the thousands of people killed, only 291 bodies in tact were found. There are still over 1,000 people who never had remains found. These chapters were just terrible and I found myself tearing up. If you're a fan of CSI, Law and Order, etc those type of shows I highly recommend this book. "

Dr. Melinek threw herself into her schooling and then her work, a determined young woman who truly wants to help solve the mysteries of some deaths and help bring closure to grieving families.In this book, she talks of heartbreak, loss, unusual cases, and her own personal viewpoint of the aftermath of 9/11, the bio-terrorist attacks that followed, plane crashes, investigation of sometimes gruesome death scenes, and how she copes with what many find impossible to look at and cannot fathom why some people even do that job.Obviously, this is not a lighthearted romp. It is, however, an important book. It made me very thankful for people that do these types of jobs. "
192,1476727252,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9779623-shaun,4,"This book is a collaboration between Judy Melinek and her husband T.J. Mitchell. Together they describe Judy's time training in forensic pathology at NYC Medical Examiner's Office. So if you've ever wondered what it's like to be a real forensic pathologist, here's your chance.Perhaps most notably, Melinek was in NYC during the Sept 11th attacks and was thus part of the grueling identification process, which often depended on DNA extracted from lone teeth as a means of identification. Her description of that process is nothing short of sobering. I'd never really thought much about the condition of the bodies. Interesting read and competently written."

Better yet, stay out of the car, and get some exercise. Watch your weight. If you’re a smoker stop right now. If you aren’t, don’t start. Guns put holes in people. Drugs are bad…Staying alive is mostly common sense.”This is intriguing story, told in a personable and conversational way, with black humour, personal insights, some interesting characters and plenty of passion. You can feel this doctor’s affinity for her role and the pride she has for revealing the cause of death, particularly in homicide cases where she “speaks on behalf of the dead.” This narrative is told with honesty that sometimes catches you unaware, particularly when the author discusses suicides and neonatal and child deaths; so sad. The life of an Medical Examiner is dissected and probed and all is revealed; the ugliness of death, the stench, the maggots, the sloughing skin, the reek of alcohol, the worry of infection but all is told is a calm and meaning full manner – this is not “voyeur of the dead” material, this is life (because death also affects the living), death and some deaths are good deaths and some… you really should not ask about.Throughout this narrative the authors’ voices carry you on a journey, you walk side by side with the rookie M.E and take lessons with her, then suddenly the world changes, the tone changes and it is chilling. The terrorist attacks on September 11, 2001 on the World Trade Centre towers and other threats shake up the world and have a very personal direct impact on Dr Melinek; she sees firsthand the destruction and violation of life. This section of the book is…overwhelmingly sad and horrific, the work of the first responders and the medical staff tasked with identifying the human remains is a mammoth and heartbreakingly poignant. All involved in the rescue and recovery deserve our thanks.This is truly a remarkable book told with respect and passion. "

I've always had a fascination for stuff that some people find a bit dark - true crime stories, biographies of serial killers, etc. So this book was right up my alley. Overall, the book does a good job of weaving together stories of a job that's rather morbid and dark with insights into the author's life and the lives of those she has a duty to - the dead and their families, who need answers and resolution. Some of the stories are weird, some of them will make you shake your head, some of them are just outright sad. For me, they reinforced the fact that I'm not cut out for this sort of work, as much as I enjoy reading about it. There is a chapter on the aftermath of 9/11 and I must warn who lived in New York or who was greatly impacted by the events that it is not an easy chapter to get through. Some may wish to skip it entirely. For me it was a reminder and more insight into just how truly awful that day was, and made my heart break all over again. I admire people like Judy, really - they do the work that most of us won't and can't do, and provide a vital service to our communities because of it. Books like this provide insight and remind us how important these sorts of jobs are, even if we never think about them."
195,1476727252,http://goodreads.com/user/show/13814810-ella,2,"Although this book provides an interesting look into the experiences of the author's forensic pathology residency, there are a number of aspects on which I would like to comment more critically. Most importantly, I was very unsettled by Melinek's simplistic conception of suicide and suicidal ideations. She repeatedly and violently asserts that suicide is ""selfish"". Despite Melinek's own early personal exposure to her father's suicide, she neither addresses the context nor engages with any of the complexity surrounding mental health issues. Claiming so assertively that ""suicide is a selfish act"" without considering the factors beyond the individual, the larger social institutions, and the failure of these systems further upstream, is, to me, a rather self-serving assessment. Rhetoric is powerful and I worry about the unintended consequences of Melinek's assertions on this subject. Looking more superficially, I disliked the book's organization. The timeline is established primarily through reference to her second pregnancy and to specific cases. However, the author bounces around considerably during the 2 year period in which the majority of the narrative occurs. This was more of an annoyance then it was seriously disruptive."
196,1476727252,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2079470-cheryl,4,"Dr. Judy Melinek has written a close up, personal account of the time she spent working as a forensic pathologist in the Office of the Chief Medical Examiner of New York City. While there, she performed autopsies on casualties of accidents, homicides, and suicides. In addition to performing autopsies, Dr. Melinek, in some cases, found it necessary and revealing to investigate scenes where bodies were discovered. Another part of her responsibilities involved counseling grieving family members as well as providing court testimony in cases of homicide.Dr. Melinek gives very graphic and detailed accounts of many of her cases. Most poignant and heartwrenching was the description of the work performed by forensic pathologists on the victims of the World Trade Center catastrophe on September 11, 2001, and the days and months afterward. Everyone who worked those cases was forever changed by the experience.Told with compassion and humility, Working Stiff is an unforgettable book. However, it may not appeal to everyone because of the very graphic and gruesome detail included in the casework. "
197,1476727252,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1484029-mikey-b,4,"Obviously the topic of forensics is always of interest; albeit a somewhat macabre one. So from that point of view this book is an obvious winner.However I did find the number of autopsies discussed made for quantity over quality giving the book a somewhat flippant feel (OK the subtitle clearly state 262 bodies so I was warned). Also the book had a lot of medical jargon, some of which was well explained, some not.The most poignant chapter was on the days after September 11, 2001 when the author and her colleagues were overwhelmed by an utter devastation they had never before encountered.Overall I felt the author was writing more for herself than for an audience. Many autopsies were left dangling (like Errico Lavagnino) where we do not know the cause of death. There were too many family and co-worker conversations which made the narrative unnecessarily auto-biographical. And at the risk of being politically incorrect I became irritated by reading about the author’s pregnancies."

It was sciency and then I ended up listening to a huge chunk today to finish and it was AMAZING.It has all the disgusting, gory details that you would hope for. There's obscure diagnoses and freak accidents. There were times I would say ""UGH"" out loud while working and listening. She tells you what is the worst way to die...and it is BAD.She was also a part of the team that worked on cataloguing all of the World Trade Center remains from 9/11 and that section is the most haunting. This is what makes it special and a must read for anyone who is interested in dead body memoirs/non-fiction.If you enjoyed Smoke Gets in Your Eyes and Stiff, you will most definitely like this memoir.

This is a personal account of Judy Melinek's two years working as a forensic pathologist with the Office of the Chief Medical Examiner in New York. I have found out information about decomposing bodies, burns and dismemberment that I did not know were possible. And given that Judy's time there encompassed September 11, 2001 and the scale that OCME had to deal with in deaths is beyond comprehension.As terrible as some of the accounts were, it was also a fitting tribute to the unsung heroes who give their time to answer questions for those who are still living and need resolution, justice or just consolation.If however, you find something like Agatha Christie or Midsummer Murders confronting and grisly then you may wish to steer clear."
200,1476727252,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5500554-stacy-green,4,"I started this book for research but it quickly became much more than that. Melinek has a way of delivering the story with both clinical observation and compassion. It's a very candid glimpse into the world of a medical examiner, and it's done very well. The chapter on 9/11 was chilling and heartbreaking, and hearing about it from the perspective from someone working with the massive amounts of casualties really made it feel like those days were happening all over again. Not for the faint of heart, but very well worth the time. And a must read for any writer considering a character in this field. "

The author describes things with compassion, and gives a good overview of various aspects of the job. Especially sobering was the work done after 9/11. Wow - I thought I had some ideas of what happened, but I never comprehended how truly horrible the aftermath was. I have even more respect for all of the heroes that kept working and dealing with all of that, as well as those who died. Anyway, it was a good book and well worth reading."

Staying alive, as it turns out, is mostly common sense.”This is the advice of Judy Melinek, the author of Working Stiff: Two Years, 262 Bodies, and the Making of a Medical Examiner, gleaned from her experience as an assistant medical examiner in New York City. From 2001 to 2003 Melinek performed hundreds of autopsies on the victims of homicides, suicides, accidents, natural diseases, therapeutic complications, and undetermined causes, that crossed her table. Melinek's very first post mortem involved the death of a young man, a heroin addict diagnosed with sickle-cell trait who died in hospital, her second an elderly man who sustained severe burns in a house fire, the third a pregnant woman, the victim of a hit and run. In general, each chapter of Working Stiff groups together cases by manner of death, detailing Melinek's examination of patients young and old, male and female, destitute and wealthy, and everything in between. The final chapters focus on the medical examiners office's role in the wake of the Twin Towers collapse on September 11, and the crash of American Airlines flight 587. The narrative is very readable, almost conversational in tone, and mostly free of the medical jargon one might expect. Melinek is at all times respectful but not humourless, sharing both professional perspective and personal observations. I do feel compelled to warn the unwary reader that this isn't a book for the squeamish with its graphic record of gruesome injury and detailed descriptions of the forensic autopsy process.What shines through is Melinek's passion and commitment to her job as she works to investigate and determine the cause and manner of death, comfort the bereaved, provide assistance to the justice system and ""speak for the dead"".Informative, entertaining and engaging Working Stiff is a fascinating account of the work of a medical examiner, well told by Judy Melinek and her husband T.J. Mitchell. * I gave the book an extra 1/2 star for Judy's admission she wears ""sensible shoes and a Medical Examiner windbreaker"" during her rare visits to crime scenes - not six inch stiletto's and Armani suits. "
205,1476727252,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1740304-linda,4,"Dr. Melinek was originally studying to be a surgeon. But the grueling conditions of her surgical residency were taking their toll on her life and health, and the health of patients. Honestly, the description of what is expected of surgical residents scared the shit out of me. I know, we’ve seen it in TV dramas… no sleep, inhuman hours. But the reality is that nobody could possibly function well under those conditions, and our lives depend on surgeons being at their best. It makes me wonder if some regulation should be put into place similar to that for pilots and truck drivers. Anyway, her quitting her surgical residency for the more civilized routine of a medical examiner is what brings us to this book.Her descriptions of how she does her work, in conjunction with law enforcement, to determine cause of death… and more important, manner of death, was fascinating. Manner of death includes Homicide, Suicide, Accidental, Natural, and Undetermined. Dr. Melinek provides vivid anecdotes of each of these, and it’s very interesting. She does not come across as a morbid person, and in fact enjoys the work for the comfort it can provide the living.She tells us of having worked as a Medical Examiner in NYC through the 9/11 attacks and the subsequent anthrax scare, which is as overwhelming as you would imagine.There’s only one thing I was a little triggered by, and it has nothing to do with the gruesome descriptions of death and the methodical dissection of corpses. Dr. Melinek survived her own tragedy when her beloved father took his own life while she was a girl. And whenever she discusses her findings of suicide, there remains an understandable bitterness. It allows her to be more empathetic to other survivors, which is wonderful. But her vehement assertion that all people who commit suicide are selfish hit me wrong. I am also the survivor of a loved one who took her own life, though not a parent. My own conclusion is that none of us can know the pain and suffering that another person endures. And they deserve compassion more than derision. I’m not condemning her perspective as less valid than mine, it just made it a little hard for me to read at points.3.67 stars"
206,1476727252,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4089241-liralen,4,"I'm stumped. This would normally go on my hypothetical list of jobs I never knew I didn't want, except I did know I wouldn't want this job. I just love reading about it. 'Jobs I Only Want to Read About'?Erm. Anyway. Melinek turned from surgery to forensic pathology after realising that both career paths would let her cut up bodies but pathology would also let her get more than three hours of sleep (and the patients wouldn't argue). Here she details cases she saw during her two years in New York City, where she learned the ropes. Suicides and overdoses—so many overdoses—and accidents and medical errors. More overdoses. Murders. Early in her career but late in the book, victims of 9/11.Melinek displays a fair amount of glee in discussing some of the more interesting cases—I rather think she and Mary Roach would get along—while managing to remain respectful of the individuals (deceased and family) involved. She's descriptive enough that I actually took a break mid-book to read something lighter, which I don't usually feel the need to do...I recommend reading this, but not while eating!Towards the end of the book, Melinek talks about the attacks on the World Trade Center in 2001, when she'd been working as a medical examiner for only a few months. To me it was the strongest section of the book—it has the most consistent storyline of the book, and although that (and the American Airlines crash of November 2001) is the most hectic, case-after-case-body-after-body time she describes, in some ways it's the least hectic section of the book—more time taken to slow down and connect her personal experience with her professional experience. Up to that point I was enjoying the stories but finding the transitions somewhat lacking (or perhaps too good, as she segued neatly from body to body to body), but the pieces really fell into place for me later on in the book.I'll never be a doctor, much less a medical examiner, and I'm so many kinds of okay with that. But a reader of books like this? Yes please."

I imagine it was cathartic for the writer to share, but a lot of this book made me squirm with discomfort. Like the accidents whose victims the author attended to, morbid curiousity prevented me from looking away. I wouldn't recommend it to the squeamish and, as others have noted, she is particularly opinionated about suicide and tends to come across as highly unsympathetic.2 stars out of 5.

The only issue I had was that there were so many stories - bodies - and that the story itself was too fragmented. Other than this, absolutely a fascinating read. "
209,1476727252,http://goodreads.com/user/show/678841-kim,4,"Working Stiff discusses Judy Melinek's two years working for the New York City OCME (Office of the Chief Medical Examiner), which began in 2001 and ended in 2002. Although the WTC attack happened only six weeks after she began work and the plane crash in Queens four weeks after that, the book is not about these two disasters but her experience and teachings from the autopsies of ""regular"" New Yorkers, and all the different ways that they die.I found the subject matter fascinating. This sort of pathology is something I had considered and briefly, in medical school, I spent time in the ME's office. I was immediately repelled by the odor of decomposition. ""You get used to it,"" was what the medical examiners and detectives told me, but I was pretty sure that wasn't true. Years later, I know that there are certain things we learn to put up with in our line of work and others that just strain our personal limits. So - kudos to Judy Melinek and others like her who are able to handle the stench of decomposition when it is present and do this job. On the plus side: Melinek does an incredible job documenting how ordinary and not-so-ordinary people die, what happens to our bodies after we die, and how medical examiners piece together our last hours and moments of life. The scientific and technical details are amazing. She discusses numerous cases - murders and natural causes, ""therapeutic complications"" (as a physician, I really like that), innumerable accidental deaths, suicides. As she states in the beginning of the book, ""Staying alive, as it turns out, is mostly common sense."" So true.Like everyone else old enough to pay attention, I remember where I was on September 11, 2001; and exactly what I was doing when I found out what was going on; and exactly what I was doing when those towers fell. Years later it is still something that brings me to tears: the horror, the fear, the magnitude of loss. The people who gave of themselves to save others and lost their own lives as a consequence. Melinek provides an entirely fresh, gruesome, devastating look at an old story which is both horrifying (""an X-ray had revealed a woman's severed hand, complete with wedding ring, entirely embedded within the chest wall of a man's intact torso"") and educational (""the individual pieces of recovered remains numbered 19,956""). I admit I cried for these people and their families, and for the people who worked to identify them after the fact. I don't know how you wrap your head around that and emerge intact, although I suppose it's pretty much like anything else: one foot in front of the other until it's far enough behind you.On the downside: Another reviewer has mentioned the lack of an index, which I thoroughly agree with. I own an e-book, so it's moderately easier to find things, but this is still a lack. I agree that the book lacks an ""arc,"" which makes it difficult to read at times. I really enjoyed it, but I read the individual vignettes - because that is mostly what they are - over many months. I am not sure if the book would have been better if Melinek had begun at the beginning of the two years and used her personal growth as a story arc or if this was the best option if she did not want the entire book dominated by 9/11. While I understand her wish to make the book about forensics and not about 9/11, I think the lack of an arc is a detriment.However, overall this is an interesting - if not super quick - read. I really enjoyed it and for anyone looking to learn a little more about this subject it is a worthwhile read."

I don't read much non-fiction but I have a fascination with death and what happens to your body after you die. That's why I picked this up. Maybe it's because we don't really talk about it as a society. It's too taboo or gross or a combination of both I don't know.This book covers the first year of Dr. Melinek's fellowship in NYC as a medical examiner. She doesn't go through all 262 cases but picks highlights to show was is involved in the different types of death. She does a really good job of breaking down all the medical jargon into laymen's terms without sounding condescending. Part of an MEs training is to learn how to do that since they deal with grieving family members. Each case is its own little story and I was surprised at how much detective work an ME actually does. If there is no criminal homicide for the police to investigate (and only about 30% of autopsy cases are criminal in nature) it is up to the ME to piece together what happened and not just physically. They have to understand the circumstances surrounding the death and that involves some legwork.The final section of the book is about 9/11. Melinek was only 9 weeks into her fellowship when this happened. I've heard a lot of stories about the brave work of the firefighters and police on that day but I haven't heard anything about the MEs. The only medical stories I've heard were about all the doctors and nurses waiting at the hospitals for the wounded to come in and how devastated they were when only a fraction of the number expected showed up. Now imagine what all the MEs had to go through. It was heartbreaking and interesting at the same time. They were able to identify approximately half of those that died that day. Considering what they had to work with it's pretty amazing.If you have any interest in this area I highly recommend picking up this book."

I am a big fan of crime novels, and with a boyfriend in the police, crime and murder is definitely something that interests me. This book goes into detail about how many different ways people die on an everyday occurrence, while going into detail her checklist of things that she does when doing a post mortem. This book answered every curiosity I had about post mortems and what exactly it is they do with a body. It also showed me how unexpected and random life can be; some of the accidents and medical mistakes that caused deaths throughout this really did make me think. Another thing I really appreciated is how she has shown that women can have the big career and still have a home life; something I think more women need to hear, too often we're told there's a choice and I think Melinek proved that you can indeed have both.

So don't jaywalk...You know that yellow line on the subway platform? It's there for a reason. Staying alive, as it turns out, is mostly common sense. Judy MelinekAfter reading this book I really wish I had become a medical examiner...weird I know ;-) It was fascinating. The one thing that would probably make me quit that job though would be the smell of a decomposing body...It hits you--an assault, not a scent. You flinch, heave back in revulsion. It invades your throat, assails your taste buds, even stings your eyes.The maggot talk just validated my wish to be immediately sealed in a metal drawer in a mausoleum after I die. I also knew there had to be a reason I'm allergic to cats...they will eat you immediately after you die. Whereas dogs will just stay by you for days on end. The last quarter of this book was completely spellbinding, in my opinion. She was a NYC Medical Examiner on 9/11. She heard and saw that low flying jetliner when she was hurrying to work that morning. It is even more horrific through her eyes than what I heard and saw on the news. She tagged body pieces (and the descriptions of their condition were awful)...many refrigerated tractor trailers' worth of body parts, a small number of intact bodies.The limbs had all been amputated. The torso was transected below the navel. The remains were entirely black--burned and covered in soot. The head...the head wasn't recognizable as a head, except that it had hair and was attached to the neck. The smell of jet fuel was so strong it made me dizzy. I could tell just by looking at the open body bag that this person had been mashed, burned, dropped from a height, and slashed by sharp forces. I had seen people killed by subway trains and speeding cars, run over by trucks, crushed by industrial equipment, fallen from great heights, burned, and battered--but never all at the same time.I examined the surface of the leg--and came across something that made me stare. Fragments of a personal bank check, complete with routing number and a partially legible name, were embedded under the skin, buried deep in the muscle tissue....an X-ray had revealed a woman's severed hand, complete with wedding ring, entirely embedded inside the chest wall of a man's intact torso.This quote from the Chief Medical Examiner at the time is haunting: People were jumping or falling from the buildings. They seemed to take forever to fall, tumbling through the air. They would hit the pavement with a loud thud--very loud--and bounce, and land again. The sounds of the bodies hitting the ground echoed off the buildings, one after another, over and over. I've added some great quotes from this book...hopefully they will show below this review. "
214,1476727252,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4968643-david,2,"Published a dozen years after Dr. Melinek’s two year stint in the NYC Office of the Chief Medical Examiner the cases and experiences she describes are flat, lifeless and incomplete. With all of that time between the events and the publishing of the book the authors should have conducted some degree of research to round out the stories of the cadavers she autopsied. The frequent quoted conversations had me wondering how accurate the dialogue was. And how could stories from the NYC medical examiner’s be so uninteresting?The book started off strongly and Dr. Melinek's perspective on suicide was powerful and interesting. However the book lost its unique voice soon thereafter. The stories simply weren’t compelling and there were hints of smugness, impatience and pettiness that made her seem less nice than the image she was going for (she took some condescending cheap shots at peoples’ appearances that had nothing to do with the stories at hand - the woman with the nose job, the fat guy, just to name two instances).As to the autopsies there are plenty of the sickening descriptions you might expect. Sometimes the authors seemed to rely on technical language with little explanation to create a ‘wow’ factor. If you have pet cats or are expecting to have surgery in the near future you might want to skip this one for either of those reasons alone.One final complaint: the authors played up the wittiness of Dr. Hirsch’s epigrams as if he were some magical combination of Confucius and Henny Youngman. Unfortunately the many decade old quotes fell far short of that mark. Maybe they simply forgot his precise quotes after all of those years."
215,1476727252,http://goodreads.com/user/show/23100707-jean,4,"This is a memoir of a forensic pathologist. After medical school Dr. Melinek started a residency program to be a surgeon. She took time off from work to have a baby and decided to change her specialty and become a pathologist. She attended UCLA for her pathology and forensic training and was accepted at the NYC Medical Examiner’s Office for her one-year forensic residency training program. After she completed the program she stayed on in the medical examiner’s office for another one-year residency program in forensic neuropathology.Dr. Melinek was only two months into her residency when the September 11 terrorist attack happened. She provides a firsthand account of events at the medical examiner’s office of that fateful event. She also covers the anthrax bio-terrorism attack in NYC and the crash of American Airlines flight 587. As the residency program was two years she also got to cover the routine murders, suicides and accidents normally dealt with by the medical examiner. Dr. Melinek reveals the day to day life of a forensic pathologist. She also provides some background information, for example: how a death certificate is filled out and why; what constitutes accidental death or homicide and so on. I found the information on the type of bullets and their effect on the body interesting as well as the general information of ballistics. Overall a most fascinating memoir.Dr. Melinek wrote the book with her husband, T. J. Mitchell. They met at Harvard where he was an English major. He works as a screenwriter and script editor.Tanya Eby does a good job narrating the book. Eby is a voice over artist and an award winning audiobook narrator."

I like Melinek's voice and style of writing and her irreverent way of looking at death. I love the way she describes her reaction to shows featuring characters doing her job - the fact that they go to every crime scene, the women wear their good high-heeled shoes, they actually help with the investigation. From now on CSI will be light-hearted crime fiction, in the same league as those 'cosy mysteries' that feature little old lady super-sleuths, not a realistic look into the life of a medical examiner. I can see the irony and humour in some of the causes of death that she sees (although, not when contemplating my own future). For example, an unfortunate worker having his morning coffee gets hit in the head by a giant crane, a crane so large that he is practically crumpled into the ground like an aluminium can. Although, at the same time reading medical nonfiction does hit a bit close to home for someone only weeks away from having major surgery to remove a 9 x 7 cm suspicious mass, along with 25% of her liver. Maybe I shouldn't be reading this right now... So far I'm enjoying it despite the negative thoughts it's bringing up. To be continued...12/3 - Not as bad as I thought it was going to be re bringing up disturbing thoughts, except for one of the later chapters focussing on deaths due to 'medical misadventures' or 'therapeutic complications' as Melinek puts it - when a patient dies during non-emergent surgery due to surgeon error. Reading about the ordeal Melinek and her fellow medical examiners went through in the aftermath of September 11 was a little tough, even for someone who's never been to New York - body bags becoming body part bags becoming body bit bags (a lump of skin, a piece of an intestine) and thinking of all the families who don't KNOW what happened to their father, mother, son, daughter. That was really sad. I do wonder how she remembered the details of all these cases, from 14 years ago, so vividly, even seeming to repeat conversations word for word. I also wonder how she managed to get all the patient's families to agree to have their family member's death story revealed in the ME's memoir. There was no mention anywhere of the names having been changed to protect the surviving family members, so I have to assume that all those names are real. Whatever the case, highly recommended to those with a strong stomach and a lack of anxiety regarding all the ways they and their loved ones could die.PopSugar 2015 Reading Challenge: A Memoir"

This is the place where Death delights to help the living.’I am completely, over the top, irrationally fond of books about medicine and/or the macabre and apparently have the extremely annoying habit of sharing choice trivia I pick up in these books, to the horror of my friends (so those of you that I see offline, brace yourselves for some really gruesome tidbits)This book takes the form of memoir, forensic crime investigation, pathology and weird-shit-people-die-from stories. The author seems to be quite an optimistic ray of sunshine in an industry that leans towards the dark and depressing. She conveys the stories at times with humor, at times with sadness but always with compassion and respect.“People ask me all the time, “What’s the worst way to die you’ve ever seen?” I assure them, “You don’t want to know.” She was right. I should not have wanted to know. All I can say is I will never eat lobster again, EVER.She is frank and outspoken about suicide and whether I agree with her views or not, I could sympathize with her. Having lived through her own fathers suicide at the age of 13 it clearly left scars still visible in her adult life.I heard about this author from a GR friend’s review and also knew beforehand that she was most famous for the 8 months she provided medical support in the 9/11 aftermath. What I did not expect was how much of an emotional read Chapter 10 would be for me. I have the utmost respect for each and every person who was involved in the First Responder teams and everyone else that assisted them. Every doctor has to cultivate compassion, to learn it and then practice it. To confront death every day, to see it for yourself, you have to love the living. Would I recommend this? YES absolutely, but then again I have an extreme bias towards books like this so perhaps my judgment cannot be trusted. Oh and a word of warning, if you are overly sensitive or have a weak stomach perhaps this book is not for you."
220,1476727252,http://goodreads.com/user/show/20229277-alissa-patrick,4,"I really loved this book. This is a non-fiction account of a woman's 2 year stint as a New York Medical Examiner, a profession I always found fascinating even though it gives me the heebie jeebies. The stories are of course gross at times (doing the autopsy of a construction worker who had a beam fall on his head). Sometimes the stats are informative and funny (if you die alone with your pet, the dog will lay by your body in mourning.... your cat? Will start eating you that day)I was enjoying this read as a light-hearted read (as much as the content would allow of course)... until I got to the 9/11 chapters. It didn't even occur to me as I was reading what year she had started being an ME, and then suddenly she started a chapter with September 11, 2001, and I went ""oh. crap""The last part of the book was really hard for me. I put it down several times because I nearly cried. I still relive that day so vividly and reading her account of that awful morning- then the task she had of trying to identify only body parts or small pieces of DNA just killed me. I obviously knew the carnage of that day but it just never occurred to me that they barely pulled bodies out of the World Trade Center, it was particles of people. Of the thousands of people killed, only 291 bodies in tact were found. There are still over 1,000 people who never had remains found. These chapters were just terrible and I found myself tearing up. If you're a fan of CSI, Law and Order, etc those type of shows I highly recommend this book. "

Dr. Melinek threw herself into her schooling and then her work, a determined young woman who truly wants to help solve the mysteries of some deaths and help bring closure to grieving families.In this book, she talks of heartbreak, loss, unusual cases, and her own personal viewpoint of the aftermath of 9/11, the bio-terrorist attacks that followed, plane crashes, investigation of sometimes gruesome death scenes, and how she copes with what many find impossible to look at and cannot fathom why some people even do that job.Obviously, this is not a lighthearted romp. It is, however, an important book. It made me very thankful for people that do these types of jobs. "

Together they describe Judy's time training in forensic pathology at NYC Medical Examiner's Office. So if you've ever wondered what it's like to be a real forensic pathologist, here's your chance.Perhaps most notably, Melinek was in NYC during the Sept 11th attacks and was thus part of the grueling identification process, which often depended on DNA extracted from lone teeth as a means of identification. Her description of that process is nothing short of sobering. I'd never really thought much about the condition of the bodies. Interesting read and competently written."

Better yet, stay out of the car, and get some exercise. Watch your weight. If you’re a smoker stop right now. If you aren’t, don’t start. Guns put holes in people. Drugs are bad…Staying alive is mostly common sense.”This is intriguing story, told in a personable and conversational way, with black humour, personal insights, some interesting characters and plenty of passion. You can feel this doctor’s affinity for her role and the pride she has for revealing the cause of death, particularly in homicide cases where she “speaks on behalf of the dead.” This narrative is told with honesty that sometimes catches you unaware, particularly when the author discusses suicides and neonatal and child deaths; so sad. The life of an Medical Examiner is dissected and probed and all is revealed; the ugliness of death, the stench, the maggots, the sloughing skin, the reek of alcohol, the worry of infection but all is told is a calm and meaning full manner – this is not “voyeur of the dead” material, this is life (because death also affects the living), death and some deaths are good deaths and some… you really should not ask about.Throughout this narrative the authors’ voices carry you on a journey, you walk side by side with the rookie M.E and take lessons with her, then suddenly the world changes, the tone changes and it is chilling. The terrorist attacks on September 11, 2001 on the World Trade Centre towers and other threats shake up the world and have a very personal direct impact on Dr Melinek; she sees firsthand the destruction and violation of life. This section of the book is…overwhelmingly sad and horrific, the work of the first responders and the medical staff tasked with identifying the human remains is a mammoth and heartbreakingly poignant. All involved in the rescue and recovery deserve our thanks.This is truly a remarkable book told with respect and passion. "

I've always had a fascination for stuff that some people find a bit dark - true crime stories, biographies of serial killers, etc. So this book was right up my alley. Overall, the book does a good job of weaving together stories of a job that's rather morbid and dark with insights into the author's life and the lives of those she has a duty to - the dead and their families, who need answers and resolution. Some of the stories are weird, some of them will make you shake your head, some of them are just outright sad. For me, they reinforced the fact that I'm not cut out for this sort of work, as much as I enjoy reading about it. There is a chapter on the aftermath of 9/11 and I must warn who lived in New York or who was greatly impacted by the events that it is not an easy chapter to get through. Some may wish to skip it entirely. For me it was a reminder and more insight into just how truly awful that day was, and made my heart break all over again. I admire people like Judy, really - they do the work that most of us won't and can't do, and provide a vital service to our communities because of it. Books like this provide insight and remind us how important these sorts of jobs are, even if we never think about them."
225,1476727252,http://goodreads.com/user/show/13814810-ella,2,"Although this book provides an interesting look into the experiences of the author's forensic pathology residency, there are a number of aspects on which I would like to comment more critically. Most importantly, I was very unsettled by Melinek's simplistic conception of suicide and suicidal ideations. She repeatedly and violently asserts that suicide is ""selfish"". Despite Melinek's own early personal exposure to her father's suicide, she neither addresses the context nor engages with any of the complexity surrounding mental health issues. Claiming so assertively that ""suicide is a selfish act"" without considering the factors beyond the individual, the larger social institutions, and the failure of these systems further upstream, is, to me, a rather self-serving assessment. Rhetoric is powerful and I worry about the unintended consequences of Melinek's assertions on this subject. Looking more superficially, I disliked the book's organization. The timeline is established primarily through reference to her second pregnancy and to specific cases. However, the author bounces around considerably during the 2 year period in which the majority of the narrative occurs. This was more of an annoyance then it was seriously disruptive."
226,1476727252,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2079470-cheryl,4,"Dr. Judy Melinek has written a close up, personal account of the time she spent working as a forensic pathologist in the Office of the Chief Medical Examiner of New York City. While there, she performed autopsies on casualties of accidents, homicides, and suicides. In addition to performing autopsies, Dr. Melinek, in some cases, found it necessary and revealing to investigate scenes where bodies were discovered. Another part of her responsibilities involved counseling grieving family members as well as providing court testimony in cases of homicide.Dr. Melinek gives very graphic and detailed accounts of many of her cases. Most poignant and heartwrenching was the description of the work performed by forensic pathologists on the victims of the World Trade Center catastrophe on September 11, 2001, and the days and months afterward. Everyone who worked those cases was forever changed by the experience.Told with compassion and humility, Working Stiff is an unforgettable book. However, it may not appeal to everyone because of the very graphic and gruesome detail included in the casework. "
227,1476727252,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1484029-mikey-b,4,"Obviously the topic of forensics is always of interest; albeit a somewhat macabre one. So from that point of view this book is an obvious winner.However I did find the number of autopsies discussed made for quantity over quality giving the book a somewhat flippant feel (OK the subtitle clearly state 262 bodies so I was warned). Also the book had a lot of medical jargon, some of which was well explained, some not.The most poignant chapter was on the days after September 11, 2001 when the author and her colleagues were overwhelmed by an utter devastation they had never before encountered.Overall I felt the author was writing more for herself than for an audience. Many autopsies were left dangling (like Errico Lavagnino) where we do not know the cause of death. There were too many family and co-worker conversations which made the narrative unnecessarily auto-biographical. And at the risk of being politically incorrect I became irritated by reading about the author’s pregnancies."

There's obscure diagnoses and freak accidents. There were times I would say ""UGH"" out loud while working and listening. She tells you what is the worst way to die...and it is BAD.She was also a part of the team that worked on cataloguing all of the World Trade Center remains from 9/11 and that section is the most haunting.

This is a personal account of Judy Melinek's two years working as a forensic pathologist with the Office of the Chief Medical Examiner in New York. I have found out information about decomposing bodies, burns and dismemberment that I did not know were possible. And given that Judy's time there encompassed September 11, 2001 and the scale that OCME had to deal with in deaths is beyond comprehension.As terrible as some of the accounts were, it was also a fitting tribute to the unsung heroes who give their time to answer questions for those who are still living and need resolution, justice or just consolation.If however, you find something like Agatha Christie or Midsummer Murders confronting and grisly then you may wish to steer clear."

Melinek has a way of delivering the story with both clinical observation and compassion. It's a very candid glimpse into the world of a medical examiner, and it's done very well. The chapter on 9/11 was chilling and heartbreaking, and hearing about it from the perspective from someone working with the massive amounts of casualties really made it feel like those days were happening all over again. Not for the faint of heart, but very well worth the time. And a must read for any writer considering a character in this field. "

Staying alive, as it turns out, is mostly common sense.”This is the advice of Judy Melinek, the author of Working Stiff: Two Years, 262 Bodies, and the Making of a Medical Examiner, gleaned from her experience as an assistant medical examiner in New York City. From 2001 to 2003 Melinek performed hundreds of autopsies on the victims of homicides, suicides, accidents, natural diseases, therapeutic complications, and undetermined causes, that crossed her table. Melinek's very first post mortem involved the death of a young man, a heroin addict diagnosed with sickle-cell trait who died in hospital, her second an elderly man who sustained severe burns in a house fire, the third a pregnant woman, the victim of a hit and run. In general, each chapter of Working Stiff groups together cases by manner of death, detailing Melinek's examination of patients young and old, male and female, destitute and wealthy, and everything in between. The final chapters focus on the medical examiners office's role in the wake of the Twin Towers collapse on September 11, and the crash of American Airlines flight 587. The narrative is very readable, almost conversational in tone, and mostly free of the medical jargon one might expect. Melinek is at all times respectful but not humourless, sharing both professional perspective and personal observations. I do feel compelled to warn the unwary reader that this isn't a book for the squeamish with its graphic record of gruesome injury and detailed descriptions of the forensic autopsy process.What shines through is Melinek's passion and commitment to her job as she works to investigate and determine the cause and manner of death, comfort the bereaved, provide assistance to the justice system and ""speak for the dead"".Informative, entertaining and engaging Working Stiff is a fascinating account of the work of a medical examiner, well told by Judy Melinek and her husband T.J. Mitchell. * I gave the book an extra 1/2 star for Judy's admission she wears ""sensible shoes and a Medical Examiner windbreaker"" during her rare visits to crime scenes - not six inch stiletto's and Armani suits.

235,1476727252,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1740304-linda,4,"Dr. Melinek was originally studying to be a surgeon. But the grueling conditions of her surgical residency were taking their toll on her life and health, and the health of patients. Honestly, the description of what is expected of surgical residents scared the shit out of me. I know, we’ve seen it in TV dramas… no sleep, inhuman hours. But the reality is that nobody could possibly function well under those conditions, and our lives depend on surgeons being at their best. It makes me wonder if some regulation should be put into place similar to that for pilots and truck drivers. Anyway, her quitting her surgical residency for the more civilized routine of a medical examiner is what brings us to this book.Her descriptions of how she does her work, in conjunction with law enforcement, to determine cause of death… and more important, manner of death, was fascinating. Manner of death includes Homicide, Suicide, Accidental, Natural, and Undetermined. Dr. Melinek provides vivid anecdotes of each of these, and it’s very interesting. She does not come across as a morbid person, and in fact enjoys the work for the comfort it can provide the living.She tells us of having worked as a Medical Examiner in NYC through the 9/11 attacks and the subsequent anthrax scare, which is as overwhelming as you would imagine.There’s only one thing I was a little triggered by, and it has nothing to do with the gruesome descriptions of death and the methodical dissection of corpses. Dr. Melinek survived her own tragedy when her beloved father took his own life while she was a girl. And whenever she discusses her findings of suicide, there remains an understandable bitterness. It allows her to be more empathetic to other survivors, which is wonderful. But her vehement assertion that all people who commit suicide are selfish hit me wrong. I am also the survivor of a loved one who took her own life, though not a parent. My own conclusion is that none of us can know the pain and suffering that another person endures. And they deserve compassion more than derision. I’m not condemning her perspective as less valid than mine, it just made it a little hard for me to read at points.3.67 stars"

This would normally go on my hypothetical list of jobs I never knew I didn't want, except I did know I wouldn't want this job. I just love reading about it. 'Jobs I Only Want to Read About'?Erm. Anyway. Melinek turned from surgery to forensic pathology after realising that both career paths would let her cut up bodies but pathology would also let her get more than three hours of sleep (and the patients wouldn't argue). Here she details cases she saw during her two years in New York City, where she learned the ropes. Suicides and overdoses—so many overdoses—and accidents and medical errors. More overdoses. Murders. Early in her career but late in the book, victims of 9/11.Melinek displays a fair amount of glee in discussing some of the more interesting cases—I rather think she and Mary Roach would get along—while managing to remain respectful of the individuals (deceased and family) involved. She's descriptive enough that I actually took a break mid-book to read something lighter, which I don't usually feel the need to do...I recommend reading this, but not while eating!Towards the end of the book, Melinek talks about the attacks on the World Trade Center in 2001, when she'd been working as a medical examiner for only a few months. To me it was the strongest section of the book—it has the most consistent storyline of the book, and although that (and the American Airlines crash of November 2001) is the most hectic, case-after-case-body-after-body time she describes, in some ways it's the least hectic section of the book—more time taken to slow down and connect her personal experience with her professional experience. Up to that point I was enjoying the stories but finding the transitions somewhat lacking (or perhaps too good, as she segued neatly from body to body to body), but the pieces really fell into place for me later on in the book.I'll never be a doctor, much less a medical examiner, and I'm so many kinds of okay with that. But a reader of books like this? Yes please."

I imagine it was cathartic for the writer to share, but a lot of this book made me squirm with discomfort. Like the accidents whose victims the author attended to, morbid curiousity prevented me from looking away. I wouldn't recommend it to the squeamish and, as others have noted, she is particularly opinionated about suicide and tends to come across as highly unsympathetic.2 stars out of 5.

The only issue I had was that there were so many stories - bodies - and that the story itself was too fragmented. Other than this, absolutely a fascinating read. "
239,1476727252,http://goodreads.com/user/show/678841-kim,4,"Working Stiff discusses Judy Melinek's two years working for the New York City OCME (Office of the Chief Medical Examiner), which began in 2001 and ended in 2002. Although the WTC attack happened only six weeks after she began work and the plane crash in Queens four weeks after that, the book is not about these two disasters but her experience and teachings from the autopsies of ""regular"" New Yorkers, and all the different ways that they die.I found the subject matter fascinating. This sort of pathology is something I had considered and briefly, in medical school, I spent time in the ME's office. I was immediately repelled by the odor of decomposition. ""You get used to it,"" was what the medical examiners and detectives told me, but I was pretty sure that wasn't true. Years later, I know that there are certain things we learn to put up with in our line of work and others that just strain our personal limits. So - kudos to Judy Melinek and others like her who are able to handle the stench of decomposition when it is present and do this job. On the plus side: Melinek does an incredible job documenting how ordinary and not-so-ordinary people die, what happens to our bodies after we die, and how medical examiners piece together our last hours and moments of life. The scientific and technical details are amazing. She discusses numerous cases - murders and natural causes, ""therapeutic complications"" (as a physician, I really like that), innumerable accidental deaths, suicides. As she states in the beginning of the book, ""Staying alive, as it turns out, is mostly common sense."" So true.Like everyone else old enough to pay attention, I remember where I was on September 11, 2001; and exactly what I was doing when I found out what was going on; and exactly what I was doing when those towers fell. Years later it is still something that brings me to tears: the horror, the fear, the magnitude of loss. The people who gave of themselves to save others and lost their own lives as a consequence. Melinek provides an entirely fresh, gruesome, devastating look at an old story which is both horrifying (""an X-ray had revealed a woman's severed hand, complete with wedding ring, entirely embedded within the chest wall of a man's intact torso"") and educational (""the individual pieces of recovered remains numbered 19,956""). I admit I cried for these people and their families, and for the people who worked to identify them after the fact. I don't know how you wrap your head around that and emerge intact, although I suppose it's pretty much like anything else: one foot in front of the other until it's far enough behind you.On the downside: Another reviewer has mentioned the lack of an index, which I thoroughly agree with. I own an e-book, so it's moderately easier to find things, but this is still a lack. I agree that the book lacks an ""arc,"" which makes it difficult to read at times. I really enjoyed it, but I read the individual vignettes - because that is mostly what they are - over many months. I am not sure if the book would have been better if Melinek had begun at the beginning of the two years and used her personal growth as a story arc or if this was the best option if she did not want the entire book dominated by 9/11. While I understand her wish to make the book about forensics and not about 9/11, I think the lack of an arc is a detriment.However, overall this is an interesting - if not super quick - read. I really enjoyed it and for anyone looking to learn a little more about this subject it is a worthwhile read."

It's a graphic yet tasteful and respectful memoir of a New York medical examiner's grisly career and how she coped with it over time, as well as how her work helped grieving families and friends find closure."
241,1476727252,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5028851-cathryn,5,"While I was reading this book I kept walking around my house saying ""This is fascinating."" to the point that I started the sentence and my daughter finished it. I don't read much non-fiction but I have a fascination with death and what happens to your body after you die. That's why I picked this up. Maybe it's because we don't really talk about it as a society. It's too taboo or gross or a combination of both I don't know.This book covers the first year of Dr. Melinek's fellowship in NYC as a medical examiner. She doesn't go through all 262 cases but picks highlights to show was is involved in the different types of death. She does a really good job of breaking down all the medical jargon into laymen's terms without sounding condescending. Part of an MEs training is to learn how to do that since they deal with grieving family members. Each case is its own little story and I was surprised at how much detective work an ME actually does. If there is no criminal homicide for the police to investigate (and only about 30% of autopsy cases are criminal in nature) it is up to the ME to piece together what happened and not just physically. They have to understand the circumstances surrounding the death and that involves some legwork.The final section of the book is about 9/11. Melinek was only 9 weeks into her fellowship when this happened. I've heard a lot of stories about the brave work of the firefighters and police on that day but I haven't heard anything about the MEs. The only medical stories I've heard were about all the doctors and nurses waiting at the hospitals for the wounded to come in and how devastated they were when only a fraction of the number expected showed up. Now imagine what all the MEs had to go through. It was heartbreaking and interesting at the same time. They were able to identify approximately half of those that died that day. Considering what they had to work with it's pretty amazing.If you have any interest in this area I highly recommend picking up this book."
242,1476727252,http://goodreads.com/user/show/52700401-abbie-hooton,5,"If you have any sense of morbid fascination with the dead and what happens, then this is definitely worth a read. I am a big fan of crime novels, and with a boyfriend in the police, crime and murder is definitely something that interests me. This book goes into detail about how many different ways people die on an everyday occurrence, while going into detail her checklist of things that she does when doing a post mortem. This book answered every curiosity I had about post mortems and what exactly it is they do with a body. It also showed me how unexpected and random life can be; some of the accidents and medical mistakes that caused deaths throughout this really did make me think. Another thing I really appreciated is how she has shown that women can have the big career and still have a home life; something I think more women need to hear, too often we're told there's a choice and I think Melinek proved that you can indeed have both. "
243,1476727252,http://goodreads.com/user/show/773729-kelly,4,"Once I became an eyewitness to death, I found that nearly every unexpected fatality I investigated was either the result of something dangerously mundane, or of something predictably hazardous. So don't jaywalk...You know that yellow line on the subway platform? It's there for a reason. Staying alive, as it turns out, is mostly common sense. Judy MelinekAfter reading this book I really wish I had become a medical examiner...weird I know ;-) It was fascinating. The one thing that would probably make me quit that job though would be the smell of a decomposing body...It hits you--an assault, not a scent. You flinch, heave back in revulsion. It invades your throat, assails your taste buds, even stings your eyes.The maggot talk just validated my wish to be immediately sealed in a metal drawer in a mausoleum after I die. I also knew there had to be a reason I'm allergic to cats...they will eat you immediately after you die. Whereas dogs will just stay by you for days on end. The last quarter of this book was completely spellbinding, in my opinion. She was a NYC Medical Examiner on 9/11. She heard and saw that low flying jetliner when she was hurrying to work that morning. It is even more horrific through her eyes than what I heard and saw on the news. She tagged body pieces (and the descriptions of their condition were awful)...many refrigerated tractor trailers' worth of body parts, a small number of intact bodies.The limbs had all been amputated. The torso was transected below the navel. The remains were entirely black--burned and covered in soot. The head...the head wasn't recognizable as a head, except that it had hair and was attached to the neck. The smell of jet fuel was so strong it made me dizzy. I could tell just by looking at the open body bag that this person had been mashed, burned, dropped from a height, and slashed by sharp forces. I had seen people killed by subway trains and speeding cars, run over by trucks, crushed by industrial equipment, fallen from great heights, burned, and battered--but never all at the same time.I examined the surface of the leg--and came across something that made me stare. Fragments of a personal bank check, complete with routing number and a partially legible name, were embedded under the skin, buried deep in the muscle tissue....an X-ray had revealed a woman's severed hand, complete with wedding ring, entirely embedded inside the chest wall of a man's intact torso.This quote from the Chief Medical Examiner at the time is haunting: People were jumping or falling from the buildings. They seemed to take forever to fall, tumbling through the air. They would hit the pavement with a loud thud--very loud--and bounce, and land again. The sounds of the bodies hitting the ground echoed off the buildings, one after another, over and over. I've added some great quotes from this book...hopefully they will show below this review. "
244,1476727252,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4968643-david,2,"Published a dozen years after Dr. Melinek’s two year stint in the NYC Office of the Chief Medical Examiner the cases and experiences she describes are flat, lifeless and incomplete. With all of that time between the events and the publishing of the book the authors should have conducted some degree of research to round out the stories of the cadavers she autopsied. The frequent quoted conversations had me wondering how accurate the dialogue was. And how could stories from the NYC medical examiner’s be so uninteresting?The book started off strongly and Dr. Melinek's perspective on suicide was powerful and interesting. However the book lost its unique voice soon thereafter. The stories simply weren’t compelling and there were hints of smugness, impatience and pettiness that made her seem less nice than the image she was going for (she took some condescending cheap shots at peoples’ appearances that had nothing to do with the stories at hand - the woman with the nose job, the fat guy, just to name two instances).As to the autopsies there are plenty of the sickening descriptions you might expect. Sometimes the authors seemed to rely on technical language with little explanation to create a ‘wow’ factor. If you have pet cats or are expecting to have surgery in the near future you might want to skip this one for either of those reasons alone.One final complaint: the authors played up the wittiness of Dr. Hirsch’s epigrams as if he were some magical combination of Confucius and Henny Youngman. Unfortunately the many decade old quotes fell far short of that mark. Maybe they simply forgot his precise quotes after all of those years."
245,1476727252,http://goodreads.com/user/show/23100707-jean,4,"This is a memoir of a forensic pathologist. After medical school Dr. Melinek started a residency program to be a surgeon. She took time off from work to have a baby and decided to change her specialty and become a pathologist. She attended UCLA for her pathology and forensic training and was accepted at the NYC Medical Examiner’s Office for her one-year forensic residency training program. After she completed the program she stayed on in the medical examiner’s office for another one-year residency program in forensic neuropathology.Dr. Melinek was only two months into her residency when the September 11 terrorist attack happened. She provides a firsthand account of events at the medical examiner’s office of that fateful event. She also covers the anthrax bio-terrorism attack in NYC and the crash of American Airlines flight 587. As the residency program was two years she also got to cover the routine murders, suicides and accidents normally dealt with by the medical examiner. Dr. Melinek reveals the day to day life of a forensic pathologist. She also provides some background information, for example: how a death certificate is filled out and why; what constitutes accidental death or homicide and so on. I found the information on the type of bullets and their effect on the body interesting as well as the general information of ballistics. Overall a most fascinating memoir.Dr. Melinek wrote the book with her husband, T. J. Mitchell. They met at Harvard where he was an English major. He works as a screenwriter and script editor.Tanya Eby does a good job narrating the book. Eby is a voice over artist and an award winning audiobook narrator."

I like Melinek's voice and style of writing and her irreverent way of looking at death. I love the way she describes her reaction to shows featuring characters doing her job - the fact that they go to every crime scene, the women wear their good high-heeled shoes, they actually help with the investigation. From now on CSI will be light-hearted crime fiction, in the same league as those 'cosy mysteries' that feature little old lady super-sleuths, not a realistic look into the life of a medical examiner. I can see the irony and humour in some of the causes of death that she sees (although, not when contemplating my own future). For example, an unfortunate worker having his morning coffee gets hit in the head by a giant crane, a crane so large that he is practically crumpled into the ground like an aluminium can. Although, at the same time reading medical nonfiction does hit a bit close to home for someone only weeks away from having major surgery to remove a 9 x 7 cm suspicious mass, along with 25% of her liver. Maybe I shouldn't be reading this right now... So far I'm enjoying it despite the negative thoughts it's bringing up. To be continued...12/3 - Not as bad as I thought it was going to be re bringing up disturbing thoughts, except for one of the later chapters focussing on deaths due to 'medical misadventures' or 'therapeutic complications' as Melinek puts it - when a patient dies during non-emergent surgery due to surgeon error. Reading about the ordeal Melinek and her fellow medical examiners went through in the aftermath of September 11 was a little tough, even for someone who's never been to New York - body bags becoming body part bags becoming body bit bags (a lump of skin, a piece of an intestine) and thinking of all the families who don't KNOW what happened to their father, mother, son, daughter. That was really sad. I do wonder how she remembered the details of all these cases, from 14 years ago, so vividly, even seeming to repeat conversations word for word. I also wonder how she managed to get all the patient's families to agree to have their family member's death story revealed in the ME's memoir. There was no mention anywhere of the names having been changed to protect the surviving family members, so I have to assume that all those names are real. Whatever the case, highly recommended to those with a strong stomach and a lack of anxiety regarding all the ways they and their loved ones could die.PopSugar 2015 Reading Challenge: A Memoir"

This is the place where Death delights to help the living.’I am completely, over the top, irrationally fond of books about medicine and/or the macabre and apparently have the extremely annoying habit of sharing choice trivia I pick up in these books, to the horror of my friends (so those of you that I see offline, brace yourselves for some really gruesome tidbits)This book takes the form of memoir, forensic crime investigation, pathology and weird-shit-people-die-from stories. The author seems to be quite an optimistic ray of sunshine in an industry that leans towards the dark and depressing. She conveys the stories at times with humor, at times with sadness but always with compassion and respect.“People ask me all the time, “What’s the worst way to die you’ve ever seen?” I assure them, “You don’t want to know.” She was right. I should not have wanted to know. All I can say is I will never eat lobster again, EVER.She is frank and outspoken about suicide and whether I agree with her views or not, I could sympathize with her. Having lived through her own fathers suicide at the age of 13 it clearly left scars still visible in her adult life.I heard about this author from a GR friend’s review and also knew beforehand that she was most famous for the 8 months she provided medical support in the 9/11 aftermath. What I did not expect was how much of an emotional read Chapter 10 would be for me. I have the utmost respect for each and every person who was involved in the First Responder teams and everyone else that assisted them. Every doctor has to cultivate compassion, to learn it and then practice it. To confront death every day, to see it for yourself, you have to love the living. Would I recommend this? YES absolutely, but then again I have an extreme bias towards books like this so perhaps my judgment cannot be trusted. Oh and a word of warning, if you are overly sensitive or have a weak stomach perhaps this book is not for you."

This is a non-fiction account of a woman's 2 year stint as a New York Medical Examiner, a profession I always found fascinating even though it gives me the heebie jeebies. The stories are of course gross at times (doing the autopsy of a construction worker who had a beam fall on his head). Sometimes the stats are informative and funny (if you die alone with your pet, the dog will lay by your body in mourning.... your cat? Will start eating you that day)I was enjoying this read as a light-hearted read (as much as the content would allow of course)... until I got to the 9/11 chapters. It didn't even occur to me as I was reading what year she had started being an ME, and then suddenly she started a chapter with September 11, 2001, and I went ""oh. crap""The last part of the book was really hard for me. I put it down several times because I nearly cried. I still relive that day so vividly and reading her account of that awful morning- then the task she had of trying to identify only body parts or small pieces of DNA just killed me. I obviously knew the carnage of that day but it just never occurred to me that they barely pulled bodies out of the World Trade Center, it was particles of people. Of the thousands of people killed, only 291 bodies in tact were found. There are still over 1,000 people who never had remains found. These chapters were just terrible and I found myself tearing up. If you're a fan of CSI, Law and Order, etc those type of shows I highly recommend this book. "

So if you've ever wondered what it's like to be a real forensic pathologist, here's your chance.Perhaps most notably, Melinek was in NYC during the Sept 11th attacks and was thus part of the grueling identification process, which often depended on DNA extracted from lone teeth as a means of identification. Her description of that process is nothing short of sobering. I'd never really thought much about the condition of the bodies. Interesting read and competently written."

Better yet, stay out of the car, and get some exercise. Watch your weight. If you’re a smoker stop right now. If you aren’t, don’t start. Guns put holes in people. Drugs are bad…Staying alive is mostly common sense.”This is intriguing story, told in a personable and conversational way, with black humour, personal insights, some interesting characters and plenty of passion. You can feel this doctor’s affinity for her role and the pride she has for revealing the cause of death, particularly in homicide cases where she “speaks on behalf of the dead.” This narrative is told with honesty that sometimes catches you unaware, particularly when the author discusses suicides and neonatal and child deaths; so sad. The life of an Medical Examiner is dissected and probed and all is revealed; the ugliness of death, the stench, the maggots, the sloughing skin, the reek of alcohol, the worry of infection but all is told is a calm and meaning full manner – this is not “voyeur of the dead” material, this is life (because death also affects the living), death and some deaths are good deaths and some… you really should not ask about.Throughout this narrative the authors’ voices carry you on a journey, you walk side by side with the rookie M.E and take lessons with her, then suddenly the world changes, the tone changes and it is chilling. The terrorist attacks on September 11, 2001 on the World Trade Centre towers and other threats shake up the world and have a very personal direct impact on Dr Melinek; she sees firsthand the destruction and violation of life. This section of the book is…overwhelmingly sad and horrific, the work of the first responders and the medical staff tasked with identifying the human remains is a mammoth and heartbreakingly poignant. All involved in the rescue and recovery deserve our thanks.This is truly a remarkable book told with respect and passion. "

I've always had a fascination for stuff that some people find a bit dark - true crime stories, biographies of serial killers, etc. So this book was right up my alley. Overall, the book does a good job of weaving together stories of a job that's rather morbid and dark with insights into the author's life and the lives of those she has a duty to - the dead and their families, who need answers and resolution. Some of the stories are weird, some of them will make you shake your head, some of them are just outright sad. For me, they reinforced the fact that I'm not cut out for this sort of work, as much as I enjoy reading about it. There is a chapter on the aftermath of 9/11 and I must warn who lived in New York or who was greatly impacted by the events that it is not an easy chapter to get through. Some may wish to skip it entirely. For me it was a reminder and more insight into just how truly awful that day was, and made my heart break all over again. I admire people like Judy, really - they do the work that most of us won't and can't do, and provide a vital service to our communities because of it. Books like this provide insight and remind us how important these sorts of jobs are, even if we never think about them."
255,1476727252,http://goodreads.com/user/show/13814810-ella,2,"Although this book provides an interesting look into the experiences of the author's forensic pathology residency, there are a number of aspects on which I would like to comment more critically. Most importantly, I was very unsettled by Melinek's simplistic conception of suicide and suicidal ideations. She repeatedly and violently asserts that suicide is ""selfish"". Despite Melinek's own early personal exposure to her father's suicide, she neither addresses the context nor engages with any of the complexity surrounding mental health issues. Claiming so assertively that ""suicide is a selfish act"" without considering the factors beyond the individual, the larger social institutions, and the failure of these systems further upstream, is, to me, a rather self-serving assessment. Rhetoric is powerful and I worry about the unintended consequences of Melinek's assertions on this subject. Looking more superficially, I disliked the book's organization. The timeline is established primarily through reference to her second pregnancy and to specific cases. However, the author bounces around considerably during the 2 year period in which the majority of the narrative occurs. This was more of an annoyance then it was seriously disruptive."
256,1476727252,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2079470-cheryl,4,"Dr. Judy Melinek has written a close up, personal account of the time she spent working as a forensic pathologist in the Office of the Chief Medical Examiner of New York City. While there, she performed autopsies on casualties of accidents, homicides, and suicides. In addition to performing autopsies, Dr. Melinek, in some cases, found it necessary and revealing to investigate scenes where bodies were discovered. Another part of her responsibilities involved counseling grieving family members as well as providing court testimony in cases of homicide.Dr. Melinek gives very graphic and detailed accounts of many of her cases. Most poignant and heartwrenching was the description of the work performed by forensic pathologists on the victims of the World Trade Center catastrophe on September 11, 2001, and the days and months afterward. Everyone who worked those cases was forever changed by the experience.Told with compassion and humility, Working Stiff is an unforgettable book.

So from that point of view this book is an obvious winner.However I did find the number of autopsies discussed made for quantity over quality giving the book a somewhat flippant feel (OK the subtitle clearly state 262 bodies so I was warned). Also the book had a lot of medical jargon, some of which was well explained, some not.The most poignant chapter was on the days after September 11, 2001 when the author and her colleagues were overwhelmed by an utter devastation they had never before encountered.Overall I felt the author was writing more for herself than for an audience. Many autopsies were left dangling (like Errico Lavagnino) where we do not know the cause of death. There were too many family and co-worker conversations which made the narrative unnecessarily auto-biographical. And at the risk of being politically incorrect I became irritated by reading about the author’s pregnancies."

She tells you what is the worst way to die...and it is BAD.She was also a part of the team that worked on cataloguing all of the World Trade Center remains from 9/11 and that section is the most haunting.

This is a personal account of Judy Melinek's two years working as a forensic pathologist with the Office of the Chief Medical Examiner in New York. I have found out information about decomposing bodies, burns and dismemberment that I did not know were possible. And given that Judy's time there encompassed September 11, 2001 and the scale that OCME had to deal with in deaths is beyond comprehension.As terrible as some of the accounts were, it was also a fitting tribute to the unsung heroes who give their time to answer questions for those who are still living and need resolution, justice or just consolation.If however, you find something like Agatha Christie or Midsummer Murders confronting and grisly then you may wish to steer clear."

Melinek has a way of delivering the story with both clinical observation and compassion. It's a very candid glimpse into the world of a medical examiner, and it's done very well. The chapter on 9/11 was chilling and heartbreaking, and hearing about it from the perspective from someone working with the massive amounts of casualties really made it feel like those days were happening all over again. Not for the faint of heart, but very well worth the time. And a must read for any writer considering a character in this field. "

The author describes things with compassion, and gives a good overview of various aspects of the job. Especially sobering was the work done after 9/11. Wow - I thought I had some ideas of what happened, but I never comprehended how truly horrible the aftermath was. I have even more respect for all of the heroes that kept working and dealing with all of that, as well as those who died. Anyway, it was a good book and well worth reading."

The idea of the smells, maggots, and questionable fluids...ah man eww, but the worse would be seeing children or pregnant women (which the author said were the hardest cases to work on).

Watch your weight. If you’re a smoker stop right now. If you aren’t, don’t start. Guns put holes in people. Drugs are bad. You know that yellow line on the subway platform? It's there for a reason. Staying alive, as it turns out, is mostly common sense.”This is the advice of Judy Melinek, the author of Working Stiff: Two Years, 262 Bodies, and the Making of a Medical Examiner, gleaned from her experience as an assistant medical examiner in New York City. From 2001 to 2003 Melinek performed hundreds of autopsies on the victims of homicides, suicides, accidents, natural diseases, therapeutic complications, and undetermined causes, that crossed her table. Melinek's very first post mortem involved the death of a young man, a heroin addict diagnosed with sickle-cell trait who died in hospital, her second an elderly man who sustained severe burns in a house fire, the third a pregnant woman, the victim of a hit and run. In general, each chapter of Working Stiff groups together cases by manner of death, detailing Melinek's examination of patients young and old, male and female, destitute and wealthy, and everything in between. The final chapters focus on the medical examiners office's role in the wake of the Twin Towers collapse on September 11, and the crash of American Airlines flight 587. The narrative is very readable, almost conversational in tone, and mostly free of the medical jargon one might expect. Melinek is at all times respectful but not humourless, sharing both professional perspective and personal observations. I do feel compelled to warn the unwary reader that this isn't a book for the squeamish with its graphic record of gruesome injury and detailed descriptions of the forensic autopsy process.What shines through is Melinek's passion and commitment to her job as she works to investigate and determine the cause and manner of death, comfort the bereaved, provide assistance to the justice system and ""speak for the dead"".Informative, entertaining and engaging Working Stiff is a fascinating account of the work of a medical examiner, well told by Judy Melinek and her husband T.J. Mitchell. * I gave the book an extra 1/2 star for Judy's admission she wears ""sensible shoes and a Medical Examiner windbreaker"" during her rare visits to crime scenes - not six inch stiletto's and Armani suits.

265,1476727252,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1740304-linda,4,"Dr. Melinek was originally studying to be a surgeon. But the grueling conditions of her surgical residency were taking their toll on her life and health, and the health of patients. Honestly, the description of what is expected of surgical residents scared the shit out of me. I know, we’ve seen it in TV dramas… no sleep, inhuman hours. But the reality is that nobody could possibly function well under those conditions, and our lives depend on surgeons being at their best. It makes me wonder if some regulation should be put into place similar to that for pilots and truck drivers. Anyway, her quitting her surgical residency for the more civilized routine of a medical examiner is what brings us to this book.Her descriptions of how she does her work, in conjunction with law enforcement, to determine cause of death… and more important, manner of death, was fascinating. Manner of death includes Homicide, Suicide, Accidental, Natural, and Undetermined. Dr. Melinek provides vivid anecdotes of each of these, and it’s very interesting. She does not come across as a morbid person, and in fact enjoys the work for the comfort it can provide the living.She tells us of having worked as a Medical Examiner in NYC through the 9/11 attacks and the subsequent anthrax scare, which is as overwhelming as you would imagine.There’s only one thing I was a little triggered by, and it has nothing to do with the gruesome descriptions of death and the methodical dissection of corpses. Dr. Melinek survived her own tragedy when her beloved father took his own life while she was a girl. And whenever she discusses her findings of suicide, there remains an understandable bitterness. It allows her to be more empathetic to other survivors, which is wonderful. But her vehement assertion that all people who commit suicide are selfish hit me wrong. I am also the survivor of a loved one who took her own life, though not a parent. My own conclusion is that none of us can know the pain and suffering that another person endures. And they deserve compassion more than derision. I’m not condemning her perspective as less valid than mine, it just made it a little hard for me to read at points.3.67 stars"

This would normally go on my hypothetical list of jobs I never knew I didn't want, except I did know I wouldn't want this job. I just love reading about it. 'Jobs I Only Want to Read About'?Erm. Anyway. Melinek turned from surgery to forensic pathology after realising that both career paths would let her cut up bodies but pathology would also let her get more than three hours of sleep (and the patients wouldn't argue). Here she details cases she saw during her two years in New York City, where she learned the ropes. Suicides and overdoses—so many overdoses—and accidents and medical errors. More overdoses. Murders. Early in her career but late in the book, victims of 9/11.Melinek displays a fair amount of glee in discussing some of the more interesting cases—I rather think she and Mary Roach would get along—while managing to remain respectful of the individuals (deceased and family) involved. She's descriptive enough that I actually took a break mid-book to read something lighter, which I don't usually feel the need to do...I recommend reading this, but not while eating!Towards the end of the book, Melinek talks about the attacks on the World Trade Center in 2001, when she'd been working as a medical examiner for only a few months. To me it was the strongest section of the book—it has the most consistent storyline of the book, and although that (and the American Airlines crash of November 2001) is the most hectic, case-after-case-body-after-body time she describes, in some ways it's the least hectic section of the book—more time taken to slow down and connect her personal experience with her professional experience. Up to that point I was enjoying the stories but finding the transitions somewhat lacking (or perhaps too good, as she segued neatly from body to body to body), but the pieces really fell into place for me later on in the book.I'll never be a doctor, much less a medical examiner, and I'm so many kinds of okay with that. But a reader of books like this? Yes please."

I wouldn't recommend it to the squeamish and, as others have noted, she is particularly opinionated about suicide and tends to come across as highly unsympathetic.2 stars out of 5.

The only issue I had was that there were so many stories - bodies - and that the story itself was too fragmented. Other than this, absolutely a fascinating read. "
269,1476727252,http://goodreads.com/user/show/678841-kim,4,"Working Stiff discusses Judy Melinek's two years working for the New York City OCME (Office of the Chief Medical Examiner), which began in 2001 and ended in 2002. Although the WTC attack happened only six weeks after she began work and the plane crash in Queens four weeks after that, the book is not about these two disasters but her experience and teachings from the autopsies of ""regular"" New Yorkers, and all the different ways that they die.I found the subject matter fascinating. This sort of pathology is something I had considered and briefly, in medical school, I spent time in the ME's office. I was immediately repelled by the odor of decomposition. ""You get used to it,"" was what the medical examiners and detectives told me, but I was pretty sure that wasn't true. Years later, I know that there are certain things we learn to put up with in our line of work and others that just strain our personal limits. So - kudos to Judy Melinek and others like her who are able to handle the stench of decomposition when it is present and do this job. On the plus side: Melinek does an incredible job documenting how ordinary and not-so-ordinary people die, what happens to our bodies after we die, and how medical examiners piece together our last hours and moments of life. The scientific and technical details are amazing. She discusses numerous cases - murders and natural causes, ""therapeutic complications"" (as a physician, I really like that), innumerable accidental deaths, suicides. As she states in the beginning of the book, ""Staying alive, as it turns out, is mostly common sense."" So true.Like everyone else old enough to pay attention, I remember where I was on September 11, 2001; and exactly what I was doing when I found out what was going on; and exactly what I was doing when those towers fell. Years later it is still something that brings me to tears: the horror, the fear, the magnitude of loss. The people who gave of themselves to save others and lost their own lives as a consequence. Melinek provides an entirely fresh, gruesome, devastating look at an old story which is both horrifying (""an X-ray had revealed a woman's severed hand, complete with wedding ring, entirely embedded within the chest wall of a man's intact torso"") and educational (""the individual pieces of recovered remains numbered 19,956""). I admit I cried for these people and their families, and for the people who worked to identify them after the fact. I don't know how you wrap your head around that and emerge intact, although I suppose it's pretty much like anything else: one foot in front of the other until it's far enough behind you.On the downside: Another reviewer has mentioned the lack of an index, which I thoroughly agree with. I own an e-book, so it's moderately easier to find things, but this is still a lack. I agree that the book lacks an ""arc,"" which makes it difficult to read at times. I really enjoyed it, but I read the individual vignettes - because that is mostly what they are - over many months. I am not sure if the book would have been better if Melinek had begun at the beginning of the two years and used her personal growth as a story arc or if this was the best option if she did not want the entire book dominated by 9/11. While I understand her wish to make the book about forensics and not about 9/11, I think the lack of an arc is a detriment.However, overall this is an interesting - if not super quick - read. I really enjoyed it and for anyone looking to learn a little more about this subject it is a worthwhile read."

I don't read much non-fiction but I have a fascination with death and what happens to your body after you die. That's why I picked this up. Maybe it's because we don't really talk about it as a society. It's too taboo or gross or a combination of both I don't know.This book covers the first year of Dr. Melinek's fellowship in NYC as a medical examiner. She doesn't go through all 262 cases but picks highlights to show was is involved in the different types of death. She does a really good job of breaking down all the medical jargon into laymen's terms without sounding condescending. Part of an MEs training is to learn how to do that since they deal with grieving family members. Each case is its own little story and I was surprised at how much detective work an ME actually does. If there is no criminal homicide for the police to investigate (and only about 30% of autopsy cases are criminal in nature) it is up to the ME to piece together what happened and not just physically. They have to understand the circumstances surrounding the death and that involves some legwork.The final section of the book is about 9/11. Melinek was only 9 weeks into her fellowship when this happened. I've heard a lot of stories about the brave work of the firefighters and police on that day but I haven't heard anything about the MEs. The only medical stories I've heard were about all the doctors and nurses waiting at the hospitals for the wounded to come in and how devastated they were when only a fraction of the number expected showed up. Now imagine what all the MEs had to go through. It was heartbreaking and interesting at the same time. They were able to identify approximately half of those that died that day. Considering what they had to work with it's pretty amazing.If you have any interest in this area I highly recommend picking up this book."

I am a big fan of crime novels, and with a boyfriend in the police, crime and murder is definitely something that interests me. This book goes into detail about how many different ways people die on an everyday occurrence, while going into detail her checklist of things that she does when doing a post mortem. This book answered every curiosity I had about post mortems and what exactly it is they do with a body. It also showed me how unexpected and random life can be; some of the accidents and medical mistakes that caused deaths throughout this really did make me think. Another thing I really appreciated is how she has shown that women can have the big career and still have a home life; something I think more women need to hear, too often we're told there's a choice and I think Melinek proved that you can indeed have both.

So don't jaywalk...You know that yellow line on the subway platform? It's there for a reason. Staying alive, as it turns out, is mostly common sense. Judy MelinekAfter reading this book I really wish I had become a medical examiner...weird I know ;-) It was fascinating. The one thing that would probably make me quit that job though would be the smell of a decomposing body...It hits you--an assault, not a scent. You flinch, heave back in revulsion. It invades your throat, assails your taste buds, even stings your eyes.The maggot talk just validated my wish to be immediately sealed in a metal drawer in a mausoleum after I die. I also knew there had to be a reason I'm allergic to cats...they will eat you immediately after you die. Whereas dogs will just stay by you for days on end. The last quarter of this book was completely spellbinding, in my opinion. She was a NYC Medical Examiner on 9/11. She heard and saw that low flying jetliner when she was hurrying to work that morning. It is even more horrific through her eyes than what I heard and saw on the news. She tagged body pieces (and the descriptions of their condition were awful)...many refrigerated tractor trailers' worth of body parts, a small number of intact bodies.The limbs had all been amputated. The torso was transected below the navel. The remains were entirely black--burned and covered in soot. The head...the head wasn't recognizable as a head, except that it had hair and was attached to the neck. The smell of jet fuel was so strong it made me dizzy. I could tell just by looking at the open body bag that this person had been mashed, burned, dropped from a height, and slashed by sharp forces. I had seen people killed by subway trains and speeding cars, run over by trucks, crushed by industrial equipment, fallen from great heights, burned, and battered--but never all at the same time.I examined the surface of the leg--and came across something that made me stare. Fragments of a personal bank check, complete with routing number and a partially legible name, were embedded under the skin, buried deep in the muscle tissue....an X-ray had revealed a woman's severed hand, complete with wedding ring, entirely embedded inside the chest wall of a man's intact torso.This quote from the Chief Medical Examiner at the time is haunting: People were jumping or falling from the buildings. They seemed to take forever to fall, tumbling through the air. They would hit the pavement with a loud thud--very loud--and bounce, and land again. The sounds of the bodies hitting the ground echoed off the buildings, one after another, over and over. I've added some great quotes from this book...hopefully they will show below this review. "
274,1476727252,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4968643-david,2,"Published a dozen years after Dr. Melinek’s two year stint in the NYC Office of the Chief Medical Examiner the cases and experiences she describes are flat, lifeless and incomplete. With all of that time between the events and the publishing of the book the authors should have conducted some degree of research to round out the stories of the cadavers she autopsied. The frequent quoted conversations had me wondering how accurate the dialogue was. And how could stories from the NYC medical examiner’s be so uninteresting?The book started off strongly and Dr. Melinek's perspective on suicide was powerful and interesting. However the book lost its unique voice soon thereafter. The stories simply weren’t compelling and there were hints of smugness, impatience and pettiness that made her seem less nice than the image she was going for (she took some condescending cheap shots at peoples’ appearances that had nothing to do with the stories at hand - the woman with the nose job, the fat guy, just to name two instances).As to the autopsies there are plenty of the sickening descriptions you might expect. Sometimes the authors seemed to rely on technical language with little explanation to create a ‘wow’ factor. If you have pet cats or are expecting to have surgery in the near future you might want to skip this one for either of those reasons alone.One final complaint: the authors played up the wittiness of Dr. Hirsch’s epigrams as if he were some magical combination of Confucius and Henny Youngman. Unfortunately the many decade old quotes fell far short of that mark. Maybe they simply forgot his precise quotes after all of those years."

She took time off from work to have a baby and decided to change her specialty and become a pathologist. She attended UCLA for her pathology and forensic training and was accepted at the NYC Medical Examiner’s Office for her one-year forensic residency training program. After she completed the program she stayed on in the medical examiner’s office for another one-year residency program in forensic neuropathology.Dr. Melinek was only two months into her residency when the September 11 terrorist attack happened. She provides a firsthand account of events at the medical examiner’s office of that fateful event. She also covers the anthrax bio-terrorism attack in NYC and the crash of American Airlines flight 587. As the residency program was two years she also got to cover the routine murders, suicides and accidents normally dealt with by the medical examiner. Dr. Melinek reveals the day to day life of a forensic pathologist. She also provides some background information, for example: how a death certificate is filled out and why; what constitutes accidental death or homicide and so on. I found the information on the type of bullets and their effect on the body interesting as well as the general information of ballistics. Overall a most fascinating memoir.Dr. Melinek wrote the book with her husband, T. J. Mitchell. They met at Harvard where he was an English major. He works as a screenwriter and script editor.Tanya Eby does a good job narrating the book. Eby is a voice over artist and an award winning audiobook narrator."

I like Melinek's voice and style of writing and her irreverent way of looking at death. I love the way she describes her reaction to shows featuring characters doing her job - the fact that they go to every crime scene, the women wear their good high-heeled shoes, they actually help with the investigation. From now on CSI will be light-hearted crime fiction, in the same league as those 'cosy mysteries' that feature little old lady super-sleuths, not a realistic look into the life of a medical examiner. I can see the irony and humour in some of the causes of death that she sees (although, not when contemplating my own future). For example, an unfortunate worker having his morning coffee gets hit in the head by a giant crane, a crane so large that he is practically crumpled into the ground like an aluminium can. Although, at the same time reading medical nonfiction does hit a bit close to home for someone only weeks away from having major surgery to remove a 9 x 7 cm suspicious mass, along with 25% of her liver. Maybe I shouldn't be reading this right now... So far I'm enjoying it despite the negative thoughts it's bringing up. To be continued...12/3 - Not as bad as I thought it was going to be re bringing up disturbing thoughts, except for one of the later chapters focussing on deaths due to 'medical misadventures' or 'therapeutic complications' as Melinek puts it - when a patient dies during non-emergent surgery due to surgeon error. Reading about the ordeal Melinek and her fellow medical examiners went through in the aftermath of September 11 was a little tough, even for someone who's never been to New York - body bags becoming body part bags becoming body bit bags (a lump of skin, a piece of an intestine) and thinking of all the families who don't KNOW what happened to their father, mother, son, daughter. That was really sad. I do wonder how she remembered the details of all these cases, from 14 years ago, so vividly, even seeming to repeat conversations word for word. I also wonder how she managed to get all the patient's families to agree to have their family member's death story revealed in the ME's memoir. There was no mention anywhere of the names having been changed to protect the surviving family members, so I have to assume that all those names are real. Whatever the case, highly recommended to those with a strong stomach and a lack of anxiety regarding all the ways they and their loved ones could die.PopSugar 2015 Reading Challenge: A Memoir"

This is the place where Death delights to help the living.’I am completely, over the top, irrationally fond of books about medicine and/or the macabre and apparently have the extremely annoying habit of sharing choice trivia I pick up in these books, to the horror of my friends (so those of you that I see offline, brace yourselves for some really gruesome tidbits)This book takes the form of memoir, forensic crime investigation, pathology and weird-shit-people-die-from stories. The author seems to be quite an optimistic ray of sunshine in an industry that leans towards the dark and depressing. She conveys the stories at times with humor, at times with sadness but always with compassion and respect.“People ask me all the time, “What’s the worst way to die you’ve ever seen?” I assure them, “You don’t want to know.” She was right. I should not have wanted to know. All I can say is I will never eat lobster again, EVER.She is frank and outspoken about suicide and whether I agree with her views or not, I could sympathize with her. Having lived through her own fathers suicide at the age of 13 it clearly left scars still visible in her adult life.I heard about this author from a GR friend’s review and also knew beforehand that she was most famous for the 8 months she provided medical support in the 9/11 aftermath. What I did not expect was how much of an emotional read Chapter 10 would be for me. I have the utmost respect for each and every person who was involved in the First Responder teams and everyone else that assisted them. Every doctor has to cultivate compassion, to learn it and then practice it. To confront death every day, to see it for yourself, you have to love the living. Would I recommend this? YES absolutely, but then again I have an extreme bias towards books like this so perhaps my judgment cannot be trusted. Oh and a word of warning, if you are overly sensitive or have a weak stomach perhaps this book is not for you."

Sometimes the stats are informative and funny (if you die alone with your pet, the dog will lay by your body in mourning.... your cat? Will start eating you that day)I was enjoying this read as a light-hearted read (as much as the content would allow of course)... until I got to the 9/11 chapters. It didn't even occur to me as I was reading what year she had started being an ME, and then suddenly she started a chapter with September 11, 2001, and I went ""oh. crap""The last part of the book was really hard for me. I put it down several times because I nearly cried. I still relive that day so vividly and reading her account of that awful morning- then the task she had of trying to identify only body parts or small pieces of DNA just killed me. I obviously knew the carnage of that day but it just never occurred to me that they barely pulled bodies out of the World Trade Center, it was particles of people. Of the thousands of people killed, only 291 bodies in tact were found. There are still over 1,000 people who never had remains found. These chapters were just terrible and I found myself tearing up.

Better yet, stay out of the car, and get some exercise. Watch your weight. If you’re a smoker stop right now. If you aren’t, don’t start. Guns put holes in people. Drugs are bad…Staying alive is mostly common sense.”This is intriguing story, told in a personable and conversational way, with black humour, personal insights, some interesting characters and plenty of passion. You can feel this doctor’s affinity for her role and the pride she has for revealing the cause of death, particularly in homicide cases where she “speaks on behalf of the dead.” This narrative is told with honesty that sometimes catches you unaware, particularly when the author discusses suicides and neonatal and child deaths; so sad. The life of an Medical Examiner is dissected and probed and all is revealed; the ugliness of death, the stench, the maggots, the sloughing skin, the reek of alcohol, the worry of infection but all is told is a calm and meaning full manner – this is not “voyeur of the dead” material, this is life (because death also affects the living), death and some deaths are good deaths and some… you really should not ask about.Throughout this narrative the authors’ voices carry you on a journey, you walk side by side with the rookie M.E and take lessons with her, then suddenly the world changes, the tone changes and it is chilling. The terrorist attacks on September 11, 2001 on the World Trade Centre towers and other threats shake up the world and have a very personal direct impact on Dr Melinek; she sees firsthand the destruction and violation of life. This section of the book is…overwhelmingly sad and horrific, the work of the first responders and the medical staff tasked with identifying the human remains is a mammoth and heartbreakingly poignant. All involved in the rescue and recovery deserve our thanks.This is truly a remarkable book told with respect and passion. "
284,1476727252,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3067217-kerri-book-hoarder,4,"This book isn't for those with a weak stomach, and, well - it should probably be avoided if you're eating, too. I've always had a fascination for stuff that some people find a bit dark - true crime stories, biographies of serial killers, etc. So this book was right up my alley. Overall, the book does a good job of weaving together stories of a job that's rather morbid and dark with insights into the author's life and the lives of those she has a duty to - the dead and their families, who need answers and resolution. Some of the stories are weird, some of them will make you shake your head, some of them are just outright sad. For me, they reinforced the fact that I'm not cut out for this sort of work, as much as I enjoy reading about it. There is a chapter on the aftermath of 9/11 and I must warn who lived in New York or who was greatly impacted by the events that it is not an easy chapter to get through. Some may wish to skip it entirely. For me it was a reminder and more insight into just how truly awful that day was, and made my heart break all over again. I admire people like Judy, really - they do the work that most of us won't and can't do, and provide a vital service to our communities because of it. Books like this provide insight and remind us how important these sorts of jobs are, even if we never think about them."
285,1476727252,http://goodreads.com/user/show/13814810-ella,2,"Although this book provides an interesting look into the experiences of the author's forensic pathology residency, there are a number of aspects on which I would like to comment more critically. Most importantly, I was very unsettled by Melinek's simplistic conception of suicide and suicidal ideations. She repeatedly and violently asserts that suicide is ""selfish"". Despite Melinek's own early personal exposure to her father's suicide, she neither addresses the context nor engages with any of the complexity surrounding mental health issues. Claiming so assertively that ""suicide is a selfish act"" without considering the factors beyond the individual, the larger social institutions, and the failure of these systems further upstream, is, to me, a rather self-serving assessment. Rhetoric is powerful and I worry about the unintended consequences of Melinek's assertions on this subject. Looking more superficially, I disliked the book's organization. The timeline is established primarily through reference to her second pregnancy and to specific cases. However, the author bounces around considerably during the 2 year period in which the majority of the narrative occurs. This was more of an annoyance then it was seriously disruptive."
286,1476727252,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2079470-cheryl,4,"Dr. Judy Melinek has written a close up, personal account of the time she spent working as a forensic pathologist in the Office of the Chief Medical Examiner of New York City. While there, she performed autopsies on casualties of accidents, homicides, and suicides. In addition to performing autopsies, Dr. Melinek, in some cases, found it necessary and revealing to investigate scenes where bodies were discovered. Another part of her responsibilities involved counseling grieving family members as well as providing court testimony in cases of homicide.Dr. Melinek gives very graphic and detailed accounts of many of her cases. Most poignant and heartwrenching was the description of the work performed by forensic pathologists on the victims of the World Trade Center catastrophe on September 11, 2001, and the days and months afterward. Everyone who worked those cases was forever changed by the experience.Told with compassion and humility, Working Stiff is an unforgettable book. However, it may not appeal to everyone because of the very graphic and gruesome detail included in the casework. "
287,1476727252,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1484029-mikey-b,4,"Obviously the topic of forensics is always of interest; albeit a somewhat macabre one. So from that point of view this book is an obvious winner.However I did find the number of autopsies discussed made for quantity over quality giving the book a somewhat flippant feel (OK the subtitle clearly state 262 bodies so I was warned). Also the book had a lot of medical jargon, some of which was well explained, some not.The most poignant chapter was on the days after September 11, 2001 when the author and her colleagues were overwhelmed by an utter devastation they had never before encountered.Overall I felt the author was writing more for herself than for an audience. Many autopsies were left dangling (like Errico Lavagnino) where we do not know the cause of death. There were too many family and co-worker conversations which made the narrative unnecessarily auto-biographical. And at the risk of being politically incorrect I became irritated by reading about the author’s pregnancies."
288,1476727252,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3772692-jenny-bunting,4,"I wasn't so sure about this memoir when I first started it. It was sciency and then I ended up listening to a huge chunk today to finish and it was AMAZING.It has all the disgusting, gory details that you would hope for. There's obscure diagnoses and freak accidents. There were times I would say ""UGH"" out loud while working and listening. She tells you what is the worst way to die...and it is BAD.She was also a part of the team that worked on cataloguing all of the World Trade Center remains from 9/11 and that section is the most haunting. This is what makes it special and a must read for anyone who is interested in dead body memoirs/non-fiction.If you enjoyed Smoke Gets in Your Eyes and Stiff, you will most definitely like this memoir. If anyone knows of similar memoirs, please suggest them or recommend them to me."
289,1476727252,http://goodreads.com/user/show/25379212-kylie-h,4,"This book is gruesome, mind bogglingly horrific and absolutely true! That is what I had to keep reminding myself. This is a personal account of Judy Melinek's two years working as a forensic pathologist with the Office of the Chief Medical Examiner in New York. I have found out information about decomposing bodies, burns and dismemberment that I did not know were possible. And given that Judy's time there encompassed September 11, 2001 and the scale that OCME had to deal with in deaths is beyond comprehension.As terrible as some of the accounts were, it was also a fitting tribute to the unsung heroes who give their time to answer questions for those who are still living and need resolution, justice or just consolation.If however, you find something like Agatha Christie or Midsummer Murders confronting and grisly then you may wish to steer clear."
290,1476727252,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5500554-stacy-green,4,"I started this book for research but it quickly became much more than that. Melinek has a way of delivering the story with both clinical observation and compassion. It's a very candid glimpse into the world of a medical examiner, and it's done very well. The chapter on 9/11 was chilling and heartbreaking, and hearing about it from the perspective from someone working with the massive amounts of casualties really made it feel like those days were happening all over again. Not for the faint of heart, but very well worth the time. And a must read for any writer considering a character in this field. "
291,1476727252,http://goodreads.com/user/show/30478876-fiona,5,"A long car trip gave me the time I needed to read this book, after buying it yesterday at a little book shop that is closing down. :-(It is a great book if you are interested in forensic medicine, death, and curious about the many ways people can die.It's graphic at times, but not overly so, and very well worded, so that nothing is beyond the 'everyday person' but, it is also not written in a way that is condenscending to those of us who are not qualified in this field.A very interesting biography, and I rate it highly.Thank you, Dr Judy Melinek for sharing this part of your life with us. "
292,1476727252,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5096743-suzanne,4,"It takes a strong person to be a forensic pathologist, and I was really fascinated to learn a bit more about what the job entails. The author describes things with compassion, and gives a good overview of various aspects of the job. Especially sobering was the work done after 9/11. Wow - I thought I had some ideas of what happened, but I never comprehended how truly horrible the aftermath was. I have even more respect for all of the heroes that kept working and dealing with all of that, as well as those who died. Anyway, it was a good book and well worth reading."
293,1476727252,http://goodreads.com/user/show/98177655-grandma,4,"I can’t imagine looking at corpses on a daily basis. The idea of the smells, maggots, and questionable fluids...ah man eww, but the worse would be seeing children or pregnant women (which the author said were the hardest cases to work on). The book was packed with interesting facts about how medical examiners figure out how people died. If you love crime shows like CSI or SVU this book is perfect for you!"

Staying alive, as it turns out, is mostly common sense.”This is the advice of Judy Melinek, the author of Working Stiff: Two Years, 262 Bodies, and the Making of a Medical Examiner, gleaned from her experience as an assistant medical examiner in New York City. From 2001 to 2003 Melinek performed hundreds of autopsies on the victims of homicides, suicides, accidents, natural diseases, therapeutic complications, and undetermined causes, that crossed her table. Melinek's very first post mortem involved the death of a young man, a heroin addict diagnosed with sickle-cell trait who died in hospital, her second an elderly man who sustained severe burns in a house fire, the third a pregnant woman, the victim of a hit and run. In general, each chapter of Working Stiff groups together cases by manner of death, detailing Melinek's examination of patients young and old, male and female, destitute and wealthy, and everything in between. The final chapters focus on the medical examiners office's role in the wake of the Twin Towers collapse on September 11, and the crash of American Airlines flight 587. The narrative is very readable, almost conversational in tone, and mostly free of the medical jargon one might expect. Melinek is at all times respectful but not humourless, sharing both professional perspective and personal observations. I do feel compelled to warn the unwary reader that this isn't a book for the squeamish with its graphic record of gruesome injury and detailed descriptions of the forensic autopsy process.What shines through is Melinek's passion and commitment to her job as she works to investigate and determine the cause and manner of death, comfort the bereaved, provide assistance to the justice system and ""speak for the dead"".Informative, entertaining and engaging Working Stiff is a fascinating account of the work of a medical examiner, well told by Judy Melinek and her husband T.J. Mitchell. * I gave the book an extra 1/2 star for Judy's admission she wears ""sensible shoes and a Medical Examiner windbreaker"" during her rare visits to crime scenes - not six inch stiletto's and Armani suits. "
295,1476727252,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1740304-linda,4,"Dr. Melinek was originally studying to be a surgeon. But the grueling conditions of her surgical residency were taking their toll on her life and health, and the health of patients. Honestly, the description of what is expected of surgical residents scared the shit out of me. I know, we’ve seen it in TV dramas… no sleep, inhuman hours. But the reality is that nobody could possibly function well under those conditions, and our lives depend on surgeons being at their best. It makes me wonder if some regulation should be put into place similar to that for pilots and truck drivers. Anyway, her quitting her surgical residency for the more civilized routine of a medical examiner is what brings us to this book.Her descriptions of how she does her work, in conjunction with law enforcement, to determine cause of death… and more important, manner of death, was fascinating. Manner of death includes Homicide, Suicide, Accidental, Natural, and Undetermined. Dr. Melinek provides vivid anecdotes of each of these, and it’s very interesting. She does not come across as a morbid person, and in fact enjoys the work for the comfort it can provide the living.She tells us of having worked as a Medical Examiner in NYC through the 9/11 attacks and the subsequent anthrax scare, which is as overwhelming as you would imagine.There’s only one thing I was a little triggered by, and it has nothing to do with the gruesome descriptions of death and the methodical dissection of corpses. Dr. Melinek survived her own tragedy when her beloved father took his own life while she was a girl. And whenever she discusses her findings of suicide, there remains an understandable bitterness. It allows her to be more empathetic to other survivors, which is wonderful. But her vehement assertion that all people who commit suicide are selfish hit me wrong. I am also the survivor of a loved one who took her own life, though not a parent. My own conclusion is that none of us can know the pain and suffering that another person endures. And they deserve compassion more than derision. I’m not condemning her perspective as less valid than mine, it just made it a little hard for me to read at points.3.67 stars"
296,1476727252,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4089241-liralen,4,"I'm stumped. This would normally go on my hypothetical list of jobs I never knew I didn't want, except I did know I wouldn't want this job. I just love reading about it. 'Jobs I Only Want to Read About'?Erm. Anyway. Melinek turned from surgery to forensic pathology after realising that both career paths would let her cut up bodies but pathology would also let her get more than three hours of sleep (and the patients wouldn't argue). Here she details cases she saw during her two years in New York City, where she learned the ropes. Suicides and overdoses—so many overdoses—and accidents and medical errors. More overdoses. Murders. Early in her career but late in the book, victims of 9/11.Melinek displays a fair amount of glee in discussing some of the more interesting cases—I rather think she and Mary Roach would get along—while managing to remain respectful of the individuals (deceased and family) involved. She's descriptive enough that I actually took a break mid-book to read something lighter, which I don't usually feel the need to do...I recommend reading this, but not while eating!Towards the end of the book, Melinek talks about the attacks on the World Trade Center in 2001, when she'd been working as a medical examiner for only a few months. To me it was the strongest section of the book—it has the most consistent storyline of the book, and although that (and the American Airlines crash of November 2001) is the most hectic, case-after-case-body-after-body time she describes, in some ways it's the least hectic section of the book—more time taken to slow down and connect her personal experience with her professional experience. Up to that point I was enjoying the stories but finding the transitions somewhat lacking (or perhaps too good, as she segued neatly from body to body to body), but the pieces really fell into place for me later on in the book.I'll never be a doctor, much less a medical examiner, and I'm so many kinds of okay with that. But a reader of books like this? Yes please."
297,1476727252,http://goodreads.com/user/show/31467977-tom-quinn,2,"One part breezy autobiography, two parts clinical anatomy discussion, one part morality lecture. I imagine it was cathartic for the writer to share, but a lot of this book made me squirm with discomfort. Like the accidents whose victims the author attended to, morbid curiousity prevented me from looking away. I wouldn't recommend it to the squeamish and, as others have noted, she is particularly opinionated about suicide and tends to come across as highly unsympathetic.2 stars out of 5. It grows very repetitive very quickly and I began skimming about halfway through."
298,1476727252,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5935491-tanja-berg,3,"I have a thing for the grisly and I love science, so I thought this would be right up my alley. In many ways it was. The only issue I had was that there were so many stories - bodies - and that the story itself was too fragmented. Other than this, absolutely a fascinating read. "
299,1476727252,http://goodreads.com/user/show/678841-kim,4,"Working Stiff discusses Judy Melinek's two years working for the New York City OCME (Office of the Chief Medical Examiner), which began in 2001 and ended in 2002. Although the WTC attack happened only six weeks after she began work and the plane crash in Queens four weeks after that, the book is not about these two disasters but her experience and teachings from the autopsies of ""regular"" New Yorkers, and all the different ways that they die.I found the subject matter fascinating. This sort of pathology is something I had considered and briefly, in medical school, I spent time in the ME's office. I was immediately repelled by the odor of decomposition. ""You get used to it,"" was what the medical examiners and detectives told me, but I was pretty sure that wasn't true. Years later, I know that there are certain things we learn to put up with in our line of work and others that just strain our personal limits. So - kudos to Judy Melinek and others like her who are able to handle the stench of decomposition when it is present and do this job. On the plus side: Melinek does an incredible job documenting how ordinary and not-so-ordinary people die, what happens to our bodies after we die, and how medical examiners piece together our last hours and moments of life. The scientific and technical details are amazing. She discusses numerous cases - murders and natural causes, ""therapeutic complications"" (as a physician, I really like that), innumerable accidental deaths, suicides. As she states in the beginning of the book, ""Staying alive, as it turns out, is mostly common sense."" So true.Like everyone else old enough to pay attention, I remember where I was on September 11, 2001; and exactly what I was doing when I found out what was going on; and exactly what I was doing when those towers fell. Years later it is still something that brings me to tears: the horror, the fear, the magnitude of loss. The people who gave of themselves to save others and lost their own lives as a consequence. Melinek provides an entirely fresh, gruesome, devastating look at an old story which is both horrifying (""an X-ray had revealed a woman's severed hand, complete with wedding ring, entirely embedded within the chest wall of a man's intact torso"") and educational (""the individual pieces of recovered remains numbered 19,956""). I admit I cried for these people and their families, and for the people who worked to identify them after the fact. I don't know how you wrap your head around that and emerge intact, although I suppose it's pretty much like anything else: one foot in front of the other until it's far enough behind you.On the downside: Another reviewer has mentioned the lack of an index, which I thoroughly agree with. I own an e-book, so it's moderately easier to find things, but this is still a lack. I agree that the book lacks an ""arc,"" which makes it difficult to read at times. I really enjoyed it, but I read the individual vignettes - because that is mostly what they are - over many months. I am not sure if the book would have been better if Melinek had begun at the beginning of the two years and used her personal growth as a story arc or if this was the best option if she did not want the entire book dominated by 9/11. While I understand her wish to make the book about forensics and not about 9/11, I think the lack of an arc is a detriment.However, overall this is an interesting - if not super quick - read. I really enjoyed it and for anyone looking to learn a little more about this subject it is a worthwhile read."
