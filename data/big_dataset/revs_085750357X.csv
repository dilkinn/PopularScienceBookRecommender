An explicit description has been given of a few of the pixels in the holographic plate at the future boundary of the horizon.

A complete description of the holographic plate and resolution of the information paradox remains an open challenge, which we have presented new and concrete tools to address.‚Äù If you're into Physics, read the rest of the review elsewhere."

2,085750357X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/19742661-nemo,5,"this is wonderful as an introduction to hawking's work, or as a reminder for people who read a brief history of time a while ago and would like to be reminded of the basic concepts. wouldn't recommend it for students of physics (just go straight for brief history) but excellent for the layperson. if you don't know much about hawking's work or quantum physics/astrophysics in general i'd definitely say read this before anything else.

3,085750357X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3569723-ammar,4,"This is the transcript of the two 2016 Reith Lectures, that Stephen Hawking delivered on the topic of Black Holes. The illustration and comments are very helpful and they give the reader a wider understanding about this topic.The book is short, but intense. Full of information about Black Holes, their history and various theories and hypothesis about their formation, characteristics, and purpose. Interesting read for anyone interested in Science, Physics, the Universe or just want to be a cool geek."
4,085750357X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/45226134-omar-fadel,4,"A great beginner's guide to Black Holes. The illustrations were very useful as well as David Shukman's notes between the lines. While reading these two lectures, I was pausing at some points to watch a few scenes of the movie Interstellar in which the scientist characters explain several informations about Black Holes and the universe's dimensions in order to get a clearer understanding. However, I was surprised by his mentioning the movie. Next Stephen Hawking read: A Brief History of Time."
5,085750357X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/41690792-muthuvel,2,"A very brief history of black holes precisely. All the information and work sparsely depicted in the book for his research in black holes like super translations, quantum gravity theory are explained more clearly and profound enough in his books The Grand Design and The Universe in a Nutshell. Just a recent lecture of the physicist who presented this publicly at Stockholm's Nordic Institute for Theoretical Physics last August (2015).The tone of the book is way more opinionated than providing ample coherent information about Black holes. For instance, "" The conclusion: My message here, then, is that black holes aren‚Äôt as black as they are painted. They are not the eternal prisons once envisaged. Things can get out of a black hole, both in this universe and possibly to another. So, if you feel you are in a black hole, don‚Äôt give up: there is a way out!""  but the issue is its still a theoretical hypothesis anyway. It's still a theory anyway. Hawking was the one who came up with this idea of Hawking radiation in 70s and following decades he switched it from ditching and picking it up again and again. The answer to quest might be 50/50 and we are not yet there. This small book is an opinion/prediction of his upon black holes. Try Universe in a Nutshell, it will give more ideas on these stuffs with relevant contexts.The issue with today's small pop science books is that they don't intend to provide coherent information about something but for commodifying the simplified works of complex minds to the public under the pretext of preaching that knowing the name of something is intelligent rather knowing about something and being able to clearly understand it. It could have been a pamphlet but they made it a book with a lot of empty spaces and charging like it's worth ‚Çπ100 (5 US dollars in purchasing power parity).A friend of mine defended that these kind of books really are the only way to get to know things for common people. I believe its right, Common people are too bothered with too many things. That's why these kind of books become bestsellers.At the same time, there are free sources from MIT, Stanford to get more detail (and even a 12min youtube video better than this book, in my opinion) but common people like us will have to pay the price until we see the possibilities (at the same time, reliability) of various sources of knowledge."

9,085750357X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7650924-varun,4,"I must admit that I am attracted to black holes if not by their immense gravitational power then by the mysticism that surrounds their existence and functioning. These powerful, enormous cosmic entities, these mysterious objects have so much happening within and around them that even a thousand theoretical papers are not enough to capture the nuances of their existence. And this beautiful little book with Hawking's lectures on black holes with some added comments by the journalist does provide some dew drops of knowledge to the reader. Simplistic language and to the point narration makes it a short impactful read. The illustrations in there are funny, but I was interested in the text. A couple of mind-blowing concepts in there such as alternate histories are something I would want to read more about.My reaction after reading this book:"

13,085750357X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/73828522-furkan,5,this is the one of the best books i have ever read.when i first looked at the name of book and author i thought it's gonna be tough to read with bunch of equations but thanks to Hawking's way of explaining of theories with simple language and awesome pictures i could not put this book aside until i finished it at once.Even if i read this book that does not mean i will not read one more time.And one recommendation for whom wants to read is if you search names and theories mentioned in book and watch few videos about them you will never forget what this book wants to tell you and you will have more fun.

So, at what is called the quantum scale, there is a fuzziness in nature, very unlike the precisely ordered universe described by Isaac Newton.""""When a black hole is created by gravitational collapse, it rapidly settles down to a stationary state, which is characterized by only three parameters: the mass, the angular momentum(state of rotation) and the electric charge.Apart from these three, it preserves no other details of the object that has collapsed.If information is lost, which is apparently what is happening in a black hole, there should be some release of energy - but that flies in the face of the theory that nothing comes out of black holes. A paradox.""Or so we thought...""Black holes seems to emit particles at a steady rate.Quantum mechanics implies that the whole space is filled with pairs of virtual particles and antiparticles, which are constantly materializing in pairs, separating, and then coming together again and annihilating each other.Now, in the presence of a black hole, one member of a pair of virtual particles may fall into the hole, leaving the other member without the partner necessary for mutual annihilation. The forsaken particle or antiparticle may fall into the black hole after its partner, but it may also escape to infinity, where it appears to be radiation emitted by the black hole.""known as Hawking radiation.""The more accurately you know the positions of particles, the less accurately you can know their speeds, and vice versa""""Although one can't predict the positions and speeds separately, one can predict what is called the 'quantum state'.

If you want to know what Black Holes are , and if your mind keep on questioning about the facts of black holes ? , refer this and read this book. Stephen Hawkings lecture is made into a book and it has descriptions about what he is saying after each terms.I found it useful in gaining knowledge about black holes and many of the physics terms. There is complete satisfaction when you know a thing completely and this book gives that chance.  Clearly Science and it's myths always fascinated mankind.Like the Book says , if you enter a black hole , you might make a way out of it."
24,085750357X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/34971152-neel-tullu,4,A great book to end my reading slump. Stephen Hawking always makes you linger around those possibilities that you might never consider in the first place.

Highly recommend for a subtle introduction in this vast expanse of space.

37,085750357X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/72733679-manogna,5,"This book might as well change your view on black holes, if like me you knew very little about them, or widen your perspective on black holes if you are aware and read about them. The very existence (or non-existence) of a black hole, or a concept alike is brilliant and magical. And if a book can get you any closer to the concept and different adaptations of perspectives on the concept, then it is this by the legend Mr.Stephen Hawkings himself. These 60 pages of the book got me closer to the theory in a few minutes, then a bulky book that would probably take me days to read and months to comprehend. The book also contains notes by David Shukman ,which make it much more understandable.

It's very short, so i finished less than 2 hours (what probably is much time for most people).The book is about (in fact is a transcript) a lecture made by stephen hawking in 2016 what was divided in two parts.I haven't much to say about it, but have some commentaries. as it is a lecture ""transformed"" in a book can't demand too much, So here we go:First off, initially it is pretty tought to read if you don't have any idea about the subject . But the text is very simplifed along your read and they (David Shukman specifically) have introduce some extra explanations who haven't in the lecture.In general, is an easy and fast reading what inspires the search for knowledge. Also is a good motivation for those who wants to be a researcher or follow the academic career like me.Besides that, some problems of (my version) of the book is the images. They are very nice and illustrative, but they appears in the sequels pages illustrating something about an previous page. This don't make sense for me, because we turn the page already thinking in something tottaly different from what was illustrated.Another thing is the fact that the book don't increase anything besides the explanations of David Shukman, it's like a total copy of the lecture what you can find free online on bbc website in video. Since they are doing a book on it, could they increase more interesting things to complete.Anyway, somehow, the book it's better to understand. Moreover, you can re-read and absorb more the information, and worth to have it and i recommend. But, if you haven't and wants to watch the lecture:http://www.bbc.com/news/av/science-en...http://www.bbc.com/news/av/science-en...--------------------------------------------------------------07/09/2017"

57,085750357X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/54864770-sandy-blackteabooks,5,"This was such a fascinating read.In this transcript of Stephen Hawking's BBC Reith lectures on black holes, you learn about this mind-boggling concept, but also about how difficult it is to study. Because there is no hard, physical proof of Stephen Hawking's theories (yet), they are of course abstract and therefore quite some food for thought.As a book person with a life-long interest in science that is unfortunately paired with exceptionally few talents for it, fully grasping every idea Hawking expressed is sadly nothing I could pride myself with. Even though I had to read some paragraphs several times, I enjoyed reading these transcripts immensely.I genuinely believe that Stephen Hawking made these complicated theories as understandable as possible, and you see how effectively he toned it down when you read the excerpt of his latest published paper at the end of the book. In addition to SH's unique style, the annotations, comments and explanations by David Shukman were incredibly helpful; and the illustrations provided the visualisation of Hawking's brilliant humour, which ultimately makes his writings so enjoyable.To anyone who is interested in black holes or the universe in general, even if they consider themselves ""bad at science"" (like me), I can only recommend this little book."

It follows on from Hawking's talks during the BBC Reith Lectures in which the world renowned scientist was able to put in short his lifetime of work and knowledge of one of the most fascinating aspects of the universe that exists even if we cannot see it; Black Holes. This book captures even those with little knowledge on the subject and included is an introduction and helpful notes on the topics that are covered.On the first page it reads, ‚ÄúIt is said that fact is sometimes stranger than fiction, and nowhere is that more true than in the case of Black Holes.

But the text is very simplifed along your read and they (David Shukman specifically) have introduce some extra explanations who haven't in the lecture.In general, is an easy and fast reading what inspires the search for knowledge. Also is a good motivation for those who wants to be a researcher or follow the academic career like me.Besides that, some problems of (my version) of the book is the images.

This don't make sense for me, because we turn the page already thinking in something tottaly different from what was illustrated.Another thing is the fact that the book don't increase anything besides the explanations of David Shukman, it's like a total copy of the lecture what you can find free online on bbc website in video. Since they are doing a book on it, could they increase more interesting things to complete.Anyway, somehow, the book it's better to understand.

But the text is very simplifed along your read and they (David Shukman specifically) have introduce some extra explanations who haven't in the lecture.In general, is an easy and fast reading what inspires the search for knowledge. Also is a good motivation for those who wants to be a researcher or follow the academic career like me.Besides that, some problems of (my version) of the book is the images. They are very nice and illustrative, but they appears in the sequels pages illustrating something about an previous page. This don't make sense for me, because we turn the page already thinking in something tottaly different from what was illustrated.Another thing is the fact that the book don't increase anything besides the explanations of David Shukman, it's like a total copy of the lecture what you can find free online on bbc website in video. Since they are doing a book on it, could they increase more interesting things to complete.Anyway, somehow, the book it's better to understand.

But the text is very simplifed along your read and they (David Shukman specifically) have introduce some extra explanations who haven't in the lecture.In general, is an easy and fast reading what inspires the search for knowledge. Also is a good motivation for those who wants to be a researcher or follow the academic career like me.Besides that, some problems of (my version) of the book is the images. They are very nice and illustrative, but they appears in the sequels pages illustrating something about an previous page. This don't make sense for me, because we turn the page already thinking in something tottaly different from what was illustrated.Another thing is the fact that the book don't increase anything besides the explanations of David Shukman, it's like a total copy of the lecture what you can find free online on bbc website in video. Since they are doing a book on it, could they increase more interesting things to complete.Anyway, somehow, the book it's better to understand.
