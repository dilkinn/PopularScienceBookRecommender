0,0062225790,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5448792-b-schrodinger,4,"'An Appetite For Wonder' is the first part of Richard's autobiography and cover his life up until the publication of The Selfish Gene as well as some material about his parents and grandparents before he came along. It is written in the usual Dawkins style, witty charming and self-effacing and filled with anecdotes about great people in his life and how their influence has helped him become the man he is today.The initial part of the book deals with Richard's lineage and while it is a bit dry it is necessary due to the influence that this lineage has had on his family and himself. Yes he has come from a long line of what some people would call privileged families, but as he states at the end of the book:""I cannot deny a measure of unearned privilege when I compare my childhood, boyhood and youth to others less fortunate. I do not apologise for that privilege any more than a man should apologise for the genes on his face, but I am very conscious of it.""His childhood in Africa was not ideal, but as he shows, having two loving parents made all the difference. And amazingly he was not the ideal of a child biologist, much to the consternation to his biologist parents. His childhood was very different from other famous biologists and zoologists such as Gerald Durrell's as depicted in My Family and Other Animals. His school days were spent in boarding schools, both in Africa and then later back in Britain, where he did not necessarily shine in all subjects. It is astounding that an above average child at school has gone on to become one of the leaders in his field. I guess that it is testament to the amount of hard work and tenacity he has put into his life starting from his late youth.Richard's high school marks barely scraped him through into Oxford, despite his senior high school years being a long hard slog. He was not accepted to study biochemistry and was encouraged to and accepted into the zoology program. Anyway, enough with the summary. How good of a read is this? Well it is a difficult book to talk about as a whole. The sections on his childhood are not unlike other autobiographic reminisces from an interesting person. There are great and witty anecdotes, stories of danger and conflict and and some reflections that are inspiring. But the book, just like his life, changes dramatically when Richard starts researching at Oxford. The latter half of his book concerns mainly of explaining his research at the time. And truthfully it can be a bit dense. Probably on par with some of his more dense explanations in his other books. Not to mean that it is not as interesting as his youth, it is just a very large change in style.So anybody looking for charming stories and anecdotes may be happy with the section on his childhood, but may falter at the density of his writing on his research. I guess that is my main warning to others. It may not be the ideal Dawkins read for anyone who has not read his books before, and should probably be left until you have read a few of his other books. Indeed I hope to get some more under my belt before attempting the next volume expected in a couple of years."
1,0062225790,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4213258-bradley,4,"This is pretty much entirely an autobiography, giving us all the stray bits of Richard Dawkin's childhood through college and, later, his pet projects and his interest in programming before later publishing The Selfish Gene.As a writer, he's always good. He seemed to have a rather interesting childhood in Africa with loving parents, becoming a rather bullied child in school, getting heavily into religion among other things, including a rather unfortunate sexual event. At least it didn't seem to scar him. He also took a rather indirect path to his studies, too, but I suppose this is also rather normal, being pushed one way or another by faculty and opportunity, but at least he eventually got into the mode, thanks to the theories that naturally dovetailed between programming and biology, to write his most famous book.Pretty fascinating. I wouldn't say it's extremely so, but it was certainly edifying.The first half of the book is his life, of course, but the later sections DO give you a pretty concise summary of the thought experiments and science that led up to the book, so be prepared for at least SOME rather intense science, even if most of the rest of the book is more personable. Funny story: I read this without reading the blurb. And I thought it was just going to be another science book! Not an autobiography! I felt duped! :) lol live and learn, live and learn... :)"
2,0062225790,http://goodreads.com/user/show/155663-david,4,"In this short autobiography, Richard Dawkins covers the first half of his life. The book ends with the publication of his first book, The Selfish Gene. The book is filled with short anecdotes about Dawkins' life growing up, from the youngest age. The first half of the book covers his childhood; in this section Dawkins frequently wonders why he did so many ""unthinking"" things, often devoid of curiosity. He wonders how he was influenced to become a biologist; and both his parents were interested in the natural sciences. His father, especially, had a strong influence on his early life.Dawkins' life in a boarding school is interesting. He writes about how bullying was a big element in the school. He wanted very strongly to see evidence in favor of religion. During his early teenage years he felt pleasure in religious observances. However, he later saw hypocrisy in the religious aspects of his school, and noted that even some of the faculty did not relish the religious observances.My favorite anecdote in the book occurs while Dawkins is a young boy in East Africa. His parents learn about a ""lion kill"" nearby, so the entire household is loaded up into the family car, and they ride off to see a lion devouring its prey. All the adults are spellbound by the sight. But Richard ignores the lion. Instead, he sits on the floor of the car playing with toy cars (""vroom, vroom"").The second half of the book describes his science education and his early career. He relished computer programming, and developed a number of programs aimed at modeling biological behaviors. Throughout the book, Dawkins writes as a humble person, with none of the arrogance that some people see in him. The only downside to the book is that he writes too much in the beginning about his ancestors--this was somewhat boring. But overall, this is a charming book, about a leading biologist of our age. I listened to this book as an audiobook; Dawkins is the narrator, and his pleasant voice makes listening a delight."
3,0062225790,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2160536-marvin,3,"Richard Dawkins gets a bad rap. Sure, I understand he can be critical of religion and maybe a little arrogant.. He thinks the world would be better off without religion but never advocates its banishment. So what? I hate beets but i won't stop others from eating them. But Dawkins has never knocked on my door at 7 AM and shoved a religious pamphlet in my face. He never insisted on his ideas being read in Sunday school to provide a balanced viewpoint. And he never threatened eternal punishment if I don't read his books. So I'll give him a pass.The sad thing about people's opinions of Dawkins is that they come almost exclusively from his book The God Delusion. Many do not realize that his reputation as a world class scientist was first cemented with the book, The Selfish Gene in the 70s. Dawkins's research into genes and evolutionary science plus his popular boos introducing the topic to the masses, would trouble no one except those who think the Bible was meant to be a book of science.An Appetite For Wonders will disappoint those looking for the abrasive Dawkins. The main focus in this memoir, which goes from his birth to the publishing of The Selfish Gene, is on the influences and revelations that led to his love of science. He only pauses on his religious background briefly mentioning he had two short conversions, one from his childhood indoctrination to Anglican Christianity and another through the music of Elvis (If someone as cool as Elvis believes in God it must be right!). But Dawkins was more interested in the area of biology. Any more insight on the development of his theological views, or lack of, will need to wait for the second memoir.Yet there is much here to rejoice about. His growing up in Africa with his two naturalist parents. His experience in the boys' schools of England. I thinks it says of lot about Dawkins that when he writes about the notorious hazing traditions of British schools, he downplays his own experiences but writes emphatically about what others went through. Also his first job at Berkeley in California not only tells in detail of his education in science but about his budding concern with social issues. Yet there are two areas that make this memoir drag more than necessary. His detailed ancestral tree may be of importance to him but makes for a slow beginning. And when he writes about his first research projects, his love for research come through but his insistence on describing it in detail to what will probably be a layman reader really halts the narrative. If one wants to explore that part more thoroughly he is more likely to read The Selfish Gene or The Blind Watchman, both books I highly recommend.Yet Dawkins' autobiographical endeavor is quite enjoyable and has plenty of interesting revelations about this extraordinary scientist. If you are already a Dawkins fan like me, it is a must. For the regular reader or those whose opinion of him is only derived from The God Delusion, it might be helpful too. "
4,0062225790,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9914220-david,5,"Dawkins has given us some idea of how he has come to be the man he is, and how he has been influenced or not by the times in which he lived and the people and circumstances of his existence. Born during WW-II, in Africa where his Father served the King's African Rifles in Kenya, he relies heavily on his Mother's journals to exhibit details of those early years. History may relegate the African campaigns to North Africa and the exploits of Rommel, Montgomery and Patton, but the war influenced colonial Africa in many ways, not the least of which was the collapse of empires and independence of colonies in the years that followed. Dawkins might have become a biochemical researcher instead of an animal behaviorist, but for having tutorials with Niko Tinbergen. Who else might study the possible reasons why a fly might follow this or that pattern of cleaning itself by breaking down the individual elements and looking for patterns, or devise a computer program for counting the pecks chicks do on a particular target? His descriptions of these experiments are colorfully rendered not as the scientific papers they would become, but as the experiences of discovery and wonder that they were for him a part of his particular journey.This memoir stops after publication of The Selfish Gene in 1976, which is just about half way through his life to the present. This reviewer hopes there will be a second volume, and perhaps in future a third installment.There are moments in this book that gave me pause to stop and give some consideration to this or that thought, or connect to something else from my own life experience. I read Konrad Lorenz seminal book on animal behavior On Agression shortly after it was translated to English, and Desmond Morris The Naked Ape without giving much thought to the subtle problems with their views and what would come to be the thesis of Dawkins' insights into evolutionary thought. It is not the survival of the species, but the survival of the individual that drives natural selection, the principle of local rules which govern the outcomes rather than any drive by the entire specie. I could not help but think of Stanislaw Lem's wonderful review of ""Bitistics"" which is part of his volume Imaginary Magnitude, about the future study of computer generated literature, as I read the final paragraphs of the chapter ""Return To Oxford"". Dawkins has a marvelous wit, and can be very self-effacing in his presentation of his own behavior. This is readily apparent in those parts of his childhood in which he recalls his participation in bullying other students, or his failure to take advantage of the opportunities presented to him as a teenager to study music or mathematics. If there is one failure in this memoir, it is that his wife seems to be nothing more than a sentence her or there and not a major part of his life."
5,0062225790,http://goodreads.com/user/show/67532575-kevin-shepherd,4,"""Cliché or not, 'stranger than fiction' expresses exactly how I feel about the truth. We are survival machines - robot vehicles blindly programmed to preserve the selfish molecules known as genes. This is a truth which still fills me with astonishment. Though I have known about it for years, I never seem to get fully used to it. One of my hopes is that I may have some success in astonishing others.""In my humble estimation, Dawkins falls somewhere between Charles Darwin and Bertrand Russell, maybe even a hybrid of the two. He is as much of a philosopher as he is a biologist, and sees himself, very rightly so, as a champion of evolutionary science.Ernest Becker points out in his Pulitzer Prize winning psychological study, ""The Denial of Death,"" that men who see themselves as historical figures marshal themselves toward the hard work and dedication necessary to achieve that perceived immortality. Richard Dawkins is no exception. This is an autobiography that evolves, chapter by chapter, into an impressive multi-dimensional résumé. If you admire and respect Dawkins as much as I do, I suspect you'll find this captivating and insightful. Evangelical zealots need not bother."
6,0062225790,http://goodreads.com/user/show/695116-jim,3,"He's best known for The Selfish Gene & an outspoken atheist. He also spent the early part of his life in Africa, so I expected to like this more than I did. It wasn't bad, but amazingly pedestrian. Overall, it was interesting, especially when he discussed his experiments & early computer programming. Some of the great names he rubbed elbows with were fun to see in another light, too. It was also nice to know that the great man wasn't a child prodigy & he regrets many of the opportunities he let slide in his early life. Don't we all. There was a lot more poetry than I would have expected. Some of it was good, but most annoyed me. I've never gotten into poetry, though. He did a great job narrating it. I'm glad I read it & now I really want to read The Selfish Gene, but I can't really recommend this. So many books, so little time, & this one didn't really add all that much."
7,0062225790,http://goodreads.com/user/show/13946677,3,"‎‫‏‬I thought I would LOVE this memoir, but I only liked it!I'm not saying that I got disappointed, but I wanted this book to give me something else. Something more interesting. ‫ ‬This book [which is the first part of Dawkins' biography] tells the story of Richard Dawkins' childhood and his journey in science - as a student - until his GREATEST accomplishment: the publication of The Selfish Gene. To be honest, I didn't find the story very interesting. It was an ordinary story - even boring at certain points. The most beautiful and enlightening parts were when Dawkins wrote about the importance of education.Tonight I will start reading the second part of the biography, which is supposed to be far more interesting - hopefully!"
8,0062225790,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9782604-inyourfacenewyorker,5,"We've all heard the stereotypes about kids who grow up to be scientists: precocious, prodigious little children, lonely and isolated from their peers, who lock themselves in a room for several hours at a time doing experiments. By his own admission, Richard Dawkins was none of these things. When he lived in Africa as a boy, he was apparently more interested, for example, in playing with toy cars than watching a pride of lions devour its prey. However, he was-- and is-- a lover of words, and that is very obvious when reading any of his beautifully written twelve books. Richard Dawkins's latest book, An Appetite for Wonder is an autobiography that details the first half of his life, from his childhood up until the publication of his first book, The Selfish Gene, in 1976. The first half of the memoir details his family history and his childhood. The second, less personal half is about his intellectual awakening in his late teens which leads to his passionate pursuit of studying biology at Oxford. The book concludes at the beginning of his scientific career, when he begins as a research scientist and eventually becomes a science writer; this is when his life takes a dramatic shift. We are left with a ""cliffhanger"" of sorts and find ourselves counting down the days until 2015 when Dawkins promises to release the second half of his memoir, provided he does not die before then. His mother is in her mid-90s and his father died at the age of 95. Obviously there are some robust genes in his family, so I don't think we should expect Dawkins to check out any time soon, provided he does not get hit by a church van (Google it if you don't get it).What is really fascinating about An Appetite for Wonder are the philosophical questions that it postulates throughout. Yes, there are some endearing stories about Dawkins's early love of words; and yes there is a story about him, at the age of 19 months, telling other children that the Santa Claus who came to entertain them was actually a man named Sam, possibly foreshadowing Dawkins's journey into skepticism; yes there are some really interesting research projects that he did as a young man; and yes there are some interesting photographs to look at. But embedded within many of these stories is a continuing ""what if?"" question, and that is what I find the most fascinating. What if certain details in Dawkins's life had been changed? What if he had gone to different boarding schools than the ones he actually attended? What if he had not been born in Africa? What if he had not returned to England at age 8? What if he had been switched at birth and ben raised by different parents? What if he had not encountered certain friends and mentors during the course of his life? How did these people and experiences shape his personality and his professional life? More profoundly, what if a cannonball had hit his great-great grandfather's ""family jewels"" (yes, apparently almost happened)? Hell, how about any particular incident that did or did not happen over the course of history? A lot of the questions about life and existence that Dawkins raises are ones that I have asked myself throughout my life, everything from the events that led to my conception to my first summer at overnight camp at age 14 which dramatically changed my life. The latter is too long of a story to go into here. However, in a very clear and simple example of an important event, my father told me that his mother left his father (my grandfather) and returned to him only because she found out she was pregnant with my aunt (my father's older sister). Had it not been for the social taboo of being a single mother, my father would not have been born, and neither would I. Not that the ends justify the means, but it is still interesting to think about. Dawkins-- and all of us-- owe our unlikely existence to a very precise string of events that occurred ever since the universe began. Change any one of these events, no matter how seemingly insignificant, and we-- Dawkins, you, me, or all of the above-- would not have been born. Perhaps it was not intentional, but it seems that the section Dawkins wrote about his early research into animal decision-making is an apt metaphor for this. Rounding up my review, I want to commend Dawkins for his thoughts about the bullying he witnessed as a boy and how he regrets not intervening. I say this because I was bullied myself and I know that many people who were bullies or, in his case, who were bystanders are in denial or simply don't remember when confronted about these things later in life. It is not an easy thing to own up to. Overall, An Appetite for Wonder is an outstanding read by a truly talented and deep-thinking writer. As I say to my friends when I recommend a book, just read the damn thing."
9,0062225790,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4729639-krista,2,"won•der [wuhn-der] verb1. to think or speculate curiously.2. to be filled with admiration, amazement, or awe; marvel.3. to doubt.What a curious title Richard Dawkins chose for the first part of his memoir -- An Appetite for Wonder -- since he proceeds to make the case that he was never particularly filled with wonder as a child (a fact that was something of a disappointment to his wonder-filled parents). This should have been a fascinating life story: Dawkins was born in Africa at the twilight of the British Empire; he attended a British boarding school, complete with bullies, ""fagging"", and at least one pedophile; he studied at Oxford alongside of a lot of sciency people that he name-drops (I had only heard of Desmond Morris); he lectured at Berkley in the 60s and participated in some of the counter-culture there (which he now regrets as youthful naiveté); he returned to Oxford where he wrote some of the earliest computer programming; and he became a successful author, popularizing (if not originating) the contemporary genetic theories of the early 70s (although he did coin the word ""meme"") in The Selfish Gene.It should have been fascinating, but that list I just typed is way more interesting and far less annoying than the unexamined, self-congratulatory, self-referencing bloviation that Dawkins compiled here. I listened to this on audiobook (which Dawkins himself narrated very well) and right now I can't find the quote, but when talking about the death of his mentor, Mike Cullen, Dawkins said something like, ""His life cannot be summed up better than in the eulogy I wrote and delivered for him…"" and then he delivers it again for us. I can find the quote that follows this up because it has been included in others' mocking reviews: ''I almost wept when I spoke that eulogy in Wadham chapel, and I almost wept again just now when rereading it 12 years later"". If there's one thing we learn in An Appetite for Wonder, it's that Dawkins is often moved by his own thoughts and words.But for the most part, this is quite a dull book (and especially the very long and detailed descriptions of experiments Dawkins performed at Oxford on chick-pecking and fly-grooming behaviours) with songs and poems and his positive book reviews thrown in (three bad reviews for The Selfish Gene were attributed to two left-wing extremists and one on the opposite side of the spectrum). The subtitle of this book (The Making of a Scientist) is also just barely addressed -- Dawkins' father, a biologist and alumnus, pulled some strings to get his barely qualified son into Oxford, but since the young Dawkins didn't have the marks for Biochemistry, he was offered a spot in Zoology. After a lifetime of preferring novels to exploring the countryside and a school career of pointedly refusing to visit the observatory or to take advantage of the other ""marvelous facilities"", Dawkins allowed his father to pull some strings and make him a scientist (and, of course, this was a happy circumstance because I'm not denying that Dawkins has made many fine contributions). Based on this book, Joseph Anton, and God is not Great I have come to the realisation that my idea of hell (which, ironically, none of the three authors believe in) would be to be locked in a room with Richard Dawkins, Salman Rushdie, and Christopher Hitchens as they debate which one of them is the greatest genius; a wonder for which I have zero appetite."
10,0062225790,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5072847-will-ansbacher,4,"Can it be? Dawkins the brilliant scientist, thinker and iconoclast, is actually a bit dull? Start reading from the beginning (but how else could you read it?), and you might think so. It was only after I got to the second half, chronicling his life at Oxford and up to the age of 35 that I really began to appreciate this autobiography of a surprisingly diffident and self-effacing young man. The last chapter, in fact, where Dawkins looks honestly and uncompromisingly at himself, unsparing in his appraisal of his shortcomings, is the best in the book. Along the way he gracefully acknowledges the huge debt he owes to the people and places that made him. He shares his intense joy in discovering what science is all about - although much of his practical work from that period sounds endearingly mundane to a non-zoologist (he was counting chicken pecks). He also reveals how he was sucked into a computer addiction that lasted the best part of a decade, ending only through a series of power cuts that pushed him into writing his first book. Quite the foil to the character the public usually associates with “Richard Dawkins”! So, I was motivated to re-read from the beginning. The main problem is that this is a strictly chronological account, starting with his relatives and ancestors. Apart from his father, however, they are not rounded out at all and their lives are not very interesting or relevant to Dawkins himself. Then his own childhood: before he developed his sharp intellect he appears to have been a rather average child and adolescent, and he hasn’t lightened the memoir with a lot of humour (there’s actually much more of that in the adult half). Like many children brought up in England’s colonial days, he was sent to boarding school from 7 onwards, and it wasn’t a good time for him. Although it is quite interesting (and a little heart-rending) to read how he coped with bullying, he was more a bystander than a victim, and that leads to what I thought were his most significant comments about that time:In several places he wonders, as a compassionate adult, how he could have stood by and simply witnessed such cruelty without doing anything, and he marvels that the child he was seems like a totally different person from who he is today. I must say I understand that and rather feel the same way (maybe everyone does) - but really, if you feel you are a different person, why start your bio with the life of somebody else at all? [I’ve just started Brief Candle in the Dark, the continuation of this book, and he’s abandoned the chronological approach there]Here’s something else about the first part: it’s peppered with asides and exhortations (as the adult Dawkins) about the state of today’s world. Much of what he says makes sense but in doing so he comes across as rather pompous and humourless. Just one example: he talks of “dundridges” (after a character in a Tom Sharpe novel), his word for rule-obsessed bureaucrats and drones. Nice word, but he then goes on to tell us to use it often, as he does, in the hopes that it becomes a meme. Oh, Richard, Richard, you invented “meme”! You of all people should know that’s not how they go viral; it doesn’t work when you try so hard!And maybe I shouldn’t mention the notebook his parents kept with his cute two-year-old sayings. I’m sure his family found them endearing but little Richard was just like other peoples’ children – a wee bit tiresome. Look, my parents had one of those books too but I’m not going to fill a memoir with its contents*. OK, “fill” is an exaggeration, because on re-reading that part I found it was not so long after all – it just felt like it. But you see what I mean – that’s a lot of lesser stuff to wade through to get to the real Dawkins, and it made this a not-quite 4-star read.-------------------------------------* Oh all right, just one. When preparing for a drive to my grandparents’ house, my father asked if I thought the car minded going such a long way. “Silly, it can’t mind,” I apparently said, “it hasn’t got a face.” "
11,0062225790,http://goodreads.com/user/show/12484910-charbel,4,"Richard Dawkins has a reputation. He’s considered the leading figure in the “militant atheism” movement, as well as religion’s harshest critic. In scientific circles, however, he’s also well known as a major contributor to ethology, animal behaviour science, and evolutionary biology. In short, he is, as he put it, a “labourer in Darwin’s vineyard today”.An Appetite for Wonder: The Making of a Scientist takes you on a journey where you get to know the man behind the persuasive arguments, celebrated books, and glorious accomplishments. Dawkins doesn’t start from his birth; he is far too scrupulous for that. In fact, he goes even beyond. He begins his story with the origin of his family name, Clinton, back in the 1700s, and then progressively moves from there. Though all that background information can be a bit tedious, it’s important to understand that Dawkins considers even the most trivial detail about his heritage an integral part of who he is. The first part of the book mainly consists of his childhood, until the age of eight, in colonial Africa. Born during the Second World War, Dawkins and his family moved from country to country, creating loving memories for the young Richard that contributed in shaping the man he had become. But to the reader, this part of the book shows Richard Dawkins in a new light. You get to see a small child that is very much like any other small child. Dawkins paints these events in a nostalgic way that is both vivid and engaging. The following paragraph demonstrates how the writing can make you see Richard the boy differently than Richard the man:‘My parents also recorded that I had a large repertoire of songs, which I would render, always correctly in tune, pretending to be a gramophone, sometimes with “jokes” such as getting stuck in a groove and singing the same word over and over until the “needle” (my finger) was pushed out of the groove.’Here we don’t see Richard the scientist, or the atheist, but the young boy who, like many boys of his age, provided some entertainment to the grownups using his young childish sense of humour.The second part of the book begins with the family returning to England, and young Richard being sent to boarding schools; first to a preparatory school then to a public school (a misleading term as it’s actually a private school). In this part of the book, we glimpse some of young Richard’s school life, and even some of the adult’s many regrets. An interesting fact mentioned repeatedly in the memoir about school is not an abundance of child abuse from the masters (called discipline back then), but the proliferation of near-pedophiliac instances. Dawkins mentions that young boys who carry strong resemblances to girls, including him, were prone to harassment from older students and even from a master. This part of the book is also significant as it’s the main part of the memoir that contains some reflections on Dawkins different religious views. If you are expecting a fair deal about his atheism, I would simply point out that the book is called The Making of a Scientist and not The Making of an Atheist.The third part begins with his studies in Oxford and goes on to recount his time in Berkeley, California. This section also holds a great deal about his research in ethology, which would be attractive to any science enthusiast. There is also a chapter on The Selfish Gene (1976), the book that made Dawkins a household name and glorified him in scientific circles (I highly recommend reading The Selfish Gene). Dawkins’ first book also helped the author coin the term “Meme”, which stands for a cultural unit that evolves from individual to individual, just like a gene does in a molecular manner (yes Meme existed way before Grumpy Cat and Angry Baby).In conclusion, I recommend reading this wonderful memoir and getting to know the man behind the many controversies. An Appetite for Wonder is funny, engaging, and full-blown fascinating. Also keep your eye out for the second volume of the memoir (yes there will be a new book) meant to come out in two years’ time. I personally can’t wait."
12,0062225790,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8807144-marc-faoite,3,"An Appetite For Wonder is Richard Dawkins’ latest book and unlike The God Delusion is unlikely to be burned. It is essentially a memoir, and follows the first half of the author’s life, up until the publishing of The Selfish Gene. The second part of his life will be dealt with in a later volume. Dawkins is just about as British as you can get, including the plum in mouth accent that comes through his writing style and is his actual voice in real life. However, like many of his contemporaries born in the waning years of the British Empire, Dawkins wasn’t born in the ‘home country’, but in ‘the Colonies’ instead – in his case Kenya. The first half of the book deals with his family background, his early education and leaving Africa for England. Much of this is about as exciting as spending a wet afternoon with someone leafing through an old photo album. But as you spend more time with him you understand that despite, what at first might seem like a vaguely pompous air, he really is a rather pleasant fellow and is actually very down to earth. It is well written, undramatic stuff, and if at times it is a little soporific, it still has the virtue of making excellent bedtime reading. It’s when he gets to Oxford (about half way through the book) that things start to get more interesting. You can almost feel the author’s relief as he takes the spotlight off himself and onto the firmer ground of science. Here he writes with real passion and you can feel the excitement of the young man he was back then as he rolls up his sleeves to divulge the details of more satisfying topics, such as the grooming rituals of houseflies, or the water vascular systems of starfish (it turns out that starfish don’t have blood, but pump seawater around their bodies instead). We witness the inquisitive nature of his mind as he ponders the pecking patterns of baby chicks and devises experiments to transform the seemingly random rise and fall of beaks into raw hard data. This data leads him to another challenge – how to measure, and tabulate, and analyse it. Computers were in their infancy and still took up a significant portion of a room. Young Dawkins embraced this nascent technology and was one of the fore-runners in the field, writing simple programs at first, and when the limitations of the computers got in the way, devising his own computer languages instead, until soon he was spending almost as much time on computers as on biology. He briefly alludes to the fact that had he continued along that path he could potentially have become Bill Gates, with all the wealth to match, but he harbours no regrets for following the path of biology. I was hoping for an account of his friendship with Christopher Hitchens, with whom he attended Oxford, but no mention is made of that episode of his life. In fact there are very few details of a personal nature in the latter part of this book, which is really more of a synopsis of some of the ideas that crop up later in his work, though there is an interesting passage about his time in Berkley in the swinging sixties. It shouldn’t be surprising from the objective mind of a scientist that Dawkins seems to place himself outside his own life, keeping the subject matter at arm’s length, describing it as if seen by an external observer, rather as if he is examining or describing one of his own experiments. In one episode he starts to delve into more candid details of his personal life, but quickly withdraws from revealing more, saying ‘It isn’t that kind of autobiography.’"
13,0062225790,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3452722-koen-crolla,2,"In the past I've often denounced the whole genre of autobiography as being unacceptably self-indulgent, and Richard Dawkins himself, of course, is the walking embodiment of unexamined privilege, so I expected to dislike the smugly titled An Appetite for Wonder more than I did.It's not that Dawkins has suddenly grown a sense of self-awareness† or that his account of his youth doesn't contain barely-concealed nostalgia for colonialism or the well-publicised trivialisation of child molestation—rather, I think it's down to two main things:First: every book Dawkins has produced in this century has been more poorly-written than the last. 
The Magic of Reality
 may deserve a break because it was written for children, but The Greatest Show on Earth was almost unreadable. Appetite finally breaks this streak; it still has its purple moments, but over-all, it's basically acceptable.Secondly: I'm very familiar with scions of old-money families born into branches that have long since stretched their inheritance too thinly and bred themselves into the middle class, and I quite enjoy seeing them cling desperately to their faded glory. Many of them manage to face up to reality by the time they hit their 70s, while others only hit denial's full stride in their old age—Dawkins is one of the latter.I'd think it also helps that the part of the book that covers his coeducational academic career for the most part does so through his actual research. Other misogynists, like James Watson, have focussed too much on their relationships with women, and that just doesn't do anyone any favours. Dawkins of course can't not mention his recent online embarrassment—his victim complex won't allow it—but he does so only obliquely, by whining about ``cyber-bullies''.Still, I can't imagine anyone but Dawkins' immediate relatives‡ actually enjoying this book. It's in no sense as bad as, say, Christopher Hitchens' Hitch-22, but there's still enough smugness and lamenting the ongoing decline of civilisation and general white-old-mannishness to turn any reader off.Appetite stops at the publishing of The Selfish Gene, so unfortunately a second part is forthcoming. Maybe he'll be a less shitty person by 2015 and I'll buy it. I doubt it.--------† A passage from the epilogue, presented without comment:I have had to earn my own bread. But—while happy to ignore the attacks I have (yes, really) received for being white, male and adequately educated—I cannot deny a measure of unearned privilege when I compare my childhood, boyhood and youth to others less fortunate. I do not apologize for that privilege any more than a man should apologize for his genes or his face, but I am very conscious of it.‡ He mentions that his parents kept a joint diary of their time in Africa which they shared with the family, and that his mother later wrote her own memoirs separately, so Appetite was presumably written in that tradition."
14,0062225790,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7028840-ron,5,"The only reason I gave it only four stars is that a couple of the chapters describing his research were very arcane and way above my ability to follow! Other than that, this is a great book, telling of this great scientist's life from birth until the publication of his surprise best-seller bombshell THE SELFISH GENE. If you want proof of evolution, you need go no farther than his explanation of the revealingly ""bad design"" of the recurrent laryngeal nerve and how it traces directly back to our evolution from fishes. Oh, please, save your ""intelligent design"" foolishness for a fool! Explain why this nerve goes from the brain into the chest and THEN to the larynx! Dawkins does, clearly and lucidly. I am eagerly awaiting his next memoir installment which he says will be out in two years. Oh, heck, the nerve thing is so well explained I am giving back the one star I took away! Here is part of what Amazon says: With the 2006 publication of The God Delusion, the name Richard Dawkins became a byword for ruthless skepticism and ""brilliant, impassioned, articulate, impolite"" debate (San Francisco Chronicle). his first memoir offers a more personal view.His first book, The Selfish Gene, caused a seismic shift in the study of biology by proffering the gene-centered view of evolution. It was also in this book that Dawkins coined the term meme, a unit of cultural evolution, which has itself become a mainstay in contemporary culture.In An Appetite for Wonder, Richard Dawkins shares a rare view into his early life, his intellectual awakening at Oxford, and his path to writing The Selfish Gene. He paints a vivid picture of his idyllic childhood in colonial Africa, peppered with sketches of his colorful ancestors, charming parents, and the peculiarities of colonial life right after World War II. At boarding school, despite a near-religious encounter with an Elvis record, he began his career as a skeptic by refusing to kneel for prayer in chapel. Despite some inspired teaching throughout primary and secondary school, it was only when he got to Oxford that his intellectual curiosity took full flight."
15,0062225790,http://goodreads.com/user/show/208893-kim-olson,4,"It's hard for me to imagine a world without Richard Dawkins, because his books have contributed so much to my understanding of the world (as they've done for so many others). I've often wondered how exactly he became the man that he is. I have to say that his background is pretty much as anyone might imagine--an African childhood spent wandering the bush (although he downplays its significance), a botanist father, prep school and then Oxford, where his father and several other family members had gone before him. This autobiography is fairly straightforward in the telling and focuses on Dawkins' academic and professional life, including passages where he shares details of some of his early research. But we get a few glimpses into his other interests as well, like his love of poetry and the written word (largely introduced to him by his mother).While he covers his schoolboy rejection of Christianity, this volume ends with the publishing of The Selfish Gene, so if you're curious about his transition to the no-holds-barred brand of atheism for which he has become known (probably more for than his research, for better or worse), you won't find it here. But word is there will be a second volume, and there are enough clues in this volume to explain it. His dedication to research and getting to the truth are so core to his being that he can't seem to forgive himself even for the times that, as a child, he failed to question fantastical things that adults told him. An interesting (and in many ways, inspiring) read. "
16,0062225790,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5838785-ivana,3,"I love Dawkins. He is one of the most brilliant evolutionary biologist of our time. Having said that, I found his memoir largely boring, full of trite details and aspects of his life that, to a reader, bear no importance on his life as a magnificent scientist. I was on page 146 and still reading about his childhood and the fact that he had cold feet, that he once witnessed a child being bullied... So on and so forth. His writing is magnificent, and his scientific achievements undeniable. I guess I expected this memoir to shed more light on some of the aspects of his scientific discoveries and writings. Instead, it was simply a recounting of his family tree, his days as a kid, his university days, and at the very end- his actual work. I guess I shouldn't bitch about it; after all, it is a memoir, and he gets to write whatever the hell he wants. So, I'll stick with his other books, which I know are brilliant. I'll skip his further memoirs( I assume there are more to come, since this one is titled ""memoir #1)."
17,0062225790,http://goodreads.com/user/show/16802193-bob-schnell,3,"Richard Dawkins shares his life story up to the point of the publication of his first book ""The Selfish Gene"" (now famous for coining the word ""meme""). While I am always fascinated with autobiographies of British people I was a bit disappointed in how much of the book had already been covered in his previous books. I would have liked more personal insight regarding his ""appetite for wonder"" and fewer lengthy passages lifted directly from his other writings in explanation of his experiments. The earlier chapters on his childhood and schooling were great, but once he got to Oxford it began to fall apart for me. The copy I read was a pre-pub without photos and many diagrams, but I don't believe they would have helped my enjoyment of the book."
18,0062225790,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7958239-elizabeth-theiss,3,"Richard Dawkins is a man I would like to spend an afternoon with, sharing a bottle of wine and talking about interesting things. He is damn good company and I enjoyed his memoir. And yet, having finished it just a few minutes ago, I'm left mildly dissatisfied. He has given us an account of his intellectual development from earliest years through the publication of The Selfish Gene. He's told us amusing bits about the Great Men who inspired and mentored him. But I'm not entirely sure I learned much about Dawkins himself and the inner fire that must exist in one who has accomplished so much. I learned more about the man from reading The God Delusion than from his autobiography. At the end of the book, Dawkins promises is a sequel, to which I will look forward. "
19,0062225790,http://goodreads.com/user/show/26188-jafar,3,"I think I should have skipped this book and waited for the second volume where – presumably – Dawkins will talk about how he turned from a scientist into a public intellectual and the face of unapologetic atheism. This volume covers his childhood years in Kenya and then his Oxford years – none of which I found particularly interesting. Nor did I really like the rather long sections describing his doctoral research. The book got more interesting for me towards the end when he talks about the publishing of his first book The Selfish Gene – and that's where the book ends. Dawkins, like him or not, is an erudite man and a great writer. "
20,0062225790,http://goodreads.com/user/show/16609779-olga,4,"My first memoir... It was really good. I really admire Richard Dawkins so maybe I'm bias in this, I think he's brilliant and it was very interesting to know a little about his early life, about his passion for biology specially zoology and evolution. Very thought provoking for me and inspiring to continue my journey to become a better scientist and researcher. It feels weird trying to rate a non-fiction book, but this one I think deserves the highest rating. It has a bit of everything and I just love the way he writes. Also I'm happy I finish this before the start of #booktubeathon "

He explains toward the end of the book that the other half part of his life is the subject of yet another autobiographical work to be published in two years time. I am really looking forward to it, since I really liked this one, the first one. I don't know why but for some reason I expected the childhood part to be mundane, but it was quite the contrary! It is fascinating to see how different elements in his youth played out as a backbone to his later development. I believe he has had the best of luck in his early life. Though I should not downplay the role of his natural intelligence and perseverance in his ultimate success in life.If you are interested in his science too, you won't be disappointed. He lays down the basis of his life's research in his typical elegant and accessible style for the layperson. Though maybe I should mention my own background in biological sciences meant that I could more readily grasp the research section of the book. The book is aptly subtitled ""The Making of a Scientist"". This book is a brilliant personal and intellectual odyssey, which provides a fascinating and passionate account of -what I believe to be- a life lived to the fullest in the pursuit of truth and clarity.

22,0062225790,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2326846-richard-cytowic,1,"A disappointing book of a life full of events, but short on what they mean to the author. It sheds little to no light on how Dawkins came to be the intellect he is, and fails as both conventional autobiography and memoir. The purpose of writing is to illuminate what is hidden, and this book is far off the mark.See my full review of Richard Dawkins' Appetite for Wonder in The New York Journal of Books.A list of recent reviews can also be found on Richard Cytowic's profile page at the NY Journal of Books reviewer page."

The tone in this book is quite different from the God's Delusion, and people may find the two books were written by different authors. I personally like both versions of Dawkins although I disagree with some things he said.It is fascinating to learn about his childhood and what contributed to his love of biology. From the book, we can learn about the people who influenced Dawkins, his first experience with religions, and his journey through education and work. There are also science contexts embedded in this book, but it is a bit dense for me to digest properly.Overall, it's an enjoyable read."
24,0062225790,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3816725-larry-bassett,3,Richard Dawkins as he recalls his early lifeI am an admirer of Richard Dawkins because he has written some books debunking God. So I was attracted to this book because I was curious about is personal history. He was born in Africa two parents who were in service to the global domination of England. He grew up a fairly privileged life with his education culminating at Oxford. I experienced the book in its audible format read by author Dawkins himself with his wonderful English accent. You should probably read his book The Selfish Gene. This book is really more about Richard Dawkins the scientist rather then Richard Dawkins the atheist.
25,0062225790,http://goodreads.com/user/show/802795-kris,3,"This is not typical Dawkins. This is a memoir, mostly focusing on the younger part of his life, and really, young English boys growing up in the 60s at Hogwarts-type schools without the magic are just not that interesting. Dawkins is at his least abrasive here, though, and there is little for anyone to find offensive, but not that much happens. Dawkins is at his best as a researcher, but he is an excellent writer. "
26,0062225790,http://goodreads.com/user/show/54135119-bogdan-teodorescu,4,"Did it change my opinion on Richard Dawkins? Yes, it kinda did. And I am very happy about it. I met Dawkins the man, and through the book I realized I have many traits in common with him. His tendency for philosophy, and for the Popperian way of doing science are amazing to me. I found this autobiography really honest. One of the things I really enjoyed was the depiction of the life at Oxford. He described so well the atmosphere of those times, and made such great combinations of stories and science, it makes you wish to be in Oxford for your whole life. Really, his life is great. Although there are a lot of differences in the admission process at Oxford, Cambridge, etc (which was a decisive point in his life), and the admission was based on completely other points, he is definitely a word-class scientist. It's so great to read about his projects, and see what happens in the mind and life of such a productive scientist. I also appreciated his interest in other fields, and how his love for genetics and behavioral zoology, and his scientific path, was completely defined by his character and traits. He made the best out of himself. Overall, a great, enjoyable read. “Shouldn’t children be taught critical, sceptical thinking from an early age? Shouldn’t we all be taught to doubt, to weigh up plausibility, to demand evidence?”"
27,0062225790,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8338351-judith,4,"The title changed from what is written above to what is shown on the book jacket.A different kind of autobiography. For one, it is intended to be just part 1. Part 2 is to come out in a couple of years, if all goes well. Part 1 takes us from childhood through the publication of Dawkins' first book, The Selfish Gene, in 1976. Although called ""an intimate memoir"" on the book jacket, the book skirts a lot of what I'd call ""intimate"". For example, his marriages are mentioned in passing, with no information about how Dawkins met the women, what led up to the weddings, anything about their lives together.Similarly, we learn about previous generations of his family, about elementary school and something about the way Dawkins' parents raised Richard, and we learn that the family moved from Africa to England and why, and which schools Richard attended, but really very little about day-to-day life. Instead, we learn how Richard felt about different things that happened in his life, some of which he regretted or could not understand, while others led to his future thinking on evolution. Really, it's a book about how Dawkins came to think as he does, and why he thinks Charles Darwin is really the father of science as we now know it, and certainly why Darwin is Dawkins' hero. The title is revealing in this way. The book explains how Dawkins developed and maintained his appetite for wonder. For those who have not read his other books, this one provides an introduction to The Selfish Gene, offering a brief explanation of the theme of that book. It also lays the foundation of Dawkins' atheism. "
28,0062225790,http://goodreads.com/user/show/15957351-alex-yard,4,"I loved this, it was an unexpected treat. Since Dawkins has written two separate books that have a profound impact on how I perceive the world and live my daily life, it was fascinating to get such an intimate glimpse into his origins, upbringing, formative experiences. Interesting that he spent so much of his early years in South Africa.It offers interesting portrayals of how ""Times were different"" back then, sanitary practices and values/beliefs/behaviors which would be condemned in modern times. Also fun to see Dawkins as a young devout believer and then see the first few moments in which he began to doubt it all.It's interesting to title it Appetite for Wonder because through a lot of his early years he just seemed to be an average kid who was bright but didn't really apply himself in school or his own hobbies. But, once he began studying at the university and research level, it's really awesome how passionate his is about it all. I hate to use that buzzword, sorry, but it's true. It warms your heart to see someone geek out and gush about his experiments measuring the frequency/patterns with which baby chicks peck things. On the surface it seems super boring and whatever, but he actually does a great job showing you how fascinating it is in the context of our gradually increasing understanding of how the brain works, the mechanisms of evolution, all that. The book had lots of laugh out loud moments, I was laughing like an asshole in the break room at work, it was great. Anyways, I'll definitely read the second book that covers the rest of his life, as this book only went from his origins up until the publication of his first book."
29,0062225790,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8780262-jenny,3,"Dawkins is one of my favorite authors. He has a wonderful ability to string together memorably precise phrases, and he is peerless in his position as an 'effective persuader' (as he refers to himself at the end of this book.) Of his books I usually would comment that he has done a great job of taking esoteric scientific concepts and parsing out the heavy data leaving behind reader-friendly knowledge bombs. However, the second half of this book is pretty dense as it explores his graduate research and it's just not as fascinating as I had hoped for. The other big complaint I have is that this is a Memoir and yet it is almost completely devoid of feeling and personal insight. I really enjoyed the first half...as Dawkins relies on his and his mothers' memories to relate family history and childhood anecdotes both humorous and surprising. He adds in emotional reflection here and there as he can, given that some sixty years have elapsed since most of the events. But as the book progressed, I expected his amount of introspection to increase corresponding with his improved level of consciousness and memory. Alas, nope. Just a lot of scatter plots and job shuffling at Oxford. For example, Dawkins' marriage to his first wife, likely a profound moment in his young life, is introduced in half a sentence and then largely ignored for the rest of the book. The title of the book is an ""Appetite for Wonder"" but I felt like Dawkins was just a wee bit peckish for some book learnin'."
30,0062225790,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10360599-alex-daniel,2,"As someone who has read several Dawkins' books, liked (and loved) them, and is a scientist, I should be the target audience for AN APPETITE FOR WONDER. Strangely, I had a hard time picking this one up. But why? Dawkins is a very effective (and often entertaining) writer. I appreciate his contributions to science. And yet, I had only minimal interest in reading this memoir.Perhaps I went into it with the wrong mindset, or perhaps I was right all along, but the first half of the book is devoid of any dramatic relevations or insight. Dawkins grew up in a colony of the British Empire. Had servants. Had family members also in other fields of science. Went to a great boarding school. Was a prefect. Went to an awesome college. Worked with excellent researchers and thinkers. And then, at this memoir's climax, wrote a fantastic book -- THE SELFISH GENE. And that's it.Dawkins has led a good life, and there are some interesting pieces of insight he drops in, but for the most part, I felt nothing. Shame on me, too -- I didn't read the back blurb, and I didn't realize this was only the FIRST memoir of a planned two."
31,0062225790,http://goodreads.com/user/show/27253012-patty,4,"If you are a fan of Dawkins, I expect you'd like this memoir just fine. I found it great; it's a more personal account of Dawkins' upbringing and start in the scientific community with his interest in what he would later coin as the Selfish Gene. It's not terribly interesting, if you are not interested in those details. Within this memoir, he exposes his emotional weakness to poetry, early teenage fan-obsession with Elvis Presely, and the beginning of his relationship with Mariam. I am always enchanted by how Dawkins can spend several pages explaining to you the beauty of a fly, for example. 3.5/4 Stars."
32,0062225790,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4307846-linda-harkins,5,"I read several books by Dawkins during the '90s and discovered that he is the British ethologist who coined the word ""meme"" now embedded in the behavioral sciences. When Susan Blackmore ran with the meme ball, I also read what she had to say on the topic. This book, however, is a memoir of a person born into a family of privilege, a person whose hero is Charles Darwin, a person who writes in such a manner that I'm often amused and enlightened simultaneously. Dawkins is a talented writer who shows the reader how science enriches our lives and debunks myth and superstition."
33,0062225790,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6019174-stu-hall,3,"Started off interesting, faded and repetitive towards the end. I was hoping for a little more about the discovery of the evidence of his own beliefs and would have preferred less detail about the minutiae of pecking chicks."

36,0062225790,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3493901-lindsay-nixon,3,"It is fascinating and wonderful to learn, step-by-step, how Richard Dawkins became, well, Richard Dawkins—the brilliant academic (ethologist, evolutionary biologist). I have never read a memoir like this, it is fitting that the entire memoir feels like an explained equation. It's mathematical and scientific in it's prose: the study, understanding, and explanation of Richard Dawkins. This memoir traces Dawkins' life and how his career shaped. You see the exact path of events in his life and curiosity that led him to become an ethologist, evolutionary biologist, and atheist. This memoir lacks any personal details of his life. He mentions his current and ex-wife in a single sentence, and while he does retell stories of his childhood, they are mostly to give context. For example, his family moved, but this was only told to explain he changed schools, which was only shared because it was at that school, with a new teaching style, that he realized he had no critical thinking skills and from that day on, became passionate about thinking critically. Or how the popularity of computer languages changed his interest and research, or how an electricity shortage forced his study and work projects in a new direction.Most memoirs I have read are mostly ""musings"" stories from the past, which this is not. The stories are picked only to explain the evolution of Dawkins work and mind. Most memoirs also impart nuggets of wisdom—those quotable quotes. This book doesn't do that either. It felt... educational, and that was fine. I usually get a lot out of memoirs--deeper connection to the person, life lessons, advice... not so much here. It felt like a lecture on Dawkins by Dawkins... This is a great memoir for Dawkins fans who want to understand how he came to be and I suspect young scientists and engineers might find comfort in reading his professional path. Everyone else might be a little bored or uninterested. I did take one thing away from it, though: failure is great. Dawkins never saw his failure as a bad thing or seemed disappointed. It was always about the curiosity. Failure gave as much an answer as success and it was the failures that shaped his career ultimately—they were often the branch in the path. Without them, he would not have become the Richard Dawkins we know and admire today."
37,0062225790,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5686119-book,4,"An Appetite for Wonder: The Making of a Scientist by Richard Dawkins “An Appetite for Wonder"" is an intimate memoir of the childhood and development of iconic scientist and renowned atheist, Richard Dawkins. The book covers the first half of his life up until the publishing of his first book and masterpiece, “The Selfish Gene”. This enjoyable and heartfelt 320-page book includes the following chapters: Genes and pith helmets, Camp followers in Kenya, The land of the lake, Eagle in the mountains, Farewell to Africa, Photographic Insert 1, Under Salisbury’s spire, ‘And your English summer’s done’, The spire by the Nene, Photographic Insert 2, Dreaming spires, Learning the trade, West Coast dreamtime, Computer fix, Photographic Insert 3, The grammar of behavior, The immortal gene, and Looking back down the path.Positives:1.	Engaging, warm account of his childhood and early science years. 2.	Dawkins is very candid and forthright in his memoir. Not afraid to be self-deprecating and uncharacteristically pleasant throughout the book. 3.	Three photographic inserts really complement the elegant writing style of Dawkins. A lovely family and fascinating stories and surprises from his childhood. 4.	Fascinating life. The book takes you to Africa where the young Dawkins spent most of his childhood at. Interesting challenges and very candid and respectful of how times were back then. “My next two memories are both of injections: the first by Dr Trim in Kenya and the second (more painful) by a scorpion, later in Nyasaland.” I’m not going to spoil it…bust rest assured, amusing stories.5.	The things that are of interest to Dawkins. “I have always been interested in the deep questions of existence, the questions that religion aspires (and fails) to answer, but I have been fortunate to live in a time when such questions are given scientific rather than supernatural answers.”6.	The book that had the biggest influence on the young Dawkins. 7.	Surprisingly forthcoming. “I was probably a disappointment as a naturalist, too, despite the rare privilege of spending a day with the young David Attenborough, when we were both guests of my Uncle Bill and Aunt Diana.”8.	Surprising issues such as bullying and peer pressure. “We wanted to be accepted by our fellows, especially the influential natural leaders among us; and the ethos of my peers was – until my last year at Oundle – anti-intellectual.”9.	Find out when exactly Dawkins became anti-religious. “If you are going to allow yourself to conjure a designer out of thin air, why not apply the same indulgence to that which he is supposed to have designed, and cut out, so to speak, the middle man?”10.	The musicians that inspired and moved Dawkins. 11.	Dawkins, Oxford and higher education. “I said that Oxford was the making of me, but really it was the tutorial system, which happens to be characteristic of Oxford and Cambridge.” 12.	It wouldn’t be a book about Dawkins if the grand theory of evolution wasn’t a part of it. “He introduced me to, among other things, his – and now my – favourite example of revealingly bad ‘design’ in animals: the recurrent laryngeal nerve.”13.	The moment where Dawkins reveal where his life changed stated unequivocally. 14.	The most important mentors of Dawkins’ life. “The senior figure in 13 Bevington Road was Mike Cullen, probably the most important mentor in my life – and I believe most of my contemporaries in the Animal Behaviour Research Group (ABRG) would agree.”15.	His surprising love-affair with computers. “I published a paper on the Dawkins Organ, and made the software available free of charge.”16.	The lectureship in animal behavior. “We planned a study that would exemplify, and clarify, one of the fundamental concepts of the ethological school of animal behaviour studies, the Fixed Action Pattern.”17.	Dawkins’ projects. It did, however, feed into my next big writing project: a long theoretical paper on ‘Hierarchical organisation as a candidate principle for ethology’.18.	The behind-the-scenes view behind the making of “The Selfish Gene”. “Gene survival is what really matters in natural selection.”19.	The scientists and circumstances that inspired Dawkins to make “The Selfish Gene”. “So Trivers’ name was added to those of Hamilton and Williams among the four authors who had greatest influence on The Selfish Gene.”20.	Links. Negatives:1.	Poor Kindle formatting. The digital version absolutely butchered all the poems. Something that should be remedied soon I hope.2.	The book is first and foremost a memoir, if you are expecting a lot of science or even the Dawkins classic contentious philosophical flair against religion, you will be sorely disappointed. A review of some of the key concepts behind the selfish gene but limited science elsewhere. 3.	I don’t know if Dawkins really explains to satisfaction how and what he felt at that time some of the events occurred. He struggles at times to provide answers regarding his mindset and must rely on and in some cases understandably so, on accounts from third parties (mother). 4.	A timeline of major events and locations would have added value.5.	Not the typical quote-fest that is so endearing to his admirers; yours truly included.6.	Avid fans and readers of Dawkins’ books may feel that the book gets repetitive. Particularly those who have read “The Selfish Gene”. That being said, there is some interesting behind the scenes revelations.In summary, an interesting journey into the first half of Dawkins’ life. This was a very easy and pleasant read. Dawkins is candid and forthcoming and shares an intimate look at his interesting life. The book revolves around his childhood and his early science years and the making of “The Selfish Gene”. Perhaps a little light on the science and the fiery philosophy that we admire and love from Dawkins (I must admit I missed some of that); this is a memoir worth reading.

The parts where he illustrates his vision on education were brilliant .""Shouldn’t children be taught critical, sceptical thinking from an early age? Shouldn’t we all be taught to doubt, to weigh up plausibility, to demand evidence?""He also sparked my interest in Karl Popper's philosophy of science as a two-stage process : coming up with a hypothesis followed by attempts to falsify predictions deduced from it. This book has some interesting parts, however sometimes I found it too boring and the science was a bit heavy. Dawkins talks about an incident when he was stung by a scorpion and I identified one misconception.""..they took turns at trying to suck the poisonout of my foot. That is a recognized emergency procedure for snakebite. I haveno idea whether it is effective with scorpion stings but I am touched that theytried.""But sucking the poison is not effective as the venom spreads quickly through the bloodstream. "

He doesn't even think that children should be ""fooled"" into believing in make-believe--Santa Claus etc. They should be taught to question and to be cynical. He was quite condescending towards people who have religious beliefs. I just got tired of it."

Written with subtle humour and humility this gives a good account of the early life of Dawkins and a very good sneak view of life in the Oxford Colleges. Dawkins seems to have a prodigious memory to be able to detail the way he has of specific anecdotes. Waiting to read the second half which is expected to cover the writing life of Dawkins.

47,0062225790,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4269814-carolyn,4,"This is a delightful book. Not only is Dawkins brilliant, he's witty, charming, and possessed of a deliciously wicked sense of humor. A sample: ""I suspect him [Desmond Morris] of being the original source of a widely circulated anecdote about the film star Diana Dors. She and he came from the same Wiltshire town and were childhood friends. Her real surname was not Dors but Fluck. She was invited back to open some fete or other, and the vicar, thinking to introduce her by the name the locals would have known, genially asked them to welcome the lovely 'Diana ... Clunt.'"" Dawkins was born in Africa. He says, ""I should have been a child naturalist. I had every advantage: not only the perfect early environment of tropical Africa but what should have been the perfect genes to slot into it. For generations, sun-browned Dawkins legs have been striding in khaki shorts through the jungles of Empire."" Nevertheless, he denies any particular interest or skill in that area. He was more interested in philosophical issues, and was often tucked up with a book while his parents urged him out into the healthy outdoors. The unexpected inheritance of a country estate brought the Dawkinses back to England when Richard was 7 (American readers uninterested in his genealogy can safely skip the first chapter). and he was sent off to boarding school. He tells stories he considers embarrassing, many of them because he believed things he was told when they made no sense. He laments children's being taught to memorize rather than think and analyze.In due course he came to Balliol College at Oxford, his father's school, and by happy accident Niko Tinbergen was assigned as his tutor. He developed an interest in ethology, a case of hero-worship for Darwin, and an ""addiction"" to computer programming.As anyone who has read any of his previous books can testify, Dawkins is superbly skilled at explaining complex ideas in clear, nontechnical language. Here he offers several, along with lots of entertaining anecdotes and descriptions of numerous first-rate scientists he counts as personal friends. This book takes him through ""the first half of my life,"" ending with the publication of _The Selfish Gene_ when he was 35. He projects volume 2 of his memoirs to be forthcoming in about two years. I can hardly wait. The e-appendix to the book is available free and without registration at http://www.richarddawkins.net/afw , which provides samples of his stories. "
48,0062225790,http://goodreads.com/user/show/13536962-amanda,3,"Whether you like Richard Dawkins or not, you can't deny that his work in science has been important. Dawkins has had an impact on his field and inspired many people to take an interest in science and reason. And here in AN APPETITE FOR WONDER, he tells us the story of how he became a scientist.The story starts with his ancestors; grandparents, parents, and their siblings. To be honest, I didn't care much for the parts that weren't about his parents, because the rest of the family has a limited role in the rest of the book. Still, the story about his parents and their time in Africa was touching. Moving on, Dawkins tells us stories from his youth; to the time spent in South Africa, to the visits to Britain, and then an eventual move. During this time, he began school, which was very different from the schools we have today in the West. To be fair, the school he entered in Britain was rather different too, and Dawkins comments on this. Dawkins offers anecdotes, funny and honest, about himself during his youth. With many knowing him for his stance on religion and his own atheism, he's honest about his short stints as a Christian in his teenage years. With his usual humor and arrogance (that some hate and some love) he does get in some jabs at religion.As said, some hate and some love his arrogance on certain matters. But you know what? I'd say he's entitled. As we move past his teenage years, we move onto Dawkins' time at college, and his works after that. Regardless what one think of Dawkins, one can't deny he's a brilliant scientist. His work is simply that good. He knows his field. So yes, I'd say he's entitled to respect. However, while I enjoyed reading about his time at college and what he did next, I wasn't that interest in reading the details of his works. Sometimes it got a bit too technical regarding his research and focused less on him as a person and more on his actual work. Which I don't mind reading, but picking up this book I would've preferred to read more about the man behind the work, not the actual work. Still, overall, AN APPETITE FOR WONDER offers a wonderful account of Dawkins' upbringing and how he ended up in science, but for me, personally, some parts simply didn't interest me."
49,0062225790,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4393974-leah-k,3,"An Appetite for Wonder: The Making of a Scientist by Richard Dawkins 307 pages★★★ ½ Richard Dawkins is a prominent ethologist (study of animal behavior) and evolutionary biologist who has published several books on his theories, garnering much attention along the way. One may not always agree with his thoughts but I personally find him to be a very brilliant man and a talented writer on his subjects. This book is his memoir of his childhood up to the publishing of his first book The Selfish Gene in 1976. He plans to publish a second part in a couple years.So with his talent on writing about science, how did he do about writing his own life? Not bad. I have to admit that I was much more intrigued by the first half of this book in which he deals with his childhood and his schooling before going into college. His life as a child was an interesting one and it explains a lot about who he would become later on in life. The second part of this book? Not quite as interesting in my opinion. It is in the second part that he starts his true calling as a scientist and I did find parts fascinating but he had a habit of rambling and when the man gets into a scientific theory, try to stop him. Many sections in the second part read like a scientific journal or like one of his many books (in fact he yanked whole paragraphs from his thesis and first book and placed them into this memoir) and honestly if I wanted that much scientific theory… I would have read one of his scientific theory books. I would have been more interested in a more personal view but overall he left that out once he got into his college years. Yeah yeah, I get it, he’s a biologist so why wouldn’t he talk about his work? But I wish he had balanced it out a bit at the end. With that being said, I still find Dawkins to be a very interesting man and I look forward to his second book (although I fear he will just have a book full of paragraphs from his later books). "

I've loved - and usually have had to take the time to digest the books as they are science heavy, in the best possibly way - all his books I've read. Which is most of them.This one is different. It's his autobiography. Less science, less atheism everywhere. And way more a look at his past. What made this young African-born British lad turn to be a fantastic scientist, and a big voice for the non-religious out there? How did he become what he is? A big part of the answer lies in how The Selfish Gene turned out to exist, and in this book, we get a good look at most of the probable factors.A fascinating man, and a fascinating childhood too. What would have had to be different (or how much could all the things have had to be different) while he'd still turned out to be him instead of someone else? How much could the things have changed before there would not have been The Selfish Gene?I liked the book; I hate having to try to rate it. How can you rate a biography? Yes, it did give me clues about how Dawkins turned out to become himself. But compared to his other works... writing an autobiography can hardly be as good as The God Delusion, can it?As an unrelated side not, I did discover that my cats are Catheists while reading this book - both of them loved to sleep on this particular book while I was trying to read it. It's rare both of them love sleeping on the same books."

But also considering this man left a great amount of influence on my character, on me discovering where I came from and what's my life purpose from a scientific point of view, it would be such a shame not to know 'his own evolution'.Although he spent almost half of the book talking about other people and family members rather than talking about himself, I have never seen 'THE' most arrogant and most aggressive atheist scientist I know, getting this emotional and humble. I liked the poetry parts, when he talked about females, when he shortly described his first sexual experience, but mostly I liked the last chapter about the butterfly -or rather the sneeze- effect. Light book with funny stories of a figure whos fingerprint can not be bounded nor described between two covers of a book. All hail the great Richard Dawkins :)(The audiobook -read by his impressive voice and English- is recommended)"
52,0062225790,http://goodreads.com/user/show/42879342-katheryn-saunders,5,"I like Richard Dawkins. He discusses biology, genetics, and evolution in a way the layperson can easily grasp without being condescending. And I enjoy listening to his voice in audiobooks. In this memoir describing the first half of his life, he is affable, poetic, quirky, and surprisingly sentimental. In an irony I can't ignore, though, he is also regretful of bullying he participated in, either actively or passively by not speaking up. He laments the bullying he witnessed in school and his failure to defend the bullied. He also describes some of the political protests he participated in at Berkley as bullying. And he bemoans that children today can't escape bullying because, when they get home from school, they're subjected to cyberbullying on FaceBook and Twitter. But he himself has gained a reputation as a cyberbully on Twitter. It has damaged his reputation and cost him speaking engagements. It's always hard to admit someone you admire has feet of clay. It's a pity he is not more self-aware. "
53,0062225790,http://goodreads.com/user/show/17687788-carlo-ruggiero,3,"Received an Advanced Reader's Edition of An Appetite for Wonder through GoodReads GiveawayI was somewhat familiar with Dawkins's work, having read selections from some titles and having listened to Magic of Reality on Audio... I had some difficulty with the first half of the book being more of a (private) school recollection; it profited me nothing to read about his old school masters. Dawkins is a brilliant scientist and can write well, but the content was a little lacking, in this reader's opinion. This autobiography is more of an intimate portrait of his life (not that this is a bad thing), rather than his experiences in science. Appetite is subtitled ""The Making of a Scientist,"" so I was hoping for more stories of discovery and experimentation. There are some nice moments of insight throughout the book, but it did fall a little short of my expectations. "
54,0062225790,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6093453-colin,4,"Most people know Richard Dawkins as an outspoken anti-theist. But he's a lot more than that - a prominent ethologist and evolutionary biologist and one of the great early popularisers of science and rational inquiry to the general public. Dawkins' autobiography is in fact half of one - in it, he chronicles his childhood in Africa in the late days of Empire, his schooldays in the British education system of the time - prep schools and public schools and eventually Oxford, and his first forays as an ethologist - a researcher in animal behavior - up to the point where a protracted power shortage led him to write the book that would catapult him to early public prominence - The Selfish Gene.No one can accuse Dawkins of being a bore - he is a wonderful writer, with a special gift for combining clarity with poetic cadence. His recollections of his idyllic childhood in Kenya and Nyasaland - what is now Malawi - are tinged with a kind of genteel nostalgia, suffused with fond anecdotes and snatches of verse, lullabies and epistolary fragments. But far from whitewashing the actions of Empire, he conditions his prose with the implicit awareness of the ills of British colonialism.It might have been tempting to spin a narrative of how his experiences living in the African wild influenced his later decision to become an ethologist, but Dawkins shies away from anything so obvious. He is circumspect in the infinite web of cause and effect relationships that pushed the byways of his life into what he is now.His accounts of schoolboy life in Chafyn Grove and Oundle are oddly evocative of Roald Dahl's more fanciful take on the subject. Fagging (in which new students are de facto slaves to their elders), idiosyncratic masters, and the mischievous antics of his peers feature. Somewhat shocking are his strangely matter-of-fact accounts of pedophile teachers and schoolboy pederasty, which would probably not have had a place in Dahl's tome but invite horrified wonder as to how widespread these kinds of cultures were in 1960s England. In any case, what is most of interest are his recountings of life in Oxford, as well as his early career up to the release of The Selfish Gene - at which the book abruptly ends, in expectation of Part Two, which he says will come in a few years. His is a life of much serendipity, if we believe his account of how he navigated early days under a bevy of excellent educators, mentors and collaborators - and his wry descriptions of his early obsession with programming computers strikes a chord.In the entire volume he suffuses this account of his life with a mixture of self-deprecation, accounts of his moral shortcomings, and homilies to his greatest inspirations, coming across as almost excessively humble but not quite so. Whether or not you buy his humility is one thing; but I personally think he means it all. A man with a greater facility for self-serving self-effacement would not say half the things he does in public.But what I appreciate the most is that he is first and foremost a scientist. As far as he is able, he relates everything to biology. There are parts where, caught by a stray thought, he suddenly branches off into an extended discussion about how that point in his life relates to some scientific theory or snippet of moral philosophy. For example, when talking about how he was made to recite a good-night prayer in school and garbled up the words more and more every night because he didn't actually understand what he was reciting, he suddenly starts talking about how this is a good test of meme theory - how the lack of a ""normalization"" mechanism - i.e. comprehension of the words' meaning - caused a high 'mutation rate' in the words. He also takes the opportunity - when talking about his first magnum opus - to explicate the central thesis of that book to the reader - that we are in effect lumbering vehicles for the propagation of our immortal, selfish genes, which care not for our survival but only their own - in the form of being passed down generation to generation. Some might accuse him of being a kind of in-your-face know-it-all. But I see it as an educator's inveterate failing - that he must fill every crevice of his life in the act of passing knowledge to another. Perhaps that is the common wellspring from which his outspoken atheism originates as well.This book was supposedly met with mixed reviews upon release - one reviewer called it self-absorbed, which is a very bizarre critique for an autobiography. I suppose, when compared to the fiery clarity of The Selfish Gene or the brazenly polemical The God Delusion, this book might seem disappointingly dull. But I think of it as a kind of mellow effort on Dawkins' part to reveal his more human, positive side. I had the occasion to attend a talk of his in Stanford last year where he was promoting his book - which was one of the reasons I even read it in the first place - and far from being the firebrand that he is often caricatured as, he comes across as mild and urbane in person, even when confronted by the inevitable audience questioning on the selfsame topics that have occupied his recent attention. Well, people, you can't have it one way or another. Dawkins is human like the rest of us. If you're wondering whether this book is worth your time - if you're not a Dawkins fan, probably not. But if you're interested in learning more about the biologist behind the anti-theist, go ahead. He may surprise you. And perhaps the book itself, elegantly written as it is, is surely more testament to the harmony between science and poetry - that the infusion of rational inquiry into life's Mystery does not lay it bare, but enriches and enlivens it. I give this book: 4 out of 5 Dawkins Organs"
55,0062225790,http://goodreads.com/user/show/719063-linda,3,"Won an uncorrected proof from Goodreads. (I LOVE when that happens!)Three and a half stars. I didn't realize that this book only covered Dawkins's childhood and early career. The part I'm really interested in comes later, but Dawkins promised a volume 2 in a few years.Every time I bump up against some math/science-- and in this bio, one does-- I realize how lousy I am at it. Dawkins is a scientist with a soft spot for poetry, and he has the ability to quote long passages from memory. I'm lucky to remember the first few digits of pi, and far less likely to be able to explain its significance.And that's why Dawkins is an internationally known and celebrated scientist and bestselling author, and I'm buying lottery tickets."
56,0062225790,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9409644-sarah,0,"You wouldn't think a memoir of one of our century's most prolific scientists would be so cute. The first chapters are about his great-grandparents down to his childhood and it is entirely endearing. There are even sections about his early childhood written by his mother. A few of the chapters Dawkins details a few of his research phases which gets quite dry, but if you stick with it, even a layman such as myself can enjoy it. It feels very honest, but An Appetite for Wonder is not a tell-all. Dawkins doesn't beat around the bush with his point of view (and if you're familiar with him at all, this is obvious), without being overbearing or preachy. Almost like a novel, it leaves me wanting more and excited for part 2."
57,0062225790,http://goodreads.com/user/show/16212136-peter-pete-mcloughlin,4," This autobiography of Richard Dawkins focuses on his intellectual life his growth from his early childhood in colonial Africa. To his schooling in England to oxford and a time at Berkeley in the late sixties involved in antiwar activity. To his development up to his first major work ""the Selfish Gene"" it doesn't go into his personal life more of his intellectual development but it lets you know what is important to him and the ideas that shaped him.

Strangely, I had a hard time picking this one up. But why? Dawkins is a very effective (and often entertaining) writer. I appreciate his contributions to science. And yet, I had only minimal interest in reading this memoir.Perhaps I went into it with the wrong mindset, or perhaps I was right all along, but the first half of the book is devoid of any dramatic relevations or insight. Dawkins grew up in a colony of the British Empire. Had servants. Had family members also in other fields of science. Went to a great boarding school. Was a prefect. Went to an awesome college. Worked with excellent researchers and thinkers. And then, at this memoir's climax, wrote a fantastic book -- THE SELFISH GENE. And that's it.Dawkins has led a good life, and there are some interesting pieces of insight he drops in, but for the most part, I felt nothing. Shame on me, too -- I didn't read the back blurb, and I didn't realize this was only the FIRST memoir of a planned two."
61,0062225790,http://goodreads.com/user/show/27253012-patty,4,"If you are a fan of Dawkins, I expect you'd like this memoir just fine. I found it great; it's a more personal account of Dawkins' upbringing and start in the scientific community with his interest in what he would later coin as the Selfish Gene. It's not terribly interesting, if you are not interested in those details. Within this memoir, he exposes his emotional weakness to poetry, early teenage fan-obsession with Elvis Presely, and the beginning of his relationship with Mariam. I am always enchanted by how Dawkins can spend several pages explaining to you the beauty of a fly, for example. 3.5/4 Stars."
62,0062225790,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4307846-linda-harkins,5,"I read several books by Dawkins during the '90s and discovered that he is the British ethologist who coined the word ""meme"" now embedded in the behavioral sciences. When Susan Blackmore ran with the meme ball, I also read what she had to say on the topic. This book, however, is a memoir of a person born into a family of privilege, a person whose hero is Charles Darwin, a person who writes in such a manner that I'm often amused and enlightened simultaneously. Dawkins is a talented writer who shows the reader how science enriches our lives and debunks myth and superstition."

66,0062225790,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3493901-lindsay-nixon,3,"It is fascinating and wonderful to learn, step-by-step, how Richard Dawkins became, well, Richard Dawkins—the brilliant academic (ethologist, evolutionary biologist). I have never read a memoir like this, it is fitting that the entire memoir feels like an explained equation. It's mathematical and scientific in it's prose: the study, understanding, and explanation of Richard Dawkins. This memoir traces Dawkins' life and how his career shaped. You see the exact path of events in his life and curiosity that led him to become an ethologist, evolutionary biologist, and atheist. This memoir lacks any personal details of his life. He mentions his current and ex-wife in a single sentence, and while he does retell stories of his childhood, they are mostly to give context. For example, his family moved, but this was only told to explain he changed schools, which was only shared because it was at that school, with a new teaching style, that he realized he had no critical thinking skills and from that day on, became passionate about thinking critically. Or how the popularity of computer languages changed his interest and research, or how an electricity shortage forced his study and work projects in a new direction.Most memoirs I have read are mostly ""musings"" stories from the past, which this is not. The stories are picked only to explain the evolution of Dawkins work and mind. Most memoirs also impart nuggets of wisdom—those quotable quotes. This book doesn't do that either. It felt... educational, and that was fine. I usually get a lot out of memoirs--deeper connection to the person, life lessons, advice... not so much here. It felt like a lecture on Dawkins by Dawkins... This is a great memoir for Dawkins fans who want to understand how he came to be and I suspect young scientists and engineers might find comfort in reading his professional path. Everyone else might be a little bored or uninterested. I did take one thing away from it, though: failure is great. Dawkins never saw his failure as a bad thing or seemed disappointed. It was always about the curiosity. Failure gave as much an answer as success and it was the failures that shaped his career ultimately—they were often the branch in the path. Without them, he would not have become the Richard Dawkins we know and admire today."

The book covers the first half of his life up until the publishing of his first book and masterpiece, “The Selfish Gene”. This enjoyable and heartfelt 320-page book includes the following chapters: Genes and pith helmets, Camp followers in Kenya, The land of the lake, Eagle in the mountains, Farewell to Africa, Photographic Insert 1, Under Salisbury’s spire, ‘And your English summer’s done’, The spire by the Nene, Photographic Insert 2, Dreaming spires, Learning the trade, West Coast dreamtime, Computer fix, Photographic Insert 3, The grammar of behavior, The immortal gene, and Looking back down the path.Positives:1.	Engaging, warm account of his childhood and early science years. 2.	Dawkins is very candid and forthright in his memoir. Not afraid to be self-deprecating and uncharacteristically pleasant throughout the book. 3.	Three photographic inserts really complement the elegant writing style of Dawkins. A lovely family and fascinating stories and surprises from his childhood. 4.	Fascinating life. The book takes you to Africa where the young Dawkins spent most of his childhood at. Interesting challenges and very candid and respectful of how times were back then. “My next two memories are both of injections: the first by Dr Trim in Kenya and the second (more painful) by a scorpion, later in Nyasaland.” I’m not going to spoil it…bust rest assured, amusing stories.5.	The things that are of interest to Dawkins. “I have always been interested in the deep questions of existence, the questions that religion aspires (and fails) to answer, but I have been fortunate to live in a time when such questions are given scientific rather than supernatural answers.”6.	The book that had the biggest influence on the young Dawkins. 7.	Surprisingly forthcoming. “I was probably a disappointment as a naturalist, too, despite the rare privilege of spending a day with the young David Attenborough, when we were both guests of my Uncle Bill and Aunt Diana.”8.	Surprising issues such as bullying and peer pressure. “We wanted to be accepted by our fellows, especially the influential natural leaders among us; and the ethos of my peers was – until my last year at Oundle – anti-intellectual.”9.	Find out when exactly Dawkins became anti-religious. “If you are going to allow yourself to conjure a designer out of thin air, why not apply the same indulgence to that which he is supposed to have designed, and cut out, so to speak, the middle man?”10.	The musicians that inspired and moved Dawkins. 11.	Dawkins, Oxford and higher education. “I said that Oxford was the making of me, but really it was the tutorial system, which happens to be characteristic of Oxford and Cambridge.” 12.	It wouldn’t be a book about Dawkins if the grand theory of evolution wasn’t a part of it. “He introduced me to, among other things, his – and now my – favourite example of revealingly bad ‘design’ in animals: the recurrent laryngeal nerve.”13.	The moment where Dawkins reveal where his life changed stated unequivocally. 14.	The most important mentors of Dawkins’ life. “The senior figure in 13 Bevington Road was Mike Cullen, probably the most important mentor in my life – and I believe most of my contemporaries in the Animal Behaviour Research Group (ABRG) would agree.”15.	His surprising love-affair with computers. “I published a paper on the Dawkins Organ, and made the software available free of charge.”16.	The lectureship in animal behavior. “We planned a study that would exemplify, and clarify, one of the fundamental concepts of the ethological school of animal behaviour studies, the Fixed Action Pattern.”17.	Dawkins’ projects. It did, however, feed into my next big writing project: a long theoretical paper on ‘Hierarchical organisation as a candidate principle for ethology’.18.	The behind-the-scenes view behind the making of “The Selfish Gene”. “Gene survival is what really matters in natural selection.”19.	The scientists and circumstances that inspired Dawkins to make “The Selfish Gene”. “So Trivers’ name was added to those of Hamilton and Williams among the four authors who had greatest influence on The Selfish Gene.”20.	Links. Negatives:1.	Poor Kindle formatting. The digital version absolutely butchered all the poems. Something that should be remedied soon I hope.2.	The book is first and foremost a memoir, if you are expecting a lot of science or even the Dawkins classic contentious philosophical flair against religion, you will be sorely disappointed. A review of some of the key concepts behind the selfish gene but limited science elsewhere. 3.	I don’t know if Dawkins really explains to satisfaction how and what he felt at that time some of the events occurred. He struggles at times to provide answers regarding his mindset and must rely on and in some cases understandably so, on accounts from third parties (mother). 4.	A timeline of major events and locations would have added value.5.	Not the typical quote-fest that is so endearing to his admirers; yours truly included.6.	Avid fans and readers of Dawkins’ books may feel that the book gets repetitive. Particularly those who have read “The Selfish Gene”. That being said, there is some interesting behind the scenes revelations.In summary, an interesting journey into the first half of Dawkins’ life. This was a very easy and pleasant read. Dawkins is candid and forthcoming and shares an intimate look at his interesting life. The book revolves around his childhood and his early science years and the making of “The Selfish Gene”. Perhaps a little light on the science and the fiery philosophy that we admire and love from Dawkins (I must admit I missed some of that); this is a memoir worth reading. I highly recommend it with the reservations noted. Further recommendations: “The Selfish Gene” and “The Greatest Shown On Earth” by the same author, “Evolving Out of Eden” by Robert M.

The parts where he illustrates his vision on education were brilliant .""Shouldn’t children be taught critical, sceptical thinking from an early age? Shouldn’t we all be taught to doubt, to weigh up plausibility, to demand evidence?""He also sparked my interest in Karl Popper's philosophy of science as a two-stage process : coming up with a hypothesis followed by attempts to falsify predictions deduced from it. This book has some interesting parts, however sometimes I found it too boring and the science was a bit heavy. Dawkins talks about an incident when he was stung by a scorpion and I identified one misconception.""..they took turns at trying to suck the poisonout of my foot. That is a recognized emergency procedure for snakebite.

Written with subtle humour and humility this gives a good account of the early life of Dawkins and a very good sneak view of life in the Oxford Colleges. Dawkins seems to have a prodigious memory to be able to detail the way he has of specific anecdotes. Waiting to read the second half which is expected to cover the writing life of Dawkins.

77,0062225790,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4269814-carolyn,4,"This is a delightful book. Not only is Dawkins brilliant, he's witty, charming, and possessed of a deliciously wicked sense of humor. A sample: ""I suspect him [Desmond Morris] of being the original source of a widely circulated anecdote about the film star Diana Dors. She and he came from the same Wiltshire town and were childhood friends. Her real surname was not Dors but Fluck. She was invited back to open some fete or other, and the vicar, thinking to introduce her by the name the locals would have known, genially asked them to welcome the lovely 'Diana ... Clunt.'"" Dawkins was born in Africa. He says, ""I should have been a child naturalist. I had every advantage: not only the perfect early environment of tropical Africa but what should have been the perfect genes to slot into it. For generations, sun-browned Dawkins legs have been striding in khaki shorts through the jungles of Empire."" Nevertheless, he denies any particular interest or skill in that area. He was more interested in philosophical issues, and was often tucked up with a book while his parents urged him out into the healthy outdoors. The unexpected inheritance of a country estate brought the Dawkinses back to England when Richard was 7 (American readers uninterested in his genealogy can safely skip the first chapter). and he was sent off to boarding school. He tells stories he considers embarrassing, many of them because he believed things he was told when they made no sense. He laments children's being taught to memorize rather than think and analyze.In due course he came to Balliol College at Oxford, his father's school, and by happy accident Niko Tinbergen was assigned as his tutor. He developed an interest in ethology, a case of hero-worship for Darwin, and an ""addiction"" to computer programming.As anyone who has read any of his previous books can testify, Dawkins is superbly skilled at explaining complex ideas in clear, nontechnical language. Here he offers several, along with lots of entertaining anecdotes and descriptions of numerous first-rate scientists he counts as personal friends. This book takes him through ""the first half of my life,"" ending with the publication of _The Selfish Gene_ when he was 35. He projects volume 2 of his memoirs to be forthcoming in about two years. I can hardly wait. The e-appendix to the book is available free and without registration at http://www.richarddawkins.net/afw , which provides samples of his stories. "
78,0062225790,http://goodreads.com/user/show/13536962-amanda,3,"Whether you like Richard Dawkins or not, you can't deny that his work in science has been important. Dawkins has had an impact on his field and inspired many people to take an interest in science and reason. And here in AN APPETITE FOR WONDER, he tells us the story of how he became a scientist.The story starts with his ancestors; grandparents, parents, and their siblings. To be honest, I didn't care much for the parts that weren't about his parents, because the rest of the family has a limited role in the rest of the book. Still, the story about his parents and their time in Africa was touching. Moving on, Dawkins tells us stories from his youth; to the time spent in South Africa, to the visits to Britain, and then an eventual move. During this time, he began school, which was very different from the schools we have today in the West. To be fair, the school he entered in Britain was rather different too, and Dawkins comments on this. Dawkins offers anecdotes, funny and honest, about himself during his youth. With many knowing him for his stance on religion and his own atheism, he's honest about his short stints as a Christian in his teenage years. With his usual humor and arrogance (that some hate and some love) he does get in some jabs at religion.As said, some hate and some love his arrogance on certain matters. But you know what? I'd say he's entitled. As we move past his teenage years, we move onto Dawkins' time at college, and his works after that. Regardless what one think of Dawkins, one can't deny he's a brilliant scientist. His work is simply that good. He knows his field. So yes, I'd say he's entitled to respect. However, while I enjoyed reading about his time at college and what he did next, I wasn't that interest in reading the details of his works. Sometimes it got a bit too technical regarding his research and focused less on him as a person and more on his actual work. Which I don't mind reading, but picking up this book I would've preferred to read more about the man behind the work, not the actual work. Still, overall, AN APPETITE FOR WONDER offers a wonderful account of Dawkins' upbringing and how he ended up in science, but for me, personally, some parts simply didn't interest me."
79,0062225790,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4393974-leah-k,3,"An Appetite for Wonder: The Making of a Scientist by Richard Dawkins 307 pages★★★ ½ Richard Dawkins is a prominent ethologist (study of animal behavior) and evolutionary biologist who has published several books on his theories, garnering much attention along the way. One may not always agree with his thoughts but I personally find him to be a very brilliant man and a talented writer on his subjects. This book is his memoir of his childhood up to the publishing of his first book The Selfish Gene in 1976. He plans to publish a second part in a couple years.So with his talent on writing about science, how did he do about writing his own life? Not bad. I have to admit that I was much more intrigued by the first half of this book in which he deals with his childhood and his schooling before going into college. His life as a child was an interesting one and it explains a lot about who he would become later on in life. The second part of this book? Not quite as interesting in my opinion. It is in the second part that he starts his true calling as a scientist and I did find parts fascinating but he had a habit of rambling and when the man gets into a scientific theory, try to stop him. Many sections in the second part read like a scientific journal or like one of his many books (in fact he yanked whole paragraphs from his thesis and first book and placed them into this memoir) and honestly if I wanted that much scientific theory… I would have read one of his scientific theory books. I would have been more interested in a more personal view but overall he left that out once he got into his college years. Yeah yeah, I get it, he’s a biologist so why wouldn’t he talk about his work? But I wish he had balanced it out a bit at the end. With that being said, I still find Dawkins to be a very interesting man and I look forward to his second book (although I fear he will just have a book full of paragraphs from his later books). "

I've loved - and usually have had to take the time to digest the books as they are science heavy, in the best possibly way - all his books I've read. Which is most of them.This one is different. It's his autobiography. Less science, less atheism everywhere. And way more a look at his past. What made this young African-born British lad turn to be a fantastic scientist, and a big voice for the non-religious out there? How did he become what he is? A big part of the answer lies in how The Selfish Gene turned out to exist, and in this book, we get a good look at most of the probable factors.A fascinating man, and a fascinating childhood too. What would have had to be different (or how much could all the things have had to be different) while he'd still turned out to be him instead of someone else? How much could the things have changed before there would not have been The Selfish Gene?I liked the book; I hate having to try to rate it. How can you rate a biography? Yes, it did give me clues about how Dawkins turned out to become himself. But compared to his other works... writing an autobiography can hardly be as good as The God Delusion, can it?As an unrelated side not, I did discover that my cats are Catheists while reading this book - both of them loved to sleep on this particular book while I was trying to read it. It's rare both of them love sleeping on the same books."

But also considering this man left a great amount of influence on my character, on me discovering where I came from and what's my life purpose from a scientific point of view, it would be such a shame not to know 'his own evolution'.Although he spent almost half of the book talking about other people and family members rather than talking about himself, I have never seen 'THE' most arrogant and most aggressive atheist scientist I know, getting this emotional and humble. I liked the poetry parts, when he talked about females, when he shortly described his first sexual experience, but mostly I liked the last chapter about the butterfly -or rather the sneeze- effect. Light book with funny stories of a figure whos fingerprint can not be bounded nor described between two covers of a book. All hail the great Richard Dawkins :)(The audiobook -read by his impressive voice and English- is recommended)"
82,0062225790,http://goodreads.com/user/show/42879342-katheryn-saunders,5,"I like Richard Dawkins. He discusses biology, genetics, and evolution in a way the layperson can easily grasp without being condescending. And I enjoy listening to his voice in audiobooks. In this memoir describing the first half of his life, he is affable, poetic, quirky, and surprisingly sentimental. In an irony I can't ignore, though, he is also regretful of bullying he participated in, either actively or passively by not speaking up. He laments the bullying he witnessed in school and his failure to defend the bullied. He also describes some of the political protests he participated in at Berkley as bullying. And he bemoans that children today can't escape bullying because, when they get home from school, they're subjected to cyberbullying on FaceBook and Twitter. But he himself has gained a reputation as a cyberbully on Twitter. It has damaged his reputation and cost him speaking engagements. It's always hard to admit someone you admire has feet of clay. It's a pity he is not more self-aware. "
83,0062225790,http://goodreads.com/user/show/17687788-carlo-ruggiero,3,"Received an Advanced Reader's Edition of An Appetite for Wonder through GoodReads GiveawayI was somewhat familiar with Dawkins's work, having read selections from some titles and having listened to Magic of Reality on Audio... I had some difficulty with the first half of the book being more of a (private) school recollection; it profited me nothing to read about his old school masters. Dawkins is a brilliant scientist and can write well, but the content was a little lacking, in this reader's opinion. This autobiography is more of an intimate portrait of his life (not that this is a bad thing), rather than his experiences in science. Appetite is subtitled ""The Making of a Scientist,"" so I was hoping for more stories of discovery and experimentation. There are some nice moments of insight throughout the book, but it did fall a little short of my expectations. "
84,0062225790,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6093453-colin,4,"Most people know Richard Dawkins as an outspoken anti-theist. But he's a lot more than that - a prominent ethologist and evolutionary biologist and one of the great early popularisers of science and rational inquiry to the general public. Dawkins' autobiography is in fact half of one - in it, he chronicles his childhood in Africa in the late days of Empire, his schooldays in the British education system of the time - prep schools and public schools and eventually Oxford, and his first forays as an ethologist - a researcher in animal behavior - up to the point where a protracted power shortage led him to write the book that would catapult him to early public prominence - The Selfish Gene.No one can accuse Dawkins of being a bore - he is a wonderful writer, with a special gift for combining clarity with poetic cadence. His recollections of his idyllic childhood in Kenya and Nyasaland - what is now Malawi - are tinged with a kind of genteel nostalgia, suffused with fond anecdotes and snatches of verse, lullabies and epistolary fragments. But far from whitewashing the actions of Empire, he conditions his prose with the implicit awareness of the ills of British colonialism.It might have been tempting to spin a narrative of how his experiences living in the African wild influenced his later decision to become an ethologist, but Dawkins shies away from anything so obvious. He is circumspect in the infinite web of cause and effect relationships that pushed the byways of his life into what he is now.His accounts of schoolboy life in Chafyn Grove and Oundle are oddly evocative of Roald Dahl's more fanciful take on the subject. Fagging (in which new students are de facto slaves to their elders), idiosyncratic masters, and the mischievous antics of his peers feature. Somewhat shocking are his strangely matter-of-fact accounts of pedophile teachers and schoolboy pederasty, which would probably not have had a place in Dahl's tome but invite horrified wonder as to how widespread these kinds of cultures were in 1960s England. In any case, what is most of interest are his recountings of life in Oxford, as well as his early career up to the release of The Selfish Gene - at which the book abruptly ends, in expectation of Part Two, which he says will come in a few years. His is a life of much serendipity, if we believe his account of how he navigated early days under a bevy of excellent educators, mentors and collaborators - and his wry descriptions of his early obsession with programming computers strikes a chord.In the entire volume he suffuses this account of his life with a mixture of self-deprecation, accounts of his moral shortcomings, and homilies to his greatest inspirations, coming across as almost excessively humble but not quite so. Whether or not you buy his humility is one thing; but I personally think he means it all. A man with a greater facility for self-serving self-effacement would not say half the things he does in public.But what I appreciate the most is that he is first and foremost a scientist. As far as he is able, he relates everything to biology. There are parts where, caught by a stray thought, he suddenly branches off into an extended discussion about how that point in his life relates to some scientific theory or snippet of moral philosophy. For example, when talking about how he was made to recite a good-night prayer in school and garbled up the words more and more every night because he didn't actually understand what he was reciting, he suddenly starts talking about how this is a good test of meme theory - how the lack of a ""normalization"" mechanism - i.e. comprehension of the words' meaning - caused a high 'mutation rate' in the words. He also takes the opportunity - when talking about his first magnum opus - to explicate the central thesis of that book to the reader - that we are in effect lumbering vehicles for the propagation of our immortal, selfish genes, which care not for our survival but only their own - in the form of being passed down generation to generation. Some might accuse him of being a kind of in-your-face know-it-all. But I see it as an educator's inveterate failing - that he must fill every crevice of his life in the act of passing knowledge to another. Perhaps that is the common wellspring from which his outspoken atheism originates as well.This book was supposedly met with mixed reviews upon release - one reviewer called it self-absorbed, which is a very bizarre critique for an autobiography. I suppose, when compared to the fiery clarity of The Selfish Gene or the brazenly polemical The God Delusion, this book might seem disappointingly dull. But I think of it as a kind of mellow effort on Dawkins' part to reveal his more human, positive side. I had the occasion to attend a talk of his in Stanford last year where he was promoting his book - which was one of the reasons I even read it in the first place - and far from being the firebrand that he is often caricatured as, he comes across as mild and urbane in person, even when confronted by the inevitable audience questioning on the selfsame topics that have occupied his recent attention. Well, people, you can't have it one way or another. Dawkins is human like the rest of us. If you're wondering whether this book is worth your time - if you're not a Dawkins fan, probably not. But if you're interested in learning more about the biologist behind the anti-theist, go ahead. He may surprise you. And perhaps the book itself, elegantly written as it is, is surely more testament to the harmony between science and poetry - that the infusion of rational inquiry into life's Mystery does not lay it bare, but enriches and enlivens it. I give this book: 4 out of 5 Dawkins Organs"

I didn't realize that this book only covered Dawkins's childhood and early career. The part I'm really interested in comes later, but Dawkins promised a volume 2 in a few years.Every time I bump up against some math/science-- and in this bio, one does-- I realize how lousy I am at it. Dawkins is a scientist with a soft spot for poetry, and he has the ability to quote long passages from memory. I'm lucky to remember the first few digits of pi, and far less likely to be able to explain its significance.And that's why Dawkins is an internationally known and celebrated scientist and bestselling author, and I'm buying lottery tickets."
86,0062225790,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9409644-sarah,0,"You wouldn't think a memoir of one of our century's most prolific scientists would be so cute. The first chapters are about his great-grandparents down to his childhood and it is entirely endearing. There are even sections about his early childhood written by his mother. A few of the chapters Dawkins details a few of his research phases which gets quite dry, but if you stick with it, even a layman such as myself can enjoy it. It feels very honest, but An Appetite for Wonder is not a tell-all. Dawkins doesn't beat around the bush with his point of view (and if you're familiar with him at all, this is obvious), without being overbearing or preachy. Almost like a novel, it leaves me wanting more and excited for part 2."

To his schooling in England to oxford and a time at Berkeley in the late sixties involved in antiwar activity. To his development up to his first major work ""the Selfish Gene"" it doesn't go into his personal life more of his intellectual development but it lets you know what is important to him and the ideas that shaped him.

Strangely, I had a hard time picking this one up. But why? Dawkins is a very effective (and often entertaining) writer. I appreciate his contributions to science. And yet, I had only minimal interest in reading this memoir.Perhaps I went into it with the wrong mindset, or perhaps I was right all along, but the first half of the book is devoid of any dramatic relevations or insight. Dawkins grew up in a colony of the British Empire. Had servants. Had family members also in other fields of science. Went to a great boarding school. Was a prefect. Went to an awesome college. Worked with excellent researchers and thinkers. And then, at this memoir's climax, wrote a fantastic book -- THE SELFISH GENE. And that's it.Dawkins has led a good life, and there are some interesting pieces of insight he drops in, but for the most part, I felt nothing. Shame on me, too -- I didn't read the back blurb, and I didn't realize this was only the FIRST memoir of a planned two."
91,0062225790,http://goodreads.com/user/show/27253012-patty,4,"If you are a fan of Dawkins, I expect you'd like this memoir just fine. I found it great; it's a more personal account of Dawkins' upbringing and start in the scientific community with his interest in what he would later coin as the Selfish Gene. It's not terribly interesting, if you are not interested in those details. Within this memoir, he exposes his emotional weakness to poetry, early teenage fan-obsession with Elvis Presely, and the beginning of his relationship with Mariam. I am always enchanted by how Dawkins can spend several pages explaining to you the beauty of a fly, for example. 3.5/4 Stars."
92,0062225790,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4307846-linda-harkins,5,"I read several books by Dawkins during the '90s and discovered that he is the British ethologist who coined the word ""meme"" now embedded in the behavioral sciences. When Susan Blackmore ran with the meme ball, I also read what she had to say on the topic. This book, however, is a memoir of a person born into a family of privilege, a person whose hero is Charles Darwin, a person who writes in such a manner that I'm often amused and enlightened simultaneously. Dawkins is a talented writer who shows the reader how science enriches our lives and debunks myth and superstition."

It's mathematical and scientific in it's prose: the study, understanding, and explanation of Richard Dawkins. This memoir traces Dawkins' life and how his career shaped. You see the exact path of events in his life and curiosity that led him to become an ethologist, evolutionary biologist, and atheist. This memoir lacks any personal details of his life. He mentions his current and ex-wife in a single sentence, and while he does retell stories of his childhood, they are mostly to give context. For example, his family moved, but this was only told to explain he changed schools, which was only shared because it was at that school, with a new teaching style, that he realized he had no critical thinking skills and from that day on, became passionate about thinking critically. Or how the popularity of computer languages changed his interest and research, or how an electricity shortage forced his study and work projects in a new direction.Most memoirs I have read are mostly ""musings"" stories from the past, which this is not. The stories are picked only to explain the evolution of Dawkins work and mind. Most memoirs also impart nuggets of wisdom—those quotable quotes. This book doesn't do that either. It felt... educational, and that was fine. I usually get a lot out of memoirs--deeper connection to the person, life lessons, advice... not so much here. It felt like a lecture on Dawkins by Dawkins... This is a great memoir for Dawkins fans who want to understand how he came to be and I suspect young scientists and engineers might find comfort in reading his professional path. Everyone else might be a little bored or uninterested. I did take one thing away from it, though: failure is great. Dawkins never saw his failure as a bad thing or seemed disappointed. It was always about the curiosity. Failure gave as much an answer as success and it was the failures that shaped his career ultimately—they were often the branch in the path. Without them, he would not have become the Richard Dawkins we know and admire today."
97,0062225790,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5686119-book,4,"An Appetite for Wonder: The Making of a Scientist by Richard Dawkins “An Appetite for Wonder"" is an intimate memoir of the childhood and development of iconic scientist and renowned atheist, Richard Dawkins. The book covers the first half of his life up until the publishing of his first book and masterpiece, “The Selfish Gene”. This enjoyable and heartfelt 320-page book includes the following chapters: Genes and pith helmets, Camp followers in Kenya, The land of the lake, Eagle in the mountains, Farewell to Africa, Photographic Insert 1, Under Salisbury’s spire, ‘And your English summer’s done’, The spire by the Nene, Photographic Insert 2, Dreaming spires, Learning the trade, West Coast dreamtime, Computer fix, Photographic Insert 3, The grammar of behavior, The immortal gene, and Looking back down the path.Positives:1.	Engaging, warm account of his childhood and early science years. 2.	Dawkins is very candid and forthright in his memoir. Not afraid to be self-deprecating and uncharacteristically pleasant throughout the book. 3.	Three photographic inserts really complement the elegant writing style of Dawkins. A lovely family and fascinating stories and surprises from his childhood. 4.	Fascinating life. The book takes you to Africa where the young Dawkins spent most of his childhood at. Interesting challenges and very candid and respectful of how times were back then. “My next two memories are both of injections: the first by Dr Trim in Kenya and the second (more painful) by a scorpion, later in Nyasaland.” I’m not going to spoil it…bust rest assured, amusing stories.5.	The things that are of interest to Dawkins. “I have always been interested in the deep questions of existence, the questions that religion aspires (and fails) to answer, but I have been fortunate to live in a time when such questions are given scientific rather than supernatural answers.”6.	The book that had the biggest influence on the young Dawkins. 7.	Surprisingly forthcoming. “I was probably a disappointment as a naturalist, too, despite the rare privilege of spending a day with the young David Attenborough, when we were both guests of my Uncle Bill and Aunt Diana.”8.	Surprising issues such as bullying and peer pressure. “We wanted to be accepted by our fellows, especially the influential natural leaders among us; and the ethos of my peers was – until my last year at Oundle – anti-intellectual.”9.	Find out when exactly Dawkins became anti-religious. “If you are going to allow yourself to conjure a designer out of thin air, why not apply the same indulgence to that which he is supposed to have designed, and cut out, so to speak, the middle man?”10.	The musicians that inspired and moved Dawkins. 11.	Dawkins, Oxford and higher education. “I said that Oxford was the making of me, but really it was the tutorial system, which happens to be characteristic of Oxford and Cambridge.” 12.	It wouldn’t be a book about Dawkins if the grand theory of evolution wasn’t a part of it. “He introduced me to, among other things, his – and now my – favourite example of revealingly bad ‘design’ in animals: the recurrent laryngeal nerve.”13.	The moment where Dawkins reveal where his life changed stated unequivocally. 14.	The most important mentors of Dawkins’ life. “The senior figure in 13 Bevington Road was Mike Cullen, probably the most important mentor in my life – and I believe most of my contemporaries in the Animal Behaviour Research Group (ABRG) would agree.”15.	His surprising love-affair with computers. “I published a paper on the Dawkins Organ, and made the software available free of charge.”16.	The lectureship in animal behavior. “We planned a study that would exemplify, and clarify, one of the fundamental concepts of the ethological school of animal behaviour studies, the Fixed Action Pattern.”17.	Dawkins’ projects. It did, however, feed into my next big writing project: a long theoretical paper on ‘Hierarchical organisation as a candidate principle for ethology’.18.	The behind-the-scenes view behind the making of “The Selfish Gene”. “Gene survival is what really matters in natural selection.”19.	The scientists and circumstances that inspired Dawkins to make “The Selfish Gene”. “So Trivers’ name was added to those of Hamilton and Williams among the four authors who had greatest influence on The Selfish Gene.”20.	Links. Negatives:1.	Poor Kindle formatting. The digital version absolutely butchered all the poems. Something that should be remedied soon I hope.2.	The book is first and foremost a memoir, if you are expecting a lot of science or even the Dawkins classic contentious philosophical flair against religion, you will be sorely disappointed. A review of some of the key concepts behind the selfish gene but limited science elsewhere. 3.	I don’t know if Dawkins really explains to satisfaction how and what he felt at that time some of the events occurred. He struggles at times to provide answers regarding his mindset and must rely on and in some cases understandably so, on accounts from third parties (mother). 4.	A timeline of major events and locations would have added value.5.	Not the typical quote-fest that is so endearing to his admirers; yours truly included.6.	Avid fans and readers of Dawkins’ books may feel that the book gets repetitive. Particularly those who have read “The Selfish Gene”. That being said, there is some interesting behind the scenes revelations.In summary, an interesting journey into the first half of Dawkins’ life. This was a very easy and pleasant read. Dawkins is candid and forthcoming and shares an intimate look at his interesting life. The book revolves around his childhood and his early science years and the making of “The Selfish Gene”. Perhaps a little light on the science and the fiery philosophy that we admire and love from Dawkins (I must admit I missed some of that); this is a memoir worth reading. I highly recommend it with the reservations noted. Further recommendations: “The Selfish Gene” and “The Greatest Shown On Earth” by the same author, “Evolving Out of Eden” by Robert M.

The parts where he illustrates his vision on education were brilliant .""Shouldn’t children be taught critical, sceptical thinking from an early age? Shouldn’t we all be taught to doubt, to weigh up plausibility, to demand evidence?""He also sparked my interest in Karl Popper's philosophy of science as a two-stage process : coming up with a hypothesis followed by attempts to falsify predictions deduced from it. This book has some interesting parts, however sometimes I found it too boring and the science was a bit heavy. Dawkins talks about an incident when he was stung by a scorpion and I identified one misconception.""..they took turns at trying to suck the poisonout of my foot. That is a recognized emergency procedure for snakebite. I haveno idea whether it is effective with scorpion stings but I am touched that theytried.""But sucking the poison is not effective as the venom spreads quickly through the bloodstream. "

He doesn't even think that children should be ""fooled"" into believing in make-believe--Santa Claus etc. They should be taught to question and to be cynical. He was quite condescending towards people who have religious beliefs. I just got tired of it."

Written with subtle humour and humility this gives a good account of the early life of Dawkins and a very good sneak view of life in the Oxford Colleges. Dawkins seems to have a prodigious memory to be able to detail the way he has of specific anecdotes. Waiting to read the second half which is expected to cover the writing life of Dawkins. 
106,0062225790,http://goodreads.com/user/show/39364424-eric,3,"An autobiography of Dawkins' early life through the publishing of ""The Selfish Gene"" in 1976, with plenty of anecdotes of his days at boarding school as a young child. I found the last few chapters, leading up to and including the writing of his first book, to be the most interesting."
107,0062225790,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4269814-carolyn,4,"This is a delightful book. Not only is Dawkins brilliant, he's witty, charming, and possessed of a deliciously wicked sense of humor. A sample: ""I suspect him [Desmond Morris] of being the original source of a widely circulated anecdote about the film star Diana Dors. She and he came from the same Wiltshire town and were childhood friends. Her real surname was not Dors but Fluck. She was invited back to open some fete or other, and the vicar, thinking to introduce her by the name the locals would have known, genially asked them to welcome the lovely 'Diana ... Clunt.'"" Dawkins was born in Africa. He says, ""I should have been a child naturalist. I had every advantage: not only the perfect early environment of tropical Africa but what should have been the perfect genes to slot into it. For generations, sun-browned Dawkins legs have been striding in khaki shorts through the jungles of Empire."" Nevertheless, he denies any particular interest or skill in that area. He was more interested in philosophical issues, and was often tucked up with a book while his parents urged him out into the healthy outdoors. The unexpected inheritance of a country estate brought the Dawkinses back to England when Richard was 7 (American readers uninterested in his genealogy can safely skip the first chapter). and he was sent off to boarding school. He tells stories he considers embarrassing, many of them because he believed things he was told when they made no sense. He laments children's being taught to memorize rather than think and analyze.In due course he came to Balliol College at Oxford, his father's school, and by happy accident Niko Tinbergen was assigned as his tutor. He developed an interest in ethology, a case of hero-worship for Darwin, and an ""addiction"" to computer programming.As anyone who has read any of his previous books can testify, Dawkins is superbly skilled at explaining complex ideas in clear, nontechnical language. Here he offers several, along with lots of entertaining anecdotes and descriptions of numerous first-rate scientists he counts as personal friends. This book takes him through ""the first half of my life,"" ending with the publication of _The Selfish Gene_ when he was 35. He projects volume 2 of his memoirs to be forthcoming in about two years. I can hardly wait. The e-appendix to the book is available free and without registration at http://www.richarddawkins.net/afw , which provides samples of his stories. "
108,0062225790,http://goodreads.com/user/show/13536962-amanda,3,"Whether you like Richard Dawkins or not, you can't deny that his work in science has been important. Dawkins has had an impact on his field and inspired many people to take an interest in science and reason. And here in AN APPETITE FOR WONDER, he tells us the story of how he became a scientist.The story starts with his ancestors; grandparents, parents, and their siblings. To be honest, I didn't care much for the parts that weren't about his parents, because the rest of the family has a limited role in the rest of the book. Still, the story about his parents and their time in Africa was touching. Moving on, Dawkins tells us stories from his youth; to the time spent in South Africa, to the visits to Britain, and then an eventual move. During this time, he began school, which was very different from the schools we have today in the West. To be fair, the school he entered in Britain was rather different too, and Dawkins comments on this. Dawkins offers anecdotes, funny and honest, about himself during his youth. With many knowing him for his stance on religion and his own atheism, he's honest about his short stints as a Christian in his teenage years. With his usual humor and arrogance (that some hate and some love) he does get in some jabs at religion.As said, some hate and some love his arrogance on certain matters. But you know what? I'd say he's entitled. As we move past his teenage years, we move onto Dawkins' time at college, and his works after that. Regardless what one think of Dawkins, one can't deny he's a brilliant scientist. His work is simply that good. He knows his field. So yes, I'd say he's entitled to respect. However, while I enjoyed reading about his time at college and what he did next, I wasn't that interest in reading the details of his works. Sometimes it got a bit too technical regarding his research and focused less on him as a person and more on his actual work. Which I don't mind reading, but picking up this book I would've preferred to read more about the man behind the work, not the actual work. Still, overall, AN APPETITE FOR WONDER offers a wonderful account of Dawkins' upbringing and how he ended up in science, but for me, personally, some parts simply didn't interest me."
109,0062225790,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4393974-leah-k,3,"An Appetite for Wonder: The Making of a Scientist by Richard Dawkins 307 pages★★★ ½ Richard Dawkins is a prominent ethologist (study of animal behavior) and evolutionary biologist who has published several books on his theories, garnering much attention along the way. One may not always agree with his thoughts but I personally find him to be a very brilliant man and a talented writer on his subjects. This book is his memoir of his childhood up to the publishing of his first book The Selfish Gene in 1976. He plans to publish a second part in a couple years.So with his talent on writing about science, how did he do about writing his own life? Not bad. I have to admit that I was much more intrigued by the first half of this book in which he deals with his childhood and his schooling before going into college. His life as a child was an interesting one and it explains a lot about who he would become later on in life. The second part of this book? Not quite as interesting in my opinion. It is in the second part that he starts his true calling as a scientist and I did find parts fascinating but he had a habit of rambling and when the man gets into a scientific theory, try to stop him. Many sections in the second part read like a scientific journal or like one of his many books (in fact he yanked whole paragraphs from his thesis and first book and placed them into this memoir) and honestly if I wanted that much scientific theory… I would have read one of his scientific theory books. I would have been more interested in a more personal view but overall he left that out once he got into his college years. Yeah yeah, I get it, he’s a biologist so why wouldn’t he talk about his work? But I wish he had balanced it out a bit at the end. With that being said, I still find Dawkins to be a very interesting man and I look forward to his second book (although I fear he will just have a book full of paragraphs from his later books). "

I've loved - and usually have had to take the time to digest the books as they are science heavy, in the best possibly way - all his books I've read. Which is most of them.This one is different. It's his autobiography. Less science, less atheism everywhere. And way more a look at his past. What made this young African-born British lad turn to be a fantastic scientist, and a big voice for the non-religious out there? How did he become what he is? A big part of the answer lies in how The Selfish Gene turned out to exist, and in this book, we get a good look at most of the probable factors.A fascinating man, and a fascinating childhood too. What would have had to be different (or how much could all the things have had to be different) while he'd still turned out to be him instead of someone else? How much could the things have changed before there would not have been The Selfish Gene?I liked the book; I hate having to try to rate it. How can you rate a biography? Yes, it did give me clues about how Dawkins turned out to become himself. But compared to his other works... writing an autobiography can hardly be as good as The God Delusion, can it?As an unrelated side not, I did discover that my cats are Catheists while reading this book - both of them loved to sleep on this particular book while I was trying to read it. It's rare both of them love sleeping on the same books."

But also considering this man left a great amount of influence on my character, on me discovering where I came from and what's my life purpose from a scientific point of view, it would be such a shame not to know 'his own evolution'.Although he spent almost half of the book talking about other people and family members rather than talking about himself, I have never seen 'THE' most arrogant and most aggressive atheist scientist I know, getting this emotional and humble. I liked the poetry parts, when he talked about females, when he shortly described his first sexual experience, but mostly I liked the last chapter about the butterfly -or rather the sneeze- effect. Light book with funny stories of a figure whos fingerprint can not be bounded nor described between two covers of a book. All hail the great Richard Dawkins :)(The audiobook -read by his impressive voice and English- is recommended)"
112,0062225790,http://goodreads.com/user/show/42879342-katheryn-saunders,5,"I like Richard Dawkins. He discusses biology, genetics, and evolution in a way the layperson can easily grasp without being condescending. And I enjoy listening to his voice in audiobooks. In this memoir describing the first half of his life, he is affable, poetic, quirky, and surprisingly sentimental. In an irony I can't ignore, though, he is also regretful of bullying he participated in, either actively or passively by not speaking up. He laments the bullying he witnessed in school and his failure to defend the bullied. He also describes some of the political protests he participated in at Berkley as bullying. And he bemoans that children today can't escape bullying because, when they get home from school, they're subjected to cyberbullying on FaceBook and Twitter. But he himself has gained a reputation as a cyberbully on Twitter. It has damaged his reputation and cost him speaking engagements. It's always hard to admit someone you admire has feet of clay. It's a pity he is not more self-aware. "
113,0062225790,http://goodreads.com/user/show/17687788-carlo-ruggiero,3,"Received an Advanced Reader's Edition of An Appetite for Wonder through GoodReads GiveawayI was somewhat familiar with Dawkins's work, having read selections from some titles and having listened to Magic of Reality on Audio... I had some difficulty with the first half of the book being more of a (private) school recollection; it profited me nothing to read about his old school masters. Dawkins is a brilliant scientist and can write well, but the content was a little lacking, in this reader's opinion. This autobiography is more of an intimate portrait of his life (not that this is a bad thing), rather than his experiences in science. Appetite is subtitled ""The Making of a Scientist,"" so I was hoping for more stories of discovery and experimentation. There are some nice moments of insight throughout the book, but it did fall a little short of my expectations. "
114,0062225790,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6093453-colin,4,"Most people know Richard Dawkins as an outspoken anti-theist. But he's a lot more than that - a prominent ethologist and evolutionary biologist and one of the great early popularisers of science and rational inquiry to the general public. Dawkins' autobiography is in fact half of one - in it, he chronicles his childhood in Africa in the late days of Empire, his schooldays in the British education system of the time - prep schools and public schools and eventually Oxford, and his first forays as an ethologist - a researcher in animal behavior - up to the point where a protracted power shortage led him to write the book that would catapult him to early public prominence - The Selfish Gene.No one can accuse Dawkins of being a bore - he is a wonderful writer, with a special gift for combining clarity with poetic cadence. His recollections of his idyllic childhood in Kenya and Nyasaland - what is now Malawi - are tinged with a kind of genteel nostalgia, suffused with fond anecdotes and snatches of verse, lullabies and epistolary fragments. But far from whitewashing the actions of Empire, he conditions his prose with the implicit awareness of the ills of British colonialism.It might have been tempting to spin a narrative of how his experiences living in the African wild influenced his later decision to become an ethologist, but Dawkins shies away from anything so obvious. He is circumspect in the infinite web of cause and effect relationships that pushed the byways of his life into what he is now.His accounts of schoolboy life in Chafyn Grove and Oundle are oddly evocative of Roald Dahl's more fanciful take on the subject. Fagging (in which new students are de facto slaves to their elders), idiosyncratic masters, and the mischievous antics of his peers feature. Somewhat shocking are his strangely matter-of-fact accounts of pedophile teachers and schoolboy pederasty, which would probably not have had a place in Dahl's tome but invite horrified wonder as to how widespread these kinds of cultures were in 1960s England. In any case, what is most of interest are his recountings of life in Oxford, as well as his early career up to the release of The Selfish Gene - at which the book abruptly ends, in expectation of Part Two, which he says will come in a few years. His is a life of much serendipity, if we believe his account of how he navigated early days under a bevy of excellent educators, mentors and collaborators - and his wry descriptions of his early obsession with programming computers strikes a chord.In the entire volume he suffuses this account of his life with a mixture of self-deprecation, accounts of his moral shortcomings, and homilies to his greatest inspirations, coming across as almost excessively humble but not quite so. Whether or not you buy his humility is one thing; but I personally think he means it all. A man with a greater facility for self-serving self-effacement would not say half the things he does in public.But what I appreciate the most is that he is first and foremost a scientist. As far as he is able, he relates everything to biology. There are parts where, caught by a stray thought, he suddenly branches off into an extended discussion about how that point in his life relates to some scientific theory or snippet of moral philosophy. For example, when talking about how he was made to recite a good-night prayer in school and garbled up the words more and more every night because he didn't actually understand what he was reciting, he suddenly starts talking about how this is a good test of meme theory - how the lack of a ""normalization"" mechanism - i.e. comprehension of the words' meaning - caused a high 'mutation rate' in the words. He also takes the opportunity - when talking about his first magnum opus - to explicate the central thesis of that book to the reader - that we are in effect lumbering vehicles for the propagation of our immortal, selfish genes, which care not for our survival but only their own - in the form of being passed down generation to generation. Some might accuse him of being a kind of in-your-face know-it-all. But I see it as an educator's inveterate failing - that he must fill every crevice of his life in the act of passing knowledge to another. Perhaps that is the common wellspring from which his outspoken atheism originates as well.This book was supposedly met with mixed reviews upon release - one reviewer called it self-absorbed, which is a very bizarre critique for an autobiography. I suppose, when compared to the fiery clarity of The Selfish Gene or the brazenly polemical The God Delusion, this book might seem disappointingly dull. But I think of it as a kind of mellow effort on Dawkins' part to reveal his more human, positive side. I had the occasion to attend a talk of his in Stanford last year where he was promoting his book - which was one of the reasons I even read it in the first place - and far from being the firebrand that he is often caricatured as, he comes across as mild and urbane in person, even when confronted by the inevitable audience questioning on the selfsame topics that have occupied his recent attention. Well, people, you can't have it one way or another. Dawkins is human like the rest of us. If you're wondering whether this book is worth your time - if you're not a Dawkins fan, probably not. But if you're interested in learning more about the biologist behind the anti-theist, go ahead. He may surprise you. And perhaps the book itself, elegantly written as it is, is surely more testament to the harmony between science and poetry - that the infusion of rational inquiry into life's Mystery does not lay it bare, but enriches and enlivens it. I give this book: 4 out of 5 Dawkins Organs"

I didn't realize that this book only covered Dawkins's childhood and early career. The part I'm really interested in comes later, but Dawkins promised a volume 2 in a few years.Every time I bump up against some math/science-- and in this bio, one does-- I realize how lousy I am at it. Dawkins is a scientist with a soft spot for poetry, and he has the ability to quote long passages from memory. I'm lucky to remember the first few digits of pi, and far less likely to be able to explain its significance.And that's why Dawkins is an internationally known and celebrated scientist and bestselling author, and I'm buying lottery tickets."
116,0062225790,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9409644-sarah,0,"You wouldn't think a memoir of one of our century's most prolific scientists would be so cute. The first chapters are about his great-grandparents down to his childhood and it is entirely endearing. There are even sections about his early childhood written by his mother. A few of the chapters Dawkins details a few of his research phases which gets quite dry, but if you stick with it, even a layman such as myself can enjoy it. It feels very honest, but An Appetite for Wonder is not a tell-all. Dawkins doesn't beat around the bush with his point of view (and if you're familiar with him at all, this is obvious), without being overbearing or preachy. Almost like a novel, it leaves me wanting more and excited for part 2."

To his schooling in England to oxford and a time at Berkeley in the late sixties involved in antiwar activity. To his development up to his first major work ""the Selfish Gene"" it doesn't go into his personal life more of his intellectual development but it lets you know what is important to him and the ideas that shaped him.

Strangely, I had a hard time picking this one up. But why? Dawkins is a very effective (and often entertaining) writer. I appreciate his contributions to science. And yet, I had only minimal interest in reading this memoir.Perhaps I went into it with the wrong mindset, or perhaps I was right all along, but the first half of the book is devoid of any dramatic relevations or insight. Dawkins grew up in a colony of the British Empire. Had servants. Had family members also in other fields of science. Went to a great boarding school. Was a prefect. Went to an awesome college. Worked with excellent researchers and thinkers. And then, at this memoir's climax, wrote a fantastic book -- THE SELFISH GENE. And that's it.Dawkins has led a good life, and there are some interesting pieces of insight he drops in, but for the most part, I felt nothing. Shame on me, too -- I didn't read the back blurb, and I didn't realize this was only the FIRST memoir of a planned two."
121,0062225790,http://goodreads.com/user/show/27253012-patty,4,"If you are a fan of Dawkins, I expect you'd like this memoir just fine. I found it great; it's a more personal account of Dawkins' upbringing and start in the scientific community with his interest in what he would later coin as the Selfish Gene. It's not terribly interesting, if you are not interested in those details. Within this memoir, he exposes his emotional weakness to poetry, early teenage fan-obsession with Elvis Presely, and the beginning of his relationship with Mariam. I am always enchanted by how Dawkins can spend several pages explaining to you the beauty of a fly, for example. 3.5/4 Stars."
122,0062225790,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4307846-linda-harkins,5,"I read several books by Dawkins during the '90s and discovered that he is the British ethologist who coined the word ""meme"" now embedded in the behavioral sciences. When Susan Blackmore ran with the meme ball, I also read what she had to say on the topic. This book, however, is a memoir of a person born into a family of privilege, a person whose hero is Charles Darwin, a person who writes in such a manner that I'm often amused and enlightened simultaneously. Dawkins is a talented writer who shows the reader how science enriches our lives and debunks myth and superstition."
123,0062225790,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6019174-stu-hall,3,"Started off interesting, faded and repetitive towards the end. I was hoping for a little more about the discovery of the evidence of his own beliefs and would have preferred less detail about the minutiae of pecking chicks."
124,0062225790,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6882567-sara,3,"While I really enjoyed the first part of the book and learning more about his childhood, for someone who has read most of his other work I found too much repetition from those older writings in the last third or so."
125,0062225790,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1339246-gendou,4,"A short, fun autobiography by the Dawkins himself. Little science and philosophy lessons are woven in between anecdotes of growing up. Did you know Richard was born in Kenya?"
126,0062225790,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3493901-lindsay-nixon,3,"It is fascinating and wonderful to learn, step-by-step, how Richard Dawkins became, well, Richard Dawkins—the brilliant academic (ethologist, evolutionary biologist). I have never read a memoir like this, it is fitting that the entire memoir feels like an explained equation. It's mathematical and scientific in it's prose: the study, understanding, and explanation of Richard Dawkins. This memoir traces Dawkins' life and how his career shaped. You see the exact path of events in his life and curiosity that led him to become an ethologist, evolutionary biologist, and atheist. This memoir lacks any personal details of his life. He mentions his current and ex-wife in a single sentence, and while he does retell stories of his childhood, they are mostly to give context. For example, his family moved, but this was only told to explain he changed schools, which was only shared because it was at that school, with a new teaching style, that he realized he had no critical thinking skills and from that day on, became passionate about thinking critically. Or how the popularity of computer languages changed his interest and research, or how an electricity shortage forced his study and work projects in a new direction.Most memoirs I have read are mostly ""musings"" stories from the past, which this is not. The stories are picked only to explain the evolution of Dawkins work and mind. Most memoirs also impart nuggets of wisdom—those quotable quotes. This book doesn't do that either. It felt... educational, and that was fine. I usually get a lot out of memoirs--deeper connection to the person, life lessons, advice... not so much here. It felt like a lecture on Dawkins by Dawkins... This is a great memoir for Dawkins fans who want to understand how he came to be and I suspect young scientists and engineers might find comfort in reading his professional path. Everyone else might be a little bored or uninterested. I did take one thing away from it, though: failure is great. Dawkins never saw his failure as a bad thing or seemed disappointed. It was always about the curiosity. Failure gave as much an answer as success and it was the failures that shaped his career ultimately—they were often the branch in the path. Without them, he would not have become the Richard Dawkins we know and admire today."
127,0062225790,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5686119-book,4,"An Appetite for Wonder: The Making of a Scientist by Richard Dawkins “An Appetite for Wonder"" is an intimate memoir of the childhood and development of iconic scientist and renowned atheist, Richard Dawkins. The book covers the first half of his life up until the publishing of his first book and masterpiece, “The Selfish Gene”. This enjoyable and heartfelt 320-page book includes the following chapters: Genes and pith helmets, Camp followers in Kenya, The land of the lake, Eagle in the mountains, Farewell to Africa, Photographic Insert 1, Under Salisbury’s spire, ‘And your English summer’s done’, The spire by the Nene, Photographic Insert 2, Dreaming spires, Learning the trade, West Coast dreamtime, Computer fix, Photographic Insert 3, The grammar of behavior, The immortal gene, and Looking back down the path.Positives:1.	Engaging, warm account of his childhood and early science years. 2.	Dawkins is very candid and forthright in his memoir. Not afraid to be self-deprecating and uncharacteristically pleasant throughout the book. 3.	Three photographic inserts really complement the elegant writing style of Dawkins. A lovely family and fascinating stories and surprises from his childhood. 4.	Fascinating life. The book takes you to Africa where the young Dawkins spent most of his childhood at. Interesting challenges and very candid and respectful of how times were back then. “My next two memories are both of injections: the first by Dr Trim in Kenya and the second (more painful) by a scorpion, later in Nyasaland.” I’m not going to spoil it…bust rest assured, amusing stories.5.	The things that are of interest to Dawkins. “I have always been interested in the deep questions of existence, the questions that religion aspires (and fails) to answer, but I have been fortunate to live in a time when such questions are given scientific rather than supernatural answers.”6.	The book that had the biggest influence on the young Dawkins. 7.	Surprisingly forthcoming. “I was probably a disappointment as a naturalist, too, despite the rare privilege of spending a day with the young David Attenborough, when we were both guests of my Uncle Bill and Aunt Diana.”8.	Surprising issues such as bullying and peer pressure. “We wanted to be accepted by our fellows, especially the influential natural leaders among us; and the ethos of my peers was – until my last year at Oundle – anti-intellectual.”9.	Find out when exactly Dawkins became anti-religious. “If you are going to allow yourself to conjure a designer out of thin air, why not apply the same indulgence to that which he is supposed to have designed, and cut out, so to speak, the middle man?”10.	The musicians that inspired and moved Dawkins. 11.	Dawkins, Oxford and higher education. “I said that Oxford was the making of me, but really it was the tutorial system, which happens to be characteristic of Oxford and Cambridge.” 12.	It wouldn’t be a book about Dawkins if the grand theory of evolution wasn’t a part of it. “He introduced me to, among other things, his – and now my – favourite example of revealingly bad ‘design’ in animals: the recurrent laryngeal nerve.”13.	The moment where Dawkins reveal where his life changed stated unequivocally. 14.	The most important mentors of Dawkins’ life. “The senior figure in 13 Bevington Road was Mike Cullen, probably the most important mentor in my life – and I believe most of my contemporaries in the Animal Behaviour Research Group (ABRG) would agree.”15.	His surprising love-affair with computers. “I published a paper on the Dawkins Organ, and made the software available free of charge.”16.	The lectureship in animal behavior. “We planned a study that would exemplify, and clarify, one of the fundamental concepts of the ethological school of animal behaviour studies, the Fixed Action Pattern.”17.	Dawkins’ projects. It did, however, feed into my next big writing project: a long theoretical paper on ‘Hierarchical organisation as a candidate principle for ethology’.18.	The behind-the-scenes view behind the making of “The Selfish Gene”. “Gene survival is what really matters in natural selection.”19.	The scientists and circumstances that inspired Dawkins to make “The Selfish Gene”. “So Trivers’ name was added to those of Hamilton and Williams among the four authors who had greatest influence on The Selfish Gene.”20.	Links. Negatives:1.	Poor Kindle formatting. The digital version absolutely butchered all the poems. Something that should be remedied soon I hope.2.	The book is first and foremost a memoir, if you are expecting a lot of science or even the Dawkins classic contentious philosophical flair against religion, you will be sorely disappointed. A review of some of the key concepts behind the selfish gene but limited science elsewhere. 3.	I don’t know if Dawkins really explains to satisfaction how and what he felt at that time some of the events occurred. He struggles at times to provide answers regarding his mindset and must rely on and in some cases understandably so, on accounts from third parties (mother). 4.	A timeline of major events and locations would have added value.5.	Not the typical quote-fest that is so endearing to his admirers; yours truly included.6.	Avid fans and readers of Dawkins’ books may feel that the book gets repetitive. Particularly those who have read “The Selfish Gene”. That being said, there is some interesting behind the scenes revelations.In summary, an interesting journey into the first half of Dawkins’ life. This was a very easy and pleasant read. Dawkins is candid and forthcoming and shares an intimate look at his interesting life. The book revolves around his childhood and his early science years and the making of “The Selfish Gene”. Perhaps a little light on the science and the fiery philosophy that we admire and love from Dawkins (I must admit I missed some of that); this is a memoir worth reading. I highly recommend it with the reservations noted. Further recommendations: “The Selfish Gene” and “The Greatest Shown On Earth” by the same author, “Evolving Out of Eden” by Robert M. Price, “Your Inner Fish” by Neil Shubin, “Understanding Evolution and Ourselves” by Dennis Littrell, “Why Evolution Is True” by Jerry A. Coyne, “Evolution vs Creationism” by Eugenie C.

128,0062225790,http://goodreads.com/user/show/63352628-bianca-ro-ca,3,"Richard Dawkins is for sure a world-class scientist and a great educator .What surprised me is that he did not show an interest for biology early on and the fact that he was extremely religious. The parts where he illustrates his vision on education were brilliant .""Shouldn’t children be taught critical, sceptical thinking from an early age? Shouldn’t we all be taught to doubt, to weigh up plausibility, to demand evidence?""He also sparked my interest in Karl Popper's philosophy of science as a two-stage process : coming up with a hypothesis followed by attempts to falsify predictions deduced from it. This book has some interesting parts, however sometimes I found it too boring and the science was a bit heavy. Dawkins talks about an incident when he was stung by a scorpion and I identified one misconception.""..they took turns at trying to suck the poisonout of my foot. That is a recognized emergency procedure for snakebite. I haveno idea whether it is effective with scorpion stings but I am touched that theytried.""But sucking the poison is not effective as the venom spreads quickly through the bloodstream. "
129,0062225790,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5817790-steve,5,"Superbly written memoir by a great scientist. Dawkins has gotten a bit of a reputation as a jerk in the last few years. But this book tells a wonderful story of his life, from birth in colonial Africa until his middle age and the publication of his book ""The Selfish Gene"" and far from being the work of a nasty person it is generous and funny and not at all self-aggrandizing. "
130,0062225790,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8712910-nancy,3,"Richard Dawkins is a good writer. At first I was very interested. However, the fact that he is an atheist began to bother me. He doesn't even think that children should be ""fooled"" into believing in make-believe--Santa Claus etc. They should be taught to question and to be cynical. He was quite condescending towards people who have religious beliefs. I just got tired of it."
131,0062225790,http://goodreads.com/user/show/49404199-abbas,5,"A well told story.Objectively the life of Richard wasn't that intersting but he made it intersting. Discussing some of his early work and the relationships he had formed, Dawkins made the listening of his life story a good use of time."
132,0062225790,http://goodreads.com/user/show/69057876-sami,5,"If you have read Dawkins recent books, some themes would be recurring; however, overall a wonderful book on his own journey of becoming a scientist, writer and person he is today. "
133,0062225790,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8619183-anjroo,5,The Audio book read by the author himself is wonderful.
134,0062225790,http://goodreads.com/user/show/23160261-delara-h-f,3,Probably shouldn’t have started with this one. Such a narcissist!
135,0062225790,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1300459-sambasivan,4,The second half of the book becomes a bit technical but the first half of the life of Richard Dawkins covered in this book is quite enjoyable and adventurous one must say. Written with subtle humour and humility this gives a good account of the early life of Dawkins and a very good sneak view of life in the Oxford Colleges. Dawkins seems to have a prodigious memory to be able to detail the way he has of specific anecdotes. Waiting to read the second half which is expected to cover the writing life of Dawkins. 
136,0062225790,http://goodreads.com/user/show/39364424-eric,3,"An autobiography of Dawkins' early life through the publishing of ""The Selfish Gene"" in 1976, with plenty of anecdotes of his days at boarding school as a young child. I found the last few chapters, leading up to and including the writing of his first book, to be the most interesting."
137,0062225790,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4269814-carolyn,4,"This is a delightful book. Not only is Dawkins brilliant, he's witty, charming, and possessed of a deliciously wicked sense of humor. A sample: ""I suspect him [Desmond Morris] of being the original source of a widely circulated anecdote about the film star Diana Dors. She and he came from the same Wiltshire town and were childhood friends. Her real surname was not Dors but Fluck. She was invited back to open some fete or other, and the vicar, thinking to introduce her by the name the locals would have known, genially asked them to welcome the lovely 'Diana ... Clunt.'"" Dawkins was born in Africa. He says, ""I should have been a child naturalist. I had every advantage: not only the perfect early environment of tropical Africa but what should have been the perfect genes to slot into it. For generations, sun-browned Dawkins legs have been striding in khaki shorts through the jungles of Empire."" Nevertheless, he denies any particular interest or skill in that area. He was more interested in philosophical issues, and was often tucked up with a book while his parents urged him out into the healthy outdoors. The unexpected inheritance of a country estate brought the Dawkinses back to England when Richard was 7 (American readers uninterested in his genealogy can safely skip the first chapter). and he was sent off to boarding school. He tells stories he considers embarrassing, many of them because he believed things he was told when they made no sense. He laments children's being taught to memorize rather than think and analyze.In due course he came to Balliol College at Oxford, his father's school, and by happy accident Niko Tinbergen was assigned as his tutor. He developed an interest in ethology, a case of hero-worship for Darwin, and an ""addiction"" to computer programming.As anyone who has read any of his previous books can testify, Dawkins is superbly skilled at explaining complex ideas in clear, nontechnical language. Here he offers several, along with lots of entertaining anecdotes and descriptions of numerous first-rate scientists he counts as personal friends. This book takes him through ""the first half of my life,"" ending with the publication of _The Selfish Gene_ when he was 35. He projects volume 2 of his memoirs to be forthcoming in about two years. I can hardly wait. The e-appendix to the book is available free and without registration at http://www.richarddawkins.net/afw , which provides samples of his stories. "
138,0062225790,http://goodreads.com/user/show/13536962-amanda,3,"Whether you like Richard Dawkins or not, you can't deny that his work in science has been important. Dawkins has had an impact on his field and inspired many people to take an interest in science and reason. And here in AN APPETITE FOR WONDER, he tells us the story of how he became a scientist.The story starts with his ancestors; grandparents, parents, and their siblings. To be honest, I didn't care much for the parts that weren't about his parents, because the rest of the family has a limited role in the rest of the book. Still, the story about his parents and their time in Africa was touching. Moving on, Dawkins tells us stories from his youth; to the time spent in South Africa, to the visits to Britain, and then an eventual move. During this time, he began school, which was very different from the schools we have today in the West. To be fair, the school he entered in Britain was rather different too, and Dawkins comments on this. Dawkins offers anecdotes, funny and honest, about himself during his youth. With many knowing him for his stance on religion and his own atheism, he's honest about his short stints as a Christian in his teenage years. With his usual humor and arrogance (that some hate and some love) he does get in some jabs at religion.As said, some hate and some love his arrogance on certain matters. But you know what? I'd say he's entitled. As we move past his teenage years, we move onto Dawkins' time at college, and his works after that. Regardless what one think of Dawkins, one can't deny he's a brilliant scientist. His work is simply that good. He knows his field. So yes, I'd say he's entitled to respect. However, while I enjoyed reading about his time at college and what he did next, I wasn't that interest in reading the details of his works. Sometimes it got a bit too technical regarding his research and focused less on him as a person and more on his actual work. Which I don't mind reading, but picking up this book I would've preferred to read more about the man behind the work, not the actual work. Still, overall, AN APPETITE FOR WONDER offers a wonderful account of Dawkins' upbringing and how he ended up in science, but for me, personally, some parts simply didn't interest me."
139,0062225790,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4393974-leah-k,3,"An Appetite for Wonder: The Making of a Scientist by Richard Dawkins 307 pages★★★ ½ Richard Dawkins is a prominent ethologist (study of animal behavior) and evolutionary biologist who has published several books on his theories, garnering much attention along the way. One may not always agree with his thoughts but I personally find him to be a very brilliant man and a talented writer on his subjects. This book is his memoir of his childhood up to the publishing of his first book The Selfish Gene in 1976. He plans to publish a second part in a couple years.So with his talent on writing about science, how did he do about writing his own life? Not bad. I have to admit that I was much more intrigued by the first half of this book in which he deals with his childhood and his schooling before going into college. His life as a child was an interesting one and it explains a lot about who he would become later on in life. The second part of this book? Not quite as interesting in my opinion. It is in the second part that he starts his true calling as a scientist and I did find parts fascinating but he had a habit of rambling and when the man gets into a scientific theory, try to stop him. Many sections in the second part read like a scientific journal or like one of his many books (in fact he yanked whole paragraphs from his thesis and first book and placed them into this memoir) and honestly if I wanted that much scientific theory… I would have read one of his scientific theory books. I would have been more interested in a more personal view but overall he left that out once he got into his college years. Yeah yeah, I get it, he’s a biologist so why wouldn’t he talk about his work? But I wish he had balanced it out a bit at the end. With that being said, I still find Dawkins to be a very interesting man and I look forward to his second book (although I fear he will just have a book full of paragraphs from his later books). "
140,0062225790,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3915017-anna,4,"I won an ARC of this book from Goodreads.Dawkins is one of my favorite thinkers out there. I've loved - and usually have had to take the time to digest the books as they are science heavy, in the best possibly way - all his books I've read. Which is most of them.This one is different. It's his autobiography. Less science, less atheism everywhere. And way more a look at his past. What made this young African-born British lad turn to be a fantastic scientist, and a big voice for the non-religious out there? How did he become what he is? A big part of the answer lies in how The Selfish Gene turned out to exist, and in this book, we get a good look at most of the probable factors.A fascinating man, and a fascinating childhood too. What would have had to be different (or how much could all the things have had to be different) while he'd still turned out to be him instead of someone else? How much could the things have changed before there would not have been The Selfish Gene?I liked the book; I hate having to try to rate it. How can you rate a biography? Yes, it did give me clues about how Dawkins turned out to become himself. But compared to his other works... writing an autobiography can hardly be as good as The God Delusion, can it?As an unrelated side not, I did discover that my cats are Catheists while reading this book - both of them loved to sleep on this particular book while I was trying to read it. It's rare both of them love sleeping on the same books."
141,0062225790,http://goodreads.com/user/show/33332540-fares-d-alahmar,3,"Considering people aren't of my greatest interests, but ideas; this is the first autobiography book I have ever read. But also considering this man left a great amount of influence on my character, on me discovering where I came from and what's my life purpose from a scientific point of view, it would be such a shame not to know 'his own evolution'.Although he spent almost half of the book talking about other people and family members rather than talking about himself, I have never seen 'THE' most arrogant and most aggressive atheist scientist I know, getting this emotional and humble. I liked the poetry parts, when he talked about females, when he shortly described his first sexual experience, but mostly I liked the last chapter about the butterfly -or rather the sneeze- effect. Light book with funny stories of a figure whos fingerprint can not be bounded nor described between two covers of a book. All hail the great Richard Dawkins :)(The audiobook -read by his impressive voice and English- is recommended)"
142,0062225790,http://goodreads.com/user/show/42879342-katheryn-saunders,5,"I like Richard Dawkins. He discusses biology, genetics, and evolution in a way the layperson can easily grasp without being condescending. And I enjoy listening to his voice in audiobooks. In this memoir describing the first half of his life, he is affable, poetic, quirky, and surprisingly sentimental. In an irony I can't ignore, though, he is also regretful of bullying he participated in, either actively or passively by not speaking up. He laments the bullying he witnessed in school and his failure to defend the bullied. He also describes some of the political protests he participated in at Berkley as bullying. And he bemoans that children today can't escape bullying because, when they get home from school, they're subjected to cyberbullying on FaceBook and Twitter. But he himself has gained a reputation as a cyberbully on Twitter. It has damaged his reputation and cost him speaking engagements. It's always hard to admit someone you admire has feet of clay. It's a pity he is not more self-aware. "
143,0062225790,http://goodreads.com/user/show/17687788-carlo-ruggiero,3,"Received an Advanced Reader's Edition of An Appetite for Wonder through GoodReads GiveawayI was somewhat familiar with Dawkins's work, having read selections from some titles and having listened to Magic of Reality on Audio... I had some difficulty with the first half of the book being more of a (private) school recollection; it profited me nothing to read about his old school masters. Dawkins is a brilliant scientist and can write well, but the content was a little lacking, in this reader's opinion. This autobiography is more of an intimate portrait of his life (not that this is a bad thing), rather than his experiences in science. Appetite is subtitled ""The Making of a Scientist,"" so I was hoping for more stories of discovery and experimentation. There are some nice moments of insight throughout the book, but it did fall a little short of my expectations. "
144,0062225790,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6093453-colin,4,"Most people know Richard Dawkins as an outspoken anti-theist. But he's a lot more than that - a prominent ethologist and evolutionary biologist and one of the great early popularisers of science and rational inquiry to the general public. Dawkins' autobiography is in fact half of one - in it, he chronicles his childhood in Africa in the late days of Empire, his schooldays in the British education system of the time - prep schools and public schools and eventually Oxford, and his first forays as an ethologist - a researcher in animal behavior - up to the point where a protracted power shortage led him to write the book that would catapult him to early public prominence - The Selfish Gene.No one can accuse Dawkins of being a bore - he is a wonderful writer, with a special gift for combining clarity with poetic cadence. His recollections of his idyllic childhood in Kenya and Nyasaland - what is now Malawi - are tinged with a kind of genteel nostalgia, suffused with fond anecdotes and snatches of verse, lullabies and epistolary fragments. But far from whitewashing the actions of Empire, he conditions his prose with the implicit awareness of the ills of British colonialism.It might have been tempting to spin a narrative of how his experiences living in the African wild influenced his later decision to become an ethologist, but Dawkins shies away from anything so obvious. He is circumspect in the infinite web of cause and effect relationships that pushed the byways of his life into what he is now.His accounts of schoolboy life in Chafyn Grove and Oundle are oddly evocative of Roald Dahl's more fanciful take on the subject. Fagging (in which new students are de facto slaves to their elders), idiosyncratic masters, and the mischievous antics of his peers feature. Somewhat shocking are his strangely matter-of-fact accounts of pedophile teachers and schoolboy pederasty, which would probably not have had a place in Dahl's tome but invite horrified wonder as to how widespread these kinds of cultures were in 1960s England. In any case, what is most of interest are his recountings of life in Oxford, as well as his early career up to the release of The Selfish Gene - at which the book abruptly ends, in expectation of Part Two, which he says will come in a few years. His is a life of much serendipity, if we believe his account of how he navigated early days under a bevy of excellent educators, mentors and collaborators - and his wry descriptions of his early obsession with programming computers strikes a chord.In the entire volume he suffuses this account of his life with a mixture of self-deprecation, accounts of his moral shortcomings, and homilies to his greatest inspirations, coming across as almost excessively humble but not quite so. Whether or not you buy his humility is one thing; but I personally think he means it all. A man with a greater facility for self-serving self-effacement would not say half the things he does in public.But what I appreciate the most is that he is first and foremost a scientist. As far as he is able, he relates everything to biology. There are parts where, caught by a stray thought, he suddenly branches off into an extended discussion about how that point in his life relates to some scientific theory or snippet of moral philosophy. For example, when talking about how he was made to recite a good-night prayer in school and garbled up the words more and more every night because he didn't actually understand what he was reciting, he suddenly starts talking about how this is a good test of meme theory - how the lack of a ""normalization"" mechanism - i.e. comprehension of the words' meaning - caused a high 'mutation rate' in the words. He also takes the opportunity - when talking about his first magnum opus - to explicate the central thesis of that book to the reader - that we are in effect lumbering vehicles for the propagation of our immortal, selfish genes, which care not for our survival but only their own - in the form of being passed down generation to generation. Some might accuse him of being a kind of in-your-face know-it-all. But I see it as an educator's inveterate failing - that he must fill every crevice of his life in the act of passing knowledge to another. Perhaps that is the common wellspring from which his outspoken atheism originates as well.This book was supposedly met with mixed reviews upon release - one reviewer called it self-absorbed, which is a very bizarre critique for an autobiography. I suppose, when compared to the fiery clarity of The Selfish Gene or the brazenly polemical The God Delusion, this book might seem disappointingly dull. But I think of it as a kind of mellow effort on Dawkins' part to reveal his more human, positive side. I had the occasion to attend a talk of his in Stanford last year where he was promoting his book - which was one of the reasons I even read it in the first place - and far from being the firebrand that he is often caricatured as, he comes across as mild and urbane in person, even when confronted by the inevitable audience questioning on the selfsame topics that have occupied his recent attention. Well, people, you can't have it one way or another. Dawkins is human like the rest of us. If you're wondering whether this book is worth your time - if you're not a Dawkins fan, probably not. But if you're interested in learning more about the biologist behind the anti-theist, go ahead. He may surprise you. And perhaps the book itself, elegantly written as it is, is surely more testament to the harmony between science and poetry - that the infusion of rational inquiry into life's Mystery does not lay it bare, but enriches and enlivens it. I give this book: 4 out of 5 Dawkins Organs"
145,0062225790,http://goodreads.com/user/show/719063-linda,3,"Won an uncorrected proof from Goodreads. (I LOVE when that happens!)Three and a half stars. I didn't realize that this book only covered Dawkins's childhood and early career. The part I'm really interested in comes later, but Dawkins promised a volume 2 in a few years.Every time I bump up against some math/science-- and in this bio, one does-- I realize how lousy I am at it. Dawkins is a scientist with a soft spot for poetry, and he has the ability to quote long passages from memory. I'm lucky to remember the first few digits of pi, and far less likely to be able to explain its significance.And that's why Dawkins is an internationally known and celebrated scientist and bestselling author, and I'm buying lottery tickets."
146,0062225790,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9409644-sarah,0,"You wouldn't think a memoir of one of our century's most prolific scientists would be so cute. The first chapters are about his great-grandparents down to his childhood and it is entirely endearing. There are even sections about his early childhood written by his mother. A few of the chapters Dawkins details a few of his research phases which gets quite dry, but if you stick with it, even a layman such as myself can enjoy it. It feels very honest, but An Appetite for Wonder is not a tell-all. Dawkins doesn't beat around the bush with his point of view (and if you're familiar with him at all, this is obvious), without being overbearing or preachy. Almost like a novel, it leaves me wanting more and excited for part 2."
147,0062225790,http://goodreads.com/user/show/16212136-peter-pete-mcloughlin,4," This autobiography of Richard Dawkins focuses on his intellectual life his growth from his early childhood in colonial Africa. To his schooling in England to oxford and a time at Berkeley in the late sixties involved in antiwar activity. To his development up to his first major work ""the Selfish Gene"" it doesn't go into his personal life more of his intellectual development but it lets you know what is important to him and the ideas that shaped him. Nice book on a major figure in biology and ""new atheism"". See my status updates for some more details."
148,0062225790,http://goodreads.com/user/show/28825839-stephie-williams,4,"Somehow Dawkins always seems to write a good book. This book is no expectation. I wasn't really thrilled with the content early on. But Dawkins writing ability is greater than his topic. Again he shows this to be the case. Unfortunately the sequel to this book isn't do out until 2015, and I am almost out of Dawkin's books to read. The only one left that I haven't read is The Magic of Reality. Does anyone know how to write in italics. Needed here for the title of the book. Once again if you like Richard Dawkin's works I think you will like this one too."

Strangely, I had a hard time picking this one up. But why? Dawkins is a very effective (and often entertaining) writer. I appreciate his contributions to science. And yet, I had only minimal interest in reading this memoir.Perhaps I went into it with the wrong mindset, or perhaps I was right all along, but the first half of the book is devoid of any dramatic relevations or insight. Dawkins grew up in a colony of the British Empire. Had servants. Had family members also in other fields of science. Went to a great boarding school. Was a prefect. Went to an awesome college. Worked with excellent researchers and thinkers. And then, at this memoir's climax, wrote a fantastic book -- THE SELFISH GENE. And that's it.Dawkins has led a good life, and there are some interesting pieces of insight he drops in, but for the most part, I felt nothing. Shame on me, too -- I didn't read the back blurb, and I didn't realize this was only the FIRST memoir of a planned two."
151,0062225790,http://goodreads.com/user/show/27253012-patty,4,"If you are a fan of Dawkins, I expect you'd like this memoir just fine. I found it great; it's a more personal account of Dawkins' upbringing and start in the scientific community with his interest in what he would later coin as the Selfish Gene. It's not terribly interesting, if you are not interested in those details. Within this memoir, he exposes his emotional weakness to poetry, early teenage fan-obsession with Elvis Presely, and the beginning of his relationship with Mariam. I am always enchanted by how Dawkins can spend several pages explaining to you the beauty of a fly, for example. 3.5/4 Stars."
152,0062225790,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4307846-linda-harkins,5,"I read several books by Dawkins during the '90s and discovered that he is the British ethologist who coined the word ""meme"" now embedded in the behavioral sciences. When Susan Blackmore ran with the meme ball, I also read what she had to say on the topic. This book, however, is a memoir of a person born into a family of privilege, a person whose hero is Charles Darwin, a person who writes in such a manner that I'm often amused and enlightened simultaneously. Dawkins is a talented writer who shows the reader how science enriches our lives and debunks myth and superstition."
153,0062225790,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6019174-stu-hall,3,"Started off interesting, faded and repetitive towards the end. I was hoping for a little more about the discovery of the evidence of his own beliefs and would have preferred less detail about the minutiae of pecking chicks."
154,0062225790,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6882567-sara,3,"While I really enjoyed the first part of the book and learning more about his childhood, for someone who has read most of his other work I found too much repetition from those older writings in the last third or so."
155,0062225790,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1339246-gendou,4,"A short, fun autobiography by the Dawkins himself. Little science and philosophy lessons are woven in between anecdotes of growing up. Did you know Richard was born in Kenya?"
156,0062225790,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3493901-lindsay-nixon,3,"It is fascinating and wonderful to learn, step-by-step, how Richard Dawkins became, well, Richard Dawkins—the brilliant academic (ethologist, evolutionary biologist). I have never read a memoir like this, it is fitting that the entire memoir feels like an explained equation. It's mathematical and scientific in it's prose: the study, understanding, and explanation of Richard Dawkins. This memoir traces Dawkins' life and how his career shaped. You see the exact path of events in his life and curiosity that led him to become an ethologist, evolutionary biologist, and atheist. This memoir lacks any personal details of his life. He mentions his current and ex-wife in a single sentence, and while he does retell stories of his childhood, they are mostly to give context. For example, his family moved, but this was only told to explain he changed schools, which was only shared because it was at that school, with a new teaching style, that he realized he had no critical thinking skills and from that day on, became passionate about thinking critically. Or how the popularity of computer languages changed his interest and research, or how an electricity shortage forced his study and work projects in a new direction.Most memoirs I have read are mostly ""musings"" stories from the past, which this is not. The stories are picked only to explain the evolution of Dawkins work and mind. Most memoirs also impart nuggets of wisdom—those quotable quotes. This book doesn't do that either. It felt... educational, and that was fine. I usually get a lot out of memoirs--deeper connection to the person, life lessons, advice... not so much here. It felt like a lecture on Dawkins by Dawkins... This is a great memoir for Dawkins fans who want to understand how he came to be and I suspect young scientists and engineers might find comfort in reading his professional path. Everyone else might be a little bored or uninterested. I did take one thing away from it, though: failure is great. Dawkins never saw his failure as a bad thing or seemed disappointed. It was always about the curiosity. Failure gave as much an answer as success and it was the failures that shaped his career ultimately—they were often the branch in the path. Without them, he would not have become the Richard Dawkins we know and admire today."
157,0062225790,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5686119-book,4,"An Appetite for Wonder: The Making of a Scientist by Richard Dawkins “An Appetite for Wonder"" is an intimate memoir of the childhood and development of iconic scientist and renowned atheist, Richard Dawkins. The book covers the first half of his life up until the publishing of his first book and masterpiece, “The Selfish Gene”. This enjoyable and heartfelt 320-page book includes the following chapters: Genes and pith helmets, Camp followers in Kenya, The land of the lake, Eagle in the mountains, Farewell to Africa, Photographic Insert 1, Under Salisbury’s spire, ‘And your English summer’s done’, The spire by the Nene, Photographic Insert 2, Dreaming spires, Learning the trade, West Coast dreamtime, Computer fix, Photographic Insert 3, The grammar of behavior, The immortal gene, and Looking back down the path.Positives:1.	Engaging, warm account of his childhood and early science years. 2.	Dawkins is very candid and forthright in his memoir. Not afraid to be self-deprecating and uncharacteristically pleasant throughout the book. 3.	Three photographic inserts really complement the elegant writing style of Dawkins. A lovely family and fascinating stories and surprises from his childhood. 4.	Fascinating life. The book takes you to Africa where the young Dawkins spent most of his childhood at. Interesting challenges and very candid and respectful of how times were back then. “My next two memories are both of injections: the first by Dr Trim in Kenya and the second (more painful) by a scorpion, later in Nyasaland.” I’m not going to spoil it…bust rest assured, amusing stories.5.	The things that are of interest to Dawkins. “I have always been interested in the deep questions of existence, the questions that religion aspires (and fails) to answer, but I have been fortunate to live in a time when such questions are given scientific rather than supernatural answers.”6.	The book that had the biggest influence on the young Dawkins. 7.	Surprisingly forthcoming. “I was probably a disappointment as a naturalist, too, despite the rare privilege of spending a day with the young David Attenborough, when we were both guests of my Uncle Bill and Aunt Diana.”8.	Surprising issues such as bullying and peer pressure. “We wanted to be accepted by our fellows, especially the influential natural leaders among us; and the ethos of my peers was – until my last year at Oundle – anti-intellectual.”9.	Find out when exactly Dawkins became anti-religious. “If you are going to allow yourself to conjure a designer out of thin air, why not apply the same indulgence to that which he is supposed to have designed, and cut out, so to speak, the middle man?”10.	The musicians that inspired and moved Dawkins. 11.	Dawkins, Oxford and higher education. “I said that Oxford was the making of me, but really it was the tutorial system, which happens to be characteristic of Oxford and Cambridge.” 12.	It wouldn’t be a book about Dawkins if the grand theory of evolution wasn’t a part of it. “He introduced me to, among other things, his – and now my – favourite example of revealingly bad ‘design’ in animals: the recurrent laryngeal nerve.”13.	The moment where Dawkins reveal where his life changed stated unequivocally. 14.	The most important mentors of Dawkins’ life. “The senior figure in 13 Bevington Road was Mike Cullen, probably the most important mentor in my life – and I believe most of my contemporaries in the Animal Behaviour Research Group (ABRG) would agree.”15.	His surprising love-affair with computers. “I published a paper on the Dawkins Organ, and made the software available free of charge.”16.	The lectureship in animal behavior. “We planned a study that would exemplify, and clarify, one of the fundamental concepts of the ethological school of animal behaviour studies, the Fixed Action Pattern.”17.	Dawkins’ projects. It did, however, feed into my next big writing project: a long theoretical paper on ‘Hierarchical organisation as a candidate principle for ethology’.18.	The behind-the-scenes view behind the making of “The Selfish Gene”. “Gene survival is what really matters in natural selection.”19.	The scientists and circumstances that inspired Dawkins to make “The Selfish Gene”. “So Trivers’ name was added to those of Hamilton and Williams among the four authors who had greatest influence on The Selfish Gene.”20.	Links. Negatives:1.	Poor Kindle formatting. The digital version absolutely butchered all the poems. Something that should be remedied soon I hope.2.	The book is first and foremost a memoir, if you are expecting a lot of science or even the Dawkins classic contentious philosophical flair against religion, you will be sorely disappointed. A review of some of the key concepts behind the selfish gene but limited science elsewhere. 3.	I don’t know if Dawkins really explains to satisfaction how and what he felt at that time some of the events occurred. He struggles at times to provide answers regarding his mindset and must rely on and in some cases understandably so, on accounts from third parties (mother). 4.	A timeline of major events and locations would have added value.5.	Not the typical quote-fest that is so endearing to his admirers; yours truly included.6.	Avid fans and readers of Dawkins’ books may feel that the book gets repetitive. Particularly those who have read “The Selfish Gene”. That being said, there is some interesting behind the scenes revelations.In summary, an interesting journey into the first half of Dawkins’ life. This was a very easy and pleasant read. Dawkins is candid and forthcoming and shares an intimate look at his interesting life. The book revolves around his childhood and his early science years and the making of “The Selfish Gene”. Perhaps a little light on the science and the fiery philosophy that we admire and love from Dawkins (I must admit I missed some of that); this is a memoir worth reading. I highly recommend it with the reservations noted. Further recommendations: “The Selfish Gene” and “The Greatest Shown On Earth” by the same author, “Evolving Out of Eden” by Robert M.

158,0062225790,http://goodreads.com/user/show/63352628-bianca-ro-ca,3,"Richard Dawkins is for sure a world-class scientist and a great educator .What surprised me is that he did not show an interest for biology early on and the fact that he was extremely religious. The parts where he illustrates his vision on education were brilliant .""Shouldn’t children be taught critical, sceptical thinking from an early age? Shouldn’t we all be taught to doubt, to weigh up plausibility, to demand evidence?""He also sparked my interest in Karl Popper's philosophy of science as a two-stage process : coming up with a hypothesis followed by attempts to falsify predictions deduced from it. This book has some interesting parts, however sometimes I found it too boring and the science was a bit heavy. Dawkins talks about an incident when he was stung by a scorpion and I identified one misconception.""..they took turns at trying to suck the poisonout of my foot. That is a recognized emergency procedure for snakebite. I haveno idea whether it is effective with scorpion stings but I am touched that theytried.""But sucking the poison is not effective as the venom spreads quickly through the bloodstream. "

But this book tells a wonderful story of his life, from birth in colonial Africa until his middle age and the publication of his book ""The Selfish Gene"" and far from being the work of a nasty person it is generous and funny and not at all self-aggrandizing.

He doesn't even think that children should be ""fooled"" into believing in make-believe--Santa Claus etc. They should be taught to question and to be cynical. He was quite condescending towards people who have religious beliefs. I just got tired of it."

Written with subtle humour and humility this gives a good account of the early life of Dawkins and a very good sneak view of life in the Oxford Colleges. Dawkins seems to have a prodigious memory to be able to detail the way he has of specific anecdotes. Waiting to read the second half which is expected to cover the writing life of Dawkins. 
166,0062225790,http://goodreads.com/user/show/39364424-eric,3,"An autobiography of Dawkins' early life through the publishing of ""The Selfish Gene"" in 1976, with plenty of anecdotes of his days at boarding school as a young child. I found the last few chapters, leading up to and including the writing of his first book, to be the most interesting."
167,0062225790,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4269814-carolyn,4,"This is a delightful book. Not only is Dawkins brilliant, he's witty, charming, and possessed of a deliciously wicked sense of humor. A sample: ""I suspect him [Desmond Morris] of being the original source of a widely circulated anecdote about the film star Diana Dors. She and he came from the same Wiltshire town and were childhood friends. Her real surname was not Dors but Fluck. She was invited back to open some fete or other, and the vicar, thinking to introduce her by the name the locals would have known, genially asked them to welcome the lovely 'Diana ... Clunt.'"" Dawkins was born in Africa. He says, ""I should have been a child naturalist. I had every advantage: not only the perfect early environment of tropical Africa but what should have been the perfect genes to slot into it. For generations, sun-browned Dawkins legs have been striding in khaki shorts through the jungles of Empire."" Nevertheless, he denies any particular interest or skill in that area. He was more interested in philosophical issues, and was often tucked up with a book while his parents urged him out into the healthy outdoors. The unexpected inheritance of a country estate brought the Dawkinses back to England when Richard was 7 (American readers uninterested in his genealogy can safely skip the first chapter). and he was sent off to boarding school. He tells stories he considers embarrassing, many of them because he believed things he was told when they made no sense. He laments children's being taught to memorize rather than think and analyze.In due course he came to Balliol College at Oxford, his father's school, and by happy accident Niko Tinbergen was assigned as his tutor. He developed an interest in ethology, a case of hero-worship for Darwin, and an ""addiction"" to computer programming.As anyone who has read any of his previous books can testify, Dawkins is superbly skilled at explaining complex ideas in clear, nontechnical language. Here he offers several, along with lots of entertaining anecdotes and descriptions of numerous first-rate scientists he counts as personal friends. This book takes him through ""the first half of my life,"" ending with the publication of _The Selfish Gene_ when he was 35. He projects volume 2 of his memoirs to be forthcoming in about two years. I can hardly wait. The e-appendix to the book is available free and without registration at http://www.richarddawkins.net/afw , which provides samples of his stories. "
168,0062225790,http://goodreads.com/user/show/13536962-amanda,3,"Whether you like Richard Dawkins or not, you can't deny that his work in science has been important. Dawkins has had an impact on his field and inspired many people to take an interest in science and reason. And here in AN APPETITE FOR WONDER, he tells us the story of how he became a scientist.The story starts with his ancestors; grandparents, parents, and their siblings. To be honest, I didn't care much for the parts that weren't about his parents, because the rest of the family has a limited role in the rest of the book. Still, the story about his parents and their time in Africa was touching. Moving on, Dawkins tells us stories from his youth; to the time spent in South Africa, to the visits to Britain, and then an eventual move. During this time, he began school, which was very different from the schools we have today in the West. To be fair, the school he entered in Britain was rather different too, and Dawkins comments on this. Dawkins offers anecdotes, funny and honest, about himself during his youth. With many knowing him for his stance on religion and his own atheism, he's honest about his short stints as a Christian in his teenage years. With his usual humor and arrogance (that some hate and some love) he does get in some jabs at religion.As said, some hate and some love his arrogance on certain matters. But you know what? I'd say he's entitled. As we move past his teenage years, we move onto Dawkins' time at college, and his works after that. Regardless what one think of Dawkins, one can't deny he's a brilliant scientist. His work is simply that good. He knows his field. So yes, I'd say he's entitled to respect. However, while I enjoyed reading about his time at college and what he did next, I wasn't that interest in reading the details of his works. Sometimes it got a bit too technical regarding his research and focused less on him as a person and more on his actual work. Which I don't mind reading, but picking up this book I would've preferred to read more about the man behind the work, not the actual work. Still, overall, AN APPETITE FOR WONDER offers a wonderful account of Dawkins' upbringing and how he ended up in science, but for me, personally, some parts simply didn't interest me."
169,0062225790,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4393974-leah-k,3,"An Appetite for Wonder: The Making of a Scientist by Richard Dawkins 307 pages★★★ ½ Richard Dawkins is a prominent ethologist (study of animal behavior) and evolutionary biologist who has published several books on his theories, garnering much attention along the way. One may not always agree with his thoughts but I personally find him to be a very brilliant man and a talented writer on his subjects. This book is his memoir of his childhood up to the publishing of his first book The Selfish Gene in 1976. He plans to publish a second part in a couple years.So with his talent on writing about science, how did he do about writing his own life? Not bad. I have to admit that I was much more intrigued by the first half of this book in which he deals with his childhood and his schooling before going into college. His life as a child was an interesting one and it explains a lot about who he would become later on in life. The second part of this book? Not quite as interesting in my opinion. It is in the second part that he starts his true calling as a scientist and I did find parts fascinating but he had a habit of rambling and when the man gets into a scientific theory, try to stop him. Many sections in the second part read like a scientific journal or like one of his many books (in fact he yanked whole paragraphs from his thesis and first book and placed them into this memoir) and honestly if I wanted that much scientific theory… I would have read one of his scientific theory books. I would have been more interested in a more personal view but overall he left that out once he got into his college years. Yeah yeah, I get it, he’s a biologist so why wouldn’t he talk about his work? But I wish he had balanced it out a bit at the end. With that being said, I still find Dawkins to be a very interesting man and I look forward to his second book (although I fear he will just have a book full of paragraphs from his later books). "

I've loved - and usually have had to take the time to digest the books as they are science heavy, in the best possibly way - all his books I've read. Which is most of them.This one is different. It's his autobiography. Less science, less atheism everywhere. And way more a look at his past. What made this young African-born British lad turn to be a fantastic scientist, and a big voice for the non-religious out there? How did he become what he is? A big part of the answer lies in how The Selfish Gene turned out to exist, and in this book, we get a good look at most of the probable factors.A fascinating man, and a fascinating childhood too. What would have had to be different (or how much could all the things have had to be different) while he'd still turned out to be him instead of someone else? How much could the things have changed before there would not have been The Selfish Gene?I liked the book; I hate having to try to rate it. How can you rate a biography? Yes, it did give me clues about how Dawkins turned out to become himself. But compared to his other works... writing an autobiography can hardly be as good as The God Delusion, can it?As an unrelated side not, I did discover that my cats are Catheists while reading this book - both of them loved to sleep on this particular book while I was trying to read it. It's rare both of them love sleeping on the same books."

But also considering this man left a great amount of influence on my character, on me discovering where I came from and what's my life purpose from a scientific point of view, it would be such a shame not to know 'his own evolution'.Although he spent almost half of the book talking about other people and family members rather than talking about himself, I have never seen 'THE' most arrogant and most aggressive atheist scientist I know, getting this emotional and humble. I liked the poetry parts, when he talked about females, when he shortly described his first sexual experience, but mostly I liked the last chapter about the butterfly -or rather the sneeze- effect. Light book with funny stories of a figure whos fingerprint can not be bounded nor described between two covers of a book. All hail the great Richard Dawkins :)(The audiobook -read by his impressive voice and English- is recommended)"
172,0062225790,http://goodreads.com/user/show/42879342-katheryn-saunders,5,"I like Richard Dawkins. He discusses biology, genetics, and evolution in a way the layperson can easily grasp without being condescending. And I enjoy listening to his voice in audiobooks. In this memoir describing the first half of his life, he is affable, poetic, quirky, and surprisingly sentimental. In an irony I can't ignore, though, he is also regretful of bullying he participated in, either actively or passively by not speaking up. He laments the bullying he witnessed in school and his failure to defend the bullied. He also describes some of the political protests he participated in at Berkley as bullying. And he bemoans that children today can't escape bullying because, when they get home from school, they're subjected to cyberbullying on FaceBook and Twitter. But he himself has gained a reputation as a cyberbully on Twitter. It has damaged his reputation and cost him speaking engagements. It's always hard to admit someone you admire has feet of clay. It's a pity he is not more self-aware. "

I had some difficulty with the first half of the book being more of a (private) school recollection; it profited me nothing to read about his old school masters. Dawkins is a brilliant scientist and can write well, but the content was a little lacking, in this reader's opinion. This autobiography is more of an intimate portrait of his life (not that this is a bad thing), rather than his experiences in science. Appetite is subtitled ""The Making of a Scientist,"" so I was hoping for more stories of discovery and experimentation. There are some nice moments of insight throughout the book, but it did fall a little short of my expectations. "
174,0062225790,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6093453-colin,4,"Most people know Richard Dawkins as an outspoken anti-theist. But he's a lot more than that - a prominent ethologist and evolutionary biologist and one of the great early popularisers of science and rational inquiry to the general public. Dawkins' autobiography is in fact half of one - in it, he chronicles his childhood in Africa in the late days of Empire, his schooldays in the British education system of the time - prep schools and public schools and eventually Oxford, and his first forays as an ethologist - a researcher in animal behavior - up to the point where a protracted power shortage led him to write the book that would catapult him to early public prominence - The Selfish Gene.No one can accuse Dawkins of being a bore - he is a wonderful writer, with a special gift for combining clarity with poetic cadence. His recollections of his idyllic childhood in Kenya and Nyasaland - what is now Malawi - are tinged with a kind of genteel nostalgia, suffused with fond anecdotes and snatches of verse, lullabies and epistolary fragments. But far from whitewashing the actions of Empire, he conditions his prose with the implicit awareness of the ills of British colonialism.It might have been tempting to spin a narrative of how his experiences living in the African wild influenced his later decision to become an ethologist, but Dawkins shies away from anything so obvious. He is circumspect in the infinite web of cause and effect relationships that pushed the byways of his life into what he is now.His accounts of schoolboy life in Chafyn Grove and Oundle are oddly evocative of Roald Dahl's more fanciful take on the subject. Fagging (in which new students are de facto slaves to their elders), idiosyncratic masters, and the mischievous antics of his peers feature. Somewhat shocking are his strangely matter-of-fact accounts of pedophile teachers and schoolboy pederasty, which would probably not have had a place in Dahl's tome but invite horrified wonder as to how widespread these kinds of cultures were in 1960s England. In any case, what is most of interest are his recountings of life in Oxford, as well as his early career up to the release of The Selfish Gene - at which the book abruptly ends, in expectation of Part Two, which he says will come in a few years. His is a life of much serendipity, if we believe his account of how he navigated early days under a bevy of excellent educators, mentors and collaborators - and his wry descriptions of his early obsession with programming computers strikes a chord.In the entire volume he suffuses this account of his life with a mixture of self-deprecation, accounts of his moral shortcomings, and homilies to his greatest inspirations, coming across as almost excessively humble but not quite so. Whether or not you buy his humility is one thing; but I personally think he means it all. A man with a greater facility for self-serving self-effacement would not say half the things he does in public.But what I appreciate the most is that he is first and foremost a scientist. As far as he is able, he relates everything to biology. There are parts where, caught by a stray thought, he suddenly branches off into an extended discussion about how that point in his life relates to some scientific theory or snippet of moral philosophy. For example, when talking about how he was made to recite a good-night prayer in school and garbled up the words more and more every night because he didn't actually understand what he was reciting, he suddenly starts talking about how this is a good test of meme theory - how the lack of a ""normalization"" mechanism - i.e. comprehension of the words' meaning - caused a high 'mutation rate' in the words. He also takes the opportunity - when talking about his first magnum opus - to explicate the central thesis of that book to the reader - that we are in effect lumbering vehicles for the propagation of our immortal, selfish genes, which care not for our survival but only their own - in the form of being passed down generation to generation. Some might accuse him of being a kind of in-your-face know-it-all. But I see it as an educator's inveterate failing - that he must fill every crevice of his life in the act of passing knowledge to another. Perhaps that is the common wellspring from which his outspoken atheism originates as well.This book was supposedly met with mixed reviews upon release - one reviewer called it self-absorbed, which is a very bizarre critique for an autobiography. I suppose, when compared to the fiery clarity of The Selfish Gene or the brazenly polemical The God Delusion, this book might seem disappointingly dull. But I think of it as a kind of mellow effort on Dawkins' part to reveal his more human, positive side. I had the occasion to attend a talk of his in Stanford last year where he was promoting his book - which was one of the reasons I even read it in the first place - and far from being the firebrand that he is often caricatured as, he comes across as mild and urbane in person, even when confronted by the inevitable audience questioning on the selfsame topics that have occupied his recent attention. Well, people, you can't have it one way or another. Dawkins is human like the rest of us. If you're wondering whether this book is worth your time - if you're not a Dawkins fan, probably not. But if you're interested in learning more about the biologist behind the anti-theist, go ahead. He may surprise you. And perhaps the book itself, elegantly written as it is, is surely more testament to the harmony between science and poetry - that the infusion of rational inquiry into life's Mystery does not lay it bare, but enriches and enlivens it. I give this book: 4 out of 5 Dawkins Organs"

I didn't realize that this book only covered Dawkins's childhood and early career. The part I'm really interested in comes later, but Dawkins promised a volume 2 in a few years.Every time I bump up against some math/science-- and in this bio, one does-- I realize how lousy I am at it. Dawkins is a scientist with a soft spot for poetry, and he has the ability to quote long passages from memory. I'm lucky to remember the first few digits of pi, and far less likely to be able to explain its significance.And that's why Dawkins is an internationally known and celebrated scientist and bestselling author, and I'm buying lottery tickets."
176,0062225790,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9409644-sarah,0,"You wouldn't think a memoir of one of our century's most prolific scientists would be so cute. The first chapters are about his great-grandparents down to his childhood and it is entirely endearing. There are even sections about his early childhood written by his mother. A few of the chapters Dawkins details a few of his research phases which gets quite dry, but if you stick with it, even a layman such as myself can enjoy it. It feels very honest, but An Appetite for Wonder is not a tell-all. Dawkins doesn't beat around the bush with his point of view (and if you're familiar with him at all, this is obvious), without being overbearing or preachy. Almost like a novel, it leaves me wanting more and excited for part 2."
177,0062225790,http://goodreads.com/user/show/16212136-peter-pete-mcloughlin,4," This autobiography of Richard Dawkins focuses on his intellectual life his growth from his early childhood in colonial Africa. To his schooling in England to oxford and a time at Berkeley in the late sixties involved in antiwar activity. To his development up to his first major work ""the Selfish Gene"" it doesn't go into his personal life more of his intellectual development but it lets you know what is important to him and the ideas that shaped him. Nice book on a major figure in biology and ""new atheism"". See my status updates for some more details."
178,0062225790,http://goodreads.com/user/show/28825839-stephie-williams,4,"Somehow Dawkins always seems to write a good book. This book is no expectation. I wasn't really thrilled with the content early on. But Dawkins writing ability is greater than his topic. Again he shows this to be the case. Unfortunately the sequel to this book isn't do out until 2015, and I am almost out of Dawkin's books to read. The only one left that I haven't read is The Magic of Reality. Does anyone know how to write in italics. Needed here for the title of the book. Once again if you like Richard Dawkin's works I think you will like this one too."

Strangely, I had a hard time picking this one up. But why? Dawkins is a very effective (and often entertaining) writer. I appreciate his contributions to science. And yet, I had only minimal interest in reading this memoir.Perhaps I went into it with the wrong mindset, or perhaps I was right all along, but the first half of the book is devoid of any dramatic relevations or insight. Dawkins grew up in a colony of the British Empire. Had servants. Had family members also in other fields of science. Went to a great boarding school. Was a prefect. Went to an awesome college. Worked with excellent researchers and thinkers. And then, at this memoir's climax, wrote a fantastic book -- THE SELFISH GENE. And that's it.Dawkins has led a good life, and there are some interesting pieces of insight he drops in, but for the most part, I felt nothing. Shame on me, too -- I didn't read the back blurb, and I didn't realize this was only the FIRST memoir of a planned two."
181,0062225790,http://goodreads.com/user/show/27253012-patty,4,"If you are a fan of Dawkins, I expect you'd like this memoir just fine. I found it great; it's a more personal account of Dawkins' upbringing and start in the scientific community with his interest in what he would later coin as the Selfish Gene. It's not terribly interesting, if you are not interested in those details. Within this memoir, he exposes his emotional weakness to poetry, early teenage fan-obsession with Elvis Presely, and the beginning of his relationship with Mariam. I am always enchanted by how Dawkins can spend several pages explaining to you the beauty of a fly, for example. 3.5/4 Stars."
182,0062225790,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4307846-linda-harkins,5,"I read several books by Dawkins during the '90s and discovered that he is the British ethologist who coined the word ""meme"" now embedded in the behavioral sciences. When Susan Blackmore ran with the meme ball, I also read what she had to say on the topic. This book, however, is a memoir of a person born into a family of privilege, a person whose hero is Charles Darwin, a person who writes in such a manner that I'm often amused and enlightened simultaneously. Dawkins is a talented writer who shows the reader how science enriches our lives and debunks myth and superstition."
183,0062225790,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6019174-stu-hall,3,"Started off interesting, faded and repetitive towards the end. I was hoping for a little more about the discovery of the evidence of his own beliefs and would have preferred less detail about the minutiae of pecking chicks."
184,0062225790,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6882567-sara,3,"While I really enjoyed the first part of the book and learning more about his childhood, for someone who has read most of his other work I found too much repetition from those older writings in the last third or so."
185,0062225790,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1339246-gendou,4,"A short, fun autobiography by the Dawkins himself. Little science and philosophy lessons are woven in between anecdotes of growing up. Did you know Richard was born in Kenya?"
186,0062225790,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3493901-lindsay-nixon,3,"It is fascinating and wonderful to learn, step-by-step, how Richard Dawkins became, well, Richard Dawkins—the brilliant academic (ethologist, evolutionary biologist). I have never read a memoir like this, it is fitting that the entire memoir feels like an explained equation. It's mathematical and scientific in it's prose: the study, understanding, and explanation of Richard Dawkins. This memoir traces Dawkins' life and how his career shaped. You see the exact path of events in his life and curiosity that led him to become an ethologist, evolutionary biologist, and atheist. This memoir lacks any personal details of his life. He mentions his current and ex-wife in a single sentence, and while he does retell stories of his childhood, they are mostly to give context. For example, his family moved, but this was only told to explain he changed schools, which was only shared because it was at that school, with a new teaching style, that he realized he had no critical thinking skills and from that day on, became passionate about thinking critically. Or how the popularity of computer languages changed his interest and research, or how an electricity shortage forced his study and work projects in a new direction.Most memoirs I have read are mostly ""musings"" stories from the past, which this is not. The stories are picked only to explain the evolution of Dawkins work and mind. Most memoirs also impart nuggets of wisdom—those quotable quotes. This book doesn't do that either. It felt... educational, and that was fine. I usually get a lot out of memoirs--deeper connection to the person, life lessons, advice... not so much here. It felt like a lecture on Dawkins by Dawkins... This is a great memoir for Dawkins fans who want to understand how he came to be and I suspect young scientists and engineers might find comfort in reading his professional path. Everyone else might be a little bored or uninterested. I did take one thing away from it, though: failure is great. Dawkins never saw his failure as a bad thing or seemed disappointed. It was always about the curiosity. Failure gave as much an answer as success and it was the failures that shaped his career ultimately—they were often the branch in the path. Without them, he would not have become the Richard Dawkins we know and admire today."
187,0062225790,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5686119-book,4,"An Appetite for Wonder: The Making of a Scientist by Richard Dawkins “An Appetite for Wonder"" is an intimate memoir of the childhood and development of iconic scientist and renowned atheist, Richard Dawkins. The book covers the first half of his life up until the publishing of his first book and masterpiece, “The Selfish Gene”. This enjoyable and heartfelt 320-page book includes the following chapters: Genes and pith helmets, Camp followers in Kenya, The land of the lake, Eagle in the mountains, Farewell to Africa, Photographic Insert 1, Under Salisbury’s spire, ‘And your English summer’s done’, The spire by the Nene, Photographic Insert 2, Dreaming spires, Learning the trade, West Coast dreamtime, Computer fix, Photographic Insert 3, The grammar of behavior, The immortal gene, and Looking back down the path.Positives:1.	Engaging, warm account of his childhood and early science years. 2.	Dawkins is very candid and forthright in his memoir. Not afraid to be self-deprecating and uncharacteristically pleasant throughout the book. 3.	Three photographic inserts really complement the elegant writing style of Dawkins. A lovely family and fascinating stories and surprises from his childhood. 4.	Fascinating life. The book takes you to Africa where the young Dawkins spent most of his childhood at. Interesting challenges and very candid and respectful of how times were back then. “My next two memories are both of injections: the first by Dr Trim in Kenya and the second (more painful) by a scorpion, later in Nyasaland.” I’m not going to spoil it…bust rest assured, amusing stories.5.	The things that are of interest to Dawkins. “I have always been interested in the deep questions of existence, the questions that religion aspires (and fails) to answer, but I have been fortunate to live in a time when such questions are given scientific rather than supernatural answers.”6.	The book that had the biggest influence on the young Dawkins. 7.	Surprisingly forthcoming. “I was probably a disappointment as a naturalist, too, despite the rare privilege of spending a day with the young David Attenborough, when we were both guests of my Uncle Bill and Aunt Diana.”8.	Surprising issues such as bullying and peer pressure. “We wanted to be accepted by our fellows, especially the influential natural leaders among us; and the ethos of my peers was – until my last year at Oundle – anti-intellectual.”9.	Find out when exactly Dawkins became anti-religious. “If you are going to allow yourself to conjure a designer out of thin air, why not apply the same indulgence to that which he is supposed to have designed, and cut out, so to speak, the middle man?”10.	The musicians that inspired and moved Dawkins. 11.	Dawkins, Oxford and higher education. “I said that Oxford was the making of me, but really it was the tutorial system, which happens to be characteristic of Oxford and Cambridge.” 12.	It wouldn’t be a book about Dawkins if the grand theory of evolution wasn’t a part of it. “He introduced me to, among other things, his – and now my – favourite example of revealingly bad ‘design’ in animals: the recurrent laryngeal nerve.”13.	The moment where Dawkins reveal where his life changed stated unequivocally. 14.	The most important mentors of Dawkins’ life. “The senior figure in 13 Bevington Road was Mike Cullen, probably the most important mentor in my life – and I believe most of my contemporaries in the Animal Behaviour Research Group (ABRG) would agree.”15.	His surprising love-affair with computers. “I published a paper on the Dawkins Organ, and made the software available free of charge.”16.	The lectureship in animal behavior. “We planned a study that would exemplify, and clarify, one of the fundamental concepts of the ethological school of animal behaviour studies, the Fixed Action Pattern.”17.	Dawkins’ projects. It did, however, feed into my next big writing project: a long theoretical paper on ‘Hierarchical organisation as a candidate principle for ethology’.18.	The behind-the-scenes view behind the making of “The Selfish Gene”. “Gene survival is what really matters in natural selection.”19.	The scientists and circumstances that inspired Dawkins to make “The Selfish Gene”. “So Trivers’ name was added to those of Hamilton and Williams among the four authors who had greatest influence on The Selfish Gene.”20.	Links. Negatives:1.	Poor Kindle formatting. The digital version absolutely butchered all the poems. Something that should be remedied soon I hope.2.	The book is first and foremost a memoir, if you are expecting a lot of science or even the Dawkins classic contentious philosophical flair against religion, you will be sorely disappointed. A review of some of the key concepts behind the selfish gene but limited science elsewhere. 3.	I don’t know if Dawkins really explains to satisfaction how and what he felt at that time some of the events occurred. He struggles at times to provide answers regarding his mindset and must rely on and in some cases understandably so, on accounts from third parties (mother). 4.	A timeline of major events and locations would have added value.5.	Not the typical quote-fest that is so endearing to his admirers; yours truly included.6.	Avid fans and readers of Dawkins’ books may feel that the book gets repetitive. Particularly those who have read “The Selfish Gene”. That being said, there is some interesting behind the scenes revelations.In summary, an interesting journey into the first half of Dawkins’ life. This was a very easy and pleasant read. Dawkins is candid and forthcoming and shares an intimate look at his interesting life. The book revolves around his childhood and his early science years and the making of “The Selfish Gene”. Perhaps a little light on the science and the fiery philosophy that we admire and love from Dawkins (I must admit I missed some of that); this is a memoir worth reading. I highly recommend it with the reservations noted. Further recommendations: “The Selfish Gene” and “The Greatest Shown On Earth” by the same author, “Evolving Out of Eden” by Robert M.

The parts where he illustrates his vision on education were brilliant .""Shouldn’t children be taught critical, sceptical thinking from an early age? Shouldn’t we all be taught to doubt, to weigh up plausibility, to demand evidence?""He also sparked my interest in Karl Popper's philosophy of science as a two-stage process : coming up with a hypothesis followed by attempts to falsify predictions deduced from it. This book has some interesting parts, however sometimes I found it too boring and the science was a bit heavy. Dawkins talks about an incident when he was stung by a scorpion and I identified one misconception.""..they took turns at trying to suck the poisonout of my foot. That is a recognized emergency procedure for snakebite. I haveno idea whether it is effective with scorpion stings but I am touched that theytried.""But sucking the poison is not effective as the venom spreads quickly through the bloodstream. "

Written with subtle humour and humility this gives a good account of the early life of Dawkins and a very good sneak view of life in the Oxford Colleges. Dawkins seems to have a prodigious memory to be able to detail the way he has of specific anecdotes. Waiting to read the second half which is expected to cover the writing life of Dawkins.

197,0062225790,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4269814-carolyn,4,"This is a delightful book. Not only is Dawkins brilliant, he's witty, charming, and possessed of a deliciously wicked sense of humor. A sample: ""I suspect him [Desmond Morris] of being the original source of a widely circulated anecdote about the film star Diana Dors. She and he came from the same Wiltshire town and were childhood friends. Her real surname was not Dors but Fluck. She was invited back to open some fete or other, and the vicar, thinking to introduce her by the name the locals would have known, genially asked them to welcome the lovely 'Diana ... Clunt.'"" Dawkins was born in Africa. He says, ""I should have been a child naturalist. I had every advantage: not only the perfect early environment of tropical Africa but what should have been the perfect genes to slot into it. For generations, sun-browned Dawkins legs have been striding in khaki shorts through the jungles of Empire."" Nevertheless, he denies any particular interest or skill in that area. He was more interested in philosophical issues, and was often tucked up with a book while his parents urged him out into the healthy outdoors. The unexpected inheritance of a country estate brought the Dawkinses back to England when Richard was 7 (American readers uninterested in his genealogy can safely skip the first chapter). and he was sent off to boarding school. He tells stories he considers embarrassing, many of them because he believed things he was told when they made no sense. He laments children's being taught to memorize rather than think and analyze.In due course he came to Balliol College at Oxford, his father's school, and by happy accident Niko Tinbergen was assigned as his tutor. He developed an interest in ethology, a case of hero-worship for Darwin, and an ""addiction"" to computer programming.As anyone who has read any of his previous books can testify, Dawkins is superbly skilled at explaining complex ideas in clear, nontechnical language. Here he offers several, along with lots of entertaining anecdotes and descriptions of numerous first-rate scientists he counts as personal friends. This book takes him through ""the first half of my life,"" ending with the publication of _The Selfish Gene_ when he was 35. He projects volume 2 of his memoirs to be forthcoming in about two years. I can hardly wait. The e-appendix to the book is available free and without registration at http://www.richarddawkins.net/afw , which provides samples of his stories. "
198,0062225790,http://goodreads.com/user/show/13536962-amanda,3,"Whether you like Richard Dawkins or not, you can't deny that his work in science has been important. Dawkins has had an impact on his field and inspired many people to take an interest in science and reason. And here in AN APPETITE FOR WONDER, he tells us the story of how he became a scientist.The story starts with his ancestors; grandparents, parents, and their siblings. To be honest, I didn't care much for the parts that weren't about his parents, because the rest of the family has a limited role in the rest of the book. Still, the story about his parents and their time in Africa was touching. Moving on, Dawkins tells us stories from his youth; to the time spent in South Africa, to the visits to Britain, and then an eventual move. During this time, he began school, which was very different from the schools we have today in the West. To be fair, the school he entered in Britain was rather different too, and Dawkins comments on this. Dawkins offers anecdotes, funny and honest, about himself during his youth. With many knowing him for his stance on religion and his own atheism, he's honest about his short stints as a Christian in his teenage years. With his usual humor and arrogance (that some hate and some love) he does get in some jabs at religion.As said, some hate and some love his arrogance on certain matters. But you know what? I'd say he's entitled. As we move past his teenage years, we move onto Dawkins' time at college, and his works after that. Regardless what one think of Dawkins, one can't deny he's a brilliant scientist. His work is simply that good. He knows his field. So yes, I'd say he's entitled to respect. However, while I enjoyed reading about his time at college and what he did next, I wasn't that interest in reading the details of his works. Sometimes it got a bit too technical regarding his research and focused less on him as a person and more on his actual work. Which I don't mind reading, but picking up this book I would've preferred to read more about the man behind the work, not the actual work. Still, overall, AN APPETITE FOR WONDER offers a wonderful account of Dawkins' upbringing and how he ended up in science, but for me, personally, some parts simply didn't interest me."
199,0062225790,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4393974-leah-k,3,"An Appetite for Wonder: The Making of a Scientist by Richard Dawkins 307 pages★★★ ½ Richard Dawkins is a prominent ethologist (study of animal behavior) and evolutionary biologist who has published several books on his theories, garnering much attention along the way. One may not always agree with his thoughts but I personally find him to be a very brilliant man and a talented writer on his subjects. This book is his memoir of his childhood up to the publishing of his first book The Selfish Gene in 1976. He plans to publish a second part in a couple years.So with his talent on writing about science, how did he do about writing his own life? Not bad. I have to admit that I was much more intrigued by the first half of this book in which he deals with his childhood and his schooling before going into college. His life as a child was an interesting one and it explains a lot about who he would become later on in life. The second part of this book? Not quite as interesting in my opinion. It is in the second part that he starts his true calling as a scientist and I did find parts fascinating but he had a habit of rambling and when the man gets into a scientific theory, try to stop him. Many sections in the second part read like a scientific journal or like one of his many books (in fact he yanked whole paragraphs from his thesis and first book and placed them into this memoir) and honestly if I wanted that much scientific theory… I would have read one of his scientific theory books. I would have been more interested in a more personal view but overall he left that out once he got into his college years. Yeah yeah, I get it, he’s a biologist so why wouldn’t he talk about his work? But I wish he had balanced it out a bit at the end. With that being said, I still find Dawkins to be a very interesting man and I look forward to his second book (although I fear he will just have a book full of paragraphs from his later books). "
200,0062225790,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3915017-anna,4,"I won an ARC of this book from Goodreads.Dawkins is one of my favorite thinkers out there. I've loved - and usually have had to take the time to digest the books as they are science heavy, in the best possibly way - all his books I've read. Which is most of them.This one is different. It's his autobiography. Less science, less atheism everywhere. And way more a look at his past. What made this young African-born British lad turn to be a fantastic scientist, and a big voice for the non-religious out there? How did he become what he is? A big part of the answer lies in how The Selfish Gene turned out to exist, and in this book, we get a good look at most of the probable factors.A fascinating man, and a fascinating childhood too. What would have had to be different (or how much could all the things have had to be different) while he'd still turned out to be him instead of someone else? How much could the things have changed before there would not have been The Selfish Gene?I liked the book; I hate having to try to rate it. How can you rate a biography? Yes, it did give me clues about how Dawkins turned out to become himself. But compared to his other works... writing an autobiography can hardly be as good as The God Delusion, can it?As an unrelated side not, I did discover that my cats are Catheists while reading this book - both of them loved to sleep on this particular book while I was trying to read it. It's rare both of them love sleeping on the same books."
201,0062225790,http://goodreads.com/user/show/33332540-fares-d-alahmar,3,"Considering people aren't of my greatest interests, but ideas; this is the first autobiography book I have ever read. But also considering this man left a great amount of influence on my character, on me discovering where I came from and what's my life purpose from a scientific point of view, it would be such a shame not to know 'his own evolution'.Although he spent almost half of the book talking about other people and family members rather than talking about himself, I have never seen 'THE' most arrogant and most aggressive atheist scientist I know, getting this emotional and humble. I liked the poetry parts, when he talked about females, when he shortly described his first sexual experience, but mostly I liked the last chapter about the butterfly -or rather the sneeze- effect. Light book with funny stories of a figure whos fingerprint can not be bounded nor described between two covers of a book. All hail the great Richard Dawkins :)(The audiobook -read by his impressive voice and English- is recommended)"
202,0062225790,http://goodreads.com/user/show/42879342-katheryn-saunders,5,"I like Richard Dawkins. He discusses biology, genetics, and evolution in a way the layperson can easily grasp without being condescending. And I enjoy listening to his voice in audiobooks. In this memoir describing the first half of his life, he is affable, poetic, quirky, and surprisingly sentimental. In an irony I can't ignore, though, he is also regretful of bullying he participated in, either actively or passively by not speaking up. He laments the bullying he witnessed in school and his failure to defend the bullied. He also describes some of the political protests he participated in at Berkley as bullying. And he bemoans that children today can't escape bullying because, when they get home from school, they're subjected to cyberbullying on FaceBook and Twitter. But he himself has gained a reputation as a cyberbully on Twitter. It has damaged his reputation and cost him speaking engagements. It's always hard to admit someone you admire has feet of clay. It's a pity he is not more self-aware. "
203,0062225790,http://goodreads.com/user/show/17687788-carlo-ruggiero,3,"Received an Advanced Reader's Edition of An Appetite for Wonder through GoodReads GiveawayI was somewhat familiar with Dawkins's work, having read selections from some titles and having listened to Magic of Reality on Audio... I had some difficulty with the first half of the book being more of a (private) school recollection; it profited me nothing to read about his old school masters. Dawkins is a brilliant scientist and can write well, but the content was a little lacking, in this reader's opinion. This autobiography is more of an intimate portrait of his life (not that this is a bad thing), rather than his experiences in science. Appetite is subtitled ""The Making of a Scientist,"" so I was hoping for more stories of discovery and experimentation. There are some nice moments of insight throughout the book, but it did fall a little short of my expectations. "
204,0062225790,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6093453-colin,4,"Most people know Richard Dawkins as an outspoken anti-theist. But he's a lot more than that - a prominent ethologist and evolutionary biologist and one of the great early popularisers of science and rational inquiry to the general public. Dawkins' autobiography is in fact half of one - in it, he chronicles his childhood in Africa in the late days of Empire, his schooldays in the British education system of the time - prep schools and public schools and eventually Oxford, and his first forays as an ethologist - a researcher in animal behavior - up to the point where a protracted power shortage led him to write the book that would catapult him to early public prominence - The Selfish Gene.No one can accuse Dawkins of being a bore - he is a wonderful writer, with a special gift for combining clarity with poetic cadence. His recollections of his idyllic childhood in Kenya and Nyasaland - what is now Malawi - are tinged with a kind of genteel nostalgia, suffused with fond anecdotes and snatches of verse, lullabies and epistolary fragments. But far from whitewashing the actions of Empire, he conditions his prose with the implicit awareness of the ills of British colonialism.It might have been tempting to spin a narrative of how his experiences living in the African wild influenced his later decision to become an ethologist, but Dawkins shies away from anything so obvious. He is circumspect in the infinite web of cause and effect relationships that pushed the byways of his life into what he is now.His accounts of schoolboy life in Chafyn Grove and Oundle are oddly evocative of Roald Dahl's more fanciful take on the subject. Fagging (in which new students are de facto slaves to their elders), idiosyncratic masters, and the mischievous antics of his peers feature. Somewhat shocking are his strangely matter-of-fact accounts of pedophile teachers and schoolboy pederasty, which would probably not have had a place in Dahl's tome but invite horrified wonder as to how widespread these kinds of cultures were in 1960s England. In any case, what is most of interest are his recountings of life in Oxford, as well as his early career up to the release of The Selfish Gene - at which the book abruptly ends, in expectation of Part Two, which he says will come in a few years. His is a life of much serendipity, if we believe his account of how he navigated early days under a bevy of excellent educators, mentors and collaborators - and his wry descriptions of his early obsession with programming computers strikes a chord.In the entire volume he suffuses this account of his life with a mixture of self-deprecation, accounts of his moral shortcomings, and homilies to his greatest inspirations, coming across as almost excessively humble but not quite so. Whether or not you buy his humility is one thing; but I personally think he means it all. A man with a greater facility for self-serving self-effacement would not say half the things he does in public.But what I appreciate the most is that he is first and foremost a scientist. As far as he is able, he relates everything to biology. There are parts where, caught by a stray thought, he suddenly branches off into an extended discussion about how that point in his life relates to some scientific theory or snippet of moral philosophy. For example, when talking about how he was made to recite a good-night prayer in school and garbled up the words more and more every night because he didn't actually understand what he was reciting, he suddenly starts talking about how this is a good test of meme theory - how the lack of a ""normalization"" mechanism - i.e. comprehension of the words' meaning - caused a high 'mutation rate' in the words. He also takes the opportunity - when talking about his first magnum opus - to explicate the central thesis of that book to the reader - that we are in effect lumbering vehicles for the propagation of our immortal, selfish genes, which care not for our survival but only their own - in the form of being passed down generation to generation. Some might accuse him of being a kind of in-your-face know-it-all. But I see it as an educator's inveterate failing - that he must fill every crevice of his life in the act of passing knowledge to another. Perhaps that is the common wellspring from which his outspoken atheism originates as well.This book was supposedly met with mixed reviews upon release - one reviewer called it self-absorbed, which is a very bizarre critique for an autobiography. I suppose, when compared to the fiery clarity of The Selfish Gene or the brazenly polemical The God Delusion, this book might seem disappointingly dull. But I think of it as a kind of mellow effort on Dawkins' part to reveal his more human, positive side. I had the occasion to attend a talk of his in Stanford last year where he was promoting his book - which was one of the reasons I even read it in the first place - and far from being the firebrand that he is often caricatured as, he comes across as mild and urbane in person, even when confronted by the inevitable audience questioning on the selfsame topics that have occupied his recent attention. Well, people, you can't have it one way or another. Dawkins is human like the rest of us. If you're wondering whether this book is worth your time - if you're not a Dawkins fan, probably not. But if you're interested in learning more about the biologist behind the anti-theist, go ahead. He may surprise you. And perhaps the book itself, elegantly written as it is, is surely more testament to the harmony between science and poetry - that the infusion of rational inquiry into life's Mystery does not lay it bare, but enriches and enlivens it. I give this book: 4 out of 5 Dawkins Organs"
205,0062225790,http://goodreads.com/user/show/719063-linda,3,"Won an uncorrected proof from Goodreads. (I LOVE when that happens!)Three and a half stars. I didn't realize that this book only covered Dawkins's childhood and early career. The part I'm really interested in comes later, but Dawkins promised a volume 2 in a few years.Every time I bump up against some math/science-- and in this bio, one does-- I realize how lousy I am at it. Dawkins is a scientist with a soft spot for poetry, and he has the ability to quote long passages from memory. I'm lucky to remember the first few digits of pi, and far less likely to be able to explain its significance.And that's why Dawkins is an internationally known and celebrated scientist and bestselling author, and I'm buying lottery tickets."
206,0062225790,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9409644-sarah,0,"You wouldn't think a memoir of one of our century's most prolific scientists would be so cute. The first chapters are about his great-grandparents down to his childhood and it is entirely endearing. There are even sections about his early childhood written by his mother. A few of the chapters Dawkins details a few of his research phases which gets quite dry, but if you stick with it, even a layman such as myself can enjoy it. It feels very honest, but An Appetite for Wonder is not a tell-all. Dawkins doesn't beat around the bush with his point of view (and if you're familiar with him at all, this is obvious), without being overbearing or preachy. Almost like a novel, it leaves me wanting more and excited for part 2."
207,0062225790,http://goodreads.com/user/show/16212136-peter-pete-mcloughlin,4," This autobiography of Richard Dawkins focuses on his intellectual life his growth from his early childhood in colonial Africa. To his schooling in England to oxford and a time at Berkeley in the late sixties involved in antiwar activity. To his development up to his first major work ""the Selfish Gene"" it doesn't go into his personal life more of his intellectual development but it lets you know what is important to him and the ideas that shaped him. Nice book on a major figure in biology and ""new atheism"". See my status updates for some more details."
208,0062225790,http://goodreads.com/user/show/28825839-stephie-williams,4,"Somehow Dawkins always seems to write a good book. This book is no expectation. I wasn't really thrilled with the content early on. But Dawkins writing ability is greater than his topic. Again he shows this to be the case. Unfortunately the sequel to this book isn't do out until 2015, and I am almost out of Dawkin's books to read. The only one left that I haven't read is The Magic of Reality. Does anyone know how to write in italics. Needed here for the title of the book. Once again if you like Richard Dawkin's works I think you will like this one too."

210,0062225790,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10360599-alex-daniel,2,"As someone who has read several Dawkins' books, liked (and loved) them, and is a scientist, I should be the target audience for AN APPETITE FOR WONDER. Strangely, I had a hard time picking this one up. But why? Dawkins is a very effective (and often entertaining) writer. I appreciate his contributions to science. And yet, I had only minimal interest in reading this memoir.Perhaps I went into it with the wrong mindset, or perhaps I was right all along, but the first half of the book is devoid of any dramatic relevations or insight. Dawkins grew up in a colony of the British Empire. Had servants. Had family members also in other fields of science. Went to a great boarding school. Was a prefect. Went to an awesome college. Worked with excellent researchers and thinkers. And then, at this memoir's climax, wrote a fantastic book -- THE SELFISH GENE. And that's it.Dawkins has led a good life, and there are some interesting pieces of insight he drops in, but for the most part, I felt nothing. Shame on me, too -- I didn't read the back blurb, and I didn't realize this was only the FIRST memoir of a planned two."
211,0062225790,http://goodreads.com/user/show/27253012-patty,4,"If you are a fan of Dawkins, I expect you'd like this memoir just fine. I found it great; it's a more personal account of Dawkins' upbringing and start in the scientific community with his interest in what he would later coin as the Selfish Gene. It's not terribly interesting, if you are not interested in those details. Within this memoir, he exposes his emotional weakness to poetry, early teenage fan-obsession with Elvis Presely, and the beginning of his relationship with Mariam. I am always enchanted by how Dawkins can spend several pages explaining to you the beauty of a fly, for example. 3.5/4 Stars."
212,0062225790,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4307846-linda-harkins,5,"I read several books by Dawkins during the '90s and discovered that he is the British ethologist who coined the word ""meme"" now embedded in the behavioral sciences. When Susan Blackmore ran with the meme ball, I also read what she had to say on the topic. This book, however, is a memoir of a person born into a family of privilege, a person whose hero is Charles Darwin, a person who writes in such a manner that I'm often amused and enlightened simultaneously. Dawkins is a talented writer who shows the reader how science enriches our lives and debunks myth and superstition."
213,0062225790,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6019174-stu-hall,3,"Started off interesting, faded and repetitive towards the end. I was hoping for a little more about the discovery of the evidence of his own beliefs and would have preferred less detail about the minutiae of pecking chicks."
214,0062225790,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6882567-sara,3,"While I really enjoyed the first part of the book and learning more about his childhood, for someone who has read most of his other work I found too much repetition from those older writings in the last third or so."
215,0062225790,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1339246-gendou,4,"A short, fun autobiography by the Dawkins himself. Little science and philosophy lessons are woven in between anecdotes of growing up. Did you know Richard was born in Kenya?"
216,0062225790,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3493901-lindsay-nixon,3,"It is fascinating and wonderful to learn, step-by-step, how Richard Dawkins became, well, Richard Dawkins—the brilliant academic (ethologist, evolutionary biologist). I have never read a memoir like this, it is fitting that the entire memoir feels like an explained equation. It's mathematical and scientific in it's prose: the study, understanding, and explanation of Richard Dawkins. This memoir traces Dawkins' life and how his career shaped. You see the exact path of events in his life and curiosity that led him to become an ethologist, evolutionary biologist, and atheist. This memoir lacks any personal details of his life. He mentions his current and ex-wife in a single sentence, and while he does retell stories of his childhood, they are mostly to give context. For example, his family moved, but this was only told to explain he changed schools, which was only shared because it was at that school, with a new teaching style, that he realized he had no critical thinking skills and from that day on, became passionate about thinking critically. Or how the popularity of computer languages changed his interest and research, or how an electricity shortage forced his study and work projects in a new direction.Most memoirs I have read are mostly ""musings"" stories from the past, which this is not. The stories are picked only to explain the evolution of Dawkins work and mind. Most memoirs also impart nuggets of wisdom—those quotable quotes. This book doesn't do that either. It felt... educational, and that was fine. I usually get a lot out of memoirs--deeper connection to the person, life lessons, advice... not so much here. It felt like a lecture on Dawkins by Dawkins... This is a great memoir for Dawkins fans who want to understand how he came to be and I suspect young scientists and engineers might find comfort in reading his professional path. Everyone else might be a little bored or uninterested. I did take one thing away from it, though: failure is great. Dawkins never saw his failure as a bad thing or seemed disappointed. It was always about the curiosity. Failure gave as much an answer as success and it was the failures that shaped his career ultimately—they were often the branch in the path. Without them, he would not have become the Richard Dawkins we know and admire today."
217,0062225790,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5686119-book,4,"An Appetite for Wonder: The Making of a Scientist by Richard Dawkins “An Appetite for Wonder"" is an intimate memoir of the childhood and development of iconic scientist and renowned atheist, Richard Dawkins. The book covers the first half of his life up until the publishing of his first book and masterpiece, “The Selfish Gene”. This enjoyable and heartfelt 320-page book includes the following chapters: Genes and pith helmets, Camp followers in Kenya, The land of the lake, Eagle in the mountains, Farewell to Africa, Photographic Insert 1, Under Salisbury’s spire, ‘And your English summer’s done’, The spire by the Nene, Photographic Insert 2, Dreaming spires, Learning the trade, West Coast dreamtime, Computer fix, Photographic Insert 3, The grammar of behavior, The immortal gene, and Looking back down the path.Positives:1.	Engaging, warm account of his childhood and early science years. 2.	Dawkins is very candid and forthright in his memoir. Not afraid to be self-deprecating and uncharacteristically pleasant throughout the book. 3.	Three photographic inserts really complement the elegant writing style of Dawkins. A lovely family and fascinating stories and surprises from his childhood. 4.	Fascinating life. The book takes you to Africa where the young Dawkins spent most of his childhood at. Interesting challenges and very candid and respectful of how times were back then. “My next two memories are both of injections: the first by Dr Trim in Kenya and the second (more painful) by a scorpion, later in Nyasaland.” I’m not going to spoil it…bust rest assured, amusing stories.5.	The things that are of interest to Dawkins. “I have always been interested in the deep questions of existence, the questions that religion aspires (and fails) to answer, but I have been fortunate to live in a time when such questions are given scientific rather than supernatural answers.”6.	The book that had the biggest influence on the young Dawkins. 7.	Surprisingly forthcoming. “I was probably a disappointment as a naturalist, too, despite the rare privilege of spending a day with the young David Attenborough, when we were both guests of my Uncle Bill and Aunt Diana.”8.	Surprising issues such as bullying and peer pressure. “We wanted to be accepted by our fellows, especially the influential natural leaders among us; and the ethos of my peers was – until my last year at Oundle – anti-intellectual.”9.	Find out when exactly Dawkins became anti-religious. “If you are going to allow yourself to conjure a designer out of thin air, why not apply the same indulgence to that which he is supposed to have designed, and cut out, so to speak, the middle man?”10.	The musicians that inspired and moved Dawkins. 11.	Dawkins, Oxford and higher education. “I said that Oxford was the making of me, but really it was the tutorial system, which happens to be characteristic of Oxford and Cambridge.” 12.	It wouldn’t be a book about Dawkins if the grand theory of evolution wasn’t a part of it. “He introduced me to, among other things, his – and now my – favourite example of revealingly bad ‘design’ in animals: the recurrent laryngeal nerve.”13.	The moment where Dawkins reveal where his life changed stated unequivocally. 14.	The most important mentors of Dawkins’ life. “The senior figure in 13 Bevington Road was Mike Cullen, probably the most important mentor in my life – and I believe most of my contemporaries in the Animal Behaviour Research Group (ABRG) would agree.”15.	His surprising love-affair with computers. “I published a paper on the Dawkins Organ, and made the software available free of charge.”16.	The lectureship in animal behavior. “We planned a study that would exemplify, and clarify, one of the fundamental concepts of the ethological school of animal behaviour studies, the Fixed Action Pattern.”17.	Dawkins’ projects. It did, however, feed into my next big writing project: a long theoretical paper on ‘Hierarchical organisation as a candidate principle for ethology’.18.	The behind-the-scenes view behind the making of “The Selfish Gene”. “Gene survival is what really matters in natural selection.”19.	The scientists and circumstances that inspired Dawkins to make “The Selfish Gene”. “So Trivers’ name was added to those of Hamilton and Williams among the four authors who had greatest influence on The Selfish Gene.”20.	Links. Negatives:1.	Poor Kindle formatting. The digital version absolutely butchered all the poems. Something that should be remedied soon I hope.2.	The book is first and foremost a memoir, if you are expecting a lot of science or even the Dawkins classic contentious philosophical flair against religion, you will be sorely disappointed. A review of some of the key concepts behind the selfish gene but limited science elsewhere. 3.	I don’t know if Dawkins really explains to satisfaction how and what he felt at that time some of the events occurred. He struggles at times to provide answers regarding his mindset and must rely on and in some cases understandably so, on accounts from third parties (mother). 4.	A timeline of major events and locations would have added value.5.	Not the typical quote-fest that is so endearing to his admirers; yours truly included.6.	Avid fans and readers of Dawkins’ books may feel that the book gets repetitive. Particularly those who have read “The Selfish Gene”. That being said, there is some interesting behind the scenes revelations.In summary, an interesting journey into the first half of Dawkins’ life. This was a very easy and pleasant read. Dawkins is candid and forthcoming and shares an intimate look at his interesting life. The book revolves around his childhood and his early science years and the making of “The Selfish Gene”. Perhaps a little light on the science and the fiery philosophy that we admire and love from Dawkins (I must admit I missed some of that); this is a memoir worth reading. I highly recommend it with the reservations noted. Further recommendations: “The Selfish Gene” and “The Greatest Shown On Earth” by the same author, “Evolving Out of Eden” by Robert M.

218,0062225790,http://goodreads.com/user/show/63352628-bianca-ro-ca,3,"Richard Dawkins is for sure a world-class scientist and a great educator .What surprised me is that he did not show an interest for biology early on and the fact that he was extremely religious. The parts where he illustrates his vision on education were brilliant .""Shouldn’t children be taught critical, sceptical thinking from an early age? Shouldn’t we all be taught to doubt, to weigh up plausibility, to demand evidence?""He also sparked my interest in Karl Popper's philosophy of science as a two-stage process : coming up with a hypothesis followed by attempts to falsify predictions deduced from it. This book has some interesting parts, however sometimes I found it too boring and the science was a bit heavy. Dawkins talks about an incident when he was stung by a scorpion and I identified one misconception.""..they took turns at trying to suck the poisonout of my foot. That is a recognized emergency procedure for snakebite.

But this book tells a wonderful story of his life, from birth in colonial Africa until his middle age and the publication of his book ""The Selfish Gene"" and far from being the work of a nasty person it is generous and funny and not at all self-aggrandizing.

Written with subtle humour and humility this gives a good account of the early life of Dawkins and a very good sneak view of life in the Oxford Colleges. Dawkins seems to have a prodigious memory to be able to detail the way he has of specific anecdotes. Waiting to read the second half which is expected to cover the writing life of Dawkins.

227,0062225790,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4269814-carolyn,4,"This is a delightful book. Not only is Dawkins brilliant, he's witty, charming, and possessed of a deliciously wicked sense of humor. A sample: ""I suspect him [Desmond Morris] of being the original source of a widely circulated anecdote about the film star Diana Dors. She and he came from the same Wiltshire town and were childhood friends. Her real surname was not Dors but Fluck. She was invited back to open some fete or other, and the vicar, thinking to introduce her by the name the locals would have known, genially asked them to welcome the lovely 'Diana ... Clunt.'"" Dawkins was born in Africa. He says, ""I should have been a child naturalist. I had every advantage: not only the perfect early environment of tropical Africa but what should have been the perfect genes to slot into it. For generations, sun-browned Dawkins legs have been striding in khaki shorts through the jungles of Empire."" Nevertheless, he denies any particular interest or skill in that area. He was more interested in philosophical issues, and was often tucked up with a book while his parents urged him out into the healthy outdoors. The unexpected inheritance of a country estate brought the Dawkinses back to England when Richard was 7 (American readers uninterested in his genealogy can safely skip the first chapter). and he was sent off to boarding school. He tells stories he considers embarrassing, many of them because he believed things he was told when they made no sense. He laments children's being taught to memorize rather than think and analyze.In due course he came to Balliol College at Oxford, his father's school, and by happy accident Niko Tinbergen was assigned as his tutor. He developed an interest in ethology, a case of hero-worship for Darwin, and an ""addiction"" to computer programming.As anyone who has read any of his previous books can testify, Dawkins is superbly skilled at explaining complex ideas in clear, nontechnical language. Here he offers several, along with lots of entertaining anecdotes and descriptions of numerous first-rate scientists he counts as personal friends. This book takes him through ""the first half of my life,"" ending with the publication of _The Selfish Gene_ when he was 35. He projects volume 2 of his memoirs to be forthcoming in about two years. I can hardly wait. The e-appendix to the book is available free and without registration at http://www.richarddawkins.net/afw , which provides samples of his stories. "
228,0062225790,http://goodreads.com/user/show/13536962-amanda,3,"Whether you like Richard Dawkins or not, you can't deny that his work in science has been important. Dawkins has had an impact on his field and inspired many people to take an interest in science and reason. And here in AN APPETITE FOR WONDER, he tells us the story of how he became a scientist.The story starts with his ancestors; grandparents, parents, and their siblings. To be honest, I didn't care much for the parts that weren't about his parents, because the rest of the family has a limited role in the rest of the book. Still, the story about his parents and their time in Africa was touching. Moving on, Dawkins tells us stories from his youth; to the time spent in South Africa, to the visits to Britain, and then an eventual move. During this time, he began school, which was very different from the schools we have today in the West. To be fair, the school he entered in Britain was rather different too, and Dawkins comments on this. Dawkins offers anecdotes, funny and honest, about himself during his youth. With many knowing him for his stance on religion and his own atheism, he's honest about his short stints as a Christian in his teenage years. With his usual humor and arrogance (that some hate and some love) he does get in some jabs at religion.As said, some hate and some love his arrogance on certain matters. But you know what? I'd say he's entitled. As we move past his teenage years, we move onto Dawkins' time at college, and his works after that. Regardless what one think of Dawkins, one can't deny he's a brilliant scientist. His work is simply that good. He knows his field. So yes, I'd say he's entitled to respect. However, while I enjoyed reading about his time at college and what he did next, I wasn't that interest in reading the details of his works. Sometimes it got a bit too technical regarding his research and focused less on him as a person and more on his actual work. Which I don't mind reading, but picking up this book I would've preferred to read more about the man behind the work, not the actual work. Still, overall, AN APPETITE FOR WONDER offers a wonderful account of Dawkins' upbringing and how he ended up in science, but for me, personally, some parts simply didn't interest me."
229,0062225790,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4393974-leah-k,3,"An Appetite for Wonder: The Making of a Scientist by Richard Dawkins 307 pages★★★ ½ Richard Dawkins is a prominent ethologist (study of animal behavior) and evolutionary biologist who has published several books on his theories, garnering much attention along the way. One may not always agree with his thoughts but I personally find him to be a very brilliant man and a talented writer on his subjects. This book is his memoir of his childhood up to the publishing of his first book The Selfish Gene in 1976. He plans to publish a second part in a couple years.So with his talent on writing about science, how did he do about writing his own life? Not bad. I have to admit that I was much more intrigued by the first half of this book in which he deals with his childhood and his schooling before going into college. His life as a child was an interesting one and it explains a lot about who he would become later on in life. The second part of this book? Not quite as interesting in my opinion. It is in the second part that he starts his true calling as a scientist and I did find parts fascinating but he had a habit of rambling and when the man gets into a scientific theory, try to stop him. Many sections in the second part read like a scientific journal or like one of his many books (in fact he yanked whole paragraphs from his thesis and first book and placed them into this memoir) and honestly if I wanted that much scientific theory… I would have read one of his scientific theory books. I would have been more interested in a more personal view but overall he left that out once he got into his college years. Yeah yeah, I get it, he’s a biologist so why wouldn’t he talk about his work? But I wish he had balanced it out a bit at the end. With that being said, I still find Dawkins to be a very interesting man and I look forward to his second book (although I fear he will just have a book full of paragraphs from his later books). "
230,0062225790,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3915017-anna,4,"I won an ARC of this book from Goodreads.Dawkins is one of my favorite thinkers out there. I've loved - and usually have had to take the time to digest the books as they are science heavy, in the best possibly way - all his books I've read. Which is most of them.This one is different. It's his autobiography. Less science, less atheism everywhere. And way more a look at his past. What made this young African-born British lad turn to be a fantastic scientist, and a big voice for the non-religious out there? How did he become what he is? A big part of the answer lies in how The Selfish Gene turned out to exist, and in this book, we get a good look at most of the probable factors.A fascinating man, and a fascinating childhood too. What would have had to be different (or how much could all the things have had to be different) while he'd still turned out to be him instead of someone else? How much could the things have changed before there would not have been The Selfish Gene?I liked the book; I hate having to try to rate it. How can you rate a biography? Yes, it did give me clues about how Dawkins turned out to become himself. But compared to his other works... writing an autobiography can hardly be as good as The God Delusion, can it?As an unrelated side not, I did discover that my cats are Catheists while reading this book - both of them loved to sleep on this particular book while I was trying to read it. It's rare both of them love sleeping on the same books."
231,0062225790,http://goodreads.com/user/show/33332540-fares-d-alahmar,3,"Considering people aren't of my greatest interests, but ideas; this is the first autobiography book I have ever read. But also considering this man left a great amount of influence on my character, on me discovering where I came from and what's my life purpose from a scientific point of view, it would be such a shame not to know 'his own evolution'.Although he spent almost half of the book talking about other people and family members rather than talking about himself, I have never seen 'THE' most arrogant and most aggressive atheist scientist I know, getting this emotional and humble. I liked the poetry parts, when he talked about females, when he shortly described his first sexual experience, but mostly I liked the last chapter about the butterfly -or rather the sneeze- effect. Light book with funny stories of a figure whos fingerprint can not be bounded nor described between two covers of a book. All hail the great Richard Dawkins :)(The audiobook -read by his impressive voice and English- is recommended)"
232,0062225790,http://goodreads.com/user/show/42879342-katheryn-saunders,5,"I like Richard Dawkins. He discusses biology, genetics, and evolution in a way the layperson can easily grasp without being condescending. And I enjoy listening to his voice in audiobooks. In this memoir describing the first half of his life, he is affable, poetic, quirky, and surprisingly sentimental. In an irony I can't ignore, though, he is also regretful of bullying he participated in, either actively or passively by not speaking up. He laments the bullying he witnessed in school and his failure to defend the bullied. He also describes some of the political protests he participated in at Berkley as bullying. And he bemoans that children today can't escape bullying because, when they get home from school, they're subjected to cyberbullying on FaceBook and Twitter. But he himself has gained a reputation as a cyberbully on Twitter. It has damaged his reputation and cost him speaking engagements. It's always hard to admit someone you admire has feet of clay. It's a pity he is not more self-aware. "
233,0062225790,http://goodreads.com/user/show/17687788-carlo-ruggiero,3,"Received an Advanced Reader's Edition of An Appetite for Wonder through GoodReads GiveawayI was somewhat familiar with Dawkins's work, having read selections from some titles and having listened to Magic of Reality on Audio... I had some difficulty with the first half of the book being more of a (private) school recollection; it profited me nothing to read about his old school masters. Dawkins is a brilliant scientist and can write well, but the content was a little lacking, in this reader's opinion. This autobiography is more of an intimate portrait of his life (not that this is a bad thing), rather than his experiences in science. Appetite is subtitled ""The Making of a Scientist,"" so I was hoping for more stories of discovery and experimentation. There are some nice moments of insight throughout the book, but it did fall a little short of my expectations. "
234,0062225790,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6093453-colin,4,"Most people know Richard Dawkins as an outspoken anti-theist. But he's a lot more than that - a prominent ethologist and evolutionary biologist and one of the great early popularisers of science and rational inquiry to the general public. Dawkins' autobiography is in fact half of one - in it, he chronicles his childhood in Africa in the late days of Empire, his schooldays in the British education system of the time - prep schools and public schools and eventually Oxford, and his first forays as an ethologist - a researcher in animal behavior - up to the point where a protracted power shortage led him to write the book that would catapult him to early public prominence - The Selfish Gene.No one can accuse Dawkins of being a bore - he is a wonderful writer, with a special gift for combining clarity with poetic cadence. His recollections of his idyllic childhood in Kenya and Nyasaland - what is now Malawi - are tinged with a kind of genteel nostalgia, suffused with fond anecdotes and snatches of verse, lullabies and epistolary fragments. But far from whitewashing the actions of Empire, he conditions his prose with the implicit awareness of the ills of British colonialism.It might have been tempting to spin a narrative of how his experiences living in the African wild influenced his later decision to become an ethologist, but Dawkins shies away from anything so obvious. He is circumspect in the infinite web of cause and effect relationships that pushed the byways of his life into what he is now.His accounts of schoolboy life in Chafyn Grove and Oundle are oddly evocative of Roald Dahl's more fanciful take on the subject. Fagging (in which new students are de facto slaves to their elders), idiosyncratic masters, and the mischievous antics of his peers feature. Somewhat shocking are his strangely matter-of-fact accounts of pedophile teachers and schoolboy pederasty, which would probably not have had a place in Dahl's tome but invite horrified wonder as to how widespread these kinds of cultures were in 1960s England. In any case, what is most of interest are his recountings of life in Oxford, as well as his early career up to the release of The Selfish Gene - at which the book abruptly ends, in expectation of Part Two, which he says will come in a few years. His is a life of much serendipity, if we believe his account of how he navigated early days under a bevy of excellent educators, mentors and collaborators - and his wry descriptions of his early obsession with programming computers strikes a chord.In the entire volume he suffuses this account of his life with a mixture of self-deprecation, accounts of his moral shortcomings, and homilies to his greatest inspirations, coming across as almost excessively humble but not quite so. Whether or not you buy his humility is one thing; but I personally think he means it all. A man with a greater facility for self-serving self-effacement would not say half the things he does in public.But what I appreciate the most is that he is first and foremost a scientist. As far as he is able, he relates everything to biology. There are parts where, caught by a stray thought, he suddenly branches off into an extended discussion about how that point in his life relates to some scientific theory or snippet of moral philosophy. For example, when talking about how he was made to recite a good-night prayer in school and garbled up the words more and more every night because he didn't actually understand what he was reciting, he suddenly starts talking about how this is a good test of meme theory - how the lack of a ""normalization"" mechanism - i.e. comprehension of the words' meaning - caused a high 'mutation rate' in the words. He also takes the opportunity - when talking about his first magnum opus - to explicate the central thesis of that book to the reader - that we are in effect lumbering vehicles for the propagation of our immortal, selfish genes, which care not for our survival but only their own - in the form of being passed down generation to generation. Some might accuse him of being a kind of in-your-face know-it-all. But I see it as an educator's inveterate failing - that he must fill every crevice of his life in the act of passing knowledge to another. Perhaps that is the common wellspring from which his outspoken atheism originates as well.This book was supposedly met with mixed reviews upon release - one reviewer called it self-absorbed, which is a very bizarre critique for an autobiography. I suppose, when compared to the fiery clarity of The Selfish Gene or the brazenly polemical The God Delusion, this book might seem disappointingly dull. But I think of it as a kind of mellow effort on Dawkins' part to reveal his more human, positive side. I had the occasion to attend a talk of his in Stanford last year where he was promoting his book - which was one of the reasons I even read it in the first place - and far from being the firebrand that he is often caricatured as, he comes across as mild and urbane in person, even when confronted by the inevitable audience questioning on the selfsame topics that have occupied his recent attention. Well, people, you can't have it one way or another. Dawkins is human like the rest of us. If you're wondering whether this book is worth your time - if you're not a Dawkins fan, probably not. But if you're interested in learning more about the biologist behind the anti-theist, go ahead. He may surprise you. And perhaps the book itself, elegantly written as it is, is surely more testament to the harmony between science and poetry - that the infusion of rational inquiry into life's Mystery does not lay it bare, but enriches and enlivens it. I give this book: 4 out of 5 Dawkins Organs"
235,0062225790,http://goodreads.com/user/show/719063-linda,3,"Won an uncorrected proof from Goodreads. (I LOVE when that happens!)Three and a half stars. I didn't realize that this book only covered Dawkins's childhood and early career. The part I'm really interested in comes later, but Dawkins promised a volume 2 in a few years.Every time I bump up against some math/science-- and in this bio, one does-- I realize how lousy I am at it. Dawkins is a scientist with a soft spot for poetry, and he has the ability to quote long passages from memory. I'm lucky to remember the first few digits of pi, and far less likely to be able to explain its significance.And that's why Dawkins is an internationally known and celebrated scientist and bestselling author, and I'm buying lottery tickets."
236,0062225790,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9409644-sarah,0,"You wouldn't think a memoir of one of our century's most prolific scientists would be so cute. The first chapters are about his great-grandparents down to his childhood and it is entirely endearing. There are even sections about his early childhood written by his mother. A few of the chapters Dawkins details a few of his research phases which gets quite dry, but if you stick with it, even a layman such as myself can enjoy it. It feels very honest, but An Appetite for Wonder is not a tell-all. Dawkins doesn't beat around the bush with his point of view (and if you're familiar with him at all, this is obvious), without being overbearing or preachy. Almost like a novel, it leaves me wanting more and excited for part 2."
237,0062225790,http://goodreads.com/user/show/16212136-peter-pete-mcloughlin,4," This autobiography of Richard Dawkins focuses on his intellectual life his growth from his early childhood in colonial Africa. To his schooling in England to oxford and a time at Berkeley in the late sixties involved in antiwar activity. To his development up to his first major work ""the Selfish Gene"" it doesn't go into his personal life more of his intellectual development but it lets you know what is important to him and the ideas that shaped him. Nice book on a major figure in biology and ""new atheism"". See my status updates for some more details."

I wasn't really thrilled with the content early on. But Dawkins writing ability is greater than his topic. Again he shows this to be the case. Unfortunately the sequel to this book isn't do out until 2015, and I am almost out of Dawkin's books to read. The only one left that I haven't read is The Magic of Reality. Does anyone know how to write in italics. Needed here for the title of the book. Once again if you like Richard Dawkin's works I think you will like this one too."

Strangely, I had a hard time picking this one up. But why? Dawkins is a very effective (and often entertaining) writer. I appreciate his contributions to science. And yet, I had only minimal interest in reading this memoir.Perhaps I went into it with the wrong mindset, or perhaps I was right all along, but the first half of the book is devoid of any dramatic relevations or insight. Dawkins grew up in a colony of the British Empire. Had servants. Had family members also in other fields of science. Went to a great boarding school. Was a prefect. Went to an awesome college. Worked with excellent researchers and thinkers. And then, at this memoir's climax, wrote a fantastic book -- THE SELFISH GENE. And that's it.Dawkins has led a good life, and there are some interesting pieces of insight he drops in, but for the most part, I felt nothing. Shame on me, too -- I didn't read the back blurb, and I didn't realize this was only the FIRST memoir of a planned two."
241,0062225790,http://goodreads.com/user/show/27253012-patty,4,"If you are a fan of Dawkins, I expect you'd like this memoir just fine. I found it great; it's a more personal account of Dawkins' upbringing and start in the scientific community with his interest in what he would later coin as the Selfish Gene. It's not terribly interesting, if you are not interested in those details. Within this memoir, he exposes his emotional weakness to poetry, early teenage fan-obsession with Elvis Presely, and the beginning of his relationship with Mariam. I am always enchanted by how Dawkins can spend several pages explaining to you the beauty of a fly, for example. 3.5/4 Stars."
242,0062225790,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4307846-linda-harkins,5,"I read several books by Dawkins during the '90s and discovered that he is the British ethologist who coined the word ""meme"" now embedded in the behavioral sciences. When Susan Blackmore ran with the meme ball, I also read what she had to say on the topic. This book, however, is a memoir of a person born into a family of privilege, a person whose hero is Charles Darwin, a person who writes in such a manner that I'm often amused and enlightened simultaneously. Dawkins is a talented writer who shows the reader how science enriches our lives and debunks myth and superstition."
243,0062225790,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6019174-stu-hall,3,"Started off interesting, faded and repetitive towards the end. I was hoping for a little more about the discovery of the evidence of his own beliefs and would have preferred less detail about the minutiae of pecking chicks."
244,0062225790,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6882567-sara,3,"While I really enjoyed the first part of the book and learning more about his childhood, for someone who has read most of his other work I found too much repetition from those older writings in the last third or so."
245,0062225790,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1339246-gendou,4,"A short, fun autobiography by the Dawkins himself. Little science and philosophy lessons are woven in between anecdotes of growing up. Did you know Richard was born in Kenya?"
246,0062225790,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3493901-lindsay-nixon,3,"It is fascinating and wonderful to learn, step-by-step, how Richard Dawkins became, well, Richard Dawkins—the brilliant academic (ethologist, evolutionary biologist). I have never read a memoir like this, it is fitting that the entire memoir feels like an explained equation. It's mathematical and scientific in it's prose: the study, understanding, and explanation of Richard Dawkins. This memoir traces Dawkins' life and how his career shaped. You see the exact path of events in his life and curiosity that led him to become an ethologist, evolutionary biologist, and atheist. This memoir lacks any personal details of his life. He mentions his current and ex-wife in a single sentence, and while he does retell stories of his childhood, they are mostly to give context. For example, his family moved, but this was only told to explain he changed schools, which was only shared because it was at that school, with a new teaching style, that he realized he had no critical thinking skills and from that day on, became passionate about thinking critically. Or how the popularity of computer languages changed his interest and research, or how an electricity shortage forced his study and work projects in a new direction.Most memoirs I have read are mostly ""musings"" stories from the past, which this is not. The stories are picked only to explain the evolution of Dawkins work and mind. Most memoirs also impart nuggets of wisdom—those quotable quotes. This book doesn't do that either. It felt... educational, and that was fine. I usually get a lot out of memoirs--deeper connection to the person, life lessons, advice... not so much here. It felt like a lecture on Dawkins by Dawkins... This is a great memoir for Dawkins fans who want to understand how he came to be and I suspect young scientists and engineers might find comfort in reading his professional path. Everyone else might be a little bored or uninterested. I did take one thing away from it, though: failure is great. Dawkins never saw his failure as a bad thing or seemed disappointed. It was always about the curiosity. Failure gave as much an answer as success and it was the failures that shaped his career ultimately—they were often the branch in the path. Without them, he would not have become the Richard Dawkins we know and admire today."
247,0062225790,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5686119-book,4,"An Appetite for Wonder: The Making of a Scientist by Richard Dawkins “An Appetite for Wonder"" is an intimate memoir of the childhood and development of iconic scientist and renowned atheist, Richard Dawkins. The book covers the first half of his life up until the publishing of his first book and masterpiece, “The Selfish Gene”. This enjoyable and heartfelt 320-page book includes the following chapters: Genes and pith helmets, Camp followers in Kenya, The land of the lake, Eagle in the mountains, Farewell to Africa, Photographic Insert 1, Under Salisbury’s spire, ‘And your English summer’s done’, The spire by the Nene, Photographic Insert 2, Dreaming spires, Learning the trade, West Coast dreamtime, Computer fix, Photographic Insert 3, The grammar of behavior, The immortal gene, and Looking back down the path.Positives:1.	Engaging, warm account of his childhood and early science years. 2.	Dawkins is very candid and forthright in his memoir. Not afraid to be self-deprecating and uncharacteristically pleasant throughout the book. 3.	Three photographic inserts really complement the elegant writing style of Dawkins. A lovely family and fascinating stories and surprises from his childhood. 4.	Fascinating life. The book takes you to Africa where the young Dawkins spent most of his childhood at. Interesting challenges and very candid and respectful of how times were back then. “My next two memories are both of injections: the first by Dr Trim in Kenya and the second (more painful) by a scorpion, later in Nyasaland.” I’m not going to spoil it…bust rest assured, amusing stories.5.	The things that are of interest to Dawkins. “I have always been interested in the deep questions of existence, the questions that religion aspires (and fails) to answer, but I have been fortunate to live in a time when such questions are given scientific rather than supernatural answers.”6.	The book that had the biggest influence on the young Dawkins. 7.	Surprisingly forthcoming. “I was probably a disappointment as a naturalist, too, despite the rare privilege of spending a day with the young David Attenborough, when we were both guests of my Uncle Bill and Aunt Diana.”8.	Surprising issues such as bullying and peer pressure. “We wanted to be accepted by our fellows, especially the influential natural leaders among us; and the ethos of my peers was – until my last year at Oundle – anti-intellectual.”9.	Find out when exactly Dawkins became anti-religious. “If you are going to allow yourself to conjure a designer out of thin air, why not apply the same indulgence to that which he is supposed to have designed, and cut out, so to speak, the middle man?”10.	The musicians that inspired and moved Dawkins. 11.	Dawkins, Oxford and higher education. “I said that Oxford was the making of me, but really it was the tutorial system, which happens to be characteristic of Oxford and Cambridge.” 12.	It wouldn’t be a book about Dawkins if the grand theory of evolution wasn’t a part of it. “He introduced me to, among other things, his – and now my – favourite example of revealingly bad ‘design’ in animals: the recurrent laryngeal nerve.”13.	The moment where Dawkins reveal where his life changed stated unequivocally. 14.	The most important mentors of Dawkins’ life. “The senior figure in 13 Bevington Road was Mike Cullen, probably the most important mentor in my life – and I believe most of my contemporaries in the Animal Behaviour Research Group (ABRG) would agree.”15.	His surprising love-affair with computers. “I published a paper on the Dawkins Organ, and made the software available free of charge.”16.	The lectureship in animal behavior. “We planned a study that would exemplify, and clarify, one of the fundamental concepts of the ethological school of animal behaviour studies, the Fixed Action Pattern.”17.	Dawkins’ projects. It did, however, feed into my next big writing project: a long theoretical paper on ‘Hierarchical organisation as a candidate principle for ethology’.18.	The behind-the-scenes view behind the making of “The Selfish Gene”. “Gene survival is what really matters in natural selection.”19.	The scientists and circumstances that inspired Dawkins to make “The Selfish Gene”. “So Trivers’ name was added to those of Hamilton and Williams among the four authors who had greatest influence on The Selfish Gene.”20.	Links. Negatives:1.	Poor Kindle formatting. The digital version absolutely butchered all the poems. Something that should be remedied soon I hope.2.	The book is first and foremost a memoir, if you are expecting a lot of science or even the Dawkins classic contentious philosophical flair against religion, you will be sorely disappointed. A review of some of the key concepts behind the selfish gene but limited science elsewhere. 3.	I don’t know if Dawkins really explains to satisfaction how and what he felt at that time some of the events occurred. He struggles at times to provide answers regarding his mindset and must rely on and in some cases understandably so, on accounts from third parties (mother). 4.	A timeline of major events and locations would have added value.5.	Not the typical quote-fest that is so endearing to his admirers; yours truly included.6.	Avid fans and readers of Dawkins’ books may feel that the book gets repetitive. Particularly those who have read “The Selfish Gene”. That being said, there is some interesting behind the scenes revelations.In summary, an interesting journey into the first half of Dawkins’ life. This was a very easy and pleasant read. Dawkins is candid and forthcoming and shares an intimate look at his interesting life. The book revolves around his childhood and his early science years and the making of “The Selfish Gene”. Perhaps a little light on the science and the fiery philosophy that we admire and love from Dawkins (I must admit I missed some of that); this is a memoir worth reading. I highly recommend it with the reservations noted. Further recommendations: “The Selfish Gene” and “The Greatest Shown On Earth” by the same author, “Evolving Out of Eden” by Robert M.

The parts where he illustrates his vision on education were brilliant .""Shouldn’t children be taught critical, sceptical thinking from an early age? Shouldn’t we all be taught to doubt, to weigh up plausibility, to demand evidence?""He also sparked my interest in Karl Popper's philosophy of science as a two-stage process : coming up with a hypothesis followed by attempts to falsify predictions deduced from it.

I had every advantage: not only the perfect early environment of tropical Africa but what should have been the perfect genes to slot into it. For generations, sun-browned Dawkins legs have been striding in khaki shorts through the jungles of Empire."" Nevertheless, he denies any particular interest or skill in that area. He was more interested in philosophical issues, and was often tucked up with a book while his parents urged him out into the healthy outdoors. The unexpected inheritance of a country estate brought the Dawkinses back to England when Richard was 7 (American readers uninterested in his genealogy can safely skip the first chapter). and he was sent off to boarding school. He tells stories he considers embarrassing, many of them because he believed things he was told when they made no sense. He laments children's being taught to memorize rather than think and analyze.In due course he came to Balliol College at Oxford, his father's school, and by happy accident Niko Tinbergen was assigned as his tutor. He developed an interest in ethology, a case of hero-worship for Darwin, and an ""addiction"" to computer programming.As anyone who has read any of his previous books can testify, Dawkins is superbly skilled at explaining complex ideas in clear, nontechnical language. Here he offers several, along with lots of entertaining anecdotes and descriptions of numerous first-rate scientists he counts as personal friends. This book takes him through ""the first half of my life,"" ending with the publication of _The Selfish Gene_ when he was 35. He projects volume 2 of his memoirs to be forthcoming in about two years. I can hardly wait. The e-appendix to the book is available free and without registration at http://www.richarddawkins.net/afw , which provides samples of his stories. "
258,0062225790,http://goodreads.com/user/show/13536962-amanda,3,"Whether you like Richard Dawkins or not, you can't deny that his work in science has been important. Dawkins has had an impact on his field and inspired many people to take an interest in science and reason. And here in AN APPETITE FOR WONDER, he tells us the story of how he became a scientist.The story starts with his ancestors; grandparents, parents, and their siblings. To be honest, I didn't care much for the parts that weren't about his parents, because the rest of the family has a limited role in the rest of the book. Still, the story about his parents and their time in Africa was touching. Moving on, Dawkins tells us stories from his youth; to the time spent in South Africa, to the visits to Britain, and then an eventual move. During this time, he began school, which was very different from the schools we have today in the West. To be fair, the school he entered in Britain was rather different too, and Dawkins comments on this. Dawkins offers anecdotes, funny and honest, about himself during his youth. With many knowing him for his stance on religion and his own atheism, he's honest about his short stints as a Christian in his teenage years. With his usual humor and arrogance (that some hate and some love) he does get in some jabs at religion.As said, some hate and some love his arrogance on certain matters. But you know what? I'd say he's entitled. As we move past his teenage years, we move onto Dawkins' time at college, and his works after that. Regardless what one think of Dawkins, one can't deny he's a brilliant scientist. His work is simply that good. He knows his field. So yes, I'd say he's entitled to respect. However, while I enjoyed reading about his time at college and what he did next, I wasn't that interest in reading the details of his works. Sometimes it got a bit too technical regarding his research and focused less on him as a person and more on his actual work. Which I don't mind reading, but picking up this book I would've preferred to read more about the man behind the work, not the actual work. Still, overall, AN APPETITE FOR WONDER offers a wonderful account of Dawkins' upbringing and how he ended up in science, but for me, personally, some parts simply didn't interest me."
259,0062225790,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4393974-leah-k,3,"An Appetite for Wonder: The Making of a Scientist by Richard Dawkins 307 pages★★★ ½ Richard Dawkins is a prominent ethologist (study of animal behavior) and evolutionary biologist who has published several books on his theories, garnering much attention along the way. One may not always agree with his thoughts but I personally find him to be a very brilliant man and a talented writer on his subjects. This book is his memoir of his childhood up to the publishing of his first book The Selfish Gene in 1976. He plans to publish a second part in a couple years.So with his talent on writing about science, how did he do about writing his own life? Not bad. I have to admit that I was much more intrigued by the first half of this book in which he deals with his childhood and his schooling before going into college. His life as a child was an interesting one and it explains a lot about who he would become later on in life. The second part of this book? Not quite as interesting in my opinion. It is in the second part that he starts his true calling as a scientist and I did find parts fascinating but he had a habit of rambling and when the man gets into a scientific theory, try to stop him. Many sections in the second part read like a scientific journal or like one of his many books (in fact he yanked whole paragraphs from his thesis and first book and placed them into this memoir) and honestly if I wanted that much scientific theory… I would have read one of his scientific theory books. I would have been more interested in a more personal view but overall he left that out once he got into his college years. Yeah yeah, I get it, he’s a biologist so why wouldn’t he talk about his work? But I wish he had balanced it out a bit at the end. With that being said, I still find Dawkins to be a very interesting man and I look forward to his second book (although I fear he will just have a book full of paragraphs from his later books). "
260,0062225790,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3915017-anna,4,"I won an ARC of this book from Goodreads.Dawkins is one of my favorite thinkers out there. I've loved - and usually have had to take the time to digest the books as they are science heavy, in the best possibly way - all his books I've read. Which is most of them.This one is different. It's his autobiography. Less science, less atheism everywhere. And way more a look at his past. What made this young African-born British lad turn to be a fantastic scientist, and a big voice for the non-religious out there? How did he become what he is? A big part of the answer lies in how The Selfish Gene turned out to exist, and in this book, we get a good look at most of the probable factors.A fascinating man, and a fascinating childhood too. What would have had to be different (or how much could all the things have had to be different) while he'd still turned out to be him instead of someone else? How much could the things have changed before there would not have been The Selfish Gene?I liked the book; I hate having to try to rate it. How can you rate a biography? Yes, it did give me clues about how Dawkins turned out to become himself. But compared to his other works... writing an autobiography can hardly be as good as The God Delusion, can it?As an unrelated side not, I did discover that my cats are Catheists while reading this book - both of them loved to sleep on this particular book while I was trying to read it. It's rare both of them love sleeping on the same books."

But also considering this man left a great amount of influence on my character, on me discovering where I came from and what's my life purpose from a scientific point of view, it would be such a shame not to know 'his own evolution'.Although he spent almost half of the book talking about other people and family members rather than talking about himself, I have never seen 'THE' most arrogant and most aggressive atheist scientist I know, getting this emotional and humble. I liked the poetry parts, when he talked about females, when he shortly described his first sexual experience, but mostly I liked the last chapter about the butterfly -or rather the sneeze- effect. Light book with funny stories of a figure whos fingerprint can not be bounded nor described between two covers of a book. All hail the great Richard Dawkins :)(The audiobook -read by his impressive voice and English- is recommended)"
262,0062225790,http://goodreads.com/user/show/42879342-katheryn-saunders,5,"I like Richard Dawkins. He discusses biology, genetics, and evolution in a way the layperson can easily grasp without being condescending. And I enjoy listening to his voice in audiobooks. In this memoir describing the first half of his life, he is affable, poetic, quirky, and surprisingly sentimental. In an irony I can't ignore, though, he is also regretful of bullying he participated in, either actively or passively by not speaking up. He laments the bullying he witnessed in school and his failure to defend the bullied. He also describes some of the political protests he participated in at Berkley as bullying. And he bemoans that children today can't escape bullying because, when they get home from school, they're subjected to cyberbullying on FaceBook and Twitter. But he himself has gained a reputation as a cyberbully on Twitter. It has damaged his reputation and cost him speaking engagements. It's always hard to admit someone you admire has feet of clay. It's a pity he is not more self-aware. "
263,0062225790,http://goodreads.com/user/show/17687788-carlo-ruggiero,3,"Received an Advanced Reader's Edition of An Appetite for Wonder through GoodReads GiveawayI was somewhat familiar with Dawkins's work, having read selections from some titles and having listened to Magic of Reality on Audio... I had some difficulty with the first half of the book being more of a (private) school recollection; it profited me nothing to read about his old school masters. Dawkins is a brilliant scientist and can write well, but the content was a little lacking, in this reader's opinion. This autobiography is more of an intimate portrait of his life (not that this is a bad thing), rather than his experiences in science. Appetite is subtitled ""The Making of a Scientist,"" so I was hoping for more stories of discovery and experimentation. There are some nice moments of insight throughout the book, but it did fall a little short of my expectations. "
264,0062225790,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6093453-colin,4,"Most people know Richard Dawkins as an outspoken anti-theist. But he's a lot more than that - a prominent ethologist and evolutionary biologist and one of the great early popularisers of science and rational inquiry to the general public. Dawkins' autobiography is in fact half of one - in it, he chronicles his childhood in Africa in the late days of Empire, his schooldays in the British education system of the time - prep schools and public schools and eventually Oxford, and his first forays as an ethologist - a researcher in animal behavior - up to the point where a protracted power shortage led him to write the book that would catapult him to early public prominence - The Selfish Gene.No one can accuse Dawkins of being a bore - he is a wonderful writer, with a special gift for combining clarity with poetic cadence. His recollections of his idyllic childhood in Kenya and Nyasaland - what is now Malawi - are tinged with a kind of genteel nostalgia, suffused with fond anecdotes and snatches of verse, lullabies and epistolary fragments. But far from whitewashing the actions of Empire, he conditions his prose with the implicit awareness of the ills of British colonialism.It might have been tempting to spin a narrative of how his experiences living in the African wild influenced his later decision to become an ethologist, but Dawkins shies away from anything so obvious. He is circumspect in the infinite web of cause and effect relationships that pushed the byways of his life into what he is now.His accounts of schoolboy life in Chafyn Grove and Oundle are oddly evocative of Roald Dahl's more fanciful take on the subject. Fagging (in which new students are de facto slaves to their elders), idiosyncratic masters, and the mischievous antics of his peers feature. Somewhat shocking are his strangely matter-of-fact accounts of pedophile teachers and schoolboy pederasty, which would probably not have had a place in Dahl's tome but invite horrified wonder as to how widespread these kinds of cultures were in 1960s England. In any case, what is most of interest are his recountings of life in Oxford, as well as his early career up to the release of The Selfish Gene - at which the book abruptly ends, in expectation of Part Two, which he says will come in a few years. His is a life of much serendipity, if we believe his account of how he navigated early days under a bevy of excellent educators, mentors and collaborators - and his wry descriptions of his early obsession with programming computers strikes a chord.In the entire volume he suffuses this account of his life with a mixture of self-deprecation, accounts of his moral shortcomings, and homilies to his greatest inspirations, coming across as almost excessively humble but not quite so. Whether or not you buy his humility is one thing; but I personally think he means it all. A man with a greater facility for self-serving self-effacement would not say half the things he does in public.But what I appreciate the most is that he is first and foremost a scientist. As far as he is able, he relates everything to biology. There are parts where, caught by a stray thought, he suddenly branches off into an extended discussion about how that point in his life relates to some scientific theory or snippet of moral philosophy. For example, when talking about how he was made to recite a good-night prayer in school and garbled up the words more and more every night because he didn't actually understand what he was reciting, he suddenly starts talking about how this is a good test of meme theory - how the lack of a ""normalization"" mechanism - i.e. comprehension of the words' meaning - caused a high 'mutation rate' in the words. He also takes the opportunity - when talking about his first magnum opus - to explicate the central thesis of that book to the reader - that we are in effect lumbering vehicles for the propagation of our immortal, selfish genes, which care not for our survival but only their own - in the form of being passed down generation to generation. Some might accuse him of being a kind of in-your-face know-it-all. But I see it as an educator's inveterate failing - that he must fill every crevice of his life in the act of passing knowledge to another. Perhaps that is the common wellspring from which his outspoken atheism originates as well.This book was supposedly met with mixed reviews upon release - one reviewer called it self-absorbed, which is a very bizarre critique for an autobiography. I suppose, when compared to the fiery clarity of The Selfish Gene or the brazenly polemical The God Delusion, this book might seem disappointingly dull. But I think of it as a kind of mellow effort on Dawkins' part to reveal his more human, positive side. I had the occasion to attend a talk of his in Stanford last year where he was promoting his book - which was one of the reasons I even read it in the first place - and far from being the firebrand that he is often caricatured as, he comes across as mild and urbane in person, even when confronted by the inevitable audience questioning on the selfsame topics that have occupied his recent attention. Well, people, you can't have it one way or another. Dawkins is human like the rest of us. If you're wondering whether this book is worth your time - if you're not a Dawkins fan, probably not. But if you're interested in learning more about the biologist behind the anti-theist, go ahead. He may surprise you. And perhaps the book itself, elegantly written as it is, is surely more testament to the harmony between science and poetry - that the infusion of rational inquiry into life's Mystery does not lay it bare, but enriches and enlivens it. I give this book: 4 out of 5 Dawkins Organs"
265,0062225790,http://goodreads.com/user/show/719063-linda,3,"Won an uncorrected proof from Goodreads. (I LOVE when that happens!)Three and a half stars. I didn't realize that this book only covered Dawkins's childhood and early career. The part I'm really interested in comes later, but Dawkins promised a volume 2 in a few years.Every time I bump up against some math/science-- and in this bio, one does-- I realize how lousy I am at it. Dawkins is a scientist with a soft spot for poetry, and he has the ability to quote long passages from memory. I'm lucky to remember the first few digits of pi, and far less likely to be able to explain its significance.And that's why Dawkins is an internationally known and celebrated scientist and bestselling author, and I'm buying lottery tickets."
266,0062225790,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9409644-sarah,0,"You wouldn't think a memoir of one of our century's most prolific scientists would be so cute. The first chapters are about his great-grandparents down to his childhood and it is entirely endearing. There are even sections about his early childhood written by his mother. A few of the chapters Dawkins details a few of his research phases which gets quite dry, but if you stick with it, even a layman such as myself can enjoy it. It feels very honest, but An Appetite for Wonder is not a tell-all. Dawkins doesn't beat around the bush with his point of view (and if you're familiar with him at all, this is obvious), without being overbearing or preachy. Almost like a novel, it leaves me wanting more and excited for part 2."
267,0062225790,http://goodreads.com/user/show/16212136-peter-pete-mcloughlin,4," This autobiography of Richard Dawkins focuses on his intellectual life his growth from his early childhood in colonial Africa. To his schooling in England to oxford and a time at Berkeley in the late sixties involved in antiwar activity. To his development up to his first major work ""the Selfish Gene"" it doesn't go into his personal life more of his intellectual development but it lets you know what is important to him and the ideas that shaped him. Nice book on a major figure in biology and ""new atheism"". See my status updates for some more details."

I wasn't really thrilled with the content early on. But Dawkins writing ability is greater than his topic. Again he shows this to be the case. Unfortunately the sequel to this book isn't do out until 2015, and I am almost out of Dawkin's books to read. The only one left that I haven't read is The Magic of Reality. Does anyone know how to write in italics. Needed here for the title of the book. Once again if you like Richard Dawkin's works I think you will like this one too."

Strangely, I had a hard time picking this one up. But why? Dawkins is a very effective (and often entertaining) writer. I appreciate his contributions to science. And yet, I had only minimal interest in reading this memoir.Perhaps I went into it with the wrong mindset, or perhaps I was right all along, but the first half of the book is devoid of any dramatic relevations or insight. Dawkins grew up in a colony of the British Empire. Had servants. Had family members also in other fields of science. Went to a great boarding school. Was a prefect. Went to an awesome college. Worked with excellent researchers and thinkers. And then, at this memoir's climax, wrote a fantastic book -- THE SELFISH GENE. And that's it.Dawkins has led a good life, and there are some interesting pieces of insight he drops in, but for the most part, I felt nothing. Shame on me, too -- I didn't read the back blurb, and I didn't realize this was only the FIRST memoir of a planned two."
271,0062225790,http://goodreads.com/user/show/27253012-patty,4,"If you are a fan of Dawkins, I expect you'd like this memoir just fine. I found it great; it's a more personal account of Dawkins' upbringing and start in the scientific community with his interest in what he would later coin as the Selfish Gene. It's not terribly interesting, if you are not interested in those details. Within this memoir, he exposes his emotional weakness to poetry, early teenage fan-obsession with Elvis Presely, and the beginning of his relationship with Mariam. I am always enchanted by how Dawkins can spend several pages explaining to you the beauty of a fly, for example. 3.5/4 Stars."
272,0062225790,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4307846-linda-harkins,5,"I read several books by Dawkins during the '90s and discovered that he is the British ethologist who coined the word ""meme"" now embedded in the behavioral sciences. When Susan Blackmore ran with the meme ball, I also read what she had to say on the topic. This book, however, is a memoir of a person born into a family of privilege, a person whose hero is Charles Darwin, a person who writes in such a manner that I'm often amused and enlightened simultaneously. Dawkins is a talented writer who shows the reader how science enriches our lives and debunks myth and superstition."
273,0062225790,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6019174-stu-hall,3,"Started off interesting, faded and repetitive towards the end. I was hoping for a little more about the discovery of the evidence of his own beliefs and would have preferred less detail about the minutiae of pecking chicks."

275,0062225790,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1339246-gendou,4,"A short, fun autobiography by the Dawkins himself. Little science and philosophy lessons are woven in between anecdotes of growing up. Did you know Richard was born in Kenya?"
276,0062225790,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3493901-lindsay-nixon,3,"It is fascinating and wonderful to learn, step-by-step, how Richard Dawkins became, well, Richard Dawkins—the brilliant academic (ethologist, evolutionary biologist). I have never read a memoir like this, it is fitting that the entire memoir feels like an explained equation. It's mathematical and scientific in it's prose: the study, understanding, and explanation of Richard Dawkins. This memoir traces Dawkins' life and how his career shaped. You see the exact path of events in his life and curiosity that led him to become an ethologist, evolutionary biologist, and atheist. This memoir lacks any personal details of his life. He mentions his current and ex-wife in a single sentence, and while he does retell stories of his childhood, they are mostly to give context. For example, his family moved, but this was only told to explain he changed schools, which was only shared because it was at that school, with a new teaching style, that he realized he had no critical thinking skills and from that day on, became passionate about thinking critically. Or how the popularity of computer languages changed his interest and research, or how an electricity shortage forced his study and work projects in a new direction.Most memoirs I have read are mostly ""musings"" stories from the past, which this is not. The stories are picked only to explain the evolution of Dawkins work and mind. Most memoirs also impart nuggets of wisdom—those quotable quotes. This book doesn't do that either. It felt... educational, and that was fine. I usually get a lot out of memoirs--deeper connection to the person, life lessons, advice... not so much here. It felt like a lecture on Dawkins by Dawkins... This is a great memoir for Dawkins fans who want to understand how he came to be and I suspect young scientists and engineers might find comfort in reading his professional path. Everyone else might be a little bored or uninterested. I did take one thing away from it, though: failure is great. Dawkins never saw his failure as a bad thing or seemed disappointed. It was always about the curiosity. Failure gave as much an answer as success and it was the failures that shaped his career ultimately—they were often the branch in the path. Without them, he would not have become the Richard Dawkins we know and admire today."
277,0062225790,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5686119-book,4,"An Appetite for Wonder: The Making of a Scientist by Richard Dawkins “An Appetite for Wonder"" is an intimate memoir of the childhood and development of iconic scientist and renowned atheist, Richard Dawkins. The book covers the first half of his life up until the publishing of his first book and masterpiece, “The Selfish Gene”. This enjoyable and heartfelt 320-page book includes the following chapters: Genes and pith helmets, Camp followers in Kenya, The land of the lake, Eagle in the mountains, Farewell to Africa, Photographic Insert 1, Under Salisbury’s spire, ‘And your English summer’s done’, The spire by the Nene, Photographic Insert 2, Dreaming spires, Learning the trade, West Coast dreamtime, Computer fix, Photographic Insert 3, The grammar of behavior, The immortal gene, and Looking back down the path.Positives:1.	Engaging, warm account of his childhood and early science years. 2.	Dawkins is very candid and forthright in his memoir. Not afraid to be self-deprecating and uncharacteristically pleasant throughout the book. 3.	Three photographic inserts really complement the elegant writing style of Dawkins. A lovely family and fascinating stories and surprises from his childhood. 4.	Fascinating life. The book takes you to Africa where the young Dawkins spent most of his childhood at. Interesting challenges and very candid and respectful of how times were back then. “My next two memories are both of injections: the first by Dr Trim in Kenya and the second (more painful) by a scorpion, later in Nyasaland.” I’m not going to spoil it…bust rest assured, amusing stories.5.	The things that are of interest to Dawkins. “I have always been interested in the deep questions of existence, the questions that religion aspires (and fails) to answer, but I have been fortunate to live in a time when such questions are given scientific rather than supernatural answers.”6.	The book that had the biggest influence on the young Dawkins. 7.	Surprisingly forthcoming. “I was probably a disappointment as a naturalist, too, despite the rare privilege of spending a day with the young David Attenborough, when we were both guests of my Uncle Bill and Aunt Diana.”8.	Surprising issues such as bullying and peer pressure. “We wanted to be accepted by our fellows, especially the influential natural leaders among us; and the ethos of my peers was – until my last year at Oundle – anti-intellectual.”9.	Find out when exactly Dawkins became anti-religious. “If you are going to allow yourself to conjure a designer out of thin air, why not apply the same indulgence to that which he is supposed to have designed, and cut out, so to speak, the middle man?”10.	The musicians that inspired and moved Dawkins. 11.	Dawkins, Oxford and higher education. “I said that Oxford was the making of me, but really it was the tutorial system, which happens to be characteristic of Oxford and Cambridge.” 12.	It wouldn’t be a book about Dawkins if the grand theory of evolution wasn’t a part of it. “He introduced me to, among other things, his – and now my – favourite example of revealingly bad ‘design’ in animals: the recurrent laryngeal nerve.”13.	The moment where Dawkins reveal where his life changed stated unequivocally. 14.	The most important mentors of Dawkins’ life. “The senior figure in 13 Bevington Road was Mike Cullen, probably the most important mentor in my life – and I believe most of my contemporaries in the Animal Behaviour Research Group (ABRG) would agree.”15.	His surprising love-affair with computers. “I published a paper on the Dawkins Organ, and made the software available free of charge.”16.	The lectureship in animal behavior. “We planned a study that would exemplify, and clarify, one of the fundamental concepts of the ethological school of animal behaviour studies, the Fixed Action Pattern.”17.	Dawkins’ projects. It did, however, feed into my next big writing project: a long theoretical paper on ‘Hierarchical organisation as a candidate principle for ethology’.18.	The behind-the-scenes view behind the making of “The Selfish Gene”. “Gene survival is what really matters in natural selection.”19.	The scientists and circumstances that inspired Dawkins to make “The Selfish Gene”. “So Trivers’ name was added to those of Hamilton and Williams among the four authors who had greatest influence on The Selfish Gene.”20.	Links. Negatives:1.	Poor Kindle formatting. The digital version absolutely butchered all the poems. Something that should be remedied soon I hope.2.	The book is first and foremost a memoir, if you are expecting a lot of science or even the Dawkins classic contentious philosophical flair against religion, you will be sorely disappointed. A review of some of the key concepts behind the selfish gene but limited science elsewhere. 3.	I don’t know if Dawkins really explains to satisfaction how and what he felt at that time some of the events occurred. He struggles at times to provide answers regarding his mindset and must rely on and in some cases understandably so, on accounts from third parties (mother). 4.	A timeline of major events and locations would have added value.5.	Not the typical quote-fest that is so endearing to his admirers; yours truly included.6.	Avid fans and readers of Dawkins’ books may feel that the book gets repetitive. Particularly those who have read “The Selfish Gene”. That being said, there is some interesting behind the scenes revelations.In summary, an interesting journey into the first half of Dawkins’ life. This was a very easy and pleasant read. Dawkins is candid and forthcoming and shares an intimate look at his interesting life. The book revolves around his childhood and his early science years and the making of “The Selfish Gene”. Perhaps a little light on the science and the fiery philosophy that we admire and love from Dawkins (I must admit I missed some of that); this is a memoir worth reading. I highly recommend it with the reservations noted. Further recommendations: “The Selfish Gene” and “The Greatest Shown On Earth” by the same author, “Evolving Out of Eden” by Robert M.

The parts where he illustrates his vision on education were brilliant .""Shouldn’t children be taught critical, sceptical thinking from an early age? Shouldn’t we all be taught to doubt, to weigh up plausibility, to demand evidence?""He also sparked my interest in Karl Popper's philosophy of science as a two-stage process : coming up with a hypothesis followed by attempts to falsify predictions deduced from it. This book has some interesting parts, however sometimes I found it too boring and the science was a bit heavy.

But this book tells a wonderful story of his life, from birth in colonial Africa until his middle age and the publication of his book ""The Selfish Gene"" and far from being the work of a nasty person it is generous and funny and not at all self-aggrandizing. "
280,0062225790,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8712910-nancy,3,"Richard Dawkins is a good writer. At first I was very interested. However, the fact that he is an atheist began to bother me. He doesn't even think that children should be ""fooled"" into believing in make-believe--Santa Claus etc. They should be taught to question and to be cynical. He was quite condescending towards people who have religious beliefs. I just got tired of it."

285,0062225790,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1300459-sambasivan,4,The second half of the book becomes a bit technical but the first half of the life of Richard Dawkins covered in this book is quite enjoyable and adventurous one must say. Written with subtle humour and humility this gives a good account of the early life of Dawkins and a very good sneak view of life in the Oxford Colleges. Dawkins seems to have a prodigious memory to be able to detail the way he has of specific anecdotes. Waiting to read the second half which is expected to cover the writing life of Dawkins. 
286,0062225790,http://goodreads.com/user/show/39364424-eric,3,"An autobiography of Dawkins' early life through the publishing of ""The Selfish Gene"" in 1976, with plenty of anecdotes of his days at boarding school as a young child. I found the last few chapters, leading up to and including the writing of his first book, to be the most interesting."
287,0062225790,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4269814-carolyn,4,"This is a delightful book. Not only is Dawkins brilliant, he's witty, charming, and possessed of a deliciously wicked sense of humor. A sample: ""I suspect him [Desmond Morris] of being the original source of a widely circulated anecdote about the film star Diana Dors. She and he came from the same Wiltshire town and were childhood friends. Her real surname was not Dors but Fluck. She was invited back to open some fete or other, and the vicar, thinking to introduce her by the name the locals would have known, genially asked them to welcome the lovely 'Diana ... Clunt.'"" Dawkins was born in Africa. He says, ""I should have been a child naturalist. I had every advantage: not only the perfect early environment of tropical Africa but what should have been the perfect genes to slot into it. For generations, sun-browned Dawkins legs have been striding in khaki shorts through the jungles of Empire."" Nevertheless, he denies any particular interest or skill in that area. He was more interested in philosophical issues, and was often tucked up with a book while his parents urged him out into the healthy outdoors. The unexpected inheritance of a country estate brought the Dawkinses back to England when Richard was 7 (American readers uninterested in his genealogy can safely skip the first chapter). and he was sent off to boarding school. He tells stories he considers embarrassing, many of them because he believed things he was told when they made no sense. He laments children's being taught to memorize rather than think and analyze.In due course he came to Balliol College at Oxford, his father's school, and by happy accident Niko Tinbergen was assigned as his tutor. He developed an interest in ethology, a case of hero-worship for Darwin, and an ""addiction"" to computer programming.As anyone who has read any of his previous books can testify, Dawkins is superbly skilled at explaining complex ideas in clear, nontechnical language. Here he offers several, along with lots of entertaining anecdotes and descriptions of numerous first-rate scientists he counts as personal friends. This book takes him through ""the first half of my life,"" ending with the publication of _The Selfish Gene_ when he was 35. He projects volume 2 of his memoirs to be forthcoming in about two years. I can hardly wait. The e-appendix to the book is available free and without registration at http://www.richarddawkins.net/afw , which provides samples of his stories. "
288,0062225790,http://goodreads.com/user/show/13536962-amanda,3,"Whether you like Richard Dawkins or not, you can't deny that his work in science has been important. Dawkins has had an impact on his field and inspired many people to take an interest in science and reason. And here in AN APPETITE FOR WONDER, he tells us the story of how he became a scientist.The story starts with his ancestors; grandparents, parents, and their siblings. To be honest, I didn't care much for the parts that weren't about his parents, because the rest of the family has a limited role in the rest of the book. Still, the story about his parents and their time in Africa was touching. Moving on, Dawkins tells us stories from his youth; to the time spent in South Africa, to the visits to Britain, and then an eventual move. During this time, he began school, which was very different from the schools we have today in the West. To be fair, the school he entered in Britain was rather different too, and Dawkins comments on this. Dawkins offers anecdotes, funny and honest, about himself during his youth. With many knowing him for his stance on religion and his own atheism, he's honest about his short stints as a Christian in his teenage years. With his usual humor and arrogance (that some hate and some love) he does get in some jabs at religion.As said, some hate and some love his arrogance on certain matters. But you know what? I'd say he's entitled. As we move past his teenage years, we move onto Dawkins' time at college, and his works after that. Regardless what one think of Dawkins, one can't deny he's a brilliant scientist. His work is simply that good. He knows his field. So yes, I'd say he's entitled to respect. However, while I enjoyed reading about his time at college and what he did next, I wasn't that interest in reading the details of his works. Sometimes it got a bit too technical regarding his research and focused less on him as a person and more on his actual work. Which I don't mind reading, but picking up this book I would've preferred to read more about the man behind the work, not the actual work. Still, overall, AN APPETITE FOR WONDER offers a wonderful account of Dawkins' upbringing and how he ended up in science, but for me, personally, some parts simply didn't interest me."
289,0062225790,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4393974-leah-k,3,"An Appetite for Wonder: The Making of a Scientist by Richard Dawkins 307 pages★★★ ½ Richard Dawkins is a prominent ethologist (study of animal behavior) and evolutionary biologist who has published several books on his theories, garnering much attention along the way. One may not always agree with his thoughts but I personally find him to be a very brilliant man and a talented writer on his subjects. This book is his memoir of his childhood up to the publishing of his first book The Selfish Gene in 1976. He plans to publish a second part in a couple years.So with his talent on writing about science, how did he do about writing his own life? Not bad. I have to admit that I was much more intrigued by the first half of this book in which he deals with his childhood and his schooling before going into college. His life as a child was an interesting one and it explains a lot about who he would become later on in life. The second part of this book? Not quite as interesting in my opinion. It is in the second part that he starts his true calling as a scientist and I did find parts fascinating but he had a habit of rambling and when the man gets into a scientific theory, try to stop him. Many sections in the second part read like a scientific journal or like one of his many books (in fact he yanked whole paragraphs from his thesis and first book and placed them into this memoir) and honestly if I wanted that much scientific theory… I would have read one of his scientific theory books. I would have been more interested in a more personal view but overall he left that out once he got into his college years. Yeah yeah, I get it, he’s a biologist so why wouldn’t he talk about his work? But I wish he had balanced it out a bit at the end. With that being said, I still find Dawkins to be a very interesting man and I look forward to his second book (although I fear he will just have a book full of paragraphs from his later books). "
290,0062225790,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3915017-anna,4,"I won an ARC of this book from Goodreads.Dawkins is one of my favorite thinkers out there. I've loved - and usually have had to take the time to digest the books as they are science heavy, in the best possibly way - all his books I've read. Which is most of them.This one is different. It's his autobiography. Less science, less atheism everywhere. And way more a look at his past. What made this young African-born British lad turn to be a fantastic scientist, and a big voice for the non-religious out there? How did he become what he is? A big part of the answer lies in how The Selfish Gene turned out to exist, and in this book, we get a good look at most of the probable factors.A fascinating man, and a fascinating childhood too. What would have had to be different (or how much could all the things have had to be different) while he'd still turned out to be him instead of someone else? How much could the things have changed before there would not have been The Selfish Gene?I liked the book; I hate having to try to rate it. How can you rate a biography? Yes, it did give me clues about how Dawkins turned out to become himself. But compared to his other works... writing an autobiography can hardly be as good as The God Delusion, can it?As an unrelated side not, I did discover that my cats are Catheists while reading this book - both of them loved to sleep on this particular book while I was trying to read it. It's rare both of them love sleeping on the same books."
291,0062225790,http://goodreads.com/user/show/33332540-fares-d-alahmar,3,"Considering people aren't of my greatest interests, but ideas; this is the first autobiography book I have ever read. But also considering this man left a great amount of influence on my character, on me discovering where I came from and what's my life purpose from a scientific point of view, it would be such a shame not to know 'his own evolution'.Although he spent almost half of the book talking about other people and family members rather than talking about himself, I have never seen 'THE' most arrogant and most aggressive atheist scientist I know, getting this emotional and humble. I liked the poetry parts, when he talked about females, when he shortly described his first sexual experience, but mostly I liked the last chapter about the butterfly -or rather the sneeze- effect. Light book with funny stories of a figure whos fingerprint can not be bounded nor described between two covers of a book. All hail the great Richard Dawkins :)(The audiobook -read by his impressive voice and English- is recommended)"
292,0062225790,http://goodreads.com/user/show/42879342-katheryn-saunders,5,"I like Richard Dawkins. He discusses biology, genetics, and evolution in a way the layperson can easily grasp without being condescending. And I enjoy listening to his voice in audiobooks. In this memoir describing the first half of his life, he is affable, poetic, quirky, and surprisingly sentimental. In an irony I can't ignore, though, he is also regretful of bullying he participated in, either actively or passively by not speaking up. He laments the bullying he witnessed in school and his failure to defend the bullied. He also describes some of the political protests he participated in at Berkley as bullying. And he bemoans that children today can't escape bullying because, when they get home from school, they're subjected to cyberbullying on FaceBook and Twitter. But he himself has gained a reputation as a cyberbully on Twitter. It has damaged his reputation and cost him speaking engagements. It's always hard to admit someone you admire has feet of clay. It's a pity he is not more self-aware. "
293,0062225790,http://goodreads.com/user/show/17687788-carlo-ruggiero,3,"Received an Advanced Reader's Edition of An Appetite for Wonder through GoodReads GiveawayI was somewhat familiar with Dawkins's work, having read selections from some titles and having listened to Magic of Reality on Audio... I had some difficulty with the first half of the book being more of a (private) school recollection; it profited me nothing to read about his old school masters. Dawkins is a brilliant scientist and can write well, but the content was a little lacking, in this reader's opinion. This autobiography is more of an intimate portrait of his life (not that this is a bad thing), rather than his experiences in science. Appetite is subtitled ""The Making of a Scientist,"" so I was hoping for more stories of discovery and experimentation. There are some nice moments of insight throughout the book, but it did fall a little short of my expectations. "
294,0062225790,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6093453-colin,4,"Most people know Richard Dawkins as an outspoken anti-theist. But he's a lot more than that - a prominent ethologist and evolutionary biologist and one of the great early popularisers of science and rational inquiry to the general public. Dawkins' autobiography is in fact half of one - in it, he chronicles his childhood in Africa in the late days of Empire, his schooldays in the British education system of the time - prep schools and public schools and eventually Oxford, and his first forays as an ethologist - a researcher in animal behavior - up to the point where a protracted power shortage led him to write the book that would catapult him to early public prominence - The Selfish Gene.No one can accuse Dawkins of being a bore - he is a wonderful writer, with a special gift for combining clarity with poetic cadence. His recollections of his idyllic childhood in Kenya and Nyasaland - what is now Malawi - are tinged with a kind of genteel nostalgia, suffused with fond anecdotes and snatches of verse, lullabies and epistolary fragments. But far from whitewashing the actions of Empire, he conditions his prose with the implicit awareness of the ills of British colonialism.It might have been tempting to spin a narrative of how his experiences living in the African wild influenced his later decision to become an ethologist, but Dawkins shies away from anything so obvious. He is circumspect in the infinite web of cause and effect relationships that pushed the byways of his life into what he is now.His accounts of schoolboy life in Chafyn Grove and Oundle are oddly evocative of Roald Dahl's more fanciful take on the subject. Fagging (in which new students are de facto slaves to their elders), idiosyncratic masters, and the mischievous antics of his peers feature. Somewhat shocking are his strangely matter-of-fact accounts of pedophile teachers and schoolboy pederasty, which would probably not have had a place in Dahl's tome but invite horrified wonder as to how widespread these kinds of cultures were in 1960s England. In any case, what is most of interest are his recountings of life in Oxford, as well as his early career up to the release of The Selfish Gene - at which the book abruptly ends, in expectation of Part Two, which he says will come in a few years. His is a life of much serendipity, if we believe his account of how he navigated early days under a bevy of excellent educators, mentors and collaborators - and his wry descriptions of his early obsession with programming computers strikes a chord.In the entire volume he suffuses this account of his life with a mixture of self-deprecation, accounts of his moral shortcomings, and homilies to his greatest inspirations, coming across as almost excessively humble but not quite so. Whether or not you buy his humility is one thing; but I personally think he means it all. A man with a greater facility for self-serving self-effacement would not say half the things he does in public.But what I appreciate the most is that he is first and foremost a scientist. As far as he is able, he relates everything to biology. There are parts where, caught by a stray thought, he suddenly branches off into an extended discussion about how that point in his life relates to some scientific theory or snippet of moral philosophy. For example, when talking about how he was made to recite a good-night prayer in school and garbled up the words more and more every night because he didn't actually understand what he was reciting, he suddenly starts talking about how this is a good test of meme theory - how the lack of a ""normalization"" mechanism - i.e. comprehension of the words' meaning - caused a high 'mutation rate' in the words. He also takes the opportunity - when talking about his first magnum opus - to explicate the central thesis of that book to the reader - that we are in effect lumbering vehicles for the propagation of our immortal, selfish genes, which care not for our survival but only their own - in the form of being passed down generation to generation. Some might accuse him of being a kind of in-your-face know-it-all. But I see it as an educator's inveterate failing - that he must fill every crevice of his life in the act of passing knowledge to another. Perhaps that is the common wellspring from which his outspoken atheism originates as well.This book was supposedly met with mixed reviews upon release - one reviewer called it self-absorbed, which is a very bizarre critique for an autobiography. I suppose, when compared to the fiery clarity of The Selfish Gene or the brazenly polemical The God Delusion, this book might seem disappointingly dull. But I think of it as a kind of mellow effort on Dawkins' part to reveal his more human, positive side. I had the occasion to attend a talk of his in Stanford last year where he was promoting his book - which was one of the reasons I even read it in the first place - and far from being the firebrand that he is often caricatured as, he comes across as mild and urbane in person, even when confronted by the inevitable audience questioning on the selfsame topics that have occupied his recent attention. Well, people, you can't have it one way or another. Dawkins is human like the rest of us. If you're wondering whether this book is worth your time - if you're not a Dawkins fan, probably not. But if you're interested in learning more about the biologist behind the anti-theist, go ahead. He may surprise you. And perhaps the book itself, elegantly written as it is, is surely more testament to the harmony between science and poetry - that the infusion of rational inquiry into life's Mystery does not lay it bare, but enriches and enlivens it. I give this book: 4 out of 5 Dawkins Organs"
295,0062225790,http://goodreads.com/user/show/719063-linda,3,"Won an uncorrected proof from Goodreads. (I LOVE when that happens!)Three and a half stars. I didn't realize that this book only covered Dawkins's childhood and early career. The part I'm really interested in comes later, but Dawkins promised a volume 2 in a few years.Every time I bump up against some math/science-- and in this bio, one does-- I realize how lousy I am at it. Dawkins is a scientist with a soft spot for poetry, and he has the ability to quote long passages from memory. I'm lucky to remember the first few digits of pi, and far less likely to be able to explain its significance.And that's why Dawkins is an internationally known and celebrated scientist and bestselling author, and I'm buying lottery tickets."
296,0062225790,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9409644-sarah,0,"You wouldn't think a memoir of one of our century's most prolific scientists would be so cute. The first chapters are about his great-grandparents down to his childhood and it is entirely endearing. There are even sections about his early childhood written by his mother. A few of the chapters Dawkins details a few of his research phases which gets quite dry, but if you stick with it, even a layman such as myself can enjoy it. It feels very honest, but An Appetite for Wonder is not a tell-all. Dawkins doesn't beat around the bush with his point of view (and if you're familiar with him at all, this is obvious), without being overbearing or preachy. Almost like a novel, it leaves me wanting more and excited for part 2."
297,0062225790,http://goodreads.com/user/show/16212136-peter-pete-mcloughlin,4," This autobiography of Richard Dawkins focuses on his intellectual life his growth from his early childhood in colonial Africa. To his schooling in England to oxford and a time at Berkeley in the late sixties involved in antiwar activity. To his development up to his first major work ""the Selfish Gene"" it doesn't go into his personal life more of his intellectual development but it lets you know what is important to him and the ideas that shaped him. Nice book on a major figure in biology and ""new atheism"". See my status updates for some more details."
298,0062225790,http://goodreads.com/user/show/28825839-stephie-williams,4,"Somehow Dawkins always seems to write a good book. This book is no expectation. I wasn't really thrilled with the content early on. But Dawkins writing ability is greater than his topic. Again he shows this to be the case. Unfortunately the sequel to this book isn't do out until 2015, and I am almost out of Dawkin's books to read. The only one left that I haven't read is The Magic of Reality. Does anyone know how to write in italics. Needed here for the title of the book. Once again if you like Richard Dawkin's works I think you will like this one too."
