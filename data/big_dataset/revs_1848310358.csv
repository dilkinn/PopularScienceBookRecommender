Of course I heard of some players in this field, like Einstein, Bohr, Schrödinger, or Heisenberg, but it was all very vague and left me standing pretty much in the dark. Manjit Kumar was able to shed at least a little light (some photons if you like) on the topic, and I got a glimpse on this extraordinary achievement of human mind. Spanning roughly the time between 1900 (Planck's constant) and the mid 1960s (Everett's many world interpretation) this books explains QT/QM in a language that makes it relatively easy for this layman to follow. There's hardly any mathematics in this book and only a few diagrams. The author sets the weight on the essential leaps in developing the theory and adds some intriguing biographical and historical background on the physicists involved. I suppose everyone heard of ""Schrödinger's cat"". This thought experiment is explained pretty well, and also why Schrödinger invented it in the first place. Much more interesting to me though was the Einstein-Bohr debate. Apparently Einstein has spend a lot of his energy to refute Bohr's interpretation of QM. Alas, he failed.For scientists, this book is certainly too superficial, but I think in order to gain an outside perspective on quantum mechanics this is an excellent read.UPDATE 1/16/16Dramatis personæ; at the Solvay International Conference on Electrons and Photons, 1927 [click to enlarge and read names]

For me, the science was heavy, as my fascination with science has always been greater than my knowledge of it. I am not a scientist. That said, I loved this book. Did I understand all the theories, experiments and discussions? No. But I understood enough to follow the narrative and get excited or saddened by events and to share the passion of these giants and marvel at their tenacity and their genius.Years ago, When I started my studies in chemistry and physics, my brother thoughtfully gave me a framed copy of the famous Solvay 1927 Conference group photo, the one mentioned in the prologue, as inspiration. Inspire it did, as I gradually learned who these participants were and what they contributed to the understanding of our world. Theirs is such a grand story, I did not need to get every scientific reference in order to love listening to it. I think that is a measure of just how good this book is. "
3,1848310358,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8079403-max,5,"I thoroughly enjoyed Kumar’s book. He traces the scientific discoveries leading to quantum theory and the relationships of the scientists with a focus on the Einstein-Bohr debate over the theory’s meaning. I found Kumar’s explanations of complex theories accessible and helpful. I remember in high school and college in the 1960’s always hearing about this strange quantum world that didn’t quite exist unless someone looked at it. Kumar really helps make sense of it. My notes below summarize the science that paved the way for quantum theory, the Einstein Bohr rivalry and the various takes on the Copenhagen interpretation.Kumar’s history begins with Max Planck’s discovery of the quantum and his eponymous constant. Working to derive a formula to predict the spectral distribution of blackbody radiation in 1900, Planck found that only whole increments of energy worked. At a time when the atom was not a widely accepted theory, this confronted Planck’s belief in the continuous nature of energy and matter. He dodged the issue by saying that only the exchange of energy was quantized, not energy itself.Along came Einstein who accepted atoms as discrete matter and sources of discrete energy. After reading Planck’s paper Einstein challenged the prevailing wave theory of light, proclaiming light is made up of quanta. Einstein employed his quantum theory of electromagnetic radiation to explain the photoelectric effect in which light precipitates the release of electrons from metals. This was in 1905. Even in 1922 when Einstein was awarded the Noble Prize for his equation explaining the photoelectric effect, the underlying principle of light as quanta was still not widely accepted. Newton had held that light was composed of particles, but Thomas Young’s famous two slit experiment in 1801 showed light to be a wave. After overcoming the implied disrespect to Newton, scientists finally accepted light as a wave and held onto that view as tenaciously as they had held onto the particle view before. Also in Einstein’s Annus Mirabilis he explained Brownian motion with atomic theory gaining the atom much wider acceptance. And in his spare time that year he formulated the special theory of relativity and the famous E=MC2.In 1913 Niels Bohr conceptualized the quantum atom. Recognizing that J. J. Thomson’s plum pudding model of the atom was inherently unstable Bohr assigned electrons to special orbits in which they could not continuously emit radiation and lose energy. Each orbit had a specific energy level. When an electron moved from one orbit to another an exact amount of energy (quantum) was exchanged which resulted in unique spectral patterns. Amazingly there was no in between. An electron left one orbit and appeared in another instantaneously. The Franck-Hertz experiment in 1914 confirmed that the energy released or absorbed was exactly the difference between the energy levels of the orbits. In 1922 Bohr refined his atomic model with the concept of electron shells. This allowed him to predict the chemical similarities of elements in the periodic table.Einstein was thrilled with Bohr’s quantum atom as he felt it proved his theory of light-quanta. In 1916, finding time after his ground shattering theory of general relativity was announced in 1915, Einstein theorized that spontaneous emission occurred when an electron jumped to a lower energy orbit. The rub was that in his theory electrons made these jumps at random. His theory employed probabilities to determine the frequency of these jumps. Einstein, now as later, was uncomfortable with chance in physics theories. Einstein’s light-quantum, later to be renamed the photon, was proven in an 1923 experiment by American Arthur Compton who firing x-rays at graphite recorded changed wavelengths in the reflected scattered x-rays. Only a particle would behave this way. Furthermore he found the recoiling electrons that the x-rays had bounced off of. Then a French prince, Louis de Broglie, setting the stage for quantum mechanics, postulated that if a wave could have the values of a particle, why not the reverse? Ascribing wave characteristics to electrons explained perfectly the available orbits for electrons in an atom. Only those orbits that could accommodate whole or half wave lengths were physically possible. Sure enough subsequent experiments showed that electrons diffracted just like light. Wave particle duality was now established for energy and matter.In 1925 Wolfgang Pauli building on a paper by Edmund Stoner developed the exclusion principle. Stoner determined the number of possible energy states of electrons orbiting an atom. But the three quantum numbers denoting angular momentum, shape of orbit and orientation of orbit only allowed for half of the possible energy states. Pauli developed a fourth quantum number which would later be explained as spin. This quantum spin had two states, up or down, doubling the number of allowable electrons. It also explained the heretofore mysterious splitting of spectral lines known as the Zeeman Effect. The exclusion principle stated that no two electrons in an atom could have the same set of quantum numbers thus limiting the number of electrons.Werner Heisenberg solved a remaining problem of the quantum atom model. Even though it now explained the frequency of spectral lines, it did not explain the different intensities. Heisenberg decided to discard anything not observable, even that electrons occupied orbits. He needed the help of Max Born who collaborated with one his students, an excellent mathematician named Pascual Jordan, to get the math to support the physical theory. This new quantum mechanics employed a strange form of matrix mathematics in which A times B does not equal B times A, but it successfully calculated spectral line intensities. In England, Cambridge student P. A. M. Dirac also developed a mathematical proof working from a draft of Heisenberg’s paper.In 1926 Edwin Schrödinger developed a wave function for de Broglie’s electrons which eliminated the incomprehensible electron jumps. It also supported calculations that achieved the same predictive results as Heisenberg’s matrix mechanics. The rub was picturing what the wave represented. Schrödinger claimed it was a cloud of charge that could smoothly and continuously move from one orbit to another. He denied that electrons were particles at all while Heisenberg, committed to particles, opposed the wave theory, putting the two at odds.Heisenberg trying to settle his dispute with Schrödinger developed the uncertainty principle. This stated that quantum mechanics could not determine both the position and momentum of a particle, specifically an electron. Heisenberg, working as Bohr’s assistant, toyed with the idea that the photon itself that measured the electron interfered with the observation. Heisenberg refused to imply any behavior to an electron that could not be measured. There was no assuming what happened to an electron between two measurements, thus no path at all was held to have been traveled. Basically Heisenberg was saying classical concepts of wave, particle, position, momentum and trajectory had no meaning in the quantum world until observed. Bohr believed that uncertainty was fundamental to the quantum nature of wave-particle duality. Bohr felt the electron was both a wave and a particle, but that no experiment could measure both at the same time. He called his principle complementarity. Bohr held that observer and observed could not be separated. The way the quantum world was observed determined what was seen. Be it wave or particle, both observations were true depending on the way it was observed. Causality and regular patterns had no meaning. The only prediction quantum mechanics could make was one of probability. No experiment could ever return the deterministic clockwork cosmos of Newton to the quantum world. There was no reality at the quantum level outside of observation. This view became known as the Copenhagen interpretation. Einstein, while accepting that quantum mechanics was a correct and important theory, did not accept this interpretation. Einstein believed the quantum world was deterministic (“God doesn’t play dice.”) and most importantly real. It was there even when nobody was looking. The stage was set for a lifelong series of challenges to this interpretation by Einstein directed at Bohr, the Copenhagen Interpretation’s champion. At the conferences in Solvay in 1927 and 1930 Einstein offered thought experiments to show quantum mechanics was an incomplete description of reality. Bohr would parry and nothing would be resolved.After the Nazi’s assumed power in Germany In 1933 Einstein moved to Princeton. Bohr would be able to continue in Copenhagen until the Nazi’s declared martial law in Denmark in 1943. Many Physicists in Germany were Jewish or had Jewish connections. They were leaving and scattering around the world. Despite the turmoil of the 1930’s and 40’s, Einstein and Bohr carried on their quantum chess match. Einstein in 1935 published a paper with help from Princeton assistants known as the EPR paper. This thought experiment proposed measuring the momentum and position of one of a pair of entangled particles to determine the momentum and position of the other. The point was to prove the existence of the other particle independent of direct observation of it. The Copenhagen interpretation denied reality independent of observation. Key to Einstein’s argument was the concept of locality, that nothing faster than the speed of light could affect the other particle. Bohr conceded this but claimed the particles were entwined and thus one system, that a measurement of one was a measurement of both. Einstein reached out to the sympathetic Schrödinger who came up with his famous cat in a box thought experiment. A tiny radioactive substance is placed in the box. When it decays it will trigger a Geiger counter that will trigger the release of a vial of poison killing the cat. Since the event is not observed, does it happen? In the Copenhagen interpretation of quantum mechanics only a probability wave of the event exists. Schrödinger was trying to appeal to common sense in support of Einstein believing in reality that the cat was either actually dead or still alive. But Copenhagen purists would still say that the cat was both dead and alive until the wave was collapsed by observation. The debate would dominate the minds of Bohr and Einstein over the ensuing years. Bohr last visited Einstein in Princeton in 1954. Einstein died the next year at 76. Bohr died in 1962 at 77. The night before his death Bohr had drawn on his blackboard Einstein’s light box, a thought experiment Einstein proposed at the 1930 Solvay conference in an attempt to prove quantum mechanics an incomplete theory. Over 30 years later Bohr was still refining his argument.In 1964 John Stewart Bell put forth a theorem to test whether any local hidden variables could be used to explain the behavior of the entangled particles in the EPR thought experiment. Subsequent tests of the theorem supported non-locality between entangled particles and paved the way for today’s experiments with quantum level teleportation. But even though what Einstein called “spooky action at a distance” was proven to exist, his underlying belief that the quantum world also existed even when not measured was not disproven. In 1957 Hugh Everett III found a neat way around the problem with his many worlds interpretation. In this theory all quantum states actually exist simultaneously, obviating the probability wave. This resolved one objection to the Copenhagen Interpretation: Who observed the big bang to collapse the probability wave? God, of course, is one answer. Another issue for quantum mechanics is determining the dividing line between the quantum world and the classical world where reality is the norm.Despite the overwhelming acceptance of the Copenhagen interpretation in the mid-twentieth century, today while quantum mechanics itself is universally accepted, many physicists don’t believe it is a complete theory. The Copenhagen interpretation has lost its luster. Nobel laurate Murray Gell-Mann said ”Niels Bohr brain-washed a whole generation of physicists into believing that the problem had been solved.” At a 1999 quantum mechanics conference at Cambridge University, of 90 physicists polled, only four accepted the Copenhagen interpretation, thirty believed the modern version of the many worlds theory and most were undecided. Famed British physicist Roger Penrose said “I would, myself, strongly side with Einstein in his belief in a submicroscopic reality, and with his conviction that present-day quantum mechanics is fundamentally incomplete.” So maybe somewhere in the great beyond Einstein is finally winning his argument with Bohr."
4,1848310358,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2454280-murray-ewing,4,"It started with German physicists trying to make a better light bulb, and ended with the collapse of classical physics (if only at the subatomic level). Manjit Kumar’s Quantum is a history of the development of our understanding (if understanding is the right word for something nobody seems to understand) of quantum mechanics, looking into the lives of the key players as much as their discoveries.The two major players are Einstein and Niels Bohr, who, while agreeing that the equations behind quantum mechanics worked, differed absolutely on what those equations actually meant. Einstein wanted a physics that presented an accurate, realistic model of reality; Bohr believed there was no reality at the quantum level — not until we measured it, at any rate — just a bunch of probabilities, and that no ‘realistic model’ was possible.Kumar’s biographical approach highlights just how strange the path that led to the ideas of quantum science was — how, for instance, at the early stages, people presented equations that explained experimental results, but that nobody expected to be anything but a stop-gap till a more understandable (and less bizarre) solution came along, only to find that no, their bizarre equations were the best solution, and things were only going to get stranger.I can’t say I now understand quantum mechanics, or that I followed every theoretical step forward — the actual steps forward are explained quite briefly, without getting too much into technicalities — but I have certainly come to a strong appreciation of what strange materials these genius-level scientists were working with. Plus, it’s a good look into the scientific process generally, how a theory is worked at, and advanced, by many players, how ideas that are later accepted as canonical can be at first ridiculed, and how every step forward in science can raise even more questions.A good book, it certainly left me wanting to know more."
5,1848310358,http://goodreads.com/user/show/26188-jafar,3,"I’ve read a few books on Quantum physics and its incredible quirks and its implications about the nature of reality. By comparison, this book is light on the science, but provides an excellent history of quantum physics. There are historical fact that I had never heard of, such as the rivalry between Schrodinger and Heisenberg. Any book on quantum physics makes you think that Schrodinger was one of the pillars of the quantum community, but in fact he was an outsider and at odds with Bohr/Heisenberg/Pauli and closer to Einstein. Einstein’s famous disapproval of the interpretation of quantum physics (“God does not play dice.”) is mentioned in many books, but here you see very well why Einstein, who was the grandfather of quantum, was so uncomfortable with what the Bohr camp was saying, and how he obsessed many years over refuting the probabilistic nature of quantum physics. All in all, a very fascinating book. "
6,1848310358,http://goodreads.com/user/show/12541461-betseak,5,"In this work the author managed to give a superb account of the development of thought about quantum by bringing to life all the great physicists involved (Planck, Einstein, Born, Bohr, Schrödinger, de Broglie, Wien, Pauli, Heisenberg, Dirac, Boltzmann, Compton, Bohm, von Neumann, Bell) through vivid vignettes of their scientific accomplishments, interpersonal relations and the historical background. As it is evident from the title, the aim of the book was to present the clash of philosophical viewpoints between Einstein and Bohr about quantum theory and its interpretation. Without leaning on the equations and the mathematics of quantum theory, Manjit Kumar succeeded to accomplish it through a story that reads like an epistemological thriller. (Needless to say, though ‘the Bell’s Theorem tolled for Einstein’, the ending is still a sort of a cliffhanger.) The quantum concepts are explained with clarity (with a couple of exceptions, but I enjoyed the book too much to be too critical).As an afterthought: If you are interested in a mystical or religious interpretation of quantum theory, this is not the book.And also, here’s the link to a review which, in my opinion, captures the feel of this book very well:http://www.theguardian.com/books/2008/nov/15/quantum-physics-einstein-bohr-kumar"
7,1848310358,http://goodreads.com/user/show/38530619-britta-b-hler,4,"A very interesting and detailed account of the development of quantum physics and the decennia-long discussion between Einstein and Bohr about the nature of reality. Not an easy subject but the author manages to make it accessible for non-scientist, (and he kept the mathematicas at a minimum). I listened to the audiobook (ca. 14 hrs), beautifully read by Nat Porter."
8,1848310358,http://goodreads.com/user/show/40590836-ami-iida,4,It's written about the quantum mechanics history. 
9,1848310358,http://goodreads.com/user/show/21177142-roger,5,"There are a lot of popular science books on quantum theory but this one is different in that its aim is to question what's meant by reality. Manjit Kumar achieves this objective admirably. He also provides what I've found to be the best and most coherent account of the history of the development of quantum theory that I've read, managing, at the same time, to bring alive many of the key physicists and mathematicians involved, and not just Neils Bohr and Albert Einstein who are in the book's title. He also succeeded in explaining many aspects of quantum theory without resorting to mathematics, which is no mean feat. An exception was Bell's Inequality Theorem but I doubt that anyone could explain that in a non-mathematical way - despite having read several accounts by different authors I still have little idea of why this theory should tell us anything about hidden variables, but evidently it does.Whilst the subject of reality forms the main theme of the book, it's past the half way point before this topic is discussed in any serious way. But then Manjit examines the concept very thoroughly, focussing on the Copenhagen interpretation along with Einstein's objections to this interpretation, based on his belief that quantum theory is incomplete and that probability and non-locality must have some underlying explanation that is still to be discovered. My only criticism is that I feel the book could have been shorter, perhaps my omitting some of the finer detail when it came to history or by cutting out some of the views expressed by ""lesser"" scientists. There is quite a lot of repetition but, from my perspective, I found that helpful in reinforcing many of the points raised. However, a reader more familiar with the area might find the repetition irritating."
10,1848310358,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5917740-nilesh,5,"Many good books are written to simplistically explain the theoretical revolutions brought about in The first half of the tweNtieth century. Great biographies are published on the protagonists. But this book is something just different, wonderfuLly different.Sidestepping relativity is never easy while talking about Einstein. The book manages this. His opposition to Quantum theory is often either trivialised or made ridiculously philosOphical. The book masterfully traverses the landscape.But the book's biggest achievement is the roles played by so many other luminaries aLong with their background, interpersonal relationShips, rivalries, along with roles played by chance, the sequencing of events that made the era possible as well as the influence of wars.A must read for anyone interested in either science or scienlists."
11,1848310358,http://goodreads.com/user/show/67632708-durvasa-gupta,5,"The title itself is enough to carry away someone who is a quantum nerd. The author presents the biography of not a person but a field of science “Quantum Mechanics” in a most fascinating way. It took over a millennium for people to believe that the Earth was round, not flat. It was a difficult leap for humanity. There was a similar leap needed when the quantum was discovered. All the while when people believed light was a wave and matter continuous they had to take a leap into believing light could be a particle and an atom can have discontinuities. The book not only gives a comprehensive account of the birth of the quantum to the development of quantum mechanics but also in agreement with the title, it gives captivating details of the debate between Einstein and Bohr on the ontology of quantum mechanics. Highly recommended for people passionate about science. "
12,1848310358,http://goodreads.com/user/show/14941179-anna,4,"I’ve ostensibly been reading ‘Quantum’ for nine months. Actually, I got about 70 pages in while on a train then let it sit on my bedside table for three quarters of a year. Then I took it along on another long train journey and got back into it, although it definitely benefits from the lack of distractions in a quiet carriage. The fact is, I am social scientist who hasn’t studied any actual science since I was 16 and only realised while reading this book that the word ‘nuclear’ refers to the nucleus of an atom. Thus I read ‘Quantum’ at a slower pace than I’m used to, in order to get my head around it. The author deserves commendation for making quantum physics gradually comprehensible, on some level, to a layperson. Using the format of a narrative history definitely helps with this. The account of how the Nazis destroyed perhaps the world’s best physics institute with their decree that Jews couldn’t work in universities is especially memorable.  It took me about a hundred pages to get properly involved, but after that I was hooked. Kumar explains the debates between Bohr and Einstein about quantum theory and the very nature of reality with impressive clarity. I certainly feel much closer to understanding and my interest in more recent developments in quantum physics has been piqued. I also appreciated Kumar’s turn of phrase, particularly, ‘In the past, none had emerged unscathed from an attempt to pinpoint what constituted reality’."

This time I decided to make an exception and read this book. I found it absorbing like a novel, really well written and clear in explaining scientifics notions.I especially appreciate the way the author combine science, history and scientists personal lives. As a student I often heard Einstein, Bohr, Rutherford, Planck, Shroedinger, Heisenberg, Pauli, but I never stopped thinking about them just as persons. This book tells us about all the hard work, the passion, the struggles that these scientists experienced. Moreover gives a clear idea about how difficult is to bring new concepts in a well established academic community.I don't know enough about quantum physics to dwell on scientific explanations that are given in this book. I simply have to trust the author knowledge!I really recommend this book to everyone who wants to approach this fascinating subject. "
14,1848310358,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1884982-adam,4,"Well-written and engaging. Clarifies and explains concepts and events in 20th-century physics in ways that enable the scientific imbecile to better comprehend what the big deal is and why it's (still) such a big deal. Also works to arm said scientific imbecile with ways to humiliate people in the humanities who just love to bullshit about stuff they understand even less than someone who read a pop-science history does.Oh, and there's fun stuff in here about the personal lives of major figures in 20th-century physics. But that stuff is nowhere near as compelling as the overall drama at the heart of this account. "
15,1848310358,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9450123-srihari,4,"The book gives a condensed history of the modern physics. Each chapter is dedicated to a scientist starting with Max Plank to Einstein to Bhor to and the final verdicts on quantum mechanics that world now agrees on. The author presents a nice proportionate view of different aspects (childhood, personal, professional) of the life of the scientists without every missing a rudimentary explanation of the physical principles each scientist unfolded with their discoveries of new things and how it eventually led to a weird world of quantum. The personal flaws of each scientist were also subtly pointed out which made them a bit human for me after finishing the book. For anyone who likes or remotely interested in physics, I highly recommend this book. For sure it'll clear up what quantum means when the physics people use it. The author juggles a lot of different scientists in chapters to make a lot of connections which makes the reading a bit chaotic. So a rating of 4 instead of 5. But I guess the microscopic quantum world itself is chaotic. "

18,1848310358,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4088780-mike-w,3,"This is a good recounting of the historical development of quantum physics. It tells the story through a series of biographies of the major players--Planck, Bohr, Einstein, Schrodinger, etc... The book contains a lot of interesting information about the confusion felt by these great physicists as they tried to understand the implications of their experimental results and mathematical theories. It became clear over time that the assumptions of classical physics were not valid at the subatomic level, though Einstein, Planck and Schrodinger were never fully comfortable with the rejection of classical determinism and causality.There had been a long-standing dispute in physics about whether light was a particle or a wave. Ironically, it was Einstein who revived the particle theory of light, arguing that light was emitted in discrete quanta or photons. For a long time, the dominant interpretation of quantum mechanics espoused by Bohr, Heisenberg and others depicted electrons and photons as having dual particle and wave aspects, but denied that they were either particles or waves unless measured by some observer. This was the famous ""Copenhagen Interpretation"" in which the wave and particle aspect were ""complementary"". Moreover, these ""particles"" were really essentially indeterminate. As Heisenberg showed, it was impossible to estimate their position and momenta with perfect precision, not because of the limits of our knowledge or the imprecision of the measuring devices used, but because this uncertainty or indeterminacy were inherent characteristics of phenomena at a subatomic scale. Until someone took a measurement, it did not make sense to say the particle is at such and such a place. The particles simply were ""potentialities"", or probabilities. And reality was not really real until someone took a measurement. this prompted Einstein's famous protestation that ""God does not play dice with the universe.""But over time, as the book explains briefly in its conclusion, the Copenhagen Interpretation fell out of favor as various rivals challenged it--Bohm's hidden variables, or Everett's many worlds hypothesis for example.And, while marginalized over the last decades of his life, Einstein might well be vindicated, at least in part. he always believed that there was a deeper theory, a ""unified field theory"" that would explain the phenomena without resorting to an essential indeterminacy or unreality in nature. Strangely, the book does not mention ""String Theory"" which might prove to be the ""Theory of Everything"" than Einstein hoped in vain to discover.Again, the book tells this story well. It explains clearly the difficult concepts involved in the early debates about quanta, and gives the reader a sense of the personalities involved int these debates. It points out that Heisenberg, who won the Nobel prize for the creation of ""matrix mechanics"" didn't understand matrices, that Bohr, the champion of the quanta, strangely refused to accept that light too was quantized, that Schrodinger failed to understand his own wave equation, and so on... Such was the confusion into which physicists had plunged.But in its matter of fact style, the book fails to convey the majesty of the subject, or to explain with sufficient energy the fascination it holds even for intelligent laymen. It's good, but it could have been better."
19,1848310358,http://goodreads.com/user/show/76014-raghu,5,"Manjit Kumar's book is a fascinating history of one of the most fundamental areas of science.Just as the title says, it is a history of the great debate about the nature of reality with Einstein and Neils Bohr leading the opposing views. Quantum Mechanics has always been a fascinating subject for me, mainly because I could never hope to understand it enough, however much time I spent on it. This brilliant work takes you through the history of the ideas behind quantum mechanics from the late 19th century all the way till the latter half of 20th century. Manjit Kumar sets the stage slowly as he describes the contributions of great scientists ranging from Rutherford, Max Planck, Einstein, Bohr, de Broglie, Pauli, Heisenberg, Dirac and Schroedinger. Their works are captured along with a short historical background to provide the context. Then the stage is all set for the great question about the nature of reality. Bohr and Heisenberg and many others insist that there is no objective reality. Bohr says: 'There is no quantum world. There is only an abstract quantum mechanical description.It is wrong to think that the task of physics to find out how nature is. Physics concerns what we can say about nature.""On the other hand, Einstein insists on his belief in the existence of a causal, observer-independent reality. He says: ""What we call science has the sole purpose of determining what is"". Einstein and his Princeton team produce an ingenious thought-experiment called EPR that casts a major shadow on the Bohr-Heisenberg view called the 'Copenhagen Interpretation'. However, for all practical purposes, most scientists by the mid-20th century accept the Copenhagen view and get on with their science. Albert Einstein toiled till his death to find a Unified Field theory from which he hoped to derive the laws of Quantum Mechanics. But he wasn't successful. The book brings out the essence of those exhilarating times in science when great minds battle year after year on the nature of Reality amidst two major world wars and the looming threats of fascism and communism. In spite of their battles for decades, both Bohr and Einstein were such great human beings, having a great regard and affection for one another. The other giants like de Broglie, Pauli, Heisenberg and Schroedinger also show great respect and regard for their opponents' views and keep egos and personalities out of the equation. Manjit Kumar's narrative brings out all these essential human qualities quite vividly. He has a great ability to write. The book is lucid and delightfully accessible in spite of the difficult subject matter. I enjoyed reading it immensely. In many ways, it is like a thriller, as you keep looking for the next thought experiment that Einstein would come up with to counter Bohr only to find out how the Copenhagen team overcomes each of these hurdles. I would recommend it strongly to anyone interested in popular science in general and Quantum Mechanics in particular."

However, it doesn't mean that quantum mechanics cannot be understood whatsoever. With persistence, patience, and attention, some level of understanding could be reached.""Quantum: Einstein, Bohr, and the Great Debate about the Nature of Reality"" written by Manjit Kumar is a book attempting to guide you through the rich history behind this revolution: from the quantization of energy, which Max Planck considered to be just a magic trick, to Einstein's realization that light is made up of a package of energy called quanta. After the two events, a wave of new generation of young physicists started to emerge including Niels Bohr, Louis de Broglie, Wolfgang Pauli, Weiner Heisenberg, Erwin Schrődinger, Paul Dirac and others.There were two groups among these men: one, leading by Niels Bohr, believed in Copenhagen Interpretation, while the other one, leading by Einstein, opposed to it. Copenhagen Interpretation states that a physical system does not have a definite property prior to being measured, which means that before being measured, its property is just the cloud of probability. This obscures the nature of reality because nothing is real until observed, and Einstein felt bothered by it. The debate between Einstein and Borh spanned for 3 decades until their death. On the drawing board on the day Bohr died was Einstein's light box which Einstein used to argue with Borh thirty years ago. This, I must admit, made me tear up.I've read books and watched many documentaries about quantum mechanics before. Yet, each time I re-encounter the contents, my grasp of the subject appears to be pity, miniscule even. The concept of bell theorem is still annoyingly out of reach for me despite my reading about it from various sources many times already. Maybe one day when I have a firm grip and a more stable basic understanding on this subject, all the remaining unreachable concepts would be within my grasp.If you desire to know more about quantum mechanics, I would totally recommend this book, for it is presented in not-too-technical styles, thus making the probability of your being able to grasp it a bit higher even if you don't have any background of physics or mathematics.-----More reviews at https://menglongstarstuff.wordpress.com"

The first thing you notice about the book is the detail. Copiously researched, Kumar has pulled together a truly impressive array of material, both personal and professional, constructing a rich history that transports you to the subject's golden age and to the lives of the key players. He tells a story so engrossing and so detailed that I felt surprisingly moved towards the end. Yes, by a book on quantum theory.In terms of the science, there are some first-class explanations from blackbody radiation and the photoelectric effect through to EPR and Bell's Theorem, with 30+ pages of end notes. Although the history is structured around the debate between Einstein and Bohr, other key players are afforded considerable coverage - not just the obvious ones like Planck, Rutherford, Heisenberg, Schrödinger, de Broglie and Born, but also (and to his credit) some of the lesser known figures - Sommerfeld, Uhlenbeck, Compton - whose crucial contributions to the field frequently go unmentioned in books and articles on this subject.The great debate itself is a tremendously invigorating one. Both Einstein and Bohr agreed that quantum mechanics was correct. Where they disagreed was in whether or not it was complete. In fact the implications of this disagreement went deeper, calling into question the fundamental role of physics itself, and whether there is even such a thing to be measured as an independent objective reality. On this, the author's background in physics and philosophy are put to good use. So this is science, history, philosophy, biography. A well-written book that feeds the brain and the heart."
22,1848310358,http://goodreads.com/user/show/13719509-susan,3,"Hmmm... On the whole this book was fair to middlin', however it suffered from several flaws.The main issue I had with the book was that it didn't seem to know what it wanted to be. It flitted from biographical history of the 'key players' to one that attempted to explain the science behind their theorems and proofs. However, it did not seem to do either with any great amount of success. In both cases the length of time spent on the subject did not seem to display any consistency and left me wanting to know more about some people and significantly less about others. The same issue seemed to occur with the science. Some ideas were explained and repeated ad nauseum, whereas others seemed to start halfway through or fail to be explained at all.Overall it seemed as though the book was either over or under edited. The writer should have either had more room to breathe (an example of where this is lacking is the conclusion - for some reason the word 'Deadline' kept popping into my head when reading it) or been streamlined in what was wanted from the book.To summarise, the book was very interesting, but I fear that this had more to do with the topic and the people than it did the writer."
23,1848310358,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7094406-rohan,4,"This book provides simplistic and yet excellent history of Quantum Physics. I particularly liked the part which mentions rivalry between Schrodinger and Heisenberg. I was finally able to understand though still not clearly, why Einstein is considered as the father(if you call Max Planck the grandfather) of quantum theory.I have to admit I need to go through this book one more time to completely understand the technical arguments, though they were very few throughout the book. Overall, I would say this book was more about history than about the actual science. I really liked the last chapter of the book. It made me realize how far we have come as species in deriving and making complex conclusions about nature. I always knew about the greatness of Einstein but with this book, I also came to understand how important of a figure Bohr was to the Quantum world. All in all, a great book about great people to have ever lived among us. "

It touches on all the main characters in the development of quantum theory and subsequent development of quantum mechanics. There's a good bit of biographical and world history in the mix and you really get into the lives of these pivotal scientists, their passions, theories, interests, and lives.There is a fair bit of math and physics along the way, some parts get pretty heavy into it, but mostly this is a historical biography of Plank, Einstein, Bohr, Heisenberg, Schrodinger, etc.. . Anyone familiar with the science of the quantum will enjoy it and probably even gain some interesting insight into the history of the field.I loved the story and I'm marking ""Quantum: Einstein, Borh, and the Great Debate About the Nature of Reality"" as a definite reread for someday."

I've heard many anecdotal stories about quantum physics but this a great book that paints the broad strokes as told through the lives of the scientists who invented it. This book specifically focuses on the metaphysical debates between Einstein and Bohr and the fundamental implications it has for the nature of reality itself. It is great stuff. It is also heavy stuff, but a good escape for nerds like me. I think it would be interesting for anyone who has wondered about ""Schrodinger's Cat"" or what Einstein's famous quote ""God does not play dice"" meant. It is fun to think about these deep problems of science itself alongside the greats. HIghly recommended if you want to get a taste of what Nobel laureates fight about. "

But even if the concepts are flying over your head (as a couple did for me, despite a fair amount of familiarity with quantum mechanics and particle physics), the history and discussion of the various personalities and relationships will still be worth your time. And, perhaps more importantly, the end--and heart--of the book is concerned less with physics per se than with two competing *philosophical* views about what science is and whether such a thing as an objective reality actually exists."
27,1848310358,http://goodreads.com/user/show/95027968-a-b,2,"Modern physics is highly focused in relativity and quantum mechanics (QM). The former theory is the result of Albert Einstein's work, repeatedly confirmed over the last 98 years. The latter theory, whose degree of completeness is still an issue, is the result of concepts developed by Niels Bohr and work of his followers, which have led to two principles: [ i ] complementarity, viz., one can only get the complete picture of, say, an electron by using two concepts that contradict one another but are at the same time together, (e.g., wave vs. particle dichotomy), and [ ii ] indeterminacy (or uncertainty), viz., one cannot exactly determine at the same time some variables like the position *and* the momentum of that electron. This is often known as the Copenhagen interpretation of QM.Manjit Kumar's book, released in 2007, gives a historical account of the still unresolved ""problem of getting the interpretation proved"" --to quote Paul Dirac-- of the meaning of QM and the nature of matter and light, as seen from the perspective of the debates between Bohr and Einstein, and their scientific fellows, which reached a climax at the Fifth Solvay International Conference of October 1927. Mr Kumar touches on some philosophical aspects of the competing views underlying these debates, but does not really delve into them.The book is acceptably well written, despite a strong sophomoric tendency to bring up unnecessary anecdotes. The most flagrant ones are those about Erwin Schrödinger's sexual proclivities -- the nine references to his affairs in the twenty-four pages of chapter nine, including its title, are more suitable for those gossipy magazines in cashier aisles of North-American food markets than for a book on quanta (unless, of course, the author favors that ""enjoying a secret tryst"" is the best way to conceive wave mechanics). Zeitgeist of the millennium, I suppose.The last chapter of the book, where the author unveils an overt anti-Bohr perspective, leaves plenty to be desired. Mr Kumar concludes that ""Einstein has been vindicated, in part,"" in reference to what Einstein himself called his *instinctive* distrust of the Copenhagen interpretation (a distrust he did not support with a published interpretation of his own, however), encapsulated in the letter where he accuses Bohr of believing ""in the God who plays dice."" This conclusion, far from being universally shared, is apparently based on: ( i ) conceptual difficulties of QM not yet resolved; ( ii ) the ""many worlds"" interpretation of Hugh Everett's formulation, which Mr Kumar appears to take for granted that not only it would satisfy Einstein's demand of a tangible foundation for QM, but that it is a complete formulation as well; and ( iii ) the meager results of a poll of 90 physicists at a quantum conference 18 years ago, of whom less than half indicated an actual preference (Benjamin Disraeli would be amused). Nonetheless, a number of experiments in the 8 years after the book was completed have supported complementarity, and transformed the 'spukhafte Fernwirkung' into a reality. They include an experimental test of the famous Einstein vs. Bohr recoiling double-slit 'gedanken experiment,' in dispute 80 years ago at the Solway conference -- using resonant X-ray photoemission from molecular oxigen, in 2015 Miron and others showed the materialization of that thought experiment ""in full agreement with Bohr's complementarity principle"" (go.nature.com/2HQoWaI).For a perspective of the philosophies underlying the debates, the concepts put forward by Arthur Koestler in his book The Act of Creation (1964) are worth mentioning. Arguing that ""the glory of science is not in a truth more absolute than the truth of Bach or Tolstoy, but in the act of creation itself"" (p. 252), Koestler also concludes that ""bisociation"" is a consistent element of the process of discovery. Bisociation, defined as the simultaneous association of an idea or object with two fields ordinarily not regarded as related, fits complementarity like a glove.Finally, this book contains a GROSS MISTAKE, unacceptable in an author claiming ""a degree in physics"" who should understand basic concepts. It is a mistake the author makes about the effect discovered by Arthur Compton --namely, the increase in the wavelength of most secondary X-rays scattered after firing an X-ray beam on a graphite target--, which was a crucial finding that demonstrated light is quantized. In p.139 [2011 Norton edition, ISBN 978-039307829-9], Mr Kumar says that ""Compton understood that the difference in wavelength (and therefore frequency) meant the secondary X-rays were not the same as the ones that had been fired at the target. It was as strange as shinning a beam of red light at a metal surface and finding blue light being reflected."" The latter sentence is an erroneous simile of the effect discovered by Compton: as any physics undergraduate knows (and many a high-school student too), red light has a LONGER wavelength and therefore lower frequency and energy than blue light. The correct simile would be finding red light being reflected when shining a blue light beam at the metal surface.This mistake is not just a mere transposing error made in passing, but a major conceptual one. This is so because Mr Kumar makes it when trying to explain the scattering in his own words, something requiring full attention. And this is more flagrant as that sentence ends with a footnote about the Comptom effect using visible light. I am flabbergasted that none of the reviews of this book that I have seen mentions this awkward mistake, and that, in the absence of a correction, the book could have been shortlisted for a Samuel Johnson Prize. Seriously?"

It is just like hearing a really good lecture, you want to know what happens next. This is the history of quantum mechanics from Plank, Eisenstein, Bohr, Heisenberg, Pauli, Schrodinger, Bell and others that contributed to quantum mechanisms. This is framed with the Solvay conference in 1927. This is a fascinating story of geniuses working on an impossible problem and the lengths they had to go to the get there BEFORE computers. All of the physics calculations brought mathematics, statistics and all sorts of the different things along with it. Everything is possible in physics but be careful what you wish for because you can get into all sorts of realms of reality. This is Big Bang Theory material, I have heard these names from Big Bang Theory but never knew what they meant. All of these researchers won nobel prizes in this work and have done many other things to bring the world to where we are today. If you use computers, you are using something from physics, if you watch TV, thank physics for that. Everything in our modern world is because of these geniuses. Light-quanta or Quark is the smallest measurement. The debate between Bohr and Einstein was about how far you can measure before it stops. Is it true reality. These researchers used thought experiments to prove their point, going to their grave with different opinions about reality. We have all heard of Schroendinger's cat, but have we heard of Einsteins Light Box. Atoms are because of Neils Bohr but is there anything smaller than an atom and can it jump into pararell worlds and be measured. There are always new discoveries made but the early 19th century before electricity and computers. There was physics, books and highly intelligent people discussing reality. We have so much to thank for history and physics. I have to say it was an enjoyable read, this is well researched and well presented. I really learned a lot. The more you know, it is true, the less you truly understand. "
30,1848310358,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5720805-tom-schulte,4,"I very much enjoyed this book exploring the origins and rollout of the The Copenhagen interpretation; the meaning of quantum mechanics that was largely devised in the years 1925 to 1927 by Niels Bohr and Werner Heisenberg. According to the Copenhagen interpretation, physical systems generally do not have definite properties prior to being measured, and quantum mechanics can only predict the probabilities that measurements will produce certain results. The act of measurement affects the system, causing the set of probabilities to reduce to only one of the possible values immediately after the measurement. This feature is known as wave function collapse. There have been many objections to the Copenhagen Interpretation over the years. These include: discontinuous jumps when there is an observation, the probabilistic element introduced upon observation, the subjectiveness of requiring an observer, the difficulty of defining a measuring device, and more which Einstein railed against as ""God playing dice"" and ""spooky action at a distance"" as his complaints are often paraphrased. This audiobook, well-narrated, nicely balances the technical exposition with the human foibles (Bohr's peevishness, Schrödinger's skirt-chasing, etc.) with an amazing period of recasting our understanding of the nature of reality against the backdrop of WW I and WW II. After charting the fevered work around the Solvay Conferences and other places and the balkanization of the theoretical physicists into the Einstein-Schrödinger axis of realism and determinism (or at least the hope to find proof of those things) and the Bohr-Heisenberg axis embracing uncertainty and an observer-dependent reality,the book explores more recent alternatives to the Copenhagen Interpretation including the refuted Bell's inequality and Hugh Everett III's proposed many-worlds interpretation (MWI) of quantum physics, which he termed his ""relative state"" formulation."

I must admit that I don’t understand Q.M., yet I continue my failed attempts as this subject fascinates me.The author gives a chronological account of the fierce dispute over the metaphysical reality that engrossed the scientific world through the 20th century. Bohr was siding with the view of an uncertain world that is dependent on our perception, whereas Einstein was adamant on an observer independent world. It was a debate between quantum physics and classical physics, Local realism and quantum non-locality, quantum jump and continuity, and uncertainty and determinism. It was a fun read, mostly the second half of the book, where the actual debate takes place. The chapter that I found more captivating than others was Ch. 13, Quantum Reality. In this chapter the author talks about the famous “Schrodinger’s Cat” and “Quantum Entanglement”. You can find these ideas in other books too, but here only you know the backdrop, how they came about and under what circumstances. The story-telling was captivating enough but I felt that the science and philosophy part couldn’t come off the ground, but overall I have come away pretty satisfied."

Each of them contributed something to the development of quantum physics, although Einstein never really accepted its tenets. He couldn’t believe that “God plays dice with the universe,” and said so many times. (I thought that was just an urban legend.) The rest of them came to understand that God really does roll the dice. Neils Bohr said it best: “Those who are not shocked when they first come across quantum theory cannot possibly have understood it.” Richard Feynman quipped, “I think I can safely say that nobody understands quantum mechanics.” I definitely don’t understand it, but I really enjoyed reading about the men who puzzled it out. I wish I could have lived during their time, and I really wish I could have been one of them."

Yet, both points of view are needed to push each other to the brink of crisis, demanding confirmation, and ultimately figuring it out, but not without the intervening struggle between two opposing theories. A great story! "
34,1848310358,http://goodreads.com/user/show/23888196-rama,4,"Quantum : Einstein, Bohr and the Great Debate About the Nature of Reality The great Einstein-Bohr debate about physical reality is interesting not only to physicists, but also to great many readers interested in understanding the nature. This discussion between Bohr and Einstein over the interpretation of quantum theory began in 1927 at the fifth Solvay Conference. The debate over the ability of quantum theory to describe nature was fueled by many leading physicists of the time, some of whom directly contributed to the development of quantum physics, but later found themselves arguing against the theory they helped to create. Notable examples include Erwin Schrodinger, Paul Dirac, and Max Planck; the latter two did not actively participate in challenging the quantum reality. Bohr and Einstein spent many years intensely debating the nature of reality, and their discussions are known for very famous Einstein's comments such as; ""God does not play dice,' or ""God is slick, but he ain't mean,"" and Bohr's response was ""don't bring God into this (discussion of quantum physics)."" Bohr argued vigorously against both deterministic and realistic world, but Einstein was equally adamant to defend these two physical and philosophical concepts. Deterministic philosophy was spurred by Newtonian mechanics; if we know a system and its physical properties (size, color, or position) at one point in time, then at some point in future we can predict the system based on these physical properties. Bohr argued that complete knowledge of the present can result only in a description of what the future most probably will be like, but there is no such thing as certainty in quantum world. This thought is mystified by what is commonly called Copenhagen interpretation, and its strong proponents were Niels Bohr, Werner Heisenberg, and Max Born. Classical reality envisioned by Einstein was supported to a certain level by Schrödinger. Recent historical research shows that Paul Dirac had his own doubts about Copenhagen school of thought (1), and Max Planck, the founding father of quantum physics, lived until 1947 did not participate directly in Einstein-Bohr debate because of his own insecurities about quantum reality. When experimental test for Bell's inequality was conducted by Alain Aspect and others, many thought that Einstein was definitely wrong, but recent advances say, not so fast. Physicist Roger Penrose and many others believe that quantum physics is an incomplete theory (2). Few weeks ago when Large Hadron Collider (LHC) conducted test runs, Stephen Hawking expressed pessimism of finding Higgs Boson in LHC experiments by stating that ""I think it will be much more exciting if we don't find the Higgs. That will show something is wrong, and we need to think again. I have a bet of 100 dollars that we won't find the Higgs."" In a poll conducted in 1999 at Cambridge University, 55% of physicists polled for none of the existing quantum interpretations are right. This shows that not everything is settled in quantum physics. History of quantum physics is the best example to understand how scientists work. Their collective efforts to understand the universe we live in through publications, conferences, discussions correspondence and collaborative efforts are essential to scientific advancement. The author describes these things well in the book, but he falls short in certain areas; his current work uses previously published works of Max Jammer (3), Jagdish Mehra and Helmut Rechenberg (4) as his few sources of information, but he could have researched a little more by talking to people who were directly associated with Einstein or Bohr. In a recent book by Louisa Gilder (5), after interviewing a colleague of Boris Podolsky, she reported that Rosen or Podolsky never asked Einstein for his permission when they published the classic Einstein, Podolsky and Rosen paper, 'Can Quantum Mechanical Description of Physical Reality Be Considered Complete."" It is also stated elsewhere that Einstein never thought this was going to be a paper; the ideas came out during informal discussions (6). The author discusses the results of crucial experiments such as tests of Bell's theorem, and other work that may have lead to confusions or mistakes. Many who are familiar with the history of quantum physics think that even though Einstein is unquestionably the best scientist mankind has ever seen but they also believe that he was grumpy old man who did not appreciate new and novel ideas in physics. This is certainly not true according to physicists who knew him. He helped Max Planck in the development of early ideas such as quantized energy levels in quantum physics. Einstein was not against new ideas such as the probabilistic or statistical interpretation of quantum mechanics, but the denial of an independent reality bothered him immensely. This lead to another famous quote from Einstein: ""I think that a particle must have a separate reality independent of the measurements. That is an electron has spin, location and so forth even when it is not being measured. I like to think that the moon is there even if I am not looking at it."" The author resurrects these ideals of Einstein hastily when he discusses experimental tests of Bell's theorem. He concludes that Einstein's doubts about the completeness of quantum mechanics are vindicated. "

Just because Einstein is recognizable by the general public does not make him more knowledgeable than any of the Kardashians.

36,1848310358,http://goodreads.com/user/show/45669105-toby,5,"This was a joy to read. It provided a fantastic account of the quantum theory, including the science, history, philosophical interpretations and the interesting personalities involved in its development. It is a must-read for anyone interested in modern physics from a basic scientific, historical or philosophical point of view, without the complicated mathematics.  The book offered a captivating narrative, tracking the theory from its roots in the conservative theorist Max Planck, and then covering most of the revolutionary theoretical and experimental developments that followed: from Einstein, Rutherford and Bohr through to Schrodinger, Pauli and Heisenberg, among many others. The reader gets to fully appreciate the ingenuity of the physicists and their theories, learn of their correspondence on the matter together, and gets a little glimpse into the lives of the physicists during the momentous years of the first half of the 20th century. I particularly liked Bohr, a great theorist, a critical thinker and champion of quantum theory, but also a wonderful teacher, colleague, friend and humanitarian (even if at times he was overbearing!). Pauli the scathing critic (the ""conscience of physics""), and of course Einstein, are also interesting characters, among many others... This context and narrative gives the book a flow, making it very readable, even exciting at times. The gripping stories and personalities, the passionate debates and clashing ideas, the shocking experiments and discoveries, the thoughtful questions, the ingenious solutions, and the persisting mysteries and challenges, all keep you wondering what will happen next and if any resolution will come.  On top of the history, the author offers the necessary explanations of the science, and discussions on the stunning revelations it unveiled about the nature of reality at atomic and subatomic scales. The science is lucidly described, an impressive feat to accomplish considering the perplexing nature of the theory. It is honestly one of the best accounts of quantum mechanics for the general public I've ever read. The author writes clear explanations and constructs the account methodically and meticulously with the lay-person in mind. What results is a pretty complete and accessible account of the science of quantum theory, as well as of the history and philosophy behind it. I thoroughly appreciated how discussions of the science appropriately interpreted the perspectives of the scientists themselves as they grappled with understanding the experiments and theories they studied, and how the author wonderfully tracks how their perspectives evolved over time as the story develops. This is one of the best things about the book, as we get to fully appreciate the astonishing implications of quantum mechanics. The book expertly explains how the discoveries and theories often challenged the very foundations of physics, as well as deeply held beliefs about the nature of reality. Puzzling concepts including the uncertainty of determining conjugate variables, the probabilistic nature of the physical laws, the complementary of the wave and particle properties of light, and the physical meaning of the abstract math that made up the theories all boggle the mind, but are still a treat for the intellect to consider. These concepts are confusing, but will deeply alter the way you view the world. The scientists themselves struggled to understand it all, but still offered deep, ingenious and often very radically different interpretations of the theories and principles they developed: Schrodinger criticized the statistical nature of quantum mechanics and attempted to come up with a deterministic wave-theory of matter, Heisenberg opposed him and held onto a particle theory while declaring that his uncertainty principle was fundamental, and others like de Broglie proposed an integrated ""pilot-wave theory"" that incorporated the reality of both particles and waves into understanding matter. We observe how their thoughtful considerations (and those of many others), even when flawed, led to additional scientific breakthroughs, and into fairly extreme philosophical territories.  At the centre of the debates are Bohr and Einstein. Throughout, and especially towards the later parts of the book, the narrative focuses heavily on the differences between Einstein and Bohr on how each interpreted the new physics. Bohr embraced quantum mechanics and its success, and followed it to radical, counter-intuitive, conclusions about the nature of reality. He proposed that physical reality as we thought we knew it didn't exist: that uncertainty was an inherent aspect of any theory that describes subatomic processes, that the universe didn't run like clockwork but according to probabilistic laws, that light could exhibit complementary wave-like or particle-like properties depending what experiment was performed, but was actually neither... He even decided that notions of a particle's position or momentum did not exist until a measurement was performed to make these values ""real"", but until then they were meaningless. ""There is no quantum world"" he'd famously state, ""only an abstract quantum mechanical description"". His ""Copenhagen Interpretation"" was extremely influential, considering he and its other proponents were instrumental figures in development of the theory, and that his Institute in Copenhagen had long been a centre for studying quantum physics and teaching it to new students.  Einstein on the other hand, believed deeply in an observer-independent reality, and that all of science rested on this very assumption. He was convinced that quantum mechanics was either wrong or incomplete based on his philosophical convictions. He began to prod at the Copenhagen Interpretation with a series of challenges. However, after proposing clever but flawed thought-experiments supposedly exposing inconsistencies in the theory, Niels Bohr would successfully unravel them and defend his interpretation. Einstein initially failed to find holes in quantum mechanics. However, he would continue to search for ""hidden variable"" explanations for the statistical nature of the physical laws that quantum mechanical offered, and also offered one more critical thought-experiment that would challenge not the theory itself but its completeness. The EPR thought-experiment showed how a precise measurement could be made of a particle's position of momentum without disturbing it, as long as it is inferred by a particle it had previously interacted with but is now separated from. Since two particles can't communicate with each other faster than the speed of light, then quantum mechanics must be incomplete because it supposedly forbids the measurement of these properties without instantly disturbing the particle.  The debates between the two scientists at conferences, the influential papers they published on their opposing ideas, and their correspondence with each other and others on the matter are all revealed through exciting story-telling. Even as the two men settled into older age, they would still battle behind the scenes on their interpretations of the theory. Bohr offered a somewhat vague explanation that the particles in Einstein's EPR thought-experiment formed a sort of unified system that held together even over large distances. Einstein continued to stubbornly challenge the accepted quantum orthodoxy. But they were not merely old fools caught in the past, as many may have thought at the time. Einstein's brilliant final thought-experiment would continue to bother not only Bohr, but many others who eventually realized what he may have been getting at, even long after his death.  The author shows how Einstein's stubborn challenges to a well-established theory pushed further research into quantum mechanics. Physicists in later years searched for (and found!) hidden-variable explanations of quantum mechanics and unified field theories that Einstein was after, hoping to explain quantum mechanics as a result of a much grander theory that could clarify some of quantum mechanics shortcomings. Additionally, a theorem was eventually formulated which could decide if a hidden-variable explanation or a quantum mechanical description of nature was correct: Bell's theorem. Testing Bell's Theorem would use a modified real-world EPR experiment to determine the ""winner"" of the EPR thought-experiment debate. Results of the tests found that Bohr had been closer to the truth, as strange as it is: both particles in an EPR system are disturbed in agreeance with the Copenhagen prediction, even though one particle doesn't have to be directly measured. The interacting particles are said to be ""entangled"" even after they separate, and both behave according to the laws of quantum mechanics, not hidden variables.  As the final chapters of the book documents Bohr's Copenhagen Interpretation standing the test of Bell's Theorem, it also shows how Einstein's spirit might have found some vindication in the many worlds interpretation of quantum mechanics that followed. This interpretation by Everett gave a mathematical description of quantum mechanics where all the possible outcomes described by it's probabilistic laws unfold in many divided universes. The interpretation does not rely on an observer-dependent reality, but each possibility actually exists in reality, something perhaps Einstein would have appreciated.  Long after their monumental contributions, long after their debates, and long after their deaths, both scientists contributions would influence how physicists thought about quantum mechanics. Their intellectual battles, though mostly philosophical in nature, would have a lasting impact on physics: scientists began searching for a more fundamental theory of quantum gravity by attempting to reconcile Einstein's general relativity with quantum mechanics, and also made incredible discoveries involving the very Copenhagen notion of ""quantum entanglement"". In conclusion, this book's documentation of the quantum theory and the revolutionary paradigm shift in physics that followed is masterful. The philosophical debates that ensued between two great scientists one the interpretation of the theory is also reported in a delightful narrative, opening the reader's mind up to deeply challenging perspective on the nature of reality. It also provides valuable and interesting historical context, engaging glimpses into the quirky personalities of the physicists, and insight into how science works. For anyone interested in quantum theory from a basic scientific, historical and philosophical perspective, without overwhelming mathematical descriptions, this is an absolute must-read and a pleasure. I loved it and consider it one of my favourite all-time popular science books, without a doubt."

It’s a story of friendship, rivalry, epiphany and innovation. I think the timeline that’s been put out at the end of the book is a great idea which helps recapitulate the Quantum Mechanics journey."
38,1848310358,http://goodreads.com/user/show/14821636-andrew-fish,3,"At the turn of the twentieth century, it appeared that classical physics was reaching an explanation of everything. Electricity and magnetism had been unified, thermodynamics had been explained through kinetic theory and the industrial revolution was proof positive that the physical laws were both practical and accurate.But within the space of a decade, two developments were to turn physics on its head and make things a whole lot more uncertain. One was relativity, the other was the splitting of the atom. And it was the latter which was to really set the virtual cat amongst the potential pigeons, because when you started looking at things inside the atom, they no longer seemed to behave in a logical, classical manner.Manjit Kumar's Quantum takes on the story of quantum mechanics from its inception in response to the black-body radiation problem through to Bell's work on the EPR paradox. At its heart is a scientific conflict between two men, Albert Einstein and Niels Bohr - both agreed that quantum theory was mathematically sound, but they profoundly disagreed about its philosophical interpretation. Around them a cast of names from Heisenberg to Schroedinger contributed to the development of the science and the understanding of it.Superficially, Kumar's book resembles Richard Holmes' The Age of Wonder: How the Romantic Generation Discovered the Beauty and Terror of Science or Jenny Uglow's The Lunar Men: Five Friends Whose Curiosity Changed the World, following a group of professionally related people through a period of profound change. Kumar, however, comes across as less interested in the people than in their work, although this may be because by the time science was more formal and professional, conducted in universities by qualified scientists, rather than improvised in the home by amateur enthusiasts. There are touches of life intruding, particuarly in the impact of the two world wars, but these are few and serve more to rearrange the players geographically than to change their lives or outlook.The science itself is described simply. It's not exactly in layman's terms, but neither does it require a degree in physics to understand it. Since the meat of the book revolves around the philosophical conflict between Bohr and Einstein, there's little about actual experimentation - the veracity of quantum theory through its physical application is alluded to, but never explained - but the occasional thought experiment is detailed as the story goes on.Much of how you feel about this book will depend on how much you already know and how interested you are. For me, it was nice to see how all the names I'd heard connected together, but I can imagine that if you knew less about the subject you'd be a little disappointed about the lack of depth in the scientific explanations, whilst if you were interested in the people, you'd find the portraits here somewhat underwhelming. Ultimately, whilst the book is written well enough it lacks the passion of Holmes or Uglow, or for that matter Simon Singh (whose book on Fermat's Last Theorem is a masterclass in how to take an obscure subject and make it fascinating) and thus falls a little flat. Worth a read, but don't expect too much."

Next time make it twice as long and give us more detail about the recent science. "

I’d definitely add this one to the re-read and read again pile. It’s unlike any quantum book I’ve read before!This book was like a journey through quantum discovery, explaining the scientists lives and backstories, their theories and how they got into thinking, their correspondences and communications between each other and a time line through everything quantum. What I loved was it didn’t just explain quantum principles or quantum discoveries but actually went through and told the story of each scientist who discovered it and all about their lives too. Very fond of this brilliant book!"
41,1848310358,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2047122-benjamin-berman,5,"This book is very accessible to a non-science person such as myself. The early chapters focus on the early development of quantum mechanics, and Kumar is really good at describing these developments in terms any reasonably intelligent person could understand. Obviously, important things are lost in the details i am sure, but i do feel like i learned something during these chapters. I do have a very basic background in psychics, including very elementary light and heat and perhaps that did prepare me, but i think one could undertake this book without it. The second half of the book, basically after the statement by Werner Heisenbeg of the ""Uncertainty Principle"" focuses on the debate on the nature of reality spurred by quantum mechanics, as reflected in the views of two giants of 20th century physics, Albert Einstein and Neils Bohr. Bohr, who through his work and the work of his students is in many ways the patriarch of quantum mechanics, when confronted with the non-deterministic nature of quantum mechanics, came to believe ""There is no quantum world. There is only an abstract mechanical description."" Einstein virulently disagreed with such a statement, and held to his view that there is an observer-independent reality, stating ""What we call science, has the sole purpose of determining what is"" What struck me is that at some point, this debate stopped being a purely empirical or scientific one and became a philosophical debate between the two camps that touched on their innermost beliefs on the nature of reality. The debate rages on until today...Another interesting aspect of the book was the contrast in style between the two protagonists, Bohr and Einstein. Bohr is, to me at least, very much an archetype of modern science. He is empirically grounded, engaged in regular physical experimentation, and puts an emphasis on collaboration, spreading his brilliant students/collaborators all over the top universities of Europe and America to further develop physics as an academic field. Einstein meanwhile is the more romantic figure. A man who worked largely alone, and mostly in his own mind, specializing in thought experiments both brilliant and concise. Einstein very much embodies the Romantic vision of a brilliant genius, and it is not surprising that he so persists in the modern imagination this way, while Bohr is mostly, though unfairly, eclipsed in the popular imagination."
42,1848310358,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5875081-arvind-balasundaram,4,"This book is a well-written narrative on the central debate surrounding quantum physics in the war-ridden early twentieth century. Max Planck's announcement of the blackbody radiation law in 1900 shattered the comfortable and easily perceptible concepts of classical physics and led to the introduction of the quantum into the scientist's vocabulary. Within thirteen years, Niels Bohr had formulated a new theory of the quantum atom and enunciated the concept of quantum jumps. The author delivers a splendid account of the rapid spate of research that followed these groundbreaking discoveries in physics. Alongside, the reader is introduced to the personalities of the brilliant cadre of scientists working on these discoveries across continents, and the nature of their academic interactions and collaborations - Planck, Bohr, Einstein, Heisenberg, Born, Lorentz, Dirac, Pauli, Schrodinger and others.The central premise of this book is the so-called ""Copenhagen Interpretation"", the name given to the fusion of ideas as articulated by Bohr and defended by Heisenberg in the 1927 Solvay Conference. The essence of this viewpoint was that there is no quantum reality beyond what is revealed by experiment, an act of observation. This position greatly troubled Einstein, whose faith in a causal, observer-independent reality remained unshakeable. These opposite viewpoints by two of science's leading men dominated scientific debates and questioned the very purpose of physics itself - does the physicist's endeavor concern what can be SAID about nature (Bohr) or is physics' sole purpose determining what reality IS (Einstein)?Manjit Kumar patiently develops the framing of this debate from the armchair of the great scientists themselves, and how much it affected them in their private and professional lives. This complex subject- matter is handled at a basic level for the lay-reader, with few exceptions (example, the articulation of Bell's Inequality and its affirmation by the Frenchman Alain Aspect; however, the reader can skip this with no loss of continuity). The author succeeds in articulating the importance of these central problems of the quantum debate (notably, the ideas of an observer-independent reality and the locality problem associated with entanglement) in furthering our understanding of the microphysics world, and in ultimately redeeming Einstein's criticism of quantum theory as correct, but lacking in completeness.An exhilarating read! "
43,1848310358,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7309374-romanas,4,"This is a very solid and exceptionally well-researched book about the great scientific discoveries which lead to formulation of the quantum theory. The theory which is mysterious by its wacky behavior of particles that make up the universe. Nobody can yet claim to be able to completely understand it. For decades it bluffed the titans of physics, Bohr, Einstein, Schrödinger, Heisenberg, and other fellows, and it continues to do so to this day. The great debate between great minds is excellently outlined by the author. Sometimes, the reading felt very exciting, like it was a fictional thriller, but, of course, the book is based on the real facts and events. The big advantage if one reads this book is a background in physics to be able to understand many of the concepts presented in the book. Still, if one is curious and wishes to get a closer acquaintance to the quantum theory and the fascinating history of science the book suits well for that purpose. Besides history of physics, there’s a great deal of other details in the book. It describes personal traits of the scientists, influence of the world wars, troubles of being a Jew during that time, family lives, and more. I was quite astonished by discovering Einstein’s list of demands to his wife for him to return to her. One of them sounded like this: “You are neither to expect intimacy from me nor reproach me in any way”, and another, “that I receive my three meals regularly in my room”, and so on. No wonder that with this recipe, even in those times, the marriage could not last. The author did a great job by digging out peculiar details which accompanied the lives of the greatest minds on their quest to understanding the biggest secrets of our universe. If you love science, I recommend reading this book."
44,1848310358,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4962899-tim,4,"I really liked this book, but it's probably not a good book for most people. While it starts out with roughly high-school level physics being discussed, the later portions aren't quite as simple so that likely limits the potential audience. All that said, it takes its time building up to the fundamental debate between Bohr and Einstein on Quantum Mechanics and I think it does a pretty good job in presenting both sides. It's a very well written book on the history of an important field in science. Aside from the fact that it can get somewhat technical at times based upon the nature of the topic, I wish the author had covered the biographies of some of the people a bit better. In the early portions, he covers the biographies of the most important people very well, but the quality and depth of the bios drops considerably as he progresses through the book. Even some people who are presented as important people have somewhat sparse bios. That said, it's a minor point and I'd recommend this to people interested in science history.I listened to the audio version and while the narrator did an excellent job, I think portions of the book (not large ones, but certainly parts of it) aren't well suited to audio form. I'm very interested to re-read it in print, though to understand these parts better."
45,1848310358,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5779052-lc,3,"Fascinating story of the development of and controversies of quantum physics. Nicely grounded in the scientific and political context, and it's always fun to hear about scientists bitching at each other (and salacious details of their personal lives; I'm looking at you, Schrödinger.)Also, great diagrams, and beautiful explanation of the Actual Science. A number of the things I learned during the quantum physics module of my A-level suddenly made much more sense. Only 13 years too late. :DExtremely dense, though, and could have done with some pruning. It felt a bit like every single detail of every single incident was being included (and quoted), which occasionally made it difficult to follow. Digressions into mostly relevant stories weren't introduced clearly, so I got terribly confused in one section which tripped into the future for Einstein's and then Bohr's death without really explaining the context (that they respected and admired each other, regardless of their scientific differences).However, definitely worth the read. I'll be scouring the bibliography for interesting directions to go.PS not enough cats in boxes. LMFTFY."
46,1848310358,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1167923-patrick,5,"Amazon review:With vigor and elegance, Kumar describes the clash of titans that took place in the world of physics in the early 20th century, between physicists who did and those who did not believe in the quantum—the strange concept that we now know to be the underpinning of reality. The titans in Kumar's account of the conflict are Albert Einstein and Niels Bohr. In 1900, Max Planck discovered that electromagnetic radiation and the energy of light are transmitted not in a continuous flow but in small packets called quanta (singular, quantum). Bohr applied the idea of quantum to electrons, leading to the development of quantum mechanics. Bohr's theory explained experimental results that were inexplicable in classical theory. Einstein rejected Bohr's theory overturning reality in dangerous but also thrilling ways. The clash culminated at the 1927 Solway conference. Kumar, founding editor of Prometheus and a consulting science editor for Wired UK, recounts this meaty, dense, exciting story, filled with vivid characters and sharp insights. With physics undergoing another revolution today, Kumar reminds us of a time when science turned the universe upside down."
47,1848310358,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5935582-dan-cohen,4,"I re-read this book and have upgraded my rating from a 3 to a 4. It really is a very good book and I was perhaps a little mean in my prior rating. Slightly worrying that I re-read it accidentally and didn't realise until I was half-way through, but that's a feature of my decrepit memory rather than the book!Original review below:-------Worth reading. The core of the book is the material on Einstein's repeated attempts to show that the Copenhagen interpretation was wrong, or at least incomplete, and this was the most informative and entertaining aspect of the book. He takes a while to get to that bit, but that's understandable. I thought the exposition of the science was pretty good, although a bit patchy. Likewise for the potted biographical information. I didn't find the last chapter or two very engaging, which is a shame as the book wound down rather than building up to a climax. The writing felt hurried - as though it was rushed to print without sufficient review or a final edit - but I imagine they will smooth over the remaining bumps in later editions. Overall, it was definitely worth reading - informative and thought-provoking."
48,1848310358,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4196-bobby,5,"More history than science, though there is enough of both in the book to keep fans of both happy. Some of the physics went over my head but for the most part Manjit Kumar does an outstanding job of breaking down complex concepts re the quantum theory into lay terms (relatively speaking). One of the best explanations of Heisenberg's uncertainty principle I've come across is in this book. Though everybody know what a physics god Einstein was, this book helped me appreciate the contributions made by other important figures in physics, such as, Bohr, Pauli, Heisenberg, etc. Very entertaining and highly recommended."

I was afraid starting the book that it would be mostly about the lives and backgrounds of the scientists who made these discoveries and not much about the actual science. I was very much pleased to find that the book is mostly about the details of the physics and chemistry itself. As a result, however, the material may not be acessible to non-scientists,or even of any interest to them."

51,1848310358,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5254180-atti,5,i very much enjoyed this book. The anecdotal style humanizes the giants of physics that this book talks about.

59,1848310358,http://goodreads.com/user/show/91261074-chris-esposo,5,"Comprehensive and with 80% historical accounts of the development of the first QT of Plank, Bohr, and Einstein and QM of De-Broglie, Pauli, Heisenberg and Dirac, with the core of the historical material outlining the theory development being ending with the last Solvay conference of the late 20s which sought to pin down the interpretation of QM as well as resolve the dual technical approaches of Schrodinger's wave mechanical PDE approach and Heisenberg's matrix algebra approach motivated by the phenomena of spin, and the rest a bio and historical material on Einstein and Bohr from the early 20th century to their death. There's also a bit on post-Solvey and the EPR debates w/ Bohr/Heisenberg on the ""completeness"" of QM. The book ends with just a little bit on the Bell inequality and confirming its violation from the 60s to 80s.With all that said, the book does an excellent job of explaining the development of the Bohr's quantum theory motivated by his realization that angular momentum was discrete at the quantum level, realized after observing the spectral line first studied by Plank. What was interesting was how a lot of this early activity amounted to ""curve fitting"" or interpolation activity, with little rhyme or reason. Even Plank believed the ""Plank constant"" of his namesake was just a first approximation and not a universal invariant.The book takes care to explain the early theories in this era, including the Electron-shell theory of Bohr and often taught in HS chemistry, but often poorly explained and contextualized within the overall corpus of work in QT. Other big topics discussed are the De-Broglie Wave-Particle duality and the Pauli Exclusion Principle of Fermions. The later enabled clean enumeration and count formula to be formed which serves as a prelude to the matrix formulation of Heisenberg's QM in matrix algebra. The book also does a good job showing that this a process was not some game of abstraction but grounded to data from the hydrogen atom. What the book also makes clear is that the Heisenberg formulation of QM could be viewed as a kind of ""accounting scheme"" of the facts previously discovered up to then. Dispelling the myth that people just pierce through some ethereal insight, science is a data intensive activity and the construction of QM illustrates this fact well.I also enjoyed the illustration of Einsteins Solvey challenge to Bohr, the spherical wave / screen construct to show that QM would violate the notion of locality since knowing the momenta at one location once the apogee of the wave hits the screen (what people working with the theory would associate as applying the measurement operator) instantaneously makes the probability of the particle showing up elsewhere in the screen 0, thus violating the special theory of relativity, since light bounds the speed of all things in space. This challenge precludes much of Einsteins-Rosen-Padolsky challenges for the next 25 years, which eventually resolved by the ""No Information Theorem"" which allows states to somehow be entangled and change instantaneously (apparently outside the bounds of space), but unable to be confirmed the state, which requires communication to be spent in normal space. Although this seems to imply that there's some other ""thing"" going on, that could be important, just not important to the set of facts and observable relevant to QM seemingly? Not sure since I'm a layman to the field.The book is great overall and I think people from all levels of background could find it useful. Highly recommended"
