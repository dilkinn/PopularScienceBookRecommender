0,0684853957,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4684009-william2,5,"Wow, what a marvelous book! I'd always thought: ""how can even the brilliant Oliver Sacks write a 200-page book about his own leg?"" That would have to be one of the great works of solipsism, wouldn't it? And it is, it is--the book is among other things a fascinating investigation of self, but it goes beyond that. In 1974 Dr. Sacks (a shy bookish man by temperament) went for a friendly climb of a 7,000 foot mountain in Norway. I don't know if you can say that Dr. Sacks does anything thoughtlessly, but when he clambers into the paddock of a bull despite ample signage warning him away, you wonder. In due course, he comes across the bull, which really does nothing more than raise it massive horned head. The animal never pursues Sacks. Yet the good doctor panics, bolts madly across a meadow, falls and brutally severs the quadriceps of his left leg. He is lucky he doesn't die on the mountain for he is miles from his village lodging and the nights even in summer are freezing. Almost miraculously he is found crawling back to town by a couple of hunters, a father and son. In short order he is flown to London where he proceeds to experience a profound sense of ""alienation"" from his leg. He excoriates his surgical team for their lack of bedside manner. That is itself something you rarely see in print or in life: one doctor criticizing another. But the fair-minded Sacks soon comes to realize that the problem goes deeper than his surgeon. It's symtomatic of the healthcare juggernaut as a whole. Sacks has been deliberately left alone with his thoughts and what ensues is a profound dissociation from his leg. He feels it is ""no longer part of him,"" that the leg is ""dead,"" that it will never return to full use. He undergoes a clinically pure example of loss of proprioception. This is the sense we all have of our bodily posture. Nurse Sulu enters Sacks's hospital room one day in alarm. His leg has fallen out of bed and splayed itself at a strange angle. Yet Sacks lies in bed with the distinct impression that the leg is still in bed with him, tidily tucked away. He is shocked upon lifting his head from the pillow. He exhorts Nurse Sulu to move the leg this way and that. He is unable to tell what position she has put the leg in with his eyes closed. In the first half of the book Sacks worked from his own journal and he was careful to leave the fear and exclamations in, his at times irrational circular reasoning. He wants us to know how frightening the whole experience is, not just for himself, but for those in the same predicament. The moment on the mountain pales in comparison to the horrors he experiences in the hospital. Sacks undergoes a profound alteration of body image. The injury, subsequent surgery and casting of his leg has led to desensitization and atrophy until he ""forgets"" how to use it. He is left abed for 14 days. The second half of the book is a consideration of his experience from a clinical perspective. I don't mean to say that the first part of the book is not of interest, but it is when Sacks begins his consideration of the neurological reasons for his experience that for me the book began to sing. There are fascinating explications of how the brain ""sees"" the body, as well as the neural correlates for all this. The section of the brain dedicated to body-image, as it turns out, is the somatosensory cortex, part of the parietal lobe. Eventually Sacks leads the reader thoughtfully through the available literature on body image. There isn't much, to be sure. Among these is a work entitled Reflex Paralysis generated by surgeons of the hand during the American Civil War (1861-65). I am glossing over a lot here. The book is an intellectual feast on many levels. It is an almost unbelievably rich feast for the thorough reader. In the end it's a very human book, a book about all of us. Highly recommended."
1,0684853957,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5727078-aman,4,"for some reason I fall in love with this book, I felt it was so honest and real, not to mention the highly interesting phenomenon that it describes..as always I really loved how doctor Sacks shows us that healing isn't just drugs & proceduresthere's heart, feelings, harmony... so many amazing things to learn if a person wanted to :)one more thing I loved is teaching us how medicine isn't just solid information..there's always new things to learn, and new domains to discover..the only star was removed cause I found some prolongation and repetition in some subjects :\plus some difficult or weak parts, but maybe that was just due to the translated copy I hadhowever.. in some -great- parts the way of thinking & talking reminded me of a very dear person to my heart.. which made the book even more enjoyable for me :)enjoy it ^_^"
2,0684853957,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3961732-ron,5,"On one level, this is a doctor-becomes-patient story, with the many revelations that come to those in medicine who suddenly find themselves at the other end of the stethoscope. For anyone who's been a patient, there's some satisfaction in reading stories like this in which an ill or injured doctor finds out ""what it's really like"" to be in a hospital bed and more or less at the mercy of the medical profession.I suppose Oliver Sacks isn't quite a likely candidate for this tables-turned scenario. In his books and TV interviews (e.g., ""Glorious Accident""), and in Robin Williams' portrayal of him in ""Awakenings,"" he comes across as anything but the stereotypical doctor. But he learns plenty from his experience anyway, and not just from the imperious surgeon who insists that there's nothing wrong with Sacks now that his leg has been repaired or the jolly hockey-stick nurse who is copeless when he does not respond to physical therapy.He also learns first hand the terror of being injured, alone, and far from any other humans to rescue him. He experiences the helplessness that can overwhelm a person who not only loses the use of a limb, but as a ""patient,"" loses his identity as an independent person. Sacks' descriptions of his feelings as a patient, sometimes soaring, sometimes despairing, are vividly told and are a reminder to any healthcare worker of the wild fluctuations of emotions that a patient can experience, even from one hour to the next.Another fascinating aspect of the book is its account of the mystery of healing. Sacks describes in great detail the slow and unpredictable experience of recovering the ability to walk again. And he gives special consideration to the process of ""re-entry,"" as he spends time in a sanatorium, among others who are healing, finally venturing out into the world on his own to rediscover himself and his lost independence.Sacks is a vivid and analytical writer, with a rich gift of language. This is a slender book, but much is packed into it. It is a journey through the looking glass for any healthcare worker who has never been hospitalized with a serious and debilitating injury or illness, and should be required reading. "
3,0684853957,http://goodreads.com/user/show/187104-michael,3,"Doing journalism, I spend a lot of time reading through interview transcripts, looking for quotes that really drive home a point, that are overstated enough to build an argument on, to make my articles seem relevant and important. Sacks would be the best interview in the world. Every insight is an earth-shattering revelation; every challenge is a close call with the abyss; etc. etc. He seems to be writing for an intended audience of physicians and medical students, so maybe his aim in writing like this is to knock them out of their comfort zones and make them reconsider assumptions. He keeps promising that his narrative (almost dying after injuring his leg in a mountaineering accident, losing feeling and ""propioception"" in the injured leg, then gradually regaining it) will lead us to a whole new kind of neuroscience-- ""a neurology of the soul."" I don't really see how it adds up. The end sort of fades out with him walking into the red dawn of a new understanding that the reader still doesn't fully understand. I'm interested to look into whatever book he wrote next, but I don't trust him to take this anywhere.That said, there are many great passages in here, passages that will feel vindicating to people who have been through difficult and lonely experiences as patients and who may have never seen their experiences represented on the page as vividly as he does here. That's an important use of literature, and from this perspective Sacks does write with great integrity."
4,0684853957,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1325473-jimmy,4,"A very engaging book in which Oliver Sacks, through a bizarre accident involving a bull at the top of a mountain, ended up badly breaking his leg, damaging the nerves there, and half dragging himself down the mountain to get help. At this point, the narrative changes. He is hospitalized and becomes a patient for about 6 weeks. At first, the idea of reading about someone's leg slowly healing might sound dull. But this isn't anyone's leg, this is Oliver fucking Sack's leg!Oliver Sacks, if you haven't read him before, is a neurologist who writes very accessible, empathetic books about various disorders of the brain. I've read a few a long time ago, but what sets Dr. Sacks apart is that he writes like a scientist from the good old days, reminding me at times of Darwin, William James, Da Vinci etc. in that he is a broad thinker, bringing in the arts, music, poetry as equals. This doesn't make him any less rigorous, only that he acknowledges the power of these other fields, and that what we are dealing with is ultimately human. As his maiden aunt reminds him in his sick bed: ""All the trouble starts when people forget they're human.""A few years ago, when my dad had to be hospitalized because of a heart problem, I could see the fear, anguish, and confusion in his eyes whenever I visited him. His stay was thankfully short, but there were many instances in which we felt like we were being shushed, dismissed, not-listened to. The environment is the exact opposite of what an environment of healing and well-being should be--at least emotional well-being, which is half the battle. It seemed like the professionals were only focused on my dad's surgery, and not with the stress of the entire experience (by the way, stress is one of the main causes of heart disease).In this book, Oliver Sacks is the patient, whereas his usual role is doctor, and finds himself in the same predicament as my dad. But this book isn't a bitter diatribe about ""the system"". It is an attempt to understand both sides of the doctor/patient equation, as well as an attempt to document the EXPERIENCE of being a patient, the alienation, the striving for answers about his own body. At the end of the book, he talks about how little literature there is out there that is from the patient's perspective. How can we begin to heal if we cannot be empathetic towards the patient?Beyond this, I was amazed at Dr. Sacks's ability to draw upon his large reservoir of the arts to comfort him and to help him understand his condition. He quotes Wittgenstein, Eliot, the book of Job and others, and he uses Mendelssohn to help him heal. As much as I read, I don't know if I would be able to use what I've read in such a pragmatic way, to gain insight and comfort into my current condition.Lastly, Dr. Sacks writes vividly, and often his descriptions were truly epiphanic if you imagine yourself in his position. He reasons in and out and around corners about why he is feeling certain sensations, and you really feel like this is a scientist's constant exploratory mind at work. It is a pity that the doctors didn't listen to what he had to say, as they would've learned quite a bit.My only complaint may be that at times he went on too long, repeating himself in much the same words he did several pages back.I think all doctors, nurses, and health care professionals should read this book. Patients should read it too, so that they feel less alone in their experiences."
5,0684853957,http://goodreads.com/user/show/114060-miriam,3,"In this book, Sacks writes about the conditions of injury and patienthood and their effects on the psyche, using an extreme, autobiographical example. The writing is sometimes (okay, often) overwrought, and there is little suspense throughout the entire narrative. However, as a description of a curious condition, this book succeeds."
6,0684853957,http://goodreads.com/user/show/827087-kim,2,"My star rating about sums it up. It was okay. He discusses some interesting topics associated with consciousness and self, some of it a little beyond my ability to differentiate, I just think he could have covered the same ground in about half the time."
7,0684853957,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2606432-noura,0,"I thought the name of this book was just a metaphor for something else, except I was so wrong, he really needed a leg to stand on :D.OK, so Dr Sacks well he is a doctor, so he knew pain, he diagnosed it, he was able to help his patients to recover from it, but did he really know pain? did he understand what it's like to be in pain? So when Sacks's leg got broken while he was climbing a mountain he didn't understand what was happening to him, why everyone kept talking about a leg that wasn't there anymore? he lost the feeling of his leg, he forgot what it's like to have a leg. So in this book he shared his experience, his journey from having a useless leg that he really thought didn't exist in the first place to a well functioning leg. He needed this he needed to know what it's like to be a patient, what it's like to feel angry sad tired brave indifference, to feel everything and sometimes nothing at all. He needed this experience so he could understand his patients later. I would really have enjoyed this book more, but he kept repeating himself in a lot of places and that frustrated me a little."
8,0684853957,http://goodreads.com/user/show/175480-helen-helena-nell,4,"I am sort of addicted to Oliver Sacks lately. At least I seem to be reading my way through his complete works, bit by bit, even the heavy one on migraine. My favourite remains (so far) The Mind's Eye,  but this ran it a close second. The experience is personal, and he's a beautiful writer. I loved the opening chapter. I was up there on the mountain with him. I shared every moment of the strange meeting with the minotaur (not exactly) and the breaking leg. He communicates precise sensation with intimate relish. And then he analyses everything to death, which I really love because a) it is fascinating and b) it is just what I'm like myself. The injury to his leg caused him to feel, for a period of time, that there was no leg there. His brain lost all connection with the limb. It was the opposite of phantom limb syndrome - in fact he brings that connection in at the end.He was a doctor. He became a patient. He experienced not being listened to, in the most profound way. He realised, in the end, that the patients: ""were all much wiser than the doctors who treated them! There is among doctors, in acute hospitals at least, a presumption of stupidity, in their patients. And no one was 'stupid', no one  is  stupid, except the fools who take them as stupid. Working in a chronic hospital, with the same patients, one gains a greater respect for them -- for their elemental human wisdom, and the special 'wisdom of the heart'. But at that first breakfast with my 'brothers' -- not my colleagues in expertise, but my fellow-patients, fellow-creatures -- and throughout my stay in the Convalescent Home, I saw that one must oneself be  a patient, and a patient among patients, that one must enter both the solitude and the community of patienthood, to have any real idea of what 'being a patient' means, to understand the immense complexity and depth of feelings, the resonances of the soul in every key -- anguish, rage, courage, whatever -- and the thoughts evoked, even in the simplest practical minds, because as a patient one's experience forces one to think.""Sacks works for his illumination. He doesn't arrive at wise statements lightly. Because of that, I was even able to go with him in his final commitment to finding ""a neurology of the soul"". I've been thinking ever since about what he means by 'the soul'. I love a book that leaves me thinking. He also reminded me that the ego, according to Freud, is primarily a body ego. Which is just, if you think about it, as interesting. . . ."
9,0684853957,http://goodreads.com/user/show/290848-john,3,"Audible just brought this one out in audio, a year or so after Sacks' latest The Mind's Eye; my library didn't have a print copy of ""Leg"", so I spent a credit on it. Both books deal with the issue of doctor-as-patient, but this one's less approachable. Once he's rescued in Norway, and sent off to Britain for treatment, the story becomes progressively more inward and self-absorbed. I was interested when he veered towards the mind-body connection in healing, but otherwise his thoughts were just that ... thoughts. Not very focused ones either - not quite metaphysical, not really philosophical, and a little medical stuff thrown in. For Sacks fans only, those new to his stuff would probably never read another."
10,0684853957,http://goodreads.com/user/show/19331069-chris,2,"I read this having earlier read The Man who Mistook his Wife for a Hat, which I thought was extremely interesting. In contrast I found this very boring, repetitive, and with slightly unbelievable characters (and I know it's not fiction). The analysis and discovery I wanted to be there just wasn't."
11,0684853957,http://goodreads.com/user/show/552042-antoinette-verdone,4,"This book starts with a story about the author; real life near death experience. But then it morphs into a scientific study about body awareness. Again, it gets a little academic, but still an interesting read."
12,0684853957,http://goodreads.com/user/show/748954-keith,5,"This book is particularly fascinating because it turns the tables on Sacks -- he's the patient here, suffering from a neurological problem that in another context he might be diagnosing in a patient of his own. "
13,0684853957,http://goodreads.com/user/show/55975903-jakub-b-czy-ski,5,"I'd say that the book itself does not present spectacular story, but for some reason I enjoyed reading it. Sacks makes some good point about life which I'll never forget. Definitely recommandable book. "
14,0684853957,http://goodreads.com/user/show/23465472-dina,4,"Can only sayLord, you praise and thanks should also Jalal face and a great visit,And through the experience for the first time in neuroscience"
15,0684853957,http://goodreads.com/user/show/131922-mark-monday,3,"a surprisingly strong narrative. moving, at times mawkishly so, but still pretty good overall."
16,0684853957,http://goodreads.com/user/show/23937425-albatool,4,"This time, Dr. Oliver Sacks, a renowned neurologist, tells the story of his own patienthood. He starts by narrating his accident on a mountain in Norway upon his encounter with a bull where he severely injured his leg; and then takes us through his journey of being a patient and his recovery; and finally discusses his research afterwards. As a Psychology student who’s fascinated by neuropsychological cases, this was a very gripping read for me, especially because I get to be taken through this journey by getting a direct insight into Sacks’ thought-processes and reflections on his own experience of a strange phenomenon, yet a very common one. Sacks felt completely disconnected, depersonalised and alienated from his injured leg. The proprioception was completely absent, he could not feel any sensations, and felt like the leg was impossibly attached to him. He could not deliberately move the leg and control the muscles. He could no longer remember that he once had this leg and could not remember and imagine how he could have once used it. Throughout his journey, besides exploring possible explanations to this neuropsychological case, Dr. Sacks also explores various issues such as institutionalism, authority and patient-doctor relationship and communication. He emphasizes the importance of treating patients as an equal, as human beings who have emotional experiences and not merely as a medical case, and requiring a neurology of identity/self. I really love how Sacks’ narration of his experience feels so raw and honest; I love his honest ever-changing reflections he shares throughout the different stages in this journey from his racing thoughts amidst all the panic and horror. I think ‘A Leg to Stand On’ is particularly special because of the raw reflections that Sacks have shared about the human existential and phenomenological experience as a patient. Sacks brings neurology, neuropsychology, philosophy (neuro-ontology) and spirituality altogether. After reading the book, I wanted to look for reviews about the conclusions and explanations that Sacks has offered in his book regarding the condition, which he attributed in part to peripheral lesion - in light of more recent research developments in the field of neuropsychology. The linked paper below provides a good summary of the story of the accident, the condition and the possible diagnoses Sacks discussed, and the best thing is reappraising Sack’s diagnosis based on more recent research development. (https://jnnp.bmj.com/content/jnnp/83/...) "
17,0684853957,http://goodreads.com/user/show/18992329-cathy-sites,5,"This book likely isn't for everybody, but Oliver Sacks (author/neuro-scientist/naturalist) is a man I would have loved to have known. I enjoyed (an related to) his experience with his leg injury, but furthermore loved how he intertwined Plato, Nietzsche, Darwin, Einstein into his personal experience. ""Kinetic Melodies"" is my new favorite term, and something I hope to incorporate in my own recovery."
18,0684853957,http://goodreads.com/user/show/70361122-jack-lieblich,3,"Could have been awesome, but just goes on and on."
19,0684853957,http://goodreads.com/user/show/26058759-odgerel-boldbaatar,3,"3.5 is my rating. Cant exactly pinpoint what in this book i didnt like. I mean the story is interesting, a journey of a doctor who found himself in the position of a patient and his exprience of being injured and finding the path to recovery, who found solace in fellow patients but sadly not in the doctors...But somehow i didnt feel as invested in this book as with Oliver Sack's other books."
20,0684853957,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4196379-hellen,3,"It was a few days after the biking accident in May of this year that I picked up this book. My upper arm had been fractured and splintered after making a nosedive at high speed into a thick layer of grid in the forest and I was in fear of the operation the doctors said I might have to have. It was a few days after the night we spent in the ER, where I couldn't pee because I wore biking pants with suspenders locked in place with several tops (it was cold) and a nurse had to help me out of them when after six hours I worked up the courage to say ""can't pee"".There's something very scary about the thought of the breaking of the skin and the construction work performed inside of you while being unconscious. Even scarier was Sacks' situation, where he has a major surgery - he writes a will the night before the operation - and doesn't just find himself having to recover from that, but also from the complications that follow. After his first operation he finds he can't tense his leg muscles, which is the beginning of a period in which Sacks starts to experience the leg as alien.It was a consolation to have Sacks there with me, going through much worse than I did, and showing it was possible. It's the only thing we want to know when something bad happens to us: can you tell me how to get through it? (can you hold my hand?) Mostly my experience was different from Sacks' - there was never a question about whether I'd recover (and I never had a catheter) and without such worries I only had to worry about the esthetics - what would the scar look like if I'd have to have surgery? When ignoring the great proportion of this book about body ""identity"" (for such a short book it's terribly long-winded in places), it is about being a patient, being patient, and the relationship we have with our bodies. And an awful lot about spirituality for someone I know to have become a spokesperson for atheism in later life.""We can readily see in others what we do not care, or dare, to see in ourselves. The patients I work with are chronically ill. They have, they know they have, little or no hope of recovery. Some of them show a transcendent humor and gallantry, an unspoilt love and affirmation of life. But others are bitter, virulent, envenomed - great haters, great spiters, murderous, demonic. It is not the sickness but the person that shows here, his collapse or corruption with the cruelties of life. If we have youth, beauty, blessed gifts, strength, if we find fame, fortune, favor, fulfillment, it is easy to be nice, to turn a warm heart to the world. But let us be disfavored, disfigured, incapacitated, injured: let us fall from health and strength, from fortune and favor; let us find ourselves ill, miserable and without clear hope of recovery - then our mettle, our moral character, will be tried to the limit."" (p. 148)Breaking a bone is not an experience I would recommend, but at the same time if it does happen to you, firstly notice how wounds are slowly swallowed, bones reconnected, and skin - after looking like all the colors grapes come in - restored. It's a quiet reminder of the often uncelebrated joy of body functionality. And secondly, enjoy this book that captures the glory of the body that's taken for granted. It's not the greatest Sacks, but it's probably the one you'll want to read most at that time.""I was being urged, perhaps even gently pushed and levered by the therapists, who knew one thing for certain: that one must get on with it, one must proceed, one must take the first step. They knew - priceless knowledge, which the mind can forget- that there is no substitute, ever, for doing.PS. Wear a helmet!"
21,0684853957,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4626387-linda,4,"Oliver Sacks is dying and will not be with us much longer. He described his feelings about dying in an opinion piece in the New York Times not long ago. I had not know he was so ill and started mourning right then. I don't know when I'll stop. Oliver Sacks has done more than any other person to open the field of neuropsychology to the average person. Neuropsychology is the study of the brain (the neurons) and how injuries to or the death of them affect both the physical and emotional sides of humans. We learn how injuries to certain parts of the brain concerned with language can cause a person to use incorrect words to describe objects - they KNOW what the objects are and can pick out the correct one when asked but cannot accurately name them. We learn how injuries to an area concerned with judgement can cause a person to become a raging gambler. And so on.Here, Sacks is both the observer and the patient. An accident in Norway left him with a torn left quadriceps and mutilated knee. After the surgery he discovered that he had ""lost"" his leg. Seriously. He could see that it was there but did not feel attached (literally) to it. It seemed to act on its own. If it was too close to the edge of the bed, it would fall out and nothing he could do would stop it. He ran a series of experiments with one of the nurses and whatever direction she turned his leg he had no perception of it. When not looking exactly at it, he couldn't tell if she was manipulating it or not.Sacks made a great patient for this event because he could examine himself clinically as well as experience it. He knew there was severe nerve damage, but he also knew nerve damage doesn't make you feel like you don't have a leg. He had NO control over it - the physiotherapist the first day thought he was being lazy or stubborn when he said he couldn't remember how to contract his muscle. He knew it had to have something to do with proprioception, our sense of self and where we are in space, but he wasn't sure what. His doctor, when he tentatively mentioned it, dismissed it as non-existent. He had been torn apart and was now joined back together and so nothing was wrong.Sacks ""found"" his leg but became intrigued as to what had happened to him. When he was in the convalescent home, he discovered that others who had had injuries (not necessarily severe) to arms and legs had had similar experiences. Once the episode had passed, they were no longer concerned but most had never mentioned it to their doctors or even tried.Being a doctor, Sacks couldn't leave this alone and started searching the literature. He discovered that the phenomenon is most common on the left side, so something must be affecting the right side of the brain. Some people to whom this happened had underlying physical problems - a small brain tumor perhaps. But a surprising number had no underlying reason. It never seemed to be permanent. He began really listening to his patients, looking for people who had experienced this and would talk extensively to him about it. So what happens to us at this time? Most of us know about Phantom Limb syndrome where someone with an amputated limb can experience the feeling that the limb is still there, but what happens when the limb is physically there and we don't feel it?Oliver Sacks is a fascinating man and an amazing writer. We may never understand how our brains cause such strange reactions as this but we will lack the best voice in helping us TRY to understand when we lose Oliver Sacks."
22,0684853957,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5562439-jim-b,3,"What an amazing gift is Oliver Sacks! If you've read any of his books, you wind up being amazed at his curiosity, his compassion for patients, his insight into unusual or unexplored recesses of our bodies and minds. This Kindle version includes not only the 1984 original book, but his 1993 update, which is important because both medicine and Dr. Sack's continued to learn about the patient, the brain and the phenomonon he examines in this book.In short, Oliver Sacks examines how the body / mind deals with a traumatic injury to a limb. He became aware of this when he injured himself hiking, and felt that he didn't have a leg (not just that he'd lost his leg but that he'd never had a leg -- and yet the leg was still attached.) His description of his thoughts, fears and experiences was extremely interesting, and yet -- in my opinion -- over the top with detail. Humorously, I have reason to believe I'm not the only person to feel this way about this level of detail. In the 1993 Afterward, Dr Sacks describes how a shoulder injury made it hard to write for a time and so he kept a message brief -- and the editors of the British Medical Journal said, ""We're sorry for your accident, but it does wonders for your style!""I can imagine that this book is assigned reading for certain medical students, and they need to know that detail that glazed my eyes over at times.I am very grateful for the inquiring mind of Dr. Sacks, his joy of life and his gratitude for the small details of being alive. This is not my favorite of his books, but he remains one of my favorite people."
23,0684853957,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2860188-eduardo-santiago,4,"I must be on a compassion kick. I picked up this book expecting to learn more neuro, but what I got instead is a view of the road to Enlightenment. Oliver Sacks, already an MD but not yet in the field we know him for, is badly injured. During his recovery he experiences an eerie loss of proprioception, of the sense of whole body. OK, nothing really new there -- that wasn't well documented in 1980, but it certainly is now.What really captured me, though, was his feelings as he tried--and failed--to be understood by his nurses and doctors. Confusion, frustration, fear, understanding, ... acceptance and understanding. Doctor as Patient, a new perspective. Rather than put it behind him, he uses it to create the Oliver Sacks we know today. It is clear that this experience shaped him, not just his interest in neuropathologies but especially his ability to understand his patients, to empathize, and then to communicate that in his later books.A Leg to Stand On is not easy reading: his prose is dense, awkward, not yet a mature voice. Despite that, this is a book worth reading (but not as your first Oliver Sacks book. Read 1-2 others first)."
24,0684853957,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1836077-lightreads,2,"Sacks completely wrecked his leg in a run-in with a bull on a mountain in Norway, and barely got out alive. This is his memoir of his recovery, focusing on his post-operative distress to discover that the leg was psychologically absent from his body awareness, thanks probably to undiagnosed nerve damage.I picked this up on a tangent from other research, and it was useful as subjective narrative. But it's also grossly overwritten in places. I'm kind of torn, because this book is clearly trauma post-processing from start to finish, and like a lot of post-trauma writing it's deeply self-involved and recursive and bound up in minutiae of memory that mean nothing to everyone who isn't Oliver Sacks. So kind of frustrating. But, I mean, I'm glad he wrote the book, because he clearly needed to."
25,0684853957,http://goodreads.com/user/show/12556018-wendy,4,"  I started reasons Oliver Sacks after I a healthcare Practioner found that I was on the other side of the stethoscope an not being ""listened"" too. Oliver's first hand account helped me cope & overcome a very difficult time. His ability to write explicitly about exactly what I was experiencing inspired me to re-approach how I communicated with those who cared for me. It also inspired me to get an ""advanced directive"" and hand pick my healthcare team; Including interviews & seeking intention ... Thank goodness Oliver Sack has a great way of telling the horrible truth about such dilemma's. "
26,0684853957,http://goodreads.com/user/show/61950-ian,2,"Sacks is an acclaimed medical writer because he sets forth clinical observations in an interesting and engaging fashion; he can provide an excellent view of external circumstances and conditions. In A Leg to Stand On, however, Sacks himself is the patient, and his dedicated attempt to transcribe every feeling—physical and emotional—running through his head (and leg) causes the book to suffer."
27,0684853957,http://goodreads.com/user/show/661132-jan-dawson,0,Fascinating account of when Oliver Sacks hurt his own leg badly and subsequently lost his mental association with it. He opens up completely about the experience so it's fascinating as a view into what happens to someone in this situation. But he also adds in his remarkable erudition and knowledge about neuro-psychology which makes it all the more interesting. And as a bonus it's relatively short too!
28,0684853957,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4929404-ian,3,"While I enjoyed his other works immensely, I got sort of tired of this one midway through. I can't really fault him for accomplishing what he set out to do (describing in agonizing detail his injury and subsequent recovery), but the extended meditations in the middle of the book just became tedious. His shorter, more compact case studies are a bit easier to swallow than this was. Still, not a bad book by any means, just not my favorite Oliver Sacks."
29,0684853957,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2698880-penny,4,A memoir about a freak accident he had that led him to experience that his own leg did not exist. He could close his eyes and someone would move his leg and he didn't know it was being moved. This experience which lasted 12 days gave him insight into his own practice as a neurologist. His own surgeon did not take his experience seriously. He was deeply affected by the experience of being a patient and he then talks about how this experience changed his own performance as a physician.
30,0684853957,http://goodreads.com/user/show/46722444-olga-werby,5,"“A Leg to Stand On” is a book documenting proprioceptional difficulties that Dr. Sacks experienced after an unfortunate encounter with a angry bull. This book is particularly revealing to me—it is the first account I read of someone (other than myself) describing their leg as having a “will of its own.” Many years ago, I was run over by a taxi while crossing the street as a pedestrian. I still use a cane and I still encounter that “not exactly my own” feelings about my left leg daily."
31,0684853957,http://goodreads.com/user/show/40352414-mahyar,4,"Great read by Oliver Sacks as always, an amazing mix of the medical, philosophical psychological insights that came to him after he suffered a serious leg injury on a hiking trip. Be warned though, he does go a bit too much on the philosophical side in this book which may be a bit too much for the reader unfamiliar with his style. I'd recommend one of his other books ('Seeing Voices' or 'The Man who mistook his wife for a hat') to start with instead for the uninitiated."
32,0684853957,http://goodreads.com/user/show/582704-michael,4,"A brilliant analysis of and story about the psycho-physiological experience, from the first-person perspective, of losing the ability to walk. Sacks is a wonderful writer, giving us both the ""doctor's"" and the patient's perspective, from the inside of what is like to lose an ability that one takes for granted. I will be blogging soon about some of the philosophical-psychological aspects of this book (especially his use of Kant and Hume)."
33,0684853957,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8450145-adrian,4,"O. Sacks in this personal account described an injury that he suffered to his leg(upper knee muscle). He describes the incident, the subsequent medicos treatment and recovery, adds the ""phantom limb"" or lack of sensation description, and finishes the book with his own philosophical views on medicine, neurology, and general life. Overall, an interesting case study that is a good intro into the world of post-nerve injuries and the neurological and physical implications. "
34,0684853957,http://goodreads.com/user/show/815993-shelli,5,A friend bought this for me when I broke my leg skiing. It's about a doctor who breaks his leg. I'm a doctor who broke my leg. I'm not sure why she bought it for me. Just kidding. It's a very well written and interesting memoir about having to depend on others when you're really not used to doing so.
35,0684853957,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2527994-marty-babits,5,I am a fan of Oliver Sacks' writing. This is perhaps his most personal book. Introspective and fiercely exploratory - exploring his inner perception (apperceptions) - he models the essence of profoundly reflective subjectivity here. A story that is fraught with suspense told with lightness and consistent grace. 
36,0684853957,http://goodreads.com/user/show/608101-bex,0,"I stopped reading as Sacks is realizing that his leg is taking longer than expected to recuperate. His specialists are starting to show concern that his leg is non-responsive.My mother is meanwhile enduring a rough recovery post-knee surgery. I find myself focusing on other books, and neglecting Sacks. Will return to it in time!"
37,0684853957,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9844326-phil,4,A great insight into what the mindset of a doctor. This autobiographical book is probably the most personal of Sack's that I have read. He comes across as person more than the slightly removed excited child observing the world. Here we have a blissfully lucky man pulled down to earth and forced to acknowledge his mortality.A great one for a read in a hospital bed.
38,0684853957,http://goodreads.com/user/show/14011182-josephine-ensign,2,"Mostly a study in megalomania. Sacks seems to have borrowed heavily from Mann's The Magic Mountain--or to have fancied himself a Mann character? I've read Sacks' The Man Who Mistook His Wife For a Hat and found it interesting, but A Leg To Stand On has turned me away from wanting to read more of his work."
39,0684853957,http://goodreads.com/user/show/570973-maryanne,5,"I read this book some years ago, being a fan of Oliver Sacks, and recently skimmed through it again during this last summer when I broke my own leg and found myself with constant pain up one side of my right leg and no feeling at all in the bottom of my right foot. I was right the first time and this is a great book. It will give you a new feeling about your body."

The leg was damaged sufficiently badly that it had to be held still too long and he lost the use of it until he could get his brain to recognise its existence again some time after it had physically healed.
42,0684853957,http://goodreads.com/user/show/901971-jeff,5,"I think this is my favorite Sacks book, and I tend to like everything he writes. Not only did it have lots of interesting information about ways that brain function can go awry, it turned out to be a treatise on the philosophy of identity and self. And not a bad one, at that. "
43,0684853957,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2558741-leif,4,"You know, Sacks is a bit of a pompous windbag. He does tell a mean story, however, and demonstrates a bracing perspicuity and wide ranging mind. Good on him for getting his leg back, that's what I'll say."
44,0684853957,http://goodreads.com/user/show/14258591-shane-hart,4,"I read this just after I broke my leg, unlike Sacks on top of the Mountain I broke mine in my backyard. The first chapter is stunningly beautiful, the rest makes a lot of sense to people who have broken their leg, others may not appreciate it."
