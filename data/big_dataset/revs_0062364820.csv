The narrative of the book explains the causes of the massive extinctions and the effects it had on the survivors if there were any, it then tell us that we might be on the beginning stages of the massive 6th extinction which would come about because of our disregard for earth and our ravenous appetite for fossil fuels. If that sounds like something you would enjoy I recommend you read it but don’t expect for a positive ending ....because everything that is coming climate wise is not good at all , not good at all...let the book expand on it ...."
1,0062364820,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4213258-bradley,3,"For what this book is, it is good.So what is it? An accessible rundown of the events of the five great extinction events of the Earth's past. Good for newcomers, decent for an update if it's been a few decades beyond your previous encounter with possible extinction causes... (remember the debates surrounding the Cambrian?)... and entertaining enough if what you mean by entertainment is the cognition of our eventual death as a species. :)Okay, granted, a lot of the material is slightly glossed-over in favor of narrative brevity and facts and causes are somewhat light... but the book knows its audience... and it's audience isn't glamorous or snazzed up with buzz-words... or is it? Oh... wait... ""emergent"" comes up a bit. Ah, well, no book is perfect.Makes me kinda want to re-read Bill Bryson's A Short History of Nearly Everything or Kolbert's The Sixth Extinction: An Unnatural History if you want to get REALLY scared.But, again, for what it is, Brannon's book does a decent readable job. I just kinda wish I had more descriptions of the life that is now long gone. *sigh*"
2,0062364820,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3461034-trish,3,"This book was quite different form what I had expected. For one, the author doesn‘t go too much into detail when it comes to describing the different time periods. Rather, we get short descriptions followed by how the period ended - and most of that is speculation anyway.We start almost at the Big Bang before we rush through the different periods and look at one mass extinction after the other from a geological as well as a paleontological point of view. I did like how the author ensured the readers were aware of just how little time humanity has been on the planet when compared to the history of our planet.Then we follow the author to several sites where important fossils have been found, where he talked to enthusiasts as well as scientists, thus also walking through time with him and therefore watching the land mass separating as well as the appearance and disappearance of algea, trees, molluscs, dinosaurs, humans and more.One scientist‘s sentiment stood out to me: He said that, basically, we humans are what the trees were in the Devonian - our very existence triggering a mass extinction (the trees killed off the prehistoric fish). That, too, is just a theory - and will sadly give ammunition to those saying we shouldn‘t even try to do anything against climate change - but think about it: What if it‘s true and our very evolution leaves no other outcome? Personally, I disagree, because how we evolve also plays a part and we are not „just“ trees but have evolved so much, technologically, that we can change the outcome if only we are dedicated enough. However, I had never heard that theory before so it got me thinking.Anyway, the author went on quite the tour throughout the US and talked to a number of very important scientists of their respective fields. He also talked to scientists in other places (such as Siberia) and gave us their accounts of voyages and discoveries that triggered some of the most recent theories. The question he seems to be trying to answer is if the next mass extinction (ours) is just around the corner.Another thing that struck a chord with me due to what I‘ve been reading this month was the story of the Humboldt squid. I knew of the squid and how it was the only (or one of very few) profiting from rising sea temperatures, populations exploding - after having read about Alexander von Humboldt, it is very ironic that a squid named after the very scientist warning of the warming seas and advocating environmentalism is becoming a pest caused by human-induced global warming.Thus, the book had a few passages that made me contemplate several aspects of Earth‘s history, evolution, mass extinctions and global warming. However, those were few and far in between. Moreover, the writing was nothing spectacular and I often thought the author was skimming too much, barely scratching the surface, instead of going in deeper (he could have). He simply ticked off what could have been, followed every time by the admission that we don‘t know. I kept asking the same question: yeah, ok ... so?If you take it as a very light book, giving you a few pointers on the different eras and what died out at their respective end, what was left to us from those respective eras (such as gas or coal or oil) and what damage humanity has already caused in its short time on the planet, it works well enough. However, a beginner might need a few more details while a more advanced reader will definitely want more substance to the musings presented here. In short: if this book was juice, it would be watered down too much.Interestingly, my next book is The 6th Extinction and I‘m already very curious if Elizabeth Kolbert is more poignant about the theory she presents."
3,0062364820,http://goodreads.com/user/show/12000072-steve,5,"Great science writing that reads like a mystery novel I loved this book. It has everything I like about great science writing, including clear explanations of the science, personal anecdotes and a sense of humor. Even more, the way the story is structured, it reads like a mystery novel and among the suspects are volcanoes and asteroids. This made the book hard to put down. I also found that Peter Brannen seems to have paid a lot of attention to word choice and sentence structure and some of the writing had a poetic quality to it. I would even reread certain passages because they were so well written. I strongly recommend this book for anyone interested in science.Disclosure: I received a complimentary copy of this book via Edelweiss+ for review purposes.  "
4,0062364820,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4763049-holly,4,"First, this is interesting and entertaining (albeit in a perverse way), with a friendly tone but unapologetic specificity, about the five catastrophic massive extinction events and how life on earth emerged again each time, in weird and bizarre forms and in processes that took millions of years. That is the point: extinctions happen and these are incomprehensibly vast time spans - a scale we cannot even fathom. While this is ultimately a book about climate change, the grand perspective of the entire book gave me a way to really grasp how short a time modern humans have been on Earth and how long these things truly take. Our time span is of utter insignificance. The dinosaurs were the apex species of this planet for almost 200 million years - they were the real winners and the losers.And while it is such hubris to think we matter so much (anthropic principles and person-centered religious ideologies, etc.), it is at the same time such folly to think we humans have no effect on the Earth. Brannen emphasizes the observation of many scientists that the seeming goal/project/purpose of humanity on earth is to extract all the carbon out of the ground and ignite it as fast as we possibly can. That's sobering and true when one thinks about it. Just a stat: the oceans are 30% more acidic than they were at the start of the Industrial Revolution (!). And this ""project"" of ours has never happened before in such a short, intense span of years - the changes usually happen on vast timescales of millions of years, while we are doing it 2 or 3 hundred years. Alas, every projection, even the most conservative, indicates that the world as we know it is going to collapse. Because everything is connected and the systems will fail to support our life on earth. For this age, anyway. I did not know that a massive supercontinent like Pangaea actually changes how climate works, or that as the continents split and collided it caused massive changes in carbon, Co2, oxygen, nitrogen, etc., or that the Chicxulub asteroid impact may not have been the sole factor in ending the Mesozoic (the Deccan basalt floods probably contributed), ... and I had never heard of ""hypercane"" (a continent-sized typhoon with 500 mph winds which could happen if the oceans get warm enough...). There are lots of wonderfully-nerdy geological and paleontological facts and terms like these in this book that I will try to recall at pub-quizzes (e.g. that the new name for the ""K-T boundary"" as we called it when I was in college is the Cretaceous–Paleogene or ""K–Pg boundary""), but the broadening of my perspective is what I'm reflecting on right now."
5,0062364820,http://goodreads.com/user/show/72479728-bryan-alkire,3,"Good enough to read once. It’s interesting even if I was that weird kid who never cared for dinosaurs or rocks. I did learn something more interesting and fun than any science class I took. That said, the writing got a bit repetitive and I got a bit lost on which creatures went with which apocalypse. I didn’t really think the attempt to tie in with modern global warming was particularly successful. If anything, this book proved the opposite. Humans may go extinct due to global warming, but it’s probably foreordained and likely in geological time. In fact, it’s a bit of a comfort really, we may well disappear, but the earth shall abide. Worth reading once and to get from the library or the discount section.  "
6,0062364820,http://goodreads.com/user/show/16803629-hank,4,"Geology is boring. The rocks don't move, they are rock colored, basically they are just good for throwing. At least that is what I thought until reading this. Brannen has done an unimaginably good job at bringing all things geology, paleo*, geochemistry and all the other subjects I avoid, to life. His ability to weave so many different ideas and science into a coherent book is awesome.Not only was it a great science read, it was entertaining. You could feel Brannen's passion and excitement for the subject as well as all of the scientists he interviewed. So many different personalities and ideas all blended to make a good story. The only down side is how dire the warnings are and how solid a case he makes for a really bad situation coming our way. It can be tough to stay positive with all of the evidence.Climate deniers: don't bother reading it. If you aren't convinced by now no amount of rational science will sway you. Anyone else, this is a very entertaining read about past extinctions due to climate or otherwise."
7,0062364820,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1291915-lauren,4,"Brannen's Ends of the World takes on the heady subject of Earth's mass extinctions - the epochs, the rise and fall, the animals and fossils, the shifts of plates and climates, and the rise of atmospheric carbon dioxide and ocean acidification... Both as it happened millions of years ago and how it is happening now in the Anthropocene. He chronologically traces through millions of years of history. I've read similar books (Elizabeth Kolbert's The Sixth Extinction comes to mind), but Brannen takes a somewhat lighter tone on it, while still pressing the gravity of what we face now with climate change and ocean acidification.Brannen is a science journalist with a geology background, and his book centers on interviewing experts and researchers in the field and in the lab. There are some great anecdotes in the book about field work, discoveries, and the newest theories about what brought on some of the mass extinctions of the past. His last chapters were about the crises we now face and how we can learn from the past to assist in the present and future."
8,0062364820,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1376766-becky,4,"Do you ever give yourself a panic attack thinking about scale? I mean, like the vastness of time and space, and the fact that we humans, or even all (known) life, only exist for the merest fraction of a second, in a microscopic speck in a tiny solar system within a tiny galaxy in a tiny cluster of galaxies in a tiny corner of the (observable) universe. The scale of time and size just cannot be comprehended. It's too massive. So sometimes I think about this, and humanity's place in this crazy huge and mind-bogglingly old universe, and I think about the fact that we are in control of nothing. NOTHING. And the fact that one day, all of existence - me, you, millions of species of life, the planet, the solar system, the galaxy, the universe - will cease to exist. And I have a bit of a panic attack. Because the scale of that loss is too huge to comprehend. This book covers everything from the origins of the Earth to its eventual demise, at least as a life-sustaining habitat. It will still exist for a while, at least until the sun explodes, but will be uninhabitable, lifeless, and barren. Welcome to my November mood!I don't know why I find these kinds of books so fascinating, but I do. I love this stuff. You'd think that it would just depress me, that it would make me nihilistic, but on the contrary, it was actually rather uplifting. Listening to the story of Earth, and all of the drastic upheavals and catastrophic events and mass extinctions, and the subsequent resurgence of life after each one, was surprisingly optimistic. I mean. Not for US. But whatever comes after. :DI've said it before - we're not killing the planet. We don't have the power to do that. We can do a lot of damage, though, and make it harder (and maybe impossible, depending on unpredictable variables) for us to survive here. Eventually, Earth will regulate and life will resume... just maybe not life we would recognize. One of the things that I liked most about this book was how vivid it was. Brannen knows that most people aren't going to be able to comprehend the scale of the things that he's writing about here, so he makes it relatable. The asteroid that killed the dinosaurs? It was a mountain sized rock that was moving so fast that the impact crater was partially formed by the AIR PRESSURE it pushed before it. It was moving so fast, Brannen compared it to a plane plummeting from a cruising altitude of 30,000 feet to the ground in 0.3 seconds. It was literally not there one second, and then the next second, the world was already on fire and Armageddon had begun. If you had been around and close enough to see it, you'd have been blinded before you were immediately vaporized, but you probably wouldn't have realized it. You'd have been lucky. Almost everything else burned or died in the earthquakes or volcanoes. Anyway, I don't know where I'm going with this. This book covers a lot of ground, and covers some of the same stuff that I've read in other books on similar pre-historic topics (including a brief chat with Steven Brusatte, author of The Rise and Fall of the Dinosaurs: A New History of a Lost World, whose book I really enjoyed.). If you're interested in any of this stuff, I would highly recommend either book. They are both really good. One is slightly less grim though. :P"
9,0062364820,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10326608-lindsay,4,"A science journalist travels all over the world talking to paleontologists and geologists and visiting sights that illuminate the various ends of geological epochs in the deep history of Earth. By looking at he major mass extinctions on Earth through geologic time it also focuses on the individual events and their similarities. There's also a very strong discussion on where our current world climate situation is using these extinctions as a yard-stick. There's some brief discussion about the types of life that vanished at each event and what life continued, including some speculation on why, but the focus is on the geology.I found it fascinating, a tad depressing, but with elements of hope. In terms of the current levels of climate change, as the author says, mass extinctions are where you're worried about the survival of cows and mice, not polar bears and rhinos. We're not quite there yet. But it's a warning that's worth heeding regardless."
10,0062364820,http://goodreads.com/user/show/978552-cathy,3,"The book has enjoyable stretches, but in total was really too boring to keep my interest. Strange, really, considering that I am interested in paleontology, love to watch documentaries about Earth‘s history—volcanos, movement of tectonic plates, various critters, etc.— and frequently read about climate change and sustainability topics. Not sure if it‘s me or the book. I sometimes disliked the flip tone of the narrator. And the book was a little to centered on the US to really appeal to me. On the other hand I learned something about the geological history of the North American continent.I think one issue I have is that it‘s not clear to me what the book wants to be. A kind of travelogue with anecdotal stories about geological and paleontological history or rather light pop-science, priming us on the reasons and consequences of climate change. Neither works well enough.At times informative and lightly entertaining, sometimes humourous, depressing and boring for long stretches. The required doomsday scenario at the end with a pinch of hope.About the author: http://peterbrannen.com/about"
11,0062364820,http://goodreads.com/user/show/13126933-lata,4,"Ancient history fascinates me, and no, I'm not talking about human ancient history. I'm referring to the life of this planet. And it's been a seriously turbulent, nasty place periodically. Science journalist Peter Brannen takes us through several major developments on this planet. While this includes the slow development of life in all its many weird and wonderful forms over the millenia (okay, way bigger time chunks than millenia, since we're talking millions upon millions of years). But more importantly, how close this planet has come to erasing the life that lives on its thin, watery and rocky skin. Brannen takes us through possible causes of mass extinctions and their effects, from the Ordovician to the one that gets the best press, the end-Cretaceous (or, the dinosaur smushing one).While I often found Brannen's writing informative and interesting, I also found his writing style tended to verge on the hyperbolic and bombastic. That's not to say that what he was describing didn't deserve some bombast. It's hard to wrap one's head around the numbers of years into the distant past he was describing, and the sheer numbers of creatures of all sizes and sorts that have been eliminated on this planet. Not to mention that it's hard not to see that we're creating own serious problems, based on how little regard we have for the only place in this entire universe that we can currently live.I wouldn't say this book is the definitive light science book on mass extinctions, but I did find the book engaging (and liked how it jibed with the facts that I'd already learned in courses)."
12,0062364820,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3936012-becky,5,"Thanks to 25 years of visits to Yellowstone, I have developed a fascination with geology. This is one of the best books I've read on the subject. It includes the most detailed descriptions of the eras of Earth I have read in a book, other than a textbook. Because Brannen includes his reactions to the things he learns as he visits important sites and interviews scientists, he's able to explain difficult concepts in a way that anyone can understand. I don't see why textbooks have to be so boring when a writer like Brannen can impart the same information in an interesting way. "
13,0062364820,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9692204-satyajeet,4,"Essential read for the Fall!Mass extinction and the End.Really uplifting if you ask me.Read this astonishing and terrifying description of the end of the dinosaurs:“The meteorite itself was so massive that it didn’t notice any atmosphere whatsoever,” said Rebolledo. “It was traveling 20 to 40 kilometers per second, 10 kilometers — probably 14 kilometers — wide, pushing the atmosphere and building such incredible pressure that the ocean in front of it just went away.”These numbers are precise without usefully conveying the scale of the calamity. What they mean is that a rock larger than Mount Everest hit planet Earth traveling twenty times faster than a bullet. This is so fast that it would have traversed the distance from the cruising altitude of a 747 to the ground in 0.3 seconds. The asteroid itself was so large that, even at the moment of impact, the top of it might have still towered more than a mile above the cruising altitude of a 747. In its nearly instantaneous descent, it compressed the air below it so violently that it briefly became several times hotter than the surface of the sun.“The pressure of the atmosphere in front of the asteroid started excavating the crater before it even got there,” Rebolledo said. “Them when the meteorite touched ground zero, it was totally intact. It was so massive that the atmosphere didn’t even make a scratch on it.”Unlike the typical Hollywood CGI depictions of asteroid impacts, where an extraterrestrial charcoal briquette gently smolders across the sky, in the Yucatan it would have been a pleasant day one second and the world was already over by the next. As the asteroid collided with the earth, in the sky above it where there should have been air, the rock had punched a hole of outer space vacuum in the atmosphere. As the heavens rushed in to close this hole, enormous volumes of earth were expelled into orbit and beyond — all within a second or two of impact. “So there’s probably little bits of dinosaur bone up on the moon,” I asked.“Yeah, probably.” As I said, uplifting."

15,0062364820,http://goodreads.com/user/show/57644158-maddie-gretzky,5,"I came to this book because I was concerned about Climate Change, and hoping for some context. And boy, does Peter Brannon give it. Each chapter, as he explains the lead up to and then possible causes of the mass extinction, he takes time to show how it is similar (or not) to what we are doing to the planet today. And make no mistake, our actions over the past couple hundred years are immense and long lasting: ""People don't talk much about what happens after 2100. On the scale of a human lifetime, the affairs of the next century remain hazy and remote fictions. But since the scope of this book is geological, the year 2100 is an insignificant mile marker, and the passage of centuries and insignificant blur, unresolvable in the fossil record. For tens of thousands of years beyond 2100, the earth will remain much warmer and totally unlike what it has been for millions of years."" If you're looking for a well-written, well-researched book to help you understand geology, this is an excellent choice. As an award-winning science journalist, Peter Brannon has the writing chops to convey complicated ideas clearly and poetically. He also makes sure to be clear about the many areas of earth's past where we just don't know what happened, laying out the various theories and arguments in a way that was easy to understand, while ultimately letting the reader judge competing evidence for themselves. Also, and this is perhaps critical in a book about multiple apocalypses, he's funny! As a Bostonian (former) myself, I appreciated his references to New England areas, but didn't feel confused by his references to places I haven't been. On occasion, he would suggest googling something for a visual, which was always worth the search. And the photos in the middle of the book were very helpful in envisioning such alien continental arrangements. Most of all, this book was humbling. I came to it after reading Jared Diamond's Guns, Germs, and Steel, a massive book that deals only with the 14,000 years or so of human history. This book spans millions of years, and makes it clear that life survives almost everything, even though humans may not. There are no calls to action at the end of this book, and most likely climate change deniers are not among its audience (though anyone denying climate change would benefit majorly from perusing this text!) anyway. But it does end with a surprisingly universal thought: there is likely other life in the universe; it's too vast and complex for life not to exist. But perhaps we, on Earth, have been stupidly lucky to have developed complex societies: to have geologists to study the past, journalists to write about them, bookstores in order to buy the resultant book, and smartphones to write reviews like this one on. Perhaps the life elsewhere in the universe will not get to that point. Whether it will or not, it is up to us to try to preserve the planet we've got, for if we fail- if humanity dies out even if life, microbial though it may be, goes on- what was the point of it all? It is up to us not to betray that great shining future humanity has been working for for centuries, up to us not to sell it for cheap coal and oil. Isn't that future worth making some changes now, to try to avert further damage? I think so. "
16,0062364820,http://goodreads.com/user/show/34340409-sanjay-varma,1,"I did not like the author's writing style, and found the material to be poorly organized. Good stuff can be found at the paragraph level, but the author rarely strings together two good paragraphs, and did not deliver any chapter that flowed well from start to finish. I reserve particular criticism for the way that Brannen portrays scientists. He tends to present their theories first, and then introduce quotes from them at the end which make them sound a bit desperate like they're delivering a sales pitch instead of a cogent argument. There is something about the quotes from these scientists that reminded me of the way spiritual gurus speak in ""The Celestine Prophecy."""

(Sorry for my English) Of course, the subject is very interesting.However, this book reminds me too much a Nature or National Geographic TV series: many interviews, a bit of intrigue (which does not succeed), redundant explanations (in the series for the advertising cuts) and all these things. In other words, some superfluous pages.For the rest, I consider that Peter Brannen's book deserves three and half stars because it has enriched my (poor) knowledge about our geological past and has given me a good overview of the history, present and future of our planet.I have edited my review: the last chapter of the book has a very interesting topic: the thin line -the set of complex factors- that make a planet habitable or not."

While Elizabeth Kolbert won a Pulitzer writing about humanity inevitably causing the next great extinction, Peter Brannen puts forward a very convincing evidence that renders this theory rather narcissistic. There is no doubt that humans will eventually cause permanent change to earth's biosphere, altering our own quality of life and causing numerous species to disappear. However, to equal this phenomenon to the past five disruptive events is comparing apples to oranges.

The worse the mass extinction, the more detail you get about the Dantesque hellishness that occasionally visits the earth.Of course, there is a point to this. Mainly that the earth was quite well warmed by carbon at each mass extinction. Although, we have nothing on the end-Permian yet.Fun fact: when the dinosaur-killing asteroid hit, it was so big that one end of it was still higher than a 767's cruising height, when the other end first touched the ground.

22,0062364820,http://goodreads.com/user/show/15725205-bonnie-mcdaniel,4,"I've read some very good science books this year, and this is yet another. It discusses the six major mass extinctions in our planet's history (I always thought there were five, but Peter Brannen tosses in another one, the End-Pleistocene, which he pins on early humans). Of course, the granddaddy of mass extinctions is the End-Permian (252 million years ago), which is summed up in this cheerful paragraph:To summarize: There was an ocean that was rapidly acidifying--one that, over huge swaths of the planet, was as hot as a Jacuzzi and completely bereft of oxygen. There were sickly tides suffused with so much carbon dioxide and hydrogen sulfide that either poison would have sufficed as a killer in its own right. There was a Russian landscape detonating and being smothered in lava several miles deep. There was a fog of neurotoxins and lethal smog streaming from these volcanoes and, high above, an ozone layer blasted apart by halocarbons, inviting a bath of lethal radiation at the planet's surface. There was forest-destroying acid rain and a landscape so barren that rivers had stopped winding. There were carbon dioxide levels so high, and global warming so intense, that much of the earth had become too hot even for insects. And now there were Kump's unearthly mega-hurricanes, made of poison swamp gas, that would have towered into the heavens and obliterated whole continents.The Kump mentioned here then compares these conditions to the modern day:""Well, at the rate at which we're injecting CO2 into the atmosphere today, according to our best estimates, is ten times faster than it was during the End-Permian."" Books like this are very important. They point out the brutal truth: If humans continue on our fossil-fuel-burning suicidal march, we will probably destroy ourselves and much of life on Earth as well. The planet itself will survive, and life will return, albeit in a radically new fashion, as has happened after each of the previous mass extinctions. But civilization will be gone, and so will Homo sapiens. All because of a few decades of deliberate blindness and unmatched greed, and for what?This is an interesting, well-written book, but it is not a happy one. Too much here strikes way too close to home. I don't know if it's even possible, now, to stop what's coming, but I commend this author, and others, for writing books like this, which use the past to illuminate the present. "
23,0062364820,http://goodreads.com/user/show/30936578-lissa,3,"I love books about the various ""ends"" of the world in prehistory. I blame my childhood fascination with dinosaurs (one of the very first books I owned was called ""Dial-A-Dinosaur"" by Paul Sereno, which had two dials where you could find an illustration of dinosaurs and a page number for a description about them). There's something just so interesting about the lifeforms that were here before us, nearly all of which didn't survive into our ""modern"" world, and how they went extinct. There's still a lot that we don't know about these extinctions, but the author does a pretty good job at trying to piece together the various common theories about what went down and when. The reason I'm giving this book only three stars is more because of the author's writing style. Although the chapters are divided into the various mass extinctions, they tend to meander quite a bit. I would have preferred a more linear presentation of the information, but it reads more like a travelogue than something that is supposed to impart knowledge.The author does try to tie the mass extinctions of the past with what is going on today (global warming, increased CO2 in the atmosphere, etc), with mixed possibilities. On the one hand, a great deal of evidence supports that what we are doing is unsustainable in the long run and will have vast consequences for future generations, as well as the Earth for millions of years. Other scientists theorize, however, that we haven't quite reached the tipping point yet and that there is still time to reverse the damage that we are doing. The ending, I felt, was poorly done, and the author basically says that all will end well without giving evidence for that. Altogether, I would conditionally recommend this to people who are interested in the five mass extinctions of earth, but I wouldn't go into the book with high hopes."
24,0062364820,http://goodreads.com/user/show/846253-leslie,4,"The author is unquestionably convinced that we humans are out to destroy life on earth as we know it. The earth has spent billions of years hiding carbon in pockets deep in the earth and we modern humans want to dig, drill, frack and otherwise remove all of that carbon so we can burn it and release it into the atmosphere and oceans and turn the earth into a pizza oven.... and there is nothing we can do to stop it.... except stop using carbon... oh dearHowever the author also admits that many millennia ago when the first trees evolved they needed nutrients trapped below in rocks so they developed roots which broke up rocks and released various elements that eventually ended up in the streams and rivers and oceans and killed all the animals in the oceans by denying them oxygen... which is terrible I mean we need to build a time machine and go back 5000000000 years and save those pre-fishies... except if we do that we won't ever be here because if it wasn't for these very specific disasters we weak humans would have never been able to inhabit this big blue marble. Now I am not a scientist or a philosopher but it seems to me that these extinctions happened for a reason and if we are headed for a 6th extinction the only thing that makes it different is that we are seemingly arrogant enough to think we can change the future of a planet that has been around for billions of years merely to save ourselves. If the earth decides to shake us off it is because it has something very different planned. "

I really enjoyed this book but there were two things that really annoyed me. This bright young lad sees himself as a modern, secular, liberal guy -- he really looks down his nose at people who get all worked up about ""centuries old religions."" But strangely enough, whenever he starts dishing the dirt on those scary extinctions he sounds just like a backwoods preacher whooping up hellfire! ""Did all the trilobites die screaming? What about the happy, fun loving annelids? Just like us, they enjoyed their lifestyle of carbon emissions, and never thought about tomorrow. Suddenly, those sinful trilobites were bathing in a lake of fire of their own design -- just like everyone who voted for Trump is gonna fry, brothers and sisters, fry on a griddle of corporate greed! Can I get an amen for all the trilobites who voted for Trump?""The other problem was less hysterical but just as annoying. This is one of those books where the author interviews dozens of scientists, all over the country, which is fine. But he always has to stick in a few sentences at the beginning just to let you know that, hey, this person is one of us -- he's one of the cool kids. ""Biff Loman has been studying trilobites for twenty years. I caught up with Biff outside the science lab, where he was playing frisbee with his dog while wearing a classic WHO t-shirt with a pirate's bandanna on his head and faded vintage jeans."" Yeah, okay. Just once I would have liked to see him interview a scientist who, you know, wasn't cool. ""I caught up with Dr. Carrington in his foul-smelling, one-bedroom apartment, which is all he can afford on an academic's salary. He was eating day-old pizza, drinking warm beer out of the can and masturbating to a decades old episode of STAR TREK!""I think I could have bought all the global-warming hysteria a lot more readily if it didn't always come from the cool kids. You know what I mean?"

It's still beyond imagination, but I feel it more than I have before.My only issue with this book is that there were a few moments where the author goes a bit bro. There were a few (fairly subtle, but still present) moments that put me off. A little male gender-blindness, a little punching down."
29,0062364820,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1677868-steven-peterson,5,"This book is a well done telling of the story of Earth's five great extinctions. In each case, a large majority of species (including plants, land life, sea life, and life in flight) disappeared. In most cases, ironic given today's climate debate, carbon imbalance was the problem. And even the Cretaceous extinction, recently thought to have been brought about by an object from space crashing into the Yucatan area, may have interacted with contemporaneous volcanic eruptions in India.The heart of this book is a detailed examination of life in various periods. The climax of each was an extinction event. These are the five: End-Ordovician, Late Devonian, End-Permian, End-Triassic, and End-Cretaceous. Each period is well described, as we see dominant forms evolve as well as all manner of life. Then, the climax of an extinction event that could destroy 90% of all life.Then, the author describes the slow recovery of life and new forms coming into dominance. The most recent extinction event, of course, resulted in the death of most dinosaurs (birds are dinosaurs, theropods related to T. Rex and raptors, so we have today a bridge of life back to the age of the dinosaurs). This is the end event most familiar to most of us.The book ends with speculation about a sixth extinction event, with discussion of the possibility that humans may be a part of the picture, with increased carbon being produced, destruction of natural habitats, etc. This is obviously a speculative chapter, but one that helps place the tale of five prior extinctions into an interesting frame.All in all, a fine work."

It is hard to imagine a better written or more thoroughly researched book on the Big five extinctions. Peter Brannen covers all sides of scientific debates (e.g., about Deccan traps and the extinction of the dinosaurs). And he includes a lot of detail—maybe too much detail. Even still, so much of what he covers is simply fascinating, from the planet’s first trees in the Devonian (now in NY, about an hour outside of Albany), to the importance of north-south coastline length for surviving climate change, to the geology of Gettysburg (“The gradual slope up Cemetery Ridge where Pickett’s charge met its grisly fate is shaped by the underlying magmatic plumbing of End-Triassic volcanism,” p. 156). Growing up I wanted to be a geologist, so maybe that is why I loved all the details. But even if you skim the details, you would still get a lot out of the book. Are concerns about a human-caused sixth extinction overblown? What lies ahead for earth in the next 100 years? How about in the next 800 million? Does the earth’s past offer insights into what is happening now and what will likely happen in the future? Brannen will answer all of these questions, and more. One more thing: read the footnotes. When they are not informative, they are hilarious."

This is a bracing tonic.I think that Brannen did a very good job of telling this deep history, and helping to share why it matters. I also felt myself recoiling a little bit because of his tone.

The Palisades Sill is not a basalt, it is a diabase sill, making it an intrusive igneous rock, which crystallizes in place and was never at the surface as the word basalt implies. Yes it crystallized from a basaltic magma but not at the surface. I’m very surprised that the geologists he spoke to did not correct him on this. Not sure I can believe anything else in the book. "
40,0062364820,http://goodreads.com/user/show/80750585-claudia,3,"Great deal of information about the five major extinctions that have occurred on our amazing planet. Unfortunately, it is only geological records that are providing the tantalizing glimpses into the past and the further back in time, the smaller those glimpses are. Especially when you consider that the only life on the planet was microbial and basically gelatinous. There was nothing to preserve except in the most extraordinary circumstances. In fact, any fossil remnant or petrified bone is an example of profound luck.Anyway, back to the book - This took me quite a while to get through. The early chapters - dealing with the earliest extinctions - were far more theory since geological records of those times give only the most shadowy hints of what happened. And some theories could be based on happenings that actually occurred hundreds of thousands if not millions of years apart. Even the extinction of the dinosaurs which is blamed on an asteroid may have also been due to a massive volcanic eruption that buried India under 2 miles of lava near the same time. The planet's diverse species likely could not withstand both assaults.But life on Earth is very resilient and even if over half the planet's species go extinct in less than a million years (technically what an extinction event is), there are still more willing to fill in those now-empty niches.I must admit that a bit of knowledge in geology, climatology and paleontology would be helpful while reading this work since it will make some of the theories and concepts clearer. Perhaps the hardest part for the general reader to accept is the depth of time. We are lucky to know someone that has lived a hundred years. The U.S. gained it's independence 350 years ago. Rome, the eternal city, was founded over two thousand years ago. The Egyptians erected the Great Pyramid about 2500 years before that. So millions and billions of years - most would have difficulty even conceptualizing the notion.Of course, it had to end with the next expected mass extinction - whether it is due to carbon emissions driving up the temperatures and the acidifying of the oceans where various species are unable to adapt or the continents merging back into one with the center being a sere landscape with little to no water flowing or even the sun entering the last stages of it's own lifespan. So it may be within the next couple centuries . . . or 800 million years in the future.2019-187"

42,0062364820,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4162791-claudia-putnam,4,"Well, that was certainly exciting! After the rippling prose of Andrew Knoll's Life on a Younger Planet, and the astounded reverence of John McPhee's Basin and Range, Brannen's writing is a little too boppy and headlong for my taste. You can't just hurl yourself through 500 million years or so. It's kind of puppylike--I'm sure some people like that about him. Nevertheless. A lot to learn here. I did laugh out loud at the first 3 billion years of evolution so rapturously described by Knoll as the wellspring of life being portrayed by Brannen as ""sluggishy sucking up organic gunk in the disgusting seas of primordial earth."" It turns out there have been more than the 5 mass extinctions everybody (you didn't know? well, brush up) talks about, with us possibly about to trigger the 6th. Snowball Earth, a series of catastrophic glaciations in the middle of the early Slime Period (my term, but I doubt I'm the first to think it up), when complex nucleated bacteria were starting to take hold and were nearly annihilated, was likely the first. Then, as Brannen notes, the sluggish gunk suckers were pretty much wiped out when something called, no lie, penis worms, came along and started burrowing in the (shallow) ocean floors. This stirred up a lot of dirt and also changed the oxygen/carbon/nitrogen/methane ratios in the water and probably air. The atmosphere and sea still weren't too O2-heavy but it was enough to trigger the Cambrian Explosion of (relatively) complex animal life. Which wiped out the sluggy frondy stuff that had existed previously. Even though this is is not really something the book is concerned with, it sort of is, because shows how one species messes with the environment and everyone else dies. ""A sentiment exists--particularly among non-scientists--that the idea of humans seriously disrupting the planet on a geological scale is mere anthropocentric hubris. But this sentiment misunderstands the history of life. In the geological past, seemingly small innovations have reorganized the planet's chemistry, hurling it into drastic phase changes. Surely humans might be as significant as the filter feeding animals of the Cambrian Explosion.""Later it's pointed out that mass extinctions have occurred without the help of overfishing, overhunting, overgrazing, etc, etc. So, minus these two extinctions, we have 5 to discuss. Let's define what we mean by mass extinction: >75% of life on earth, sea and land, wiped out. That 75% figure is for the end-triassic, when the dinosaurs, the most successful species ever, bit the dust, so to speak. That extinction was the mildest of the 5. The worst was the end-Permian, about 252 million years ago, when around 96% of the planet died and the oceans went anoxic. Recovery period: 30 million years. No Netflix series featuring a hardy band of survivors for that one, guys. Brannen mentions that Doug Erwin, who wrote Extinction, which is next on my list, and which focuses on this event, might have consulted with Cormac McCarthy when he was writing The Road. Or perhaps the screenplay. He's not admitting to that. (What gets to me about the dinosaur event? Only two reptilian four-legged species survived. One of them was the leathernecked sea turtle. Endangered now. By us.)All these events have involved massive increases of carbon into the atmosphere via volcanism (yes, I know you think it was an asteroid with the dinosaurs, but there have been other cases of impacts of around the same size with no mass extinction...at the same time the dinosaur asteroid hit, half of India was erupting). One was very gradual. The other 4 were not. It turns out that it isn't so much about the amount of carbon but the rate at which it is added. At some point, it appears there is a tipping point. What that means is that there is a disruption in the food chain. This food chain thing is a web and it's affected in a chaotic way. At some point there is a critical disruption that can't be recovered from. Everything dies off fairly suddenly.Are we in the middle of an extinction event now? That is, are we penis worms? Or are we the equivalent of these massive volcanoes, bringing carbon out of the ground and spewing it into the air? Well, on the one hand, the amount of carbon we've put into the atmosphere is nowhere near equal, in volume, to what was seen during the Permian or Triassic events. On the other, the rate we're spewing is faster than anything ever recorded in geology. It's the rate that matters.And we're messing with our environment, penis-worm-like, in other ways. Converting wildland to farmland. Paradise to parking lot. Putting nitrogen into the ocean. Killing plankton. That plankton thing really is key. Bottom of the food chain thing--turns up time and time again as a Bad Sign. So do dead and dying reefs. So, are we? Well, if we are, it didn't take us long. Any future geologists, arising out of some future slime, or re-evolving from rat or insect, would look at the anthropocene, or the primacene, and maybe not even recognize us. There will be a layer of carbon, microplastics, steroids, nitrogen. A few primate fossils might survive, but maybe not even enough to know which humans were significant or responsible for microplastics, etc. The time layer between us and Lucy may not be geologically significant--they won't be able to tell which came first. They might think Neanderthals made the plastics. Probably not, but maybe. (This is me rambling on, not Brannen.) This extinction will be EXTREMELY mysterious unless an asteroid happens to hit right after, because we'll be gone, and our cities will erode away completely. There won't be any volcanism, unless coincidentally there is within the next 60,000 years. Since there will be so little trace of us, they won't know what happened this time. Well if we are in an extinction, says one of the scientists, I think it's Erwin, there's no way we're turning it back. It's not about carbon sinks, or stopping global warming. This is a horse that has way left the barn. So he says, no. I got the idea he says no because there's no point in thinking yes. I think another expert in these matters, Peter Ward, thinks yes. I think yes. The reason I think yes is that we're asking the question. I think we sense it. If we notice enough to ask, then yes. There's a whole field of psychology called eco-psych. It does a bunch of different things, but one aspect is address a growing sense of despair/depression over what's happening to the planet. Don't you feel it? Consider that orca carrying her dead baby all those days, over two weeks, as it rotted on her back. She and her pod were on a march. Back and forth, up and down the coast. Don't you think? They wanted us to see. They are starving and sick. Their young are dying. They're ancient, they're not in denial. They wanted us to know what they know. Back to the slime. Which, luckily, is the wellspring of life. Something interesting is bound to come of it. There's enough time before the supernova. "
43,0062364820,http://goodreads.com/user/show/52174518-rebecca,1,"I was so looking forward to this book! But I found it almost unreadable. There was no order to anything. The paragraphs went all over the place. It was as if the author took a scientific narrative, cut it up with scissors, made a collage, and then put emoji stickers all over it. I just could not follow it. And there was no chart or timeline of the eras to refer to, no organized visuals that would have made up for the word salad that was the text. Also, Brannen took what I thought were unscientific liberties with his fanciful adjectives and frivolous, ""fun"" descriptions. It is possible to write about science in a fun way (Mary Roach), but sadly, the fun here was just pointless and distracting. Very disappointing, for what should have been an utterly fascinating book (given the subject). DNF. Actually, CNF...could not finish."
44,0062364820,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3424260-kerry,5,"Brannen is able to take complex events, break them down into understandable parts, and then describe how they interact; reconstructing the original event so that you understand it in all its complexity. He does this again and again, moving from the origin of the earth into the future constructing a view of earth's history that is breathtaking."

46,0062364820,http://goodreads.com/user/show/23785775-julia,3," This was one book that not only has a somewhat colorful and interesting cover but also a lengthy name that inspires those who may be quite interested in the subject. Otherwise if you aren't interested in the subject or even nonfiction writing in truth than I would most definitely steer clear of this book since it isn't one that is for beginners. The author does a great job in actually breaking down the book into the different mass extinctions and giving the year that it has been recorded at. As a result the reader gets to be introduced into the timeframe, what may have been lurking around as the superstar(s) of the cast and then possible events that could have been triggers to these mass events. Besides this information there are also stories told about places where the rock record can be found for those events as well as the leaders of the fields and their belief and/or teaching to help clarify up the information being presented. At the same time there was a small collection of artwork and pictures of some of the briefest moments found in the book. I wish that I had known about them beforehand or even better that they were actually included in the middle of the book instead of way in the back as if they were tucked there as in second thought for they allowed the reader another glimpse into the information that was being read about.  As for what I didn't like was the fact that the book seemed so repetitive. Although the events that seemed to trigger the mass extinctions were almost similar to each other and some of their effects were also similar I didn't need to know repeatedly and repeatedly how we are so close to making these disasters almost upon us but not quite yet. As a result the last two chapters in the book were basically an expansion of all the information that the reader had been introduced as to what we are doing to not fix the problem, how the issues we are doing now will contribute to our own downfall, how there are two sides of the camp with some thinking that we are still good to go until the end arrives and how others aren't, etc. Once or twice would have been enough while if you had wanted to include those chapters than you should have saved the information to be used just in the chapters. All in all it was fun getting to know some more about the other organisms that have shared the spotlight of life and also the events that we cannot imagine that have come to life in their own majestic time under the old sun such as the traps, the evolution of plants and the super continents. Otherwise quite wordy and repetitive this book again is only for those who are quite dedicated to these fields of science and/or are interested in getting to know more about events that have been largely ignored by the general public over the last few decades."
47,0062364820,http://goodreads.com/user/show/53250130-easton-smith,4,"What a horror: the sixth extinction. To think that we, humans, have essentially recreated the sort of poisonous conditions that have, in the past, wiped out nearly every living being on this planet. What a relief: that if we do manage to wipe ourselves out, at least something will survive, and the world will repopulate with all kinds of beings we could never imagine. Those were my opposing moods throughout reading this decently-written popular science book. Geological time helps me to have perspective, which can be a salve (when thinking about how much longer the earth will live) or a knock on the head (when thinking about how our actions will ripple out for millions of years). Brannen does a good job of showing both of these angles, even if he does occasionally repeat himself. I did feel like every few pages he had to reiterate the central storyline of the book (but little did the crustaceans know, Armageddon was coming...). He also tended to present the science behind it all in a bit of a reductive way. He would explore a series of climatic and geological problems that might have occurred in history, and then usually reduce them all to CO2. While this surely helped drive home our current crisis, it did at times feel like he was shaving off a bunch of complexity. This is, perhaps, necessary in this kind of book, but I would have really appreciated a section in the beginning where he lays out his methodology. It would have helped me trust his streamlined conclusions a bit more. I also have some hesitations about the author's discussions of humanity's more recent history and our coming future. He is somewhat dismissive of Native American scholarship that suggests they did not extinct North American megafauna during pre-colonial times (I understand his objections, but it could have been more carefully written). But what bothered me the most was the way that he finishes off with a discussion with some futurist-technology-will-save-us-Elon-Musk-type guy who suggests that the real sad part of humans dying off is that we won't get to explore other planets. Brannen takes us directly from geological time to anthropocentricism so fast that its just jarring. Still, this is a great book. It's discussions of geological history are endlessly fascinating to me, someone who is not well versed in these things. A great companion book to N.K. Jemison's Broken Earth Trilogy. "
48,0062364820,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2129784-bonnie,4,"Most of us have no conception of the age of our planet, or how long it took for there to be any life at all. We tend to think of all the dinosaurs as living at the same time. It’s a shock when Brannen points out that Tyrannosaurus Rex is closer to us in time than it is to Stegosaurus.Brannen’s topic is the five previous major extinctions that have occurred on earth; we may be living through the sixth. Some took millions of years; others, like the extinction of the dinosaurs and virtually all life on earth, may have been instantaneous. Scientists are still trying to figure out exactly what happened. One of the pleasures of this book is learning about the unbelievable variety of animals that have lived on earth. Brannen provides vivid descriptions of the animals and their habitats. However, I found myself looking up the animals in order to get pictures. Toward the end of the book, he provides some illustrations, but the book could have used a lot more.I was a little irritated by his overwriting. Talking about the crocodiles that dominated the Triassic, he says, “This deposed royal family still hunts swamp margins and irritably moseys across gold courses…” Why irritably? Referring to the theory that an asteroid caused the extinction of the dinosaurs (and most of life on earth), Brannen says that the hadrosaurs, “settling down for a fitful sleep would nervously eye this strange new star…” Is there any reason to think that hadrosaurs would notice anything in the sky? Nor is his ascription of human attitudes limited to animals. Referring to the break-up of a supercontinent, he says that India “divorced” Gondwana and was “evidently unsentimental about this union.” Such anthropomorphism is cutesy and distracting.What are the implications of this history for us today? I’m not really sure. It’s possible that climate change will mean the end of the human species in 100 years or so – not close enough to affect me, but it will be horrible for my children and grandchildren. Or perhaps that won’t happen but in millions of years, the last animal on earth will die. That’s not so terrible, but the former is tragic."
49,0062364820,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5806439-ron,4,"This is an excellent survey of the five major extinction events that nearly wiped out all life on the planet. Though the style was a bit too gee-whiz for my taste, it did help lighten up what would be to some, a pretty grim story of asteroid strikes, vulcanism that makes Mt. St. Helens seem like a firecracker, and the deaths of gazillions. He does a great job of making the complex interplay of geology, biology, chemistry and--at least for one extinction event--astrophysics, accessible to the layperson. He managed to generate some mind benders, which is always appreciated. For instance, the planet we call earth existed for something like a billion years before complex life ever appeared, and that our time in existence is absolutely DWARFED by the reign of, say, the dinosaurs (and others). I knew all this, but he laid it out in a way that really made it sink in. There are plenty more factoids and anecdotes that make you stop reading for a moment and say WTF.The latter part of the book deals with the now and the future, with what some theorists say is a sixth mass extinction, already in progress, as well as other possible ways that our existence might end. Or continue. He did a good job presenting both sides of the Sixth Extinction debate, and never really got preachy about it. What did it leave me with? Well, we are certainly at a crossroads and have some very tough decisions ahead. Yes, that is an understatement...There was even a little philosophy thrown in about the significance (or lack of same), of human life to the planet and to existence as a whole. This was less effective for me, though with little wonder: how could you cover subjects in a single chapter that have kept thinkers busy for millennia? It has set the wheels turning in my own mind, which was probably the intent.It might strike some as depressing, to think we're kind of this mold that has spread across the globe in a really short time, and that species who could literally eat us for lunch ruled the globe for 160 *million* years and were wiped out nearly overnight. A subtext here, intentional or not, is that life--maybe not our life, but life-- is nothing if not persistent."

Probably the lasting image I'll take from this is the horrors of ocean acidification, especially on the scale seen at the worst-recorded extinction event at the end of the Permian period, aka, The Great Dying.Of course, this is pertinent to current climate change, and although the potential outcomes are clearly shown to be terrifying, it's also made clear that humanity still has a chance to avert the worst - time is still on our side, if we make the effort to act.However, a major flaw is that it is almost entirely focused on the role of the carbon-cycle. While the dangers of rising carbon-dioxide in the atmosphere are made clear time after time, it spends almost no time on the role of the sun on climate, and Milankovitch cycles get a brief single-sentence mention without even being named.Perhaps there is an argument that the carbon-cycle is the ultimate planetary thermostat, but it seems strange to focus so much on vulcanism and plate tectonics as major causes while ignoring variability in solar output itself, which is arguably a main driver.Even still, an interesting, engaging - and frightening - read.

I mean, Peter Brannen is writing about paleontology and climate change and the words just sing to you, make you see worlds that we actually know very little about and feel for ammonoids like there would be the cutest kittens, looking at you with big eyes and begging not to get extinct. As someone who wants to write himself someday, I really hate this guy. He is that good.That being said, The Ends of the World is a book about the major extinctions in Earth's history, their causes and how they relate to our present lives. It's a captivating read, evoking lost worlds and very carefully analyzing how they disappeared and why. There is humor, drama, interesting interviews with fascinating people. Dinosaurs? Puh-lease. This takes you back to the good old days of the Ediacaran and slowly brings you around our time and even speculates on what could come after us, the hubris filled species that, geologically speaking, was barely born yesterday - or a few seconds ago, depending on how you measure it - and has the chance to outshine all the other species that came, ruled and went.There is no way I can do it justice other than to say that I loved the book. In itself it's a summary of life on Earth so summarizing it myself would be pointless. I highly recommend it."

I learned a ton about 'deep time' and all the various times that life on this planet was (nearly) wiped out. It's one of the things I love about books on space or, is it really gives me a totally different perspective on mankind's role in the universe. And, lots of nifty facts about how different a place everything was in the past.The book doesn't get super technical, which I really appreciate. I'm in it for the story, more than the nitty gritty detail. It only gets four stars because I really found the comparison to current climate change repetitive and frustrating. Nearly every extinction, the author points out how it's basically the same as what we're doing today. Yep, I get it, it's real bad, I totally agree. I just don't need to hear it over and over. The book's final chapter goes into more detail about what kind of havoc we're causing, and different ways that might end up - also fascinating to read.I listened to the audiobook version - it's not particularly notable, which I find to be excellent."

Highly recommended if you want to understand how human-driven climate change is bringing on an extinction caused by too much carbon dioxide in the atmosphere, much like the ones that came before...but way faster. It also points out some differences and actions that mankind can take that will help. In the end, it ends relatively positively (for a book on mass extinction, anyway), with the author pointing out that we aren't yey even closer to the level of chaos and destruction at the end of the Permian extinction, for instance, and that it is not too late to turn it around...but he does point out that one of the perils of educating about climate change is that it can seem super overwhelming and inevitable, which has the opposite effect than intended: it leads to a fatalism and resignation that the end is coming so why bother. It's important to avoid making it seem hopeless, is his point, and I like it."

Maybe six, if you accept that we're in the middle of one right now. The jury's still out on that one. Unless you're keeping up with the technical journals and conferences, you can throw out what you think you know about mass extinctions from your old college geology classes, reading books that are more than 10 years old, or watching PBS or Discovery.The author's style reminds me a lot of John McPhee. He did a lot of research by going out in the field with geologists and amateur fossil hunters, as well as interviewing numerous paleontologists and other geologists. But he keeps it interesting, even for people who don't know geology.To have a mass extinction event, a lot of catastrophic events have to happen more or less at the same geologic time. The asteroid impact at the Cretaceous-Tertiary boundary (blamed for killing the dinosaurs) probably wasn't enough by itself. But there's evidence that the impact restarted & intensified massive flood lava flows on the other side of the planet. Changes in carbon dioxide concentrations in the atmosphere and dissolved in the oceans play a key role. That's tied in with ocean acidification. Starting to sound familiar?There's a lot of discussion in this book about climate change. What does it mean? How bad is it compared to the geologic past? Is there really anything that humans can do to reverse it? Read on & find out. This book will probably change your perspective, even if you're a geology major."

Hey, it turns out we've only killed off less than 1% of the species on the planet so far, and in The Great Dying it was more like 99%. So that's a resilient planet you've got there, so far.I'm more hopeful for the long-term (100,000 years+) survival of complex life in general than I was before reading this, though less so for that of mammals in particular. Reptiles and birds are going to have a good run, though. On the other hand, it does start to feel more certain that another 50 years of life in Massachusetts may not be far north enough to expect political or technological stability.On the rough timeline of 100-500,000 years for this interglacial, 800 million years for life on the planet, and 100 trillion years for potential life in the galaxy, that starts to seem both less and more important. There's plenty of time for future chances at civilization-building life to develop, so it's less relevant if we don't hack it, but also, we may actually be pretty close to an exoplanetary threshold in tech, so it'd be a shame if we shot ourselves in the foot this close to that inflection point."

I have always been fascinated by the age of the world, pre-anthropological history, etc. I was engrossed by his descriptions of the world 500 million, 200 million years ago and it illustrates the absurdly small scale of humankind's existence here. Here's a short cliff notes - it's all about climate change. Climate change has led to the demise of basically everything on earth for 500 million years, in one way or another. And here we go again. As a writer, Peter Brannen has a gift to make the death of algae interesting and extremely readable. However, his final chapter shows the outsized impact we have had in relation to this short time on earth, and how the next decades are critical, even getting into AI and cosmological settlement. It's beyond an ambitious scope at only 300 pages, covering 500 million years of history, that he executes beautifully for a lay audience at least. I wish I could force every religious person I know to read it."

The final chapters are devoted to what may be the Sixth Great Extinction but caused not just by natural forces but by humankind's hellbent destruction of habitat as well as striving to put aeons' worth of carbon back into the atmosphere. A sobering book which adequately explains the mechanisms that drove the previous extinctions and their relevance to events in the last millennia.

58,0062364820,http://goodreads.com/user/show/56646301-colin-ennis,5,"Fascinating review of major extinction events in the Earth's history. Brannen's attention to detail enabled a vivid depiction of each geological period, creating a kind of obituary for the former worlds of our planet. I especially enjoyed his discussion of the Ordovician and Permian extinctions; too often the dinosaurs (somewhat deservedly) capture the public attention, and so learning about these even more ancient planets was fascinating to me.I appreciated too that the book is essentially a covert analysis of the tenuous link between climate and life on this planet; virtually every extinction is caused by massive climate change. True, in some cases a supervolcano or asteroid might aid the process along, but the end result is still the same. Later chapters focussing on a potential Holocene extinction and the extinctions of the far-future (including all life itself) would make for a fascinating book in their own right.Brannen's writing is sobering and sweet, neither full of doom nor hope. A few strange turns of phrase (describing a group of scientists as autistic stands out as particularly unfortunate) do not wholly detract from some of the best science writing I've read in the last few years."

Things like that meteor was really bad for the dinosaurs, but that wasn't the only thing that was going on that wiped them out. Except for their descendants, the birds. It also discusses our current situation regarding the effects of climate change and what we are doing to exacerbate our own end. OK, we are speeding things up A LOT, and that's far from a good thing, but it's been coming for a while, and maybe we aren't the apex of life the way we think we are.

It is hard to imagine a better written or more thoroughly researched book on the Big five extinctions. Peter Brannen covers all sides of scientific debates (e.g., about Deccan traps and the extinction of the dinosaurs). And he includes a lot of detail—maybe too much detail. Even still, so much of what he covers is simply fascinating, from the planet’s first trees in the Devonian (now in NY, about an hour outside of Albany), to the importance of north-south coastline length for surviving climate change, to the geology of Gettysburg (“The gradual slope up Cemetery Ridge where Pickett’s charge met its grisly fate is shaped by the underlying magmatic plumbing of End-Triassic volcanism,” p. 156). Growing up I wanted to be a geologist, so maybe that is why I loved all the details. But even if you skim the details, you would still get a lot out of the book. Are concerns about a human-caused sixth extinction overblown? What lies ahead for earth in the next 100 years? How about in the next 800 million? Does the earth’s past offer insights into what is happening now and what will likely happen in the future? Brannen will answer all of these questions, and more. One more thing: read the footnotes.

70,0062364820,http://goodreads.com/user/show/80750585-claudia,3,"Great deal of information about the five major extinctions that have occurred on our amazing planet. Unfortunately, it is only geological records that are providing the tantalizing glimpses into the past and the further back in time, the smaller those glimpses are. Especially when you consider that the only life on the planet was microbial and basically gelatinous. There was nothing to preserve except in the most extraordinary circumstances. In fact, any fossil remnant or petrified bone is an example of profound luck.Anyway, back to the book - This took me quite a while to get through. The early chapters - dealing with the earliest extinctions - were far more theory since geological records of those times give only the most shadowy hints of what happened. And some theories could be based on happenings that actually occurred hundreds of thousands if not millions of years apart. Even the extinction of the dinosaurs which is blamed on an asteroid may have also been due to a massive volcanic eruption that buried India under 2 miles of lava near the same time. The planet's diverse species likely could not withstand both assaults.But life on Earth is very resilient and even if over half the planet's species go extinct in less than a million years (technically what an extinction event is), there are still more willing to fill in those now-empty niches.I must admit that a bit of knowledge in geology, climatology and paleontology would be helpful while reading this work since it will make some of the theories and concepts clearer. Perhaps the hardest part for the general reader to accept is the depth of time. We are lucky to know someone that has lived a hundred years. The U.S. gained it's independence 350 years ago. Rome, the eternal city, was founded over two thousand years ago. The Egyptians erected the Great Pyramid about 2500 years before that. So millions and billions of years - most would have difficulty even conceptualizing the notion.Of course, it had to end with the next expected mass extinction - whether it is due to carbon emissions driving up the temperatures and the acidifying of the oceans where various species are unable to adapt or the continents merging back into one with the center being a sere landscape with little to no water flowing or even the sun entering the last stages of it's own lifespan. So it may be within the next couple centuries . . . or 800 million years in the future.2019-187"

72,0062364820,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4162791-claudia-putnam,4,"Well, that was certainly exciting! After the rippling prose of Andrew Knoll's Life on a Younger Planet, and the astounded reverence of John McPhee's Basin and Range, Brannen's writing is a little too boppy and headlong for my taste. You can't just hurl yourself through 500 million years or so. It's kind of puppylike--I'm sure some people like that about him. Nevertheless. A lot to learn here. I did laugh out loud at the first 3 billion years of evolution so rapturously described by Knoll as the wellspring of life being portrayed by Brannen as ""sluggishy sucking up organic gunk in the disgusting seas of primordial earth."" It turns out there have been more than the 5 mass extinctions everybody (you didn't know? well, brush up) talks about, with us possibly about to trigger the 6th. Snowball Earth, a series of catastrophic glaciations in the middle of the early Slime Period (my term, but I doubt I'm the first to think it up), when complex nucleated bacteria were starting to take hold and were nearly annihilated, was likely the first. Then, as Brannen notes, the sluggish gunk suckers were pretty much wiped out when something called, no lie, penis worms, came along and started burrowing in the (shallow) ocean floors. This stirred up a lot of dirt and also changed the oxygen/carbon/nitrogen/methane ratios in the water and probably air. The atmosphere and sea still weren't too O2-heavy but it was enough to trigger the Cambrian Explosion of (relatively) complex animal life. Which wiped out the sluggy frondy stuff that had existed previously. Even though this is is not really something the book is concerned with, it sort of is, because shows how one species messes with the environment and everyone else dies. ""A sentiment exists--particularly among non-scientists--that the idea of humans seriously disrupting the planet on a geological scale is mere anthropocentric hubris. But this sentiment misunderstands the history of life. In the geological past, seemingly small innovations have reorganized the planet's chemistry, hurling it into drastic phase changes. Surely humans might be as significant as the filter feeding animals of the Cambrian Explosion.""Later it's pointed out that mass extinctions have occurred without the help of overfishing, overhunting, overgrazing, etc, etc. So, minus these two extinctions, we have 5 to discuss. Let's define what we mean by mass extinction: >75% of life on earth, sea and land, wiped out. That 75% figure is for the end-triassic, when the dinosaurs, the most successful species ever, bit the dust, so to speak. That extinction was the mildest of the 5. The worst was the end-Permian, about 252 million years ago, when around 96% of the planet died and the oceans went anoxic. Recovery period: 30 million years. No Netflix series featuring a hardy band of survivors for that one, guys. Brannen mentions that Doug Erwin, who wrote Extinction, which is next on my list, and which focuses on this event, might have consulted with Cormac McCarthy when he was writing The Road. Or perhaps the screenplay. He's not admitting to that. (What gets to me about the dinosaur event? Only two reptilian four-legged species survived. One of them was the leathernecked sea turtle. Endangered now. By us.)All these events have involved massive increases of carbon into the atmosphere via volcanism (yes, I know you think it was an asteroid with the dinosaurs, but there have been other cases of impacts of around the same size with no mass extinction...at the same time the dinosaur asteroid hit, half of India was erupting). One was very gradual. The other 4 were not. It turns out that it isn't so much about the amount of carbon but the rate at which it is added. At some point, it appears there is a tipping point. What that means is that there is a disruption in the food chain. This food chain thing is a web and it's affected in a chaotic way. At some point there is a critical disruption that can't be recovered from. Everything dies off fairly suddenly.Are we in the middle of an extinction event now? That is, are we penis worms? Or are we the equivalent of these massive volcanoes, bringing carbon out of the ground and spewing it into the air? Well, on the one hand, the amount of carbon we've put into the atmosphere is nowhere near equal, in volume, to what was seen during the Permian or Triassic events. On the other, the rate we're spewing is faster than anything ever recorded in geology. It's the rate that matters.And we're messing with our environment, penis-worm-like, in other ways. Converting wildland to farmland. Paradise to parking lot. Putting nitrogen into the ocean. Killing plankton. That plankton thing really is key. Bottom of the food chain thing--turns up time and time again as a Bad Sign. So do dead and dying reefs. So, are we? Well, if we are, it didn't take us long. Any future geologists, arising out of some future slime, or re-evolving from rat or insect, would look at the anthropocene, or the primacene, and maybe not even recognize us. There will be a layer of carbon, microplastics, steroids, nitrogen. A few primate fossils might survive, but maybe not even enough to know which humans were significant or responsible for microplastics, etc. The time layer between us and Lucy may not be geologically significant--they won't be able to tell which came first. They might think Neanderthals made the plastics. Probably not, but maybe. (This is me rambling on, not Brannen.) This extinction will be EXTREMELY mysterious unless an asteroid happens to hit right after, because we'll be gone, and our cities will erode away completely. There won't be any volcanism, unless coincidentally there is within the next 60,000 years. Since there will be so little trace of us, they won't know what happened this time. Well if we are in an extinction, says one of the scientists, I think it's Erwin, there's no way we're turning it back. It's not about carbon sinks, or stopping global warming. This is a horse that has way left the barn. So he says, no. I got the idea he says no because there's no point in thinking yes. I think another expert in these matters, Peter Ward, thinks yes. I think yes. The reason I think yes is that we're asking the question. I think we sense it. If we notice enough to ask, then yes. There's a whole field of psychology called eco-psych. It does a bunch of different things, but one aspect is address a growing sense of despair/depression over what's happening to the planet. Don't you feel it? Consider that orca carrying her dead baby all those days, over two weeks, as it rotted on her back. She and her pod were on a march. Back and forth, up and down the coast. Don't you think? They wanted us to see. They are starving and sick. Their young are dying. They're ancient, they're not in denial. They wanted us to know what they know. Back to the slime. Which, luckily, is the wellspring of life. Something interesting is bound to come of it. There's enough time before the supernova. "

The paragraphs went all over the place. It was as if the author took a scientific narrative, cut it up with scissors, made a collage, and then put emoji stickers all over it. I just could not follow it. And there was no chart or timeline of the eras to refer to, no organized visuals that would have made up for the word salad that was the text. Also, Brannen took what I thought were unscientific liberties with his fanciful adjectives and frivolous, ""fun"" descriptions. It is possible to write about science in a fun way (Mary Roach), but sadly, the fun here was just pointless and distracting. Very disappointing, for what should have been an utterly fascinating book (given the subject). DNF. Actually, CNF...could not finish."

Otherwise if you aren't interested in the subject or even nonfiction writing in truth than I would most definitely steer clear of this book since it isn't one that is for beginners. The author does a great job in actually breaking down the book into the different mass extinctions and giving the year that it has been recorded at. As a result the reader gets to be introduced into the timeframe, what may have been lurking around as the superstar(s) of the cast and then possible events that could have been triggers to these mass events. Besides this information there are also stories told about places where the rock record can be found for those events as well as the leaders of the fields and their belief and/or teaching to help clarify up the information being presented. At the same time there was a small collection of artwork and pictures of some of the briefest moments found in the book. I wish that I had known about them beforehand or even better that they were actually included in the middle of the book instead of way in the back as if they were tucked there as in second thought for they allowed the reader another glimpse into the information that was being read about.  As for what I didn't like was the fact that the book seemed so repetitive. Although the events that seemed to trigger the mass extinctions were almost similar to each other and some of their effects were also similar I didn't need to know repeatedly and repeatedly how we are so close to making these disasters almost upon us but not quite yet. As a result the last two chapters in the book were basically an expansion of all the information that the reader had been introduced as to what we are doing to not fix the problem, how the issues we are doing now will contribute to our own downfall, how there are two sides of the camp with some thinking that we are still good to go until the end arrives and how others aren't, etc. Once or twice would have been enough while if you had wanted to include those chapters than you should have saved the information to be used just in the chapters. All in all it was fun getting to know some more about the other organisms that have shared the spotlight of life and also the events that we cannot imagine that have come to life in their own majestic time under the old sun such as the traps, the evolution of plants and the super continents. Otherwise quite wordy and repetitive this book again is only for those who are quite dedicated to these fields of science and/or are interested in getting to know more about events that have been largely ignored by the general public over the last few decades."
77,0062364820,http://goodreads.com/user/show/53250130-easton-smith,4,"What a horror: the sixth extinction. To think that we, humans, have essentially recreated the sort of poisonous conditions that have, in the past, wiped out nearly every living being on this planet. What a relief: that if we do manage to wipe ourselves out, at least something will survive, and the world will repopulate with all kinds of beings we could never imagine. Those were my opposing moods throughout reading this decently-written popular science book. Geological time helps me to have perspective, which can be a salve (when thinking about how much longer the earth will live) or a knock on the head (when thinking about how our actions will ripple out for millions of years). Brannen does a good job of showing both of these angles, even if he does occasionally repeat himself. I did feel like every few pages he had to reiterate the central storyline of the book (but little did the crustaceans know, Armageddon was coming...). He also tended to present the science behind it all in a bit of a reductive way. He would explore a series of climatic and geological problems that might have occurred in history, and then usually reduce them all to CO2. While this surely helped drive home our current crisis, it did at times feel like he was shaving off a bunch of complexity. This is, perhaps, necessary in this kind of book, but I would have really appreciated a section in the beginning where he lays out his methodology. It would have helped me trust his streamlined conclusions a bit more. I also have some hesitations about the author's discussions of humanity's more recent history and our coming future. He is somewhat dismissive of Native American scholarship that suggests they did not extinct North American megafauna during pre-colonial times (I understand his objections, but it could have been more carefully written). But what bothered me the most was the way that he finishes off with a discussion with some futurist-technology-will-save-us-Elon-Musk-type guy who suggests that the real sad part of humans dying off is that we won't get to explore other planets. Brannen takes us directly from geological time to anthropocentricism so fast that its just jarring. Still, this is a great book. It's discussions of geological history are endlessly fascinating to me, someone who is not well versed in these things. A great companion book to N.K. Jemison's Broken Earth Trilogy. "
78,0062364820,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2129784-bonnie,4,"Most of us have no conception of the age of our planet, or how long it took for there to be any life at all. We tend to think of all the dinosaurs as living at the same time. It’s a shock when Brannen points out that Tyrannosaurus Rex is closer to us in time than it is to Stegosaurus.Brannen’s topic is the five previous major extinctions that have occurred on earth; we may be living through the sixth. Some took millions of years; others, like the extinction of the dinosaurs and virtually all life on earth, may have been instantaneous. Scientists are still trying to figure out exactly what happened. One of the pleasures of this book is learning about the unbelievable variety of animals that have lived on earth. Brannen provides vivid descriptions of the animals and their habitats. However, I found myself looking up the animals in order to get pictures. Toward the end of the book, he provides some illustrations, but the book could have used a lot more.I was a little irritated by his overwriting. Talking about the crocodiles that dominated the Triassic, he says, “This deposed royal family still hunts swamp margins and irritably moseys across gold courses…” Why irritably? Referring to the theory that an asteroid caused the extinction of the dinosaurs (and most of life on earth), Brannen says that the hadrosaurs, “settling down for a fitful sleep would nervously eye this strange new star…” Is there any reason to think that hadrosaurs would notice anything in the sky? Nor is his ascription of human attitudes limited to animals. Referring to the break-up of a supercontinent, he says that India “divorced” Gondwana and was “evidently unsentimental about this union.” Such anthropomorphism is cutesy and distracting.What are the implications of this history for us today? I’m not really sure. It’s possible that climate change will mean the end of the human species in 100 years or so – not close enough to affect me, but it will be horrible for my children and grandchildren. Or perhaps that won’t happen but in millions of years, the last animal on earth will die. That’s not so terrible, but the former is tragic."
79,0062364820,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5806439-ron,4,"This is an excellent survey of the five major extinction events that nearly wiped out all life on the planet. Though the style was a bit too gee-whiz for my taste, it did help lighten up what would be to some, a pretty grim story of asteroid strikes, vulcanism that makes Mt. St. Helens seem like a firecracker, and the deaths of gazillions. He does a great job of making the complex interplay of geology, biology, chemistry and--at least for one extinction event--astrophysics, accessible to the layperson. He managed to generate some mind benders, which is always appreciated. For instance, the planet we call earth existed for something like a billion years before complex life ever appeared, and that our time in existence is absolutely DWARFED by the reign of, say, the dinosaurs (and others). I knew all this, but he laid it out in a way that really made it sink in. There are plenty more factoids and anecdotes that make you stop reading for a moment and say WTF.The latter part of the book deals with the now and the future, with what some theorists say is a sixth mass extinction, already in progress, as well as other possible ways that our existence might end. Or continue. He did a good job presenting both sides of the Sixth Extinction debate, and never really got preachy about it. What did it leave me with? Well, we are certainly at a crossroads and have some very tough decisions ahead. Yes, that is an understatement...There was even a little philosophy thrown in about the significance (or lack of same), of human life to the planet and to existence as a whole. This was less effective for me, though with little wonder: how could you cover subjects in a single chapter that have kept thinkers busy for millennia? It has set the wheels turning in my own mind, which was probably the intent.It might strike some as depressing, to think we're kind of this mold that has spread across the globe in a really short time, and that species who could literally eat us for lunch ruled the globe for 160 *million* years and were wiped out nearly overnight. A subtext here, intentional or not, is that life--maybe not our life, but life-- is nothing if not persistent."
80,0062364820,http://goodreads.com/user/show/32091109-brian-turner,4,"Altogether, an interesting book about the worst mass extinction events in the fossil record, as well as en exploration of current climate change and future climate change possibilities.Written like a newspaper article, it peppers personal interludes and short interviews with information on changes in the geological past, which made for easy and accessible reading.Brannen does almost too good a job of describing how some of these scenarios might not just have played out, but may have also looked like in their aftermath. Probably the lasting image I'll take from this is the horrors of ocean acidification, especially on the scale seen at the worst-recorded extinction event at the end of the Permian period, aka, The Great Dying.Of course, this is pertinent to current climate change, and although the potential outcomes are clearly shown to be terrifying, it's also made clear that humanity still has a chance to avert the worst - time is still on our side, if we make the effort to act.However, a major flaw is that it is almost entirely focused on the role of the carbon-cycle. While the dangers of rising carbon-dioxide in the atmosphere are made clear time after time, it spends almost no time on the role of the sun on climate, and Milankovitch cycles get a brief single-sentence mention without even being named.Perhaps there is an argument that the carbon-cycle is the ultimate planetary thermostat, but it seems strange to focus so much on vulcanism and plate tectonics as major causes while ignoring variability in solar output itself, which is arguably a main driver.Even still, an interesting, engaging - and frightening - read.

I mean, Peter Brannen is writing about paleontology and climate change and the words just sing to you, make you see worlds that we actually know very little about and feel for ammonoids like there would be the cutest kittens, looking at you with big eyes and begging not to get extinct. As someone who wants to write himself someday, I really hate this guy. He is that good.That being said, The Ends of the World is a book about the major extinctions in Earth's history, their causes and how they relate to our present lives. It's a captivating read, evoking lost worlds and very carefully analyzing how they disappeared and why. There is humor, drama, interesting interviews with fascinating people. Dinosaurs? Puh-lease. This takes you back to the good old days of the Ediacaran and slowly brings you around our time and even speculates on what could come after us, the hubris filled species that, geologically speaking, was barely born yesterday - or a few seconds ago, depending on how you measure it - and has the chance to outshine all the other species that came, ruled and went.There is no way I can do it justice other than to say that I loved the book. In itself it's a summary of life on Earth so summarizing it myself would be pointless. I highly recommend it."
82,0062364820,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10586871-mark-dehate,4,"I really enjoyed this - I didn't have a lot of knowledge around past extinctions, other than some vague knowledge about an asteroid and the dinosaurs. I learned a ton about 'deep time' and all the various times that life on this planet was (nearly) wiped out. It's one of the things I love about books on space or, is it really gives me a totally different perspective on mankind's role in the universe. And, lots of nifty facts about how different a place everything was in the past.The book doesn't get super technical, which I really appreciate. I'm in it for the story, more than the nitty gritty detail. It only gets four stars because I really found the comparison to current climate change repetitive and frustrating. Nearly every extinction, the author points out how it's basically the same as what we're doing today. Yep, I get it, it's real bad, I totally agree. I just don't need to hear it over and over. The book's final chapter goes into more detail about what kind of havoc we're causing, and different ways that might end up - also fascinating to read.I listened to the audiobook version - it's not particularly notable, which I find to be excellent."
83,0062364820,http://goodreads.com/user/show/31309611-amber,4,"Lots to ponder in here, especially since I present talks on climate change and extinction daily as part of my work. Highly recommended if you want to understand how human-driven climate change is bringing on an extinction caused by too much carbon dioxide in the atmosphere, much like the ones that came before...but way faster. It also points out some differences and actions that mankind can take that will help. In the end, it ends relatively positively (for a book on mass extinction, anyway), with the author pointing out that we aren't yey even closer to the level of chaos and destruction at the end of the Permian extinction, for instance, and that it is not too late to turn it around...but he does point out that one of the perils of educating about climate change is that it can seem super overwhelming and inevitable, which has the opposite effect than intended: it leads to a fatalism and resignation that the end is coming so why bother. It's important to avoid making it seem hopeless, is his point, and I like it."
84,0062364820,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5938782-jim,4,"Did you know that there were 5 mass extinction events in Earth's geologic history? Maybe six, if you accept that we're in the middle of one right now. The jury's still out on that one. Unless you're keeping up with the technical journals and conferences, you can throw out what you think you know about mass extinctions from your old college geology classes, reading books that are more than 10 years old, or watching PBS or Discovery.The author's style reminds me a lot of John McPhee. He did a lot of research by going out in the field with geologists and amateur fossil hunters, as well as interviewing numerous paleontologists and other geologists. But he keeps it interesting, even for people who don't know geology.To have a mass extinction event, a lot of catastrophic events have to happen more or less at the same geologic time. The asteroid impact at the Cretaceous-Tertiary boundary (blamed for killing the dinosaurs) probably wasn't enough by itself. But there's evidence that the impact restarted & intensified massive flood lava flows on the other side of the planet. Changes in carbon dioxide concentrations in the atmosphere and dissolved in the oceans play a key role. That's tied in with ocean acidification. Starting to sound familiar?There's a lot of discussion in this book about climate change. What does it mean? How bad is it compared to the geologic past? Is there really anything that humans can do to reverse it? Read on & find out. This book will probably change your perspective, even if you're a geology major."
85,0062364820,http://goodreads.com/user/show/286888-ryn,4,"Successfully conveys a sense of scope for comparison of today's anthropocene extinction status to the K-T and other ""real"" mass extinction events. Hey, it turns out we've only killed off less than 1% of the species on the planet so far, and in The Great Dying it was more like 99%. So that's a resilient planet you've got there, so far.I'm more hopeful for the long-term (100,000 years+) survival of complex life in general than I was before reading this, though less so for that of mammals in particular. Reptiles and birds are going to have a good run, though. On the other hand, it does start to feel more certain that another 50 years of life in Massachusetts may not be far north enough to expect political or technological stability.On the rough timeline of 100-500,000 years for this interglacial, 800 million years for life on the planet, and 100 trillion years for potential life in the galaxy, that starts to seem both less and more important. There's plenty of time for future chances at civilization-building life to develop, so it's less relevant if we don't hack it, but also, we may actually be pretty close to an exoplanetary threshold in tech, so it'd be a shame if we shot ourselves in the foot this close to that inflection point."

I have always been fascinated by the age of the world, pre-anthropological history, etc. I was engrossed by his descriptions of the world 500 million, 200 million years ago and it illustrates the absurdly small scale of humankind's existence here. Here's a short cliff notes - it's all about climate change. Climate change has led to the demise of basically everything on earth for 500 million years, in one way or another. And here we go again. As a writer, Peter Brannen has a gift to make the death of algae interesting and extremely readable. However, his final chapter shows the outsized impact we have had in relation to this short time on earth, and how the next decades are critical, even getting into AI and cosmological settlement. It's beyond an ambitious scope at only 300 pages, covering 500 million years of history, that he executes beautifully for a lay audience at least. I wish I could force every religious person I know to read it."

The final chapters are devoted to what may be the Sixth Great Extinction but caused not just by natural forces but by humankind's hellbent destruction of habitat as well as striving to put aeons' worth of carbon back into the atmosphere. A sobering book which adequately explains the mechanisms that drove the previous extinctions and their relevance to events in the last millennia.

88,0062364820,http://goodreads.com/user/show/56646301-colin-ennis,5,"Fascinating review of major extinction events in the Earth's history. Brannen's attention to detail enabled a vivid depiction of each geological period, creating a kind of obituary for the former worlds of our planet. I especially enjoyed his discussion of the Ordovician and Permian extinctions; too often the dinosaurs (somewhat deservedly) capture the public attention, and so learning about these even more ancient planets was fascinating to me.I appreciated too that the book is essentially a covert analysis of the tenuous link between climate and life on this planet; virtually every extinction is caused by massive climate change. True, in some cases a supervolcano or asteroid might aid the process along, but the end result is still the same. Later chapters focussing on a potential Holocene extinction and the extinctions of the far-future (including all life itself) would make for a fascinating book in their own right.Brannen's writing is sobering and sweet, neither full of doom nor hope. A few strange turns of phrase (describing a group of scientists as autistic stands out as particularly unfortunate) do not wholly detract from some of the best science writing I've read in the last few years."

Things like that meteor was really bad for the dinosaurs, but that wasn't the only thing that was going on that wiped them out. Except for their descendants, the birds. It also discusses our current situation regarding the effects of climate change and what we are doing to exacerbate our own end. OK, we are speeding things up A LOT, and that's far from a good thing, but it's been coming for a while, and maybe we aren't the apex of life the way we think we are.

It is hard to imagine a better written or more thoroughly researched book on the Big five extinctions. Peter Brannen covers all sides of scientific debates (e.g., about Deccan traps and the extinction of the dinosaurs). And he includes a lot of detail—maybe too much detail. Even still, so much of what he covers is simply fascinating, from the planet’s first trees in the Devonian (now in NY, about an hour outside of Albany), to the importance of north-south coastline length for surviving climate change, to the geology of Gettysburg (“The gradual slope up Cemetery Ridge where Pickett’s charge met its grisly fate is shaped by the underlying magmatic plumbing of End-Triassic volcanism,” p. 156). Growing up I wanted to be a geologist, so maybe that is why I loved all the details. But even if you skim the details, you would still get a lot out of the book. Are concerns about a human-caused sixth extinction overblown? What lies ahead for earth in the next 100 years? How about in the next 800 million? Does the earth’s past offer insights into what is happening now and what will likely happen in the future? Brannen will answer all of these questions, and more. One more thing: read the footnotes.

100,0062364820,http://goodreads.com/user/show/80750585-claudia,3,"Great deal of information about the five major extinctions that have occurred on our amazing planet. Unfortunately, it is only geological records that are providing the tantalizing glimpses into the past and the further back in time, the smaller those glimpses are. Especially when you consider that the only life on the planet was microbial and basically gelatinous. There was nothing to preserve except in the most extraordinary circumstances. In fact, any fossil remnant or petrified bone is an example of profound luck.Anyway, back to the book - This took me quite a while to get through. The early chapters - dealing with the earliest extinctions - were far more theory since geological records of those times give only the most shadowy hints of what happened. And some theories could be based on happenings that actually occurred hundreds of thousands if not millions of years apart. Even the extinction of the dinosaurs which is blamed on an asteroid may have also been due to a massive volcanic eruption that buried India under 2 miles of lava near the same time. The planet's diverse species likely could not withstand both assaults.But life on Earth is very resilient and even if over half the planet's species go extinct in less than a million years (technically what an extinction event is), there are still more willing to fill in those now-empty niches.I must admit that a bit of knowledge in geology, climatology and paleontology would be helpful while reading this work since it will make some of the theories and concepts clearer. Perhaps the hardest part for the general reader to accept is the depth of time. We are lucky to know someone that has lived a hundred years. The U.S. gained it's independence 350 years ago. Rome, the eternal city, was founded over two thousand years ago. The Egyptians erected the Great Pyramid about 2500 years before that. So millions and billions of years - most would have difficulty even conceptualizing the notion.Of course, it had to end with the next expected mass extinction - whether it is due to carbon emissions driving up the temperatures and the acidifying of the oceans where various species are unable to adapt or the continents merging back into one with the center being a sere landscape with little to no water flowing or even the sun entering the last stages of it's own lifespan. So it may be within the next couple centuries . . . or 800 million years in the future.2019-187"

After the rippling prose of Andrew Knoll's Life on a Younger Planet, and the astounded reverence of John McPhee's Basin and Range, Brannen's writing is a little too boppy and headlong for my taste. You can't just hurl yourself through 500 million years or so. It's kind of puppylike--I'm sure some people like that about him. Nevertheless. A lot to learn here. I did laugh out loud at the first 3 billion years of evolution so rapturously described by Knoll as the wellspring of life being portrayed by Brannen as ""sluggishy sucking up organic gunk in the disgusting seas of primordial earth."" It turns out there have been more than the 5 mass extinctions everybody (you didn't know? well, brush up) talks about, with us possibly about to trigger the 6th. Snowball Earth, a series of catastrophic glaciations in the middle of the early Slime Period (my term, but I doubt I'm the first to think it up), when complex nucleated bacteria were starting to take hold and were nearly annihilated, was likely the first. Then, as Brannen notes, the sluggish gunk suckers were pretty much wiped out when something called, no lie, penis worms, came along and started burrowing in the (shallow) ocean floors. This stirred up a lot of dirt and also changed the oxygen/carbon/nitrogen/methane ratios in the water and probably air. The atmosphere and sea still weren't too O2-heavy but it was enough to trigger the Cambrian Explosion of (relatively) complex animal life. Which wiped out the sluggy frondy stuff that had existed previously. Even though this is is not really something the book is concerned with, it sort of is, because shows how one species messes with the environment and everyone else dies. ""A sentiment exists--particularly among non-scientists--that the idea of humans seriously disrupting the planet on a geological scale is mere anthropocentric hubris. But this sentiment misunderstands the history of life. In the geological past, seemingly small innovations have reorganized the planet's chemistry, hurling it into drastic phase changes. Surely humans might be as significant as the filter feeding animals of the Cambrian Explosion.""Later it's pointed out that mass extinctions have occurred without the help of overfishing, overhunting, overgrazing, etc, etc. So, minus these two extinctions, we have 5 to discuss. Let's define what we mean by mass extinction: >75% of life on earth, sea and land, wiped out. That 75% figure is for the end-triassic, when the dinosaurs, the most successful species ever, bit the dust, so to speak. That extinction was the mildest of the 5. The worst was the end-Permian, about 252 million years ago, when around 96% of the planet died and the oceans went anoxic. Recovery period: 30 million years. No Netflix series featuring a hardy band of survivors for that one, guys. Brannen mentions that Doug Erwin, who wrote Extinction, which is next on my list, and which focuses on this event, might have consulted with Cormac McCarthy when he was writing The Road. Or perhaps the screenplay. He's not admitting to that. (What gets to me about the dinosaur event? Only two reptilian four-legged species survived. One of them was the leathernecked sea turtle. Endangered now. By us.)All these events have involved massive increases of carbon into the atmosphere via volcanism (yes, I know you think it was an asteroid with the dinosaurs, but there have been other cases of impacts of around the same size with no mass extinction...at the same time the dinosaur asteroid hit, half of India was erupting). One was very gradual. The other 4 were not. It turns out that it isn't so much about the amount of carbon but the rate at which it is added. At some point, it appears there is a tipping point. What that means is that there is a disruption in the food chain. This food chain thing is a web and it's affected in a chaotic way. At some point there is a critical disruption that can't be recovered from. Everything dies off fairly suddenly.Are we in the middle of an extinction event now? That is, are we penis worms? Or are we the equivalent of these massive volcanoes, bringing carbon out of the ground and spewing it into the air? Well, on the one hand, the amount of carbon we've put into the atmosphere is nowhere near equal, in volume, to what was seen during the Permian or Triassic events. On the other, the rate we're spewing is faster than anything ever recorded in geology. It's the rate that matters.And we're messing with our environment, penis-worm-like, in other ways. Converting wildland to farmland. Paradise to parking lot. Putting nitrogen into the ocean. Killing plankton. That plankton thing really is key. Bottom of the food chain thing--turns up time and time again as a Bad Sign. So do dead and dying reefs. So, are we? Well, if we are, it didn't take us long. Any future geologists, arising out of some future slime, or re-evolving from rat or insect, would look at the anthropocene, or the primacene, and maybe not even recognize us. There will be a layer of carbon, microplastics, steroids, nitrogen. A few primate fossils might survive, but maybe not even enough to know which humans were significant or responsible for microplastics, etc. The time layer between us and Lucy may not be geologically significant--they won't be able to tell which came first. They might think Neanderthals made the plastics. Probably not, but maybe. (This is me rambling on, not Brannen.) This extinction will be EXTREMELY mysterious unless an asteroid happens to hit right after, because we'll be gone, and our cities will erode away completely. There won't be any volcanism, unless coincidentally there is within the next 60,000 years. Since there will be so little trace of us, they won't know what happened this time. Well if we are in an extinction, says one of the scientists, I think it's Erwin, there's no way we're turning it back. It's not about carbon sinks, or stopping global warming. This is a horse that has way left the barn. So he says, no. I got the idea he says no because there's no point in thinking yes. I think another expert in these matters, Peter Ward, thinks yes. I think yes. The reason I think yes is that we're asking the question. I think we sense it. If we notice enough to ask, then yes. There's a whole field of psychology called eco-psych. It does a bunch of different things, but one aspect is address a growing sense of despair/depression over what's happening to the planet. Don't you feel it? Consider that orca carrying her dead baby all those days, over two weeks, as it rotted on her back. She and her pod were on a march. Back and forth, up and down the coast. Don't you think? They wanted us to see. They are starving and sick. Their young are dying. They're ancient, they're not in denial. They wanted us to know what they know. Back to the slime. Which, luckily, is the wellspring of life. Something interesting is bound to come of it. There's enough time before the supernova. "

The paragraphs went all over the place. It was as if the author took a scientific narrative, cut it up with scissors, made a collage, and then put emoji stickers all over it. I just could not follow it. And there was no chart or timeline of the eras to refer to, no organized visuals that would have made up for the word salad that was the text. Also, Brannen took what I thought were unscientific liberties with his fanciful adjectives and frivolous, ""fun"" descriptions. It is possible to write about science in a fun way (Mary Roach), but sadly, the fun here was just pointless and distracting. Very disappointing, for what should have been an utterly fascinating book (given the subject). DNF. Actually, CNF...could not finish."
104,0062364820,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3424260-kerry,5,"Brannen is able to take complex events, break them down into understandable parts, and then describe how they interact; reconstructing the original event so that you understand it in all its complexity. He does this again and again, moving from the origin of the earth into the future constructing a view of earth's history that is breathtaking."

106,0062364820,http://goodreads.com/user/show/23785775-julia,3," This was one book that not only has a somewhat colorful and interesting cover but also a lengthy name that inspires those who may be quite interested in the subject. Otherwise if you aren't interested in the subject or even nonfiction writing in truth than I would most definitely steer clear of this book since it isn't one that is for beginners. The author does a great job in actually breaking down the book into the different mass extinctions and giving the year that it has been recorded at. As a result the reader gets to be introduced into the timeframe, what may have been lurking around as the superstar(s) of the cast and then possible events that could have been triggers to these mass events. Besides this information there are also stories told about places where the rock record can be found for those events as well as the leaders of the fields and their belief and/or teaching to help clarify up the information being presented. At the same time there was a small collection of artwork and pictures of some of the briefest moments found in the book. I wish that I had known about them beforehand or even better that they were actually included in the middle of the book instead of way in the back as if they were tucked there as in second thought for they allowed the reader another glimpse into the information that was being read about.  As for what I didn't like was the fact that the book seemed so repetitive. Although the events that seemed to trigger the mass extinctions were almost similar to each other and some of their effects were also similar I didn't need to know repeatedly and repeatedly how we are so close to making these disasters almost upon us but not quite yet. As a result the last two chapters in the book were basically an expansion of all the information that the reader had been introduced as to what we are doing to not fix the problem, how the issues we are doing now will contribute to our own downfall, how there are two sides of the camp with some thinking that we are still good to go until the end arrives and how others aren't, etc. Once or twice would have been enough while if you had wanted to include those chapters than you should have saved the information to be used just in the chapters. All in all it was fun getting to know some more about the other organisms that have shared the spotlight of life and also the events that we cannot imagine that have come to life in their own majestic time under the old sun such as the traps, the evolution of plants and the super continents. Otherwise quite wordy and repetitive this book again is only for those who are quite dedicated to these fields of science and/or are interested in getting to know more about events that have been largely ignored by the general public over the last few decades."
107,0062364820,http://goodreads.com/user/show/53250130-easton-smith,4,"What a horror: the sixth extinction. To think that we, humans, have essentially recreated the sort of poisonous conditions that have, in the past, wiped out nearly every living being on this planet. What a relief: that if we do manage to wipe ourselves out, at least something will survive, and the world will repopulate with all kinds of beings we could never imagine. Those were my opposing moods throughout reading this decently-written popular science book. Geological time helps me to have perspective, which can be a salve (when thinking about how much longer the earth will live) or a knock on the head (when thinking about how our actions will ripple out for millions of years). Brannen does a good job of showing both of these angles, even if he does occasionally repeat himself. I did feel like every few pages he had to reiterate the central storyline of the book (but little did the crustaceans know, Armageddon was coming...). He also tended to present the science behind it all in a bit of a reductive way. He would explore a series of climatic and geological problems that might have occurred in history, and then usually reduce them all to CO2. While this surely helped drive home our current crisis, it did at times feel like he was shaving off a bunch of complexity. This is, perhaps, necessary in this kind of book, but I would have really appreciated a section in the beginning where he lays out his methodology. It would have helped me trust his streamlined conclusions a bit more. I also have some hesitations about the author's discussions of humanity's more recent history and our coming future. He is somewhat dismissive of Native American scholarship that suggests they did not extinct North American megafauna during pre-colonial times (I understand his objections, but it could have been more carefully written). But what bothered me the most was the way that he finishes off with a discussion with some futurist-technology-will-save-us-Elon-Musk-type guy who suggests that the real sad part of humans dying off is that we won't get to explore other planets. Brannen takes us directly from geological time to anthropocentricism so fast that its just jarring. Still, this is a great book. It's discussions of geological history are endlessly fascinating to me, someone who is not well versed in these things. A great companion book to N.K. Jemison's Broken Earth Trilogy. "
108,0062364820,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2129784-bonnie,4,"Most of us have no conception of the age of our planet, or how long it took for there to be any life at all. We tend to think of all the dinosaurs as living at the same time. It’s a shock when Brannen points out that Tyrannosaurus Rex is closer to us in time than it is to Stegosaurus.Brannen’s topic is the five previous major extinctions that have occurred on earth; we may be living through the sixth. Some took millions of years; others, like the extinction of the dinosaurs and virtually all life on earth, may have been instantaneous. Scientists are still trying to figure out exactly what happened. One of the pleasures of this book is learning about the unbelievable variety of animals that have lived on earth. Brannen provides vivid descriptions of the animals and their habitats. However, I found myself looking up the animals in order to get pictures. Toward the end of the book, he provides some illustrations, but the book could have used a lot more.I was a little irritated by his overwriting. Talking about the crocodiles that dominated the Triassic, he says, “This deposed royal family still hunts swamp margins and irritably moseys across gold courses…” Why irritably? Referring to the theory that an asteroid caused the extinction of the dinosaurs (and most of life on earth), Brannen says that the hadrosaurs, “settling down for a fitful sleep would nervously eye this strange new star…” Is there any reason to think that hadrosaurs would notice anything in the sky? Nor is his ascription of human attitudes limited to animals. Referring to the break-up of a supercontinent, he says that India “divorced” Gondwana and was “evidently unsentimental about this union.” Such anthropomorphism is cutesy and distracting.What are the implications of this history for us today? I’m not really sure. It’s possible that climate change will mean the end of the human species in 100 years or so – not close enough to affect me, but it will be horrible for my children and grandchildren. Or perhaps that won’t happen but in millions of years, the last animal on earth will die. That’s not so terrible, but the former is tragic."
109,0062364820,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5806439-ron,4,"This is an excellent survey of the five major extinction events that nearly wiped out all life on the planet. Though the style was a bit too gee-whiz for my taste, it did help lighten up what would be to some, a pretty grim story of asteroid strikes, vulcanism that makes Mt. St. Helens seem like a firecracker, and the deaths of gazillions. He does a great job of making the complex interplay of geology, biology, chemistry and--at least for one extinction event--astrophysics, accessible to the layperson. He managed to generate some mind benders, which is always appreciated. For instance, the planet we call earth existed for something like a billion years before complex life ever appeared, and that our time in existence is absolutely DWARFED by the reign of, say, the dinosaurs (and others). I knew all this, but he laid it out in a way that really made it sink in. There are plenty more factoids and anecdotes that make you stop reading for a moment and say WTF.The latter part of the book deals with the now and the future, with what some theorists say is a sixth mass extinction, already in progress, as well as other possible ways that our existence might end. Or continue. He did a good job presenting both sides of the Sixth Extinction debate, and never really got preachy about it. What did it leave me with? Well, we are certainly at a crossroads and have some very tough decisions ahead. Yes, that is an understatement...There was even a little philosophy thrown in about the significance (or lack of same), of human life to the planet and to existence as a whole. This was less effective for me, though with little wonder: how could you cover subjects in a single chapter that have kept thinkers busy for millennia? It has set the wheels turning in my own mind, which was probably the intent.It might strike some as depressing, to think we're kind of this mold that has spread across the globe in a really short time, and that species who could literally eat us for lunch ruled the globe for 160 *million* years and were wiped out nearly overnight. A subtext here, intentional or not, is that life--maybe not our life, but life-- is nothing if not persistent."
110,0062364820,http://goodreads.com/user/show/32091109-brian-turner,4,"Altogether, an interesting book about the worst mass extinction events in the fossil record, as well as en exploration of current climate change and future climate change possibilities.Written like a newspaper article, it peppers personal interludes and short interviews with information on changes in the geological past, which made for easy and accessible reading.Brannen does almost too good a job of describing how some of these scenarios might not just have played out, but may have also looked like in their aftermath. Probably the lasting image I'll take from this is the horrors of ocean acidification, especially on the scale seen at the worst-recorded extinction event at the end of the Permian period, aka, The Great Dying.Of course, this is pertinent to current climate change, and although the potential outcomes are clearly shown to be terrifying, it's also made clear that humanity still has a chance to avert the worst - time is still on our side, if we make the effort to act.However, a major flaw is that it is almost entirely focused on the role of the carbon-cycle. While the dangers of rising carbon-dioxide in the atmosphere are made clear time after time, it spends almost no time on the role of the sun on climate, and Milankovitch cycles get a brief single-sentence mention without even being named.Perhaps there is an argument that the carbon-cycle is the ultimate planetary thermostat, but it seems strange to focus so much on vulcanism and plate tectonics as major causes while ignoring variability in solar output itself, which is arguably a main driver.Even still, an interesting, engaging - and frightening - read.

I mean, Peter Brannen is writing about paleontology and climate change and the words just sing to you, make you see worlds that we actually know very little about and feel for ammonoids like there would be the cutest kittens, looking at you with big eyes and begging not to get extinct. As someone who wants to write himself someday, I really hate this guy. He is that good.That being said, The Ends of the World is a book about the major extinctions in Earth's history, their causes and how they relate to our present lives. It's a captivating read, evoking lost worlds and very carefully analyzing how they disappeared and why. There is humor, drama, interesting interviews with fascinating people. Dinosaurs? Puh-lease. This takes you back to the good old days of the Ediacaran and slowly brings you around our time and even speculates on what could come after us, the hubris filled species that, geologically speaking, was barely born yesterday - or a few seconds ago, depending on how you measure it - and has the chance to outshine all the other species that came, ruled and went.There is no way I can do it justice other than to say that I loved the book. In itself it's a summary of life on Earth so summarizing it myself would be pointless. I highly recommend it."
112,0062364820,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10586871-mark-dehate,4,"I really enjoyed this - I didn't have a lot of knowledge around past extinctions, other than some vague knowledge about an asteroid and the dinosaurs. I learned a ton about 'deep time' and all the various times that life on this planet was (nearly) wiped out. It's one of the things I love about books on space or, is it really gives me a totally different perspective on mankind's role in the universe. And, lots of nifty facts about how different a place everything was in the past.The book doesn't get super technical, which I really appreciate. I'm in it for the story, more than the nitty gritty detail. It only gets four stars because I really found the comparison to current climate change repetitive and frustrating. Nearly every extinction, the author points out how it's basically the same as what we're doing today. Yep, I get it, it's real bad, I totally agree. I just don't need to hear it over and over. The book's final chapter goes into more detail about what kind of havoc we're causing, and different ways that might end up - also fascinating to read.I listened to the audiobook version - it's not particularly notable, which I find to be excellent."
113,0062364820,http://goodreads.com/user/show/31309611-amber,4,"Lots to ponder in here, especially since I present talks on climate change and extinction daily as part of my work. Highly recommended if you want to understand how human-driven climate change is bringing on an extinction caused by too much carbon dioxide in the atmosphere, much like the ones that came before...but way faster. It also points out some differences and actions that mankind can take that will help. In the end, it ends relatively positively (for a book on mass extinction, anyway), with the author pointing out that we aren't yey even closer to the level of chaos and destruction at the end of the Permian extinction, for instance, and that it is not too late to turn it around...but he does point out that one of the perils of educating about climate change is that it can seem super overwhelming and inevitable, which has the opposite effect than intended: it leads to a fatalism and resignation that the end is coming so why bother. It's important to avoid making it seem hopeless, is his point, and I like it."

Maybe six, if you accept that we're in the middle of one right now. The jury's still out on that one. Unless you're keeping up with the technical journals and conferences, you can throw out what you think you know about mass extinctions from your old college geology classes, reading books that are more than 10 years old, or watching PBS or Discovery.The author's style reminds me a lot of John McPhee. He did a lot of research by going out in the field with geologists and amateur fossil hunters, as well as interviewing numerous paleontologists and other geologists. But he keeps it interesting, even for people who don't know geology.To have a mass extinction event, a lot of catastrophic events have to happen more or less at the same geologic time. The asteroid impact at the Cretaceous-Tertiary boundary (blamed for killing the dinosaurs) probably wasn't enough by itself. But there's evidence that the impact restarted & intensified massive flood lava flows on the other side of the planet. Changes in carbon dioxide concentrations in the atmosphere and dissolved in the oceans play a key role. That's tied in with ocean acidification. Starting to sound familiar?There's a lot of discussion in this book about climate change. What does it mean? How bad is it compared to the geologic past? Is there really anything that humans can do to reverse it? Read on & find out. This book will probably change your perspective, even if you're a geology major."
115,0062364820,http://goodreads.com/user/show/286888-ryn,4,"Successfully conveys a sense of scope for comparison of today's anthropocene extinction status to the K-T and other ""real"" mass extinction events. Hey, it turns out we've only killed off less than 1% of the species on the planet so far, and in The Great Dying it was more like 99%. So that's a resilient planet you've got there, so far.I'm more hopeful for the long-term (100,000 years+) survival of complex life in general than I was before reading this, though less so for that of mammals in particular. Reptiles and birds are going to have a good run, though. On the other hand, it does start to feel more certain that another 50 years of life in Massachusetts may not be far north enough to expect political or technological stability.On the rough timeline of 100-500,000 years for this interglacial, 800 million years for life on the planet, and 100 trillion years for potential life in the galaxy, that starts to seem both less and more important. There's plenty of time for future chances at civilization-building life to develop, so it's less relevant if we don't hack it, but also, we may actually be pretty close to an exoplanetary threshold in tech, so it'd be a shame if we shot ourselves in the foot this close to that inflection point."

I have always been fascinated by the age of the world, pre-anthropological history, etc. I was engrossed by his descriptions of the world 500 million, 200 million years ago and it illustrates the absurdly small scale of humankind's existence here. Here's a short cliff notes - it's all about climate change. Climate change has led to the demise of basically everything on earth for 500 million years, in one way or another. And here we go again. As a writer, Peter Brannen has a gift to make the death of algae interesting and extremely readable. However, his final chapter shows the outsized impact we have had in relation to this short time on earth, and how the next decades are critical, even getting into AI and cosmological settlement. It's beyond an ambitious scope at only 300 pages, covering 500 million years of history, that he executes beautifully for a lay audience at least. I wish I could force every religious person I know to read it."

The final chapters are devoted to what may be the Sixth Great Extinction but caused not just by natural forces but by humankind's hellbent destruction of habitat as well as striving to put aeons' worth of carbon back into the atmosphere. A sobering book which adequately explains the mechanisms that drove the previous extinctions and their relevance to events in the last millennia.

118,0062364820,http://goodreads.com/user/show/56646301-colin-ennis,5,"Fascinating review of major extinction events in the Earth's history. Brannen's attention to detail enabled a vivid depiction of each geological period, creating a kind of obituary for the former worlds of our planet. I especially enjoyed his discussion of the Ordovician and Permian extinctions; too often the dinosaurs (somewhat deservedly) capture the public attention, and so learning about these even more ancient planets was fascinating to me.I appreciated too that the book is essentially a covert analysis of the tenuous link between climate and life on this planet; virtually every extinction is caused by massive climate change. True, in some cases a supervolcano or asteroid might aid the process along, but the end result is still the same. Later chapters focussing on a potential Holocene extinction and the extinctions of the far-future (including all life itself) would make for a fascinating book in their own right.Brannen's writing is sobering and sweet, neither full of doom nor hope. A few strange turns of phrase (describing a group of scientists as autistic stands out as particularly unfortunate) do not wholly detract from some of the best science writing I've read in the last few years."

Things like that meteor was really bad for the dinosaurs, but that wasn't the only thing that was going on that wiped them out. Except for their descendants, the birds. It also discusses our current situation regarding the effects of climate change and what we are doing to exacerbate our own end. OK, we are speeding things up A LOT, and that's far from a good thing, but it's been coming for a while, and maybe we aren't the apex of life the way we think we are.

It is hard to imagine a better written or more thoroughly researched book on the Big five extinctions. Peter Brannen covers all sides of scientific debates (e.g., about Deccan traps and the extinction of the dinosaurs). And he includes a lot of detail—maybe too much detail. Even still, so much of what he covers is simply fascinating, from the planet’s first trees in the Devonian (now in NY, about an hour outside of Albany), to the importance of north-south coastline length for surviving climate change, to the geology of Gettysburg (“The gradual slope up Cemetery Ridge where Pickett’s charge met its grisly fate is shaped by the underlying magmatic plumbing of End-Triassic volcanism,” p. 156). Growing up I wanted to be a geologist, so maybe that is why I loved all the details. But even if you skim the details, you would still get a lot out of the book. Are concerns about a human-caused sixth extinction overblown? What lies ahead for earth in the next 100 years? How about in the next 800 million? Does the earth’s past offer insights into what is happening now and what will likely happen in the future? Brannen will answer all of these questions, and more. One more thing: read the footnotes.

The Palisades Sill is not a basalt, it is a diabase sill, making it an intrusive igneous rock, which crystallizes in place and was never at the surface as the word basalt implies. Yes it crystallized from a basaltic magma but not at the surface. I’m very surprised that the geologists he spoke to did not correct him on this. Not sure I can believe anything else in the book. "
130,0062364820,http://goodreads.com/user/show/80750585-claudia,3,"Great deal of information about the five major extinctions that have occurred on our amazing planet. Unfortunately, it is only geological records that are providing the tantalizing glimpses into the past and the further back in time, the smaller those glimpses are. Especially when you consider that the only life on the planet was microbial and basically gelatinous. There was nothing to preserve except in the most extraordinary circumstances. In fact, any fossil remnant or petrified bone is an example of profound luck.Anyway, back to the book - This took me quite a while to get through. The early chapters - dealing with the earliest extinctions - were far more theory since geological records of those times give only the most shadowy hints of what happened. And some theories could be based on happenings that actually occurred hundreds of thousands if not millions of years apart. Even the extinction of the dinosaurs which is blamed on an asteroid may have also been due to a massive volcanic eruption that buried India under 2 miles of lava near the same time. The planet's diverse species likely could not withstand both assaults.But life on Earth is very resilient and even if over half the planet's species go extinct in less than a million years (technically what an extinction event is), there are still more willing to fill in those now-empty niches.I must admit that a bit of knowledge in geology, climatology and paleontology would be helpful while reading this work since it will make some of the theories and concepts clearer. Perhaps the hardest part for the general reader to accept is the depth of time. We are lucky to know someone that has lived a hundred years. The U.S. gained it's independence 350 years ago. Rome, the eternal city, was founded over two thousand years ago. The Egyptians erected the Great Pyramid about 2500 years before that. So millions and billions of years - most would have difficulty even conceptualizing the notion.Of course, it had to end with the next expected mass extinction - whether it is due to carbon emissions driving up the temperatures and the acidifying of the oceans where various species are unable to adapt or the continents merging back into one with the center being a sere landscape with little to no water flowing or even the sun entering the last stages of it's own lifespan. So it may be within the next couple centuries . . . or 800 million years in the future.2019-187"

132,0062364820,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4162791-claudia-putnam,4,"Well, that was certainly exciting! After the rippling prose of Andrew Knoll's Life on a Younger Planet, and the astounded reverence of John McPhee's Basin and Range, Brannen's writing is a little too boppy and headlong for my taste. You can't just hurl yourself through 500 million years or so. It's kind of puppylike--I'm sure some people like that about him. Nevertheless. A lot to learn here. I did laugh out loud at the first 3 billion years of evolution so rapturously described by Knoll as the wellspring of life being portrayed by Brannen as ""sluggishy sucking up organic gunk in the disgusting seas of primordial earth."" It turns out there have been more than the 5 mass extinctions everybody (you didn't know? well, brush up) talks about, with us possibly about to trigger the 6th. Snowball Earth, a series of catastrophic glaciations in the middle of the early Slime Period (my term, but I doubt I'm the first to think it up), when complex nucleated bacteria were starting to take hold and were nearly annihilated, was likely the first. Then, as Brannen notes, the sluggish gunk suckers were pretty much wiped out when something called, no lie, penis worms, came along and started burrowing in the (shallow) ocean floors. This stirred up a lot of dirt and also changed the oxygen/carbon/nitrogen/methane ratios in the water and probably air. The atmosphere and sea still weren't too O2-heavy but it was enough to trigger the Cambrian Explosion of (relatively) complex animal life. Which wiped out the sluggy frondy stuff that had existed previously. Even though this is is not really something the book is concerned with, it sort of is, because shows how one species messes with the environment and everyone else dies. ""A sentiment exists--particularly among non-scientists--that the idea of humans seriously disrupting the planet on a geological scale is mere anthropocentric hubris. But this sentiment misunderstands the history of life. In the geological past, seemingly small innovations have reorganized the planet's chemistry, hurling it into drastic phase changes. Surely humans might be as significant as the filter feeding animals of the Cambrian Explosion.""Later it's pointed out that mass extinctions have occurred without the help of overfishing, overhunting, overgrazing, etc, etc. So, minus these two extinctions, we have 5 to discuss. Let's define what we mean by mass extinction: >75% of life on earth, sea and land, wiped out. That 75% figure is for the end-triassic, when the dinosaurs, the most successful species ever, bit the dust, so to speak. That extinction was the mildest of the 5. The worst was the end-Permian, about 252 million years ago, when around 96% of the planet died and the oceans went anoxic. Recovery period: 30 million years. No Netflix series featuring a hardy band of survivors for that one, guys. Brannen mentions that Doug Erwin, who wrote Extinction, which is next on my list, and which focuses on this event, might have consulted with Cormac McCarthy when he was writing The Road. Or perhaps the screenplay. He's not admitting to that. (What gets to me about the dinosaur event? Only two reptilian four-legged species survived. One of them was the leathernecked sea turtle. Endangered now. By us.)All these events have involved massive increases of carbon into the atmosphere via volcanism (yes, I know you think it was an asteroid with the dinosaurs, but there have been other cases of impacts of around the same size with no mass extinction...at the same time the dinosaur asteroid hit, half of India was erupting). One was very gradual. The other 4 were not. It turns out that it isn't so much about the amount of carbon but the rate at which it is added. At some point, it appears there is a tipping point. What that means is that there is a disruption in the food chain. This food chain thing is a web and it's affected in a chaotic way. At some point there is a critical disruption that can't be recovered from. Everything dies off fairly suddenly.Are we in the middle of an extinction event now? That is, are we penis worms? Or are we the equivalent of these massive volcanoes, bringing carbon out of the ground and spewing it into the air? Well, on the one hand, the amount of carbon we've put into the atmosphere is nowhere near equal, in volume, to what was seen during the Permian or Triassic events. On the other, the rate we're spewing is faster than anything ever recorded in geology. It's the rate that matters.And we're messing with our environment, penis-worm-like, in other ways. Converting wildland to farmland. Paradise to parking lot. Putting nitrogen into the ocean. Killing plankton. That plankton thing really is key. Bottom of the food chain thing--turns up time and time again as a Bad Sign. So do dead and dying reefs. So, are we? Well, if we are, it didn't take us long. Any future geologists, arising out of some future slime, or re-evolving from rat or insect, would look at the anthropocene, or the primacene, and maybe not even recognize us. There will be a layer of carbon, microplastics, steroids, nitrogen. A few primate fossils might survive, but maybe not even enough to know which humans were significant or responsible for microplastics, etc. The time layer between us and Lucy may not be geologically significant--they won't be able to tell which came first. They might think Neanderthals made the plastics. Probably not, but maybe. (This is me rambling on, not Brannen.) This extinction will be EXTREMELY mysterious unless an asteroid happens to hit right after, because we'll be gone, and our cities will erode away completely. There won't be any volcanism, unless coincidentally there is within the next 60,000 years. Since there will be so little trace of us, they won't know what happened this time. Well if we are in an extinction, says one of the scientists, I think it's Erwin, there's no way we're turning it back. It's not about carbon sinks, or stopping global warming. This is a horse that has way left the barn. So he says, no. I got the idea he says no because there's no point in thinking yes. I think another expert in these matters, Peter Ward, thinks yes. I think yes. The reason I think yes is that we're asking the question. I think we sense it. If we notice enough to ask, then yes. There's a whole field of psychology called eco-psych. It does a bunch of different things, but one aspect is address a growing sense of despair/depression over what's happening to the planet. Don't you feel it? Consider that orca carrying her dead baby all those days, over two weeks, as it rotted on her back. She and her pod were on a march. Back and forth, up and down the coast. Don't you think? They wanted us to see. They are starving and sick. Their young are dying. They're ancient, they're not in denial. They wanted us to know what they know. Back to the slime. Which, luckily, is the wellspring of life. Something interesting is bound to come of it. There's enough time before the supernova. "
133,0062364820,http://goodreads.com/user/show/52174518-rebecca,1,"I was so looking forward to this book! But I found it almost unreadable. There was no order to anything. The paragraphs went all over the place. It was as if the author took a scientific narrative, cut it up with scissors, made a collage, and then put emoji stickers all over it. I just could not follow it. And there was no chart or timeline of the eras to refer to, no organized visuals that would have made up for the word salad that was the text. Also, Brannen took what I thought were unscientific liberties with his fanciful adjectives and frivolous, ""fun"" descriptions. It is possible to write about science in a fun way (Mary Roach), but sadly, the fun here was just pointless and distracting. Very disappointing, for what should have been an utterly fascinating book (given the subject). DNF. Actually, CNF...could not finish."
134,0062364820,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3424260-kerry,5,"Brannen is able to take complex events, break them down into understandable parts, and then describe how they interact; reconstructing the original event so that you understand it in all its complexity. He does this again and again, moving from the origin of the earth into the future constructing a view of earth's history that is breathtaking."

136,0062364820,http://goodreads.com/user/show/23785775-julia,3," This was one book that not only has a somewhat colorful and interesting cover but also a lengthy name that inspires those who may be quite interested in the subject. Otherwise if you aren't interested in the subject or even nonfiction writing in truth than I would most definitely steer clear of this book since it isn't one that is for beginners. The author does a great job in actually breaking down the book into the different mass extinctions and giving the year that it has been recorded at. As a result the reader gets to be introduced into the timeframe, what may have been lurking around as the superstar(s) of the cast and then possible events that could have been triggers to these mass events. Besides this information there are also stories told about places where the rock record can be found for those events as well as the leaders of the fields and their belief and/or teaching to help clarify up the information being presented. At the same time there was a small collection of artwork and pictures of some of the briefest moments found in the book. I wish that I had known about them beforehand or even better that they were actually included in the middle of the book instead of way in the back as if they were tucked there as in second thought for they allowed the reader another glimpse into the information that was being read about.  As for what I didn't like was the fact that the book seemed so repetitive. Although the events that seemed to trigger the mass extinctions were almost similar to each other and some of their effects were also similar I didn't need to know repeatedly and repeatedly how we are so close to making these disasters almost upon us but not quite yet. As a result the last two chapters in the book were basically an expansion of all the information that the reader had been introduced as to what we are doing to not fix the problem, how the issues we are doing now will contribute to our own downfall, how there are two sides of the camp with some thinking that we are still good to go until the end arrives and how others aren't, etc. Once or twice would have been enough while if you had wanted to include those chapters than you should have saved the information to be used just in the chapters. All in all it was fun getting to know some more about the other organisms that have shared the spotlight of life and also the events that we cannot imagine that have come to life in their own majestic time under the old sun such as the traps, the evolution of plants and the super continents. Otherwise quite wordy and repetitive this book again is only for those who are quite dedicated to these fields of science and/or are interested in getting to know more about events that have been largely ignored by the general public over the last few decades."
137,0062364820,http://goodreads.com/user/show/53250130-easton-smith,4,"What a horror: the sixth extinction. To think that we, humans, have essentially recreated the sort of poisonous conditions that have, in the past, wiped out nearly every living being on this planet. What a relief: that if we do manage to wipe ourselves out, at least something will survive, and the world will repopulate with all kinds of beings we could never imagine. Those were my opposing moods throughout reading this decently-written popular science book. Geological time helps me to have perspective, which can be a salve (when thinking about how much longer the earth will live) or a knock on the head (when thinking about how our actions will ripple out for millions of years). Brannen does a good job of showing both of these angles, even if he does occasionally repeat himself. I did feel like every few pages he had to reiterate the central storyline of the book (but little did the crustaceans know, Armageddon was coming...). He also tended to present the science behind it all in a bit of a reductive way. He would explore a series of climatic and geological problems that might have occurred in history, and then usually reduce them all to CO2. While this surely helped drive home our current crisis, it did at times feel like he was shaving off a bunch of complexity. This is, perhaps, necessary in this kind of book, but I would have really appreciated a section in the beginning where he lays out his methodology. It would have helped me trust his streamlined conclusions a bit more. I also have some hesitations about the author's discussions of humanity's more recent history and our coming future. He is somewhat dismissive of Native American scholarship that suggests they did not extinct North American megafauna during pre-colonial times (I understand his objections, but it could have been more carefully written). But what bothered me the most was the way that he finishes off with a discussion with some futurist-technology-will-save-us-Elon-Musk-type guy who suggests that the real sad part of humans dying off is that we won't get to explore other planets. Brannen takes us directly from geological time to anthropocentricism so fast that its just jarring. Still, this is a great book. It's discussions of geological history are endlessly fascinating to me, someone who is not well versed in these things. A great companion book to N.K. Jemison's Broken Earth Trilogy. "
138,0062364820,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2129784-bonnie,4,"Most of us have no conception of the age of our planet, or how long it took for there to be any life at all. We tend to think of all the dinosaurs as living at the same time. It’s a shock when Brannen points out that Tyrannosaurus Rex is closer to us in time than it is to Stegosaurus.Brannen’s topic is the five previous major extinctions that have occurred on earth; we may be living through the sixth. Some took millions of years; others, like the extinction of the dinosaurs and virtually all life on earth, may have been instantaneous. Scientists are still trying to figure out exactly what happened. One of the pleasures of this book is learning about the unbelievable variety of animals that have lived on earth. Brannen provides vivid descriptions of the animals and their habitats. However, I found myself looking up the animals in order to get pictures. Toward the end of the book, he provides some illustrations, but the book could have used a lot more.I was a little irritated by his overwriting. Talking about the crocodiles that dominated the Triassic, he says, “This deposed royal family still hunts swamp margins and irritably moseys across gold courses…” Why irritably? Referring to the theory that an asteroid caused the extinction of the dinosaurs (and most of life on earth), Brannen says that the hadrosaurs, “settling down for a fitful sleep would nervously eye this strange new star…” Is there any reason to think that hadrosaurs would notice anything in the sky? Nor is his ascription of human attitudes limited to animals. Referring to the break-up of a supercontinent, he says that India “divorced” Gondwana and was “evidently unsentimental about this union.” Such anthropomorphism is cutesy and distracting.What are the implications of this history for us today? I’m not really sure. It’s possible that climate change will mean the end of the human species in 100 years or so – not close enough to affect me, but it will be horrible for my children and grandchildren. Or perhaps that won’t happen but in millions of years, the last animal on earth will die. That’s not so terrible, but the former is tragic."
139,0062364820,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5806439-ron,4,"This is an excellent survey of the five major extinction events that nearly wiped out all life on the planet. Though the style was a bit too gee-whiz for my taste, it did help lighten up what would be to some, a pretty grim story of asteroid strikes, vulcanism that makes Mt. St. Helens seem like a firecracker, and the deaths of gazillions. He does a great job of making the complex interplay of geology, biology, chemistry and--at least for one extinction event--astrophysics, accessible to the layperson. He managed to generate some mind benders, which is always appreciated. For instance, the planet we call earth existed for something like a billion years before complex life ever appeared, and that our time in existence is absolutely DWARFED by the reign of, say, the dinosaurs (and others). I knew all this, but he laid it out in a way that really made it sink in. There are plenty more factoids and anecdotes that make you stop reading for a moment and say WTF.The latter part of the book deals with the now and the future, with what some theorists say is a sixth mass extinction, already in progress, as well as other possible ways that our existence might end. Or continue. He did a good job presenting both sides of the Sixth Extinction debate, and never really got preachy about it. What did it leave me with? Well, we are certainly at a crossroads and have some very tough decisions ahead. Yes, that is an understatement...There was even a little philosophy thrown in about the significance (or lack of same), of human life to the planet and to existence as a whole. This was less effective for me, though with little wonder: how could you cover subjects in a single chapter that have kept thinkers busy for millennia? It has set the wheels turning in my own mind, which was probably the intent.It might strike some as depressing, to think we're kind of this mold that has spread across the globe in a really short time, and that species who could literally eat us for lunch ruled the globe for 160 *million* years and were wiped out nearly overnight. A subtext here, intentional or not, is that life--maybe not our life, but life-- is nothing if not persistent."
140,0062364820,http://goodreads.com/user/show/32091109-brian-turner,4,"Altogether, an interesting book about the worst mass extinction events in the fossil record, as well as en exploration of current climate change and future climate change possibilities.Written like a newspaper article, it peppers personal interludes and short interviews with information on changes in the geological past, which made for easy and accessible reading.Brannen does almost too good a job of describing how some of these scenarios might not just have played out, but may have also looked like in their aftermath. Probably the lasting image I'll take from this is the horrors of ocean acidification, especially on the scale seen at the worst-recorded extinction event at the end of the Permian period, aka, The Great Dying.Of course, this is pertinent to current climate change, and although the potential outcomes are clearly shown to be terrifying, it's also made clear that humanity still has a chance to avert the worst - time is still on our side, if we make the effort to act.However, a major flaw is that it is almost entirely focused on the role of the carbon-cycle. While the dangers of rising carbon-dioxide in the atmosphere are made clear time after time, it spends almost no time on the role of the sun on climate, and Milankovitch cycles get a brief single-sentence mention without even being named.Perhaps there is an argument that the carbon-cycle is the ultimate planetary thermostat, but it seems strange to focus so much on vulcanism and plate tectonics as major causes while ignoring variability in solar output itself, which is arguably a main driver.Even still, an interesting, engaging - and frightening - read.

I mean, Peter Brannen is writing about paleontology and climate change and the words just sing to you, make you see worlds that we actually know very little about and feel for ammonoids like there would be the cutest kittens, looking at you with big eyes and begging not to get extinct. As someone who wants to write himself someday, I really hate this guy. He is that good.That being said, The Ends of the World is a book about the major extinctions in Earth's history, their causes and how they relate to our present lives. It's a captivating read, evoking lost worlds and very carefully analyzing how they disappeared and why. There is humor, drama, interesting interviews with fascinating people. Dinosaurs? Puh-lease. This takes you back to the good old days of the Ediacaran and slowly brings you around our time and even speculates on what could come after us, the hubris filled species that, geologically speaking, was barely born yesterday - or a few seconds ago, depending on how you measure it - and has the chance to outshine all the other species that came, ruled and went.There is no way I can do it justice other than to say that I loved the book. In itself it's a summary of life on Earth so summarizing it myself would be pointless. I highly recommend it."

I learned a ton about 'deep time' and all the various times that life on this planet was (nearly) wiped out. It's one of the things I love about books on space or, is it really gives me a totally different perspective on mankind's role in the universe. And, lots of nifty facts about how different a place everything was in the past.The book doesn't get super technical, which I really appreciate. I'm in it for the story, more than the nitty gritty detail. It only gets four stars because I really found the comparison to current climate change repetitive and frustrating. Nearly every extinction, the author points out how it's basically the same as what we're doing today. Yep, I get it, it's real bad, I totally agree. I just don't need to hear it over and over. The book's final chapter goes into more detail about what kind of havoc we're causing, and different ways that might end up - also fascinating to read.I listened to the audiobook version - it's not particularly notable, which I find to be excellent."
143,0062364820,http://goodreads.com/user/show/31309611-amber,4,"Lots to ponder in here, especially since I present talks on climate change and extinction daily as part of my work. Highly recommended if you want to understand how human-driven climate change is bringing on an extinction caused by too much carbon dioxide in the atmosphere, much like the ones that came before...but way faster. It also points out some differences and actions that mankind can take that will help. In the end, it ends relatively positively (for a book on mass extinction, anyway), with the author pointing out that we aren't yey even closer to the level of chaos and destruction at the end of the Permian extinction, for instance, and that it is not too late to turn it around...but he does point out that one of the perils of educating about climate change is that it can seem super overwhelming and inevitable, which has the opposite effect than intended: it leads to a fatalism and resignation that the end is coming so why bother. It's important to avoid making it seem hopeless, is his point, and I like it."

Maybe six, if you accept that we're in the middle of one right now. The jury's still out on that one. Unless you're keeping up with the technical journals and conferences, you can throw out what you think you know about mass extinctions from your old college geology classes, reading books that are more than 10 years old, or watching PBS or Discovery.The author's style reminds me a lot of John McPhee. He did a lot of research by going out in the field with geologists and amateur fossil hunters, as well as interviewing numerous paleontologists and other geologists. But he keeps it interesting, even for people who don't know geology.To have a mass extinction event, a lot of catastrophic events have to happen more or less at the same geologic time. The asteroid impact at the Cretaceous-Tertiary boundary (blamed for killing the dinosaurs) probably wasn't enough by itself. But there's evidence that the impact restarted & intensified massive flood lava flows on the other side of the planet. Changes in carbon dioxide concentrations in the atmosphere and dissolved in the oceans play a key role. That's tied in with ocean acidification. Starting to sound familiar?There's a lot of discussion in this book about climate change. What does it mean? How bad is it compared to the geologic past? Is there really anything that humans can do to reverse it? Read on & find out. This book will probably change your perspective, even if you're a geology major."
145,0062364820,http://goodreads.com/user/show/286888-ryn,4,"Successfully conveys a sense of scope for comparison of today's anthropocene extinction status to the K-T and other ""real"" mass extinction events. Hey, it turns out we've only killed off less than 1% of the species on the planet so far, and in The Great Dying it was more like 99%. So that's a resilient planet you've got there, so far.I'm more hopeful for the long-term (100,000 years+) survival of complex life in general than I was before reading this, though less so for that of mammals in particular. Reptiles and birds are going to have a good run, though. On the other hand, it does start to feel more certain that another 50 years of life in Massachusetts may not be far north enough to expect political or technological stability.On the rough timeline of 100-500,000 years for this interglacial, 800 million years for life on the planet, and 100 trillion years for potential life in the galaxy, that starts to seem both less and more important. There's plenty of time for future chances at civilization-building life to develop, so it's less relevant if we don't hack it, but also, we may actually be pretty close to an exoplanetary threshold in tech, so it'd be a shame if we shot ourselves in the foot this close to that inflection point."

I have always been fascinated by the age of the world, pre-anthropological history, etc. I was engrossed by his descriptions of the world 500 million, 200 million years ago and it illustrates the absurdly small scale of humankind's existence here. Here's a short cliff notes - it's all about climate change. Climate change has led to the demise of basically everything on earth for 500 million years, in one way or another. And here we go again. As a writer, Peter Brannen has a gift to make the death of algae interesting and extremely readable. However, his final chapter shows the outsized impact we have had in relation to this short time on earth, and how the next decades are critical, even getting into AI and cosmological settlement. It's beyond an ambitious scope at only 300 pages, covering 500 million years of history, that he executes beautifully for a lay audience at least. I wish I could force every religious person I know to read it."

The final chapters are devoted to what may be the Sixth Great Extinction but caused not just by natural forces but by humankind's hellbent destruction of habitat as well as striving to put aeons' worth of carbon back into the atmosphere. A sobering book which adequately explains the mechanisms that drove the previous extinctions and their relevance to events in the last millennia.

148,0062364820,http://goodreads.com/user/show/56646301-colin-ennis,5,"Fascinating review of major extinction events in the Earth's history. Brannen's attention to detail enabled a vivid depiction of each geological period, creating a kind of obituary for the former worlds of our planet. I especially enjoyed his discussion of the Ordovician and Permian extinctions; too often the dinosaurs (somewhat deservedly) capture the public attention, and so learning about these even more ancient planets was fascinating to me.I appreciated too that the book is essentially a covert analysis of the tenuous link between climate and life on this planet; virtually every extinction is caused by massive climate change. True, in some cases a supervolcano or asteroid might aid the process along, but the end result is still the same. Later chapters focussing on a potential Holocene extinction and the extinctions of the far-future (including all life itself) would make for a fascinating book in their own right.Brannen's writing is sobering and sweet, neither full of doom nor hope. A few strange turns of phrase (describing a group of scientists as autistic stands out as particularly unfortunate) do not wholly detract from some of the best science writing I've read in the last few years."

Things like that meteor was really bad for the dinosaurs, but that wasn't the only thing that was going on that wiped them out. Except for their descendants, the birds. It also discusses our current situation regarding the effects of climate change and what we are doing to exacerbate our own end. OK, we are speeding things up A LOT, and that's far from a good thing, but it's been coming for a while, and maybe we aren't the apex of life the way we think we are. It actually gave me a kind of fatalistic sense of hope, as oxymoronic as that sounds."

It is hard to imagine a better written or more thoroughly researched book on the Big five extinctions. Peter Brannen covers all sides of scientific debates (e.g., about Deccan traps and the extinction of the dinosaurs). And he includes a lot of detail—maybe too much detail. Even still, so much of what he covers is simply fascinating, from the planet’s first trees in the Devonian (now in NY, about an hour outside of Albany), to the importance of north-south coastline length for surviving climate change, to the geology of Gettysburg (“The gradual slope up Cemetery Ridge where Pickett’s charge met its grisly fate is shaped by the underlying magmatic plumbing of End-Triassic volcanism,” p. 156). Growing up I wanted to be a geologist, so maybe that is why I loved all the details. But even if you skim the details, you would still get a lot out of the book. Are concerns about a human-caused sixth extinction overblown? What lies ahead for earth in the next 100 years? How about in the next 800 million? Does the earth’s past offer insights into what is happening now and what will likely happen in the future? Brannen will answer all of these questions, and more. One more thing: read the footnotes. When they are not informative, they are hilarious."

This is a bracing tonic.I think that Brannen did a very good job of telling this deep history, and helping to share why it matters. I also felt myself recoiling a little bit because of his tone. It's a standard science journalism tone, which is clever and detached. Though I guess clever detachment can be useful when discussing so much death."

160,0062364820,http://goodreads.com/user/show/80750585-claudia,3,"Great deal of information about the five major extinctions that have occurred on our amazing planet. Unfortunately, it is only geological records that are providing the tantalizing glimpses into the past and the further back in time, the smaller those glimpses are. Especially when you consider that the only life on the planet was microbial and basically gelatinous. There was nothing to preserve except in the most extraordinary circumstances. In fact, any fossil remnant or petrified bone is an example of profound luck.Anyway, back to the book - This took me quite a while to get through. The early chapters - dealing with the earliest extinctions - were far more theory since geological records of those times give only the most shadowy hints of what happened. And some theories could be based on happenings that actually occurred hundreds of thousands if not millions of years apart. Even the extinction of the dinosaurs which is blamed on an asteroid may have also been due to a massive volcanic eruption that buried India under 2 miles of lava near the same time. The planet's diverse species likely could not withstand both assaults.But life on Earth is very resilient and even if over half the planet's species go extinct in less than a million years (technically what an extinction event is), there are still more willing to fill in those now-empty niches.I must admit that a bit of knowledge in geology, climatology and paleontology would be helpful while reading this work since it will make some of the theories and concepts clearer. Perhaps the hardest part for the general reader to accept is the depth of time. We are lucky to know someone that has lived a hundred years. The U.S. gained it's independence 350 years ago. Rome, the eternal city, was founded over two thousand years ago. The Egyptians erected the Great Pyramid about 2500 years before that. So millions and billions of years - most would have difficulty even conceptualizing the notion.Of course, it had to end with the next expected mass extinction - whether it is due to carbon emissions driving up the temperatures and the acidifying of the oceans where various species are unable to adapt or the continents merging back into one with the center being a sere landscape with little to no water flowing or even the sun entering the last stages of it's own lifespan. So it may be within the next couple centuries . . . or 800 million years in the future.2019-187"

162,0062364820,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4162791-claudia-putnam,4,"Well, that was certainly exciting! After the rippling prose of Andrew Knoll's Life on a Younger Planet, and the astounded reverence of John McPhee's Basin and Range, Brannen's writing is a little too boppy and headlong for my taste. You can't just hurl yourself through 500 million years or so. It's kind of puppylike--I'm sure some people like that about him. Nevertheless. A lot to learn here. I did laugh out loud at the first 3 billion years of evolution so rapturously described by Knoll as the wellspring of life being portrayed by Brannen as ""sluggishy sucking up organic gunk in the disgusting seas of primordial earth."" It turns out there have been more than the 5 mass extinctions everybody (you didn't know? well, brush up) talks about, with us possibly about to trigger the 6th. Snowball Earth, a series of catastrophic glaciations in the middle of the early Slime Period (my term, but I doubt I'm the first to think it up), when complex nucleated bacteria were starting to take hold and were nearly annihilated, was likely the first. Then, as Brannen notes, the sluggish gunk suckers were pretty much wiped out when something called, no lie, penis worms, came along and started burrowing in the (shallow) ocean floors. This stirred up a lot of dirt and also changed the oxygen/carbon/nitrogen/methane ratios in the water and probably air. The atmosphere and sea still weren't too O2-heavy but it was enough to trigger the Cambrian Explosion of (relatively) complex animal life. Which wiped out the sluggy frondy stuff that had existed previously. Even though this is is not really something the book is concerned with, it sort of is, because shows how one species messes with the environment and everyone else dies. ""A sentiment exists--particularly among non-scientists--that the idea of humans seriously disrupting the planet on a geological scale is mere anthropocentric hubris. But this sentiment misunderstands the history of life. In the geological past, seemingly small innovations have reorganized the planet's chemistry, hurling it into drastic phase changes. Surely humans might be as significant as the filter feeding animals of the Cambrian Explosion.""Later it's pointed out that mass extinctions have occurred without the help of overfishing, overhunting, overgrazing, etc, etc. So, minus these two extinctions, we have 5 to discuss. Let's define what we mean by mass extinction: >75% of life on earth, sea and land, wiped out. That 75% figure is for the end-triassic, when the dinosaurs, the most successful species ever, bit the dust, so to speak. That extinction was the mildest of the 5. The worst was the end-Permian, about 252 million years ago, when around 96% of the planet died and the oceans went anoxic. Recovery period: 30 million years. No Netflix series featuring a hardy band of survivors for that one, guys. Brannen mentions that Doug Erwin, who wrote Extinction, which is next on my list, and which focuses on this event, might have consulted with Cormac McCarthy when he was writing The Road. Or perhaps the screenplay. He's not admitting to that. (What gets to me about the dinosaur event? Only two reptilian four-legged species survived. One of them was the leathernecked sea turtle. Endangered now. By us.)All these events have involved massive increases of carbon into the atmosphere via volcanism (yes, I know you think it was an asteroid with the dinosaurs, but there have been other cases of impacts of around the same size with no mass extinction...at the same time the dinosaur asteroid hit, half of India was erupting). One was very gradual. The other 4 were not. It turns out that it isn't so much about the amount of carbon but the rate at which it is added. At some point, it appears there is a tipping point. What that means is that there is a disruption in the food chain. This food chain thing is a web and it's affected in a chaotic way. At some point there is a critical disruption that can't be recovered from. Everything dies off fairly suddenly.Are we in the middle of an extinction event now? That is, are we penis worms? Or are we the equivalent of these massive volcanoes, bringing carbon out of the ground and spewing it into the air? Well, on the one hand, the amount of carbon we've put into the atmosphere is nowhere near equal, in volume, to what was seen during the Permian or Triassic events. On the other, the rate we're spewing is faster than anything ever recorded in geology. It's the rate that matters.And we're messing with our environment, penis-worm-like, in other ways. Converting wildland to farmland. Paradise to parking lot. Putting nitrogen into the ocean. Killing plankton. That plankton thing really is key. Bottom of the food chain thing--turns up time and time again as a Bad Sign. So do dead and dying reefs. So, are we? Well, if we are, it didn't take us long. Any future geologists, arising out of some future slime, or re-evolving from rat or insect, would look at the anthropocene, or the primacene, and maybe not even recognize us. There will be a layer of carbon, microplastics, steroids, nitrogen. A few primate fossils might survive, but maybe not even enough to know which humans were significant or responsible for microplastics, etc. The time layer between us and Lucy may not be geologically significant--they won't be able to tell which came first. They might think Neanderthals made the plastics. Probably not, but maybe. (This is me rambling on, not Brannen.) This extinction will be EXTREMELY mysterious unless an asteroid happens to hit right after, because we'll be gone, and our cities will erode away completely. There won't be any volcanism, unless coincidentally there is within the next 60,000 years. Since there will be so little trace of us, they won't know what happened this time. Well if we are in an extinction, says one of the scientists, I think it's Erwin, there's no way we're turning it back. It's not about carbon sinks, or stopping global warming. This is a horse that has way left the barn. So he says, no. I got the idea he says no because there's no point in thinking yes. I think another expert in these matters, Peter Ward, thinks yes. I think yes. The reason I think yes is that we're asking the question. I think we sense it. If we notice enough to ask, then yes. There's a whole field of psychology called eco-psych. It does a bunch of different things, but one aspect is address a growing sense of despair/depression over what's happening to the planet. Don't you feel it? Consider that orca carrying her dead baby all those days, over two weeks, as it rotted on her back. She and her pod were on a march. Back and forth, up and down the coast. Don't you think? They wanted us to see. They are starving and sick. Their young are dying. They're ancient, they're not in denial. They wanted us to know what they know. Back to the slime. Which, luckily, is the wellspring of life. Something interesting is bound to come of it. There's enough time before the supernova. "
163,0062364820,http://goodreads.com/user/show/52174518-rebecca,1,"I was so looking forward to this book! But I found it almost unreadable. There was no order to anything. The paragraphs went all over the place. It was as if the author took a scientific narrative, cut it up with scissors, made a collage, and then put emoji stickers all over it. I just could not follow it. And there was no chart or timeline of the eras to refer to, no organized visuals that would have made up for the word salad that was the text. Also, Brannen took what I thought were unscientific liberties with his fanciful adjectives and frivolous, ""fun"" descriptions. It is possible to write about science in a fun way (Mary Roach), but sadly, the fun here was just pointless and distracting. Very disappointing, for what should have been an utterly fascinating book (given the subject). DNF. Actually, CNF...could not finish."
164,0062364820,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3424260-kerry,5,"Brannen is able to take complex events, break them down into understandable parts, and then describe how they interact; reconstructing the original event so that you understand it in all its complexity.

Otherwise if you aren't interested in the subject or even nonfiction writing in truth than I would most definitely steer clear of this book since it isn't one that is for beginners. The author does a great job in actually breaking down the book into the different mass extinctions and giving the year that it has been recorded at. As a result the reader gets to be introduced into the timeframe, what may have been lurking around as the superstar(s) of the cast and then possible events that could have been triggers to these mass events. Besides this information there are also stories told about places where the rock record can be found for those events as well as the leaders of the fields and their belief and/or teaching to help clarify up the information being presented. At the same time there was a small collection of artwork and pictures of some of the briefest moments found in the book. I wish that I had known about them beforehand or even better that they were actually included in the middle of the book instead of way in the back as if they were tucked there as in second thought for they allowed the reader another glimpse into the information that was being read about.  As for what I didn't like was the fact that the book seemed so repetitive. Although the events that seemed to trigger the mass extinctions were almost similar to each other and some of their effects were also similar I didn't need to know repeatedly and repeatedly how we are so close to making these disasters almost upon us but not quite yet. As a result the last two chapters in the book were basically an expansion of all the information that the reader had been introduced as to what we are doing to not fix the problem, how the issues we are doing now will contribute to our own downfall, how there are two sides of the camp with some thinking that we are still good to go until the end arrives and how others aren't, etc. Once or twice would have been enough while if you had wanted to include those chapters than you should have saved the information to be used just in the chapters. All in all it was fun getting to know some more about the other organisms that have shared the spotlight of life and also the events that we cannot imagine that have come to life in their own majestic time under the old sun such as the traps, the evolution of plants and the super continents. Otherwise quite wordy and repetitive this book again is only for those who are quite dedicated to these fields of science and/or are interested in getting to know more about events that have been largely ignored by the general public over the last few decades."
167,0062364820,http://goodreads.com/user/show/53250130-easton-smith,4,"What a horror: the sixth extinction. To think that we, humans, have essentially recreated the sort of poisonous conditions that have, in the past, wiped out nearly every living being on this planet. What a relief: that if we do manage to wipe ourselves out, at least something will survive, and the world will repopulate with all kinds of beings we could never imagine. Those were my opposing moods throughout reading this decently-written popular science book. Geological time helps me to have perspective, which can be a salve (when thinking about how much longer the earth will live) or a knock on the head (when thinking about how our actions will ripple out for millions of years). Brannen does a good job of showing both of these angles, even if he does occasionally repeat himself. I did feel like every few pages he had to reiterate the central storyline of the book (but little did the crustaceans know, Armageddon was coming...). He also tended to present the science behind it all in a bit of a reductive way. He would explore a series of climatic and geological problems that might have occurred in history, and then usually reduce them all to CO2. While this surely helped drive home our current crisis, it did at times feel like he was shaving off a bunch of complexity. This is, perhaps, necessary in this kind of book, but I would have really appreciated a section in the beginning where he lays out his methodology. It would have helped me trust his streamlined conclusions a bit more. I also have some hesitations about the author's discussions of humanity's more recent history and our coming future. He is somewhat dismissive of Native American scholarship that suggests they did not extinct North American megafauna during pre-colonial times (I understand his objections, but it could have been more carefully written). But what bothered me the most was the way that he finishes off with a discussion with some futurist-technology-will-save-us-Elon-Musk-type guy who suggests that the real sad part of humans dying off is that we won't get to explore other planets. Brannen takes us directly from geological time to anthropocentricism so fast that its just jarring. Still, this is a great book. It's discussions of geological history are endlessly fascinating to me, someone who is not well versed in these things. A great companion book to N.K. Jemison's Broken Earth Trilogy. "
168,0062364820,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2129784-bonnie,4,"Most of us have no conception of the age of our planet, or how long it took for there to be any life at all. We tend to think of all the dinosaurs as living at the same time. It’s a shock when Brannen points out that Tyrannosaurus Rex is closer to us in time than it is to Stegosaurus.Brannen’s topic is the five previous major extinctions that have occurred on earth; we may be living through the sixth. Some took millions of years; others, like the extinction of the dinosaurs and virtually all life on earth, may have been instantaneous. Scientists are still trying to figure out exactly what happened. One of the pleasures of this book is learning about the unbelievable variety of animals that have lived on earth. Brannen provides vivid descriptions of the animals and their habitats. However, I found myself looking up the animals in order to get pictures. Toward the end of the book, he provides some illustrations, but the book could have used a lot more.I was a little irritated by his overwriting. Talking about the crocodiles that dominated the Triassic, he says, “This deposed royal family still hunts swamp margins and irritably moseys across gold courses…” Why irritably? Referring to the theory that an asteroid caused the extinction of the dinosaurs (and most of life on earth), Brannen says that the hadrosaurs, “settling down for a fitful sleep would nervously eye this strange new star…” Is there any reason to think that hadrosaurs would notice anything in the sky? Nor is his ascription of human attitudes limited to animals. Referring to the break-up of a supercontinent, he says that India “divorced” Gondwana and was “evidently unsentimental about this union.” Such anthropomorphism is cutesy and distracting.What are the implications of this history for us today? I’m not really sure. It’s possible that climate change will mean the end of the human species in 100 years or so – not close enough to affect me, but it will be horrible for my children and grandchildren. Or perhaps that won’t happen but in millions of years, the last animal on earth will die. That’s not so terrible, but the former is tragic."
169,0062364820,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5806439-ron,4,"This is an excellent survey of the five major extinction events that nearly wiped out all life on the planet. Though the style was a bit too gee-whiz for my taste, it did help lighten up what would be to some, a pretty grim story of asteroid strikes, vulcanism that makes Mt. St. Helens seem like a firecracker, and the deaths of gazillions. He does a great job of making the complex interplay of geology, biology, chemistry and--at least for one extinction event--astrophysics, accessible to the layperson. He managed to generate some mind benders, which is always appreciated. For instance, the planet we call earth existed for something like a billion years before complex life ever appeared, and that our time in existence is absolutely DWARFED by the reign of, say, the dinosaurs (and others). I knew all this, but he laid it out in a way that really made it sink in. There are plenty more factoids and anecdotes that make you stop reading for a moment and say WTF.The latter part of the book deals with the now and the future, with what some theorists say is a sixth mass extinction, already in progress, as well as other possible ways that our existence might end. Or continue. He did a good job presenting both sides of the Sixth Extinction debate, and never really got preachy about it. What did it leave me with? Well, we are certainly at a crossroads and have some very tough decisions ahead. Yes, that is an understatement...There was even a little philosophy thrown in about the significance (or lack of same), of human life to the planet and to existence as a whole. This was less effective for me, though with little wonder: how could you cover subjects in a single chapter that have kept thinkers busy for millennia? It has set the wheels turning in my own mind, which was probably the intent.It might strike some as depressing, to think we're kind of this mold that has spread across the globe in a really short time, and that species who could literally eat us for lunch ruled the globe for 160 *million* years and were wiped out nearly overnight. A subtext here, intentional or not, is that life--maybe not our life, but life-- is nothing if not persistent."
170,0062364820,http://goodreads.com/user/show/32091109-brian-turner,4,"Altogether, an interesting book about the worst mass extinction events in the fossil record, as well as en exploration of current climate change and future climate change possibilities.Written like a newspaper article, it peppers personal interludes and short interviews with information on changes in the geological past, which made for easy and accessible reading.Brannen does almost too good a job of describing how some of these scenarios might not just have played out, but may have also looked like in their aftermath. Probably the lasting image I'll take from this is the horrors of ocean acidification, especially on the scale seen at the worst-recorded extinction event at the end of the Permian period, aka, The Great Dying.Of course, this is pertinent to current climate change, and although the potential outcomes are clearly shown to be terrifying, it's also made clear that humanity still has a chance to avert the worst - time is still on our side, if we make the effort to act.However, a major flaw is that it is almost entirely focused on the role of the carbon-cycle. While the dangers of rising carbon-dioxide in the atmosphere are made clear time after time, it spends almost no time on the role of the sun on climate, and Milankovitch cycles get a brief single-sentence mention without even being named.Perhaps there is an argument that the carbon-cycle is the ultimate planetary thermostat, but it seems strange to focus so much on vulcanism and plate tectonics as major causes while ignoring variability in solar output itself, which is arguably a main driver.Even still, an interesting, engaging - and frightening - read.

I mean, Peter Brannen is writing about paleontology and climate change and the words just sing to you, make you see worlds that we actually know very little about and feel for ammonoids like there would be the cutest kittens, looking at you with big eyes and begging not to get extinct. As someone who wants to write himself someday, I really hate this guy. He is that good.That being said, The Ends of the World is a book about the major extinctions in Earth's history, their causes and how they relate to our present lives. It's a captivating read, evoking lost worlds and very carefully analyzing how they disappeared and why. There is humor, drama, interesting interviews with fascinating people. Dinosaurs? Puh-lease. This takes you back to the good old days of the Ediacaran and slowly brings you around our time and even speculates on what could come after us, the hubris filled species that, geologically speaking, was barely born yesterday - or a few seconds ago, depending on how you measure it - and has the chance to outshine all the other species that came, ruled and went.There is no way I can do it justice other than to say that I loved the book. In itself it's a summary of life on Earth so summarizing it myself would be pointless. I highly recommend it."

I learned a ton about 'deep time' and all the various times that life on this planet was (nearly) wiped out. It's one of the things I love about books on space or, is it really gives me a totally different perspective on mankind's role in the universe. And, lots of nifty facts about how different a place everything was in the past.The book doesn't get super technical, which I really appreciate. I'm in it for the story, more than the nitty gritty detail. It only gets four stars because I really found the comparison to current climate change repetitive and frustrating. Nearly every extinction, the author points out how it's basically the same as what we're doing today. Yep, I get it, it's real bad, I totally agree. I just don't need to hear it over and over. The book's final chapter goes into more detail about what kind of havoc we're causing, and different ways that might end up - also fascinating to read.I listened to the audiobook version - it's not particularly notable, which I find to be excellent."
173,0062364820,http://goodreads.com/user/show/31309611-amber,4,"Lots to ponder in here, especially since I present talks on climate change and extinction daily as part of my work. Highly recommended if you want to understand how human-driven climate change is bringing on an extinction caused by too much carbon dioxide in the atmosphere, much like the ones that came before...but way faster. It also points out some differences and actions that mankind can take that will help. In the end, it ends relatively positively (for a book on mass extinction, anyway), with the author pointing out that we aren't yey even closer to the level of chaos and destruction at the end of the Permian extinction, for instance, and that it is not too late to turn it around...but he does point out that one of the perils of educating about climate change is that it can seem super overwhelming and inevitable, which has the opposite effect than intended: it leads to a fatalism and resignation that the end is coming so why bother.

Maybe six, if you accept that we're in the middle of one right now. The jury's still out on that one. Unless you're keeping up with the technical journals and conferences, you can throw out what you think you know about mass extinctions from your old college geology classes, reading books that are more than 10 years old, or watching PBS or Discovery.The author's style reminds me a lot of John McPhee. He did a lot of research by going out in the field with geologists and amateur fossil hunters, as well as interviewing numerous paleontologists and other geologists. But he keeps it interesting, even for people who don't know geology.To have a mass extinction event, a lot of catastrophic events have to happen more or less at the same geologic time. The asteroid impact at the Cretaceous-Tertiary boundary (blamed for killing the dinosaurs) probably wasn't enough by itself. But there's evidence that the impact restarted & intensified massive flood lava flows on the other side of the planet. Changes in carbon dioxide concentrations in the atmosphere and dissolved in the oceans play a key role. That's tied in with ocean acidification. Starting to sound familiar?There's a lot of discussion in this book about climate change. What does it mean? How bad is it compared to the geologic past? Is there really anything that humans can do to reverse it? Read on & find out. This book will probably change your perspective, even if you're a geology major."

Hey, it turns out we've only killed off less than 1% of the species on the planet so far, and in The Great Dying it was more like 99%. So that's a resilient planet you've got there, so far.I'm more hopeful for the long-term (100,000 years+) survival of complex life in general than I was before reading this, though less so for that of mammals in particular. Reptiles and birds are going to have a good run, though. On the other hand, it does start to feel more certain that another 50 years of life in Massachusetts may not be far north enough to expect political or technological stability.On the rough timeline of 100-500,000 years for this interglacial, 800 million years for life on the planet, and 100 trillion years for potential life in the galaxy, that starts to seem both less and more important. There's plenty of time for future chances at civilization-building life to develop, so it's less relevant if we don't hack it, but also, we may actually be pretty close to an exoplanetary threshold in tech, so it'd be a shame if we shot ourselves in the foot this close to that inflection point."

I have always been fascinated by the age of the world, pre-anthropological history, etc. I was engrossed by his descriptions of the world 500 million, 200 million years ago and it illustrates the absurdly small scale of humankind's existence here. Here's a short cliff notes - it's all about climate change. Climate change has led to the demise of basically everything on earth for 500 million years, in one way or another. And here we go again. As a writer, Peter Brannen has a gift to make the death of algae interesting and extremely readable. However, his final chapter shows the outsized impact we have had in relation to this short time on earth, and how the next decades are critical, even getting into AI and cosmological settlement. It's beyond an ambitious scope at only 300 pages, covering 500 million years of history, that he executes beautifully for a lay audience at least. I wish I could force every religious person I know to read it."

The final chapters are devoted to what may be the Sixth Great Extinction but caused not just by natural forces but by humankind's hellbent destruction of habitat as well as striving to put aeons' worth of carbon back into the atmosphere. A sobering book which adequately explains the mechanisms that drove the previous extinctions and their relevance to events in the last millennia.

Brannen's attention to detail enabled a vivid depiction of each geological period, creating a kind of obituary for the former worlds of our planet. I especially enjoyed his discussion of the Ordovician and Permian extinctions; too often the dinosaurs (somewhat deservedly) capture the public attention, and so learning about these even more ancient planets was fascinating to me.I appreciated too that the book is essentially a covert analysis of the tenuous link between climate and life on this planet; virtually every extinction is caused by massive climate change. True, in some cases a supervolcano or asteroid might aid the process along, but the end result is still the same. Later chapters focussing on a potential Holocene extinction and the extinctions of the far-future (including all life itself) would make for a fascinating book in their own right.Brannen's writing is sobering and sweet, neither full of doom nor hope. A few strange turns of phrase (describing a group of scientists as autistic stands out as particularly unfortunate) do not wholly detract from some of the best science writing I've read in the last few years."

Things like that meteor was really bad for the dinosaurs, but that wasn't the only thing that was going on that wiped them out. Except for their descendants, the birds. It also discusses our current situation regarding the effects of climate change and what we are doing to exacerbate our own end. OK, we are speeding things up A LOT, and that's far from a good thing, but it's been coming for a while, and maybe we aren't the apex of life the way we think we are.

It is hard to imagine a better written or more thoroughly researched book on the Big five extinctions. Peter Brannen covers all sides of scientific debates (e.g., about Deccan traps and the extinction of the dinosaurs). And he includes a lot of detail—maybe too much detail. Even still, so much of what he covers is simply fascinating, from the planet’s first trees in the Devonian (now in NY, about an hour outside of Albany), to the importance of north-south coastline length for surviving climate change, to the geology of Gettysburg (“The gradual slope up Cemetery Ridge where Pickett’s charge met its grisly fate is shaped by the underlying magmatic plumbing of End-Triassic volcanism,” p. 156). Growing up I wanted to be a geologist, so maybe that is why I loved all the details. But even if you skim the details, you would still get a lot out of the book. Are concerns about a human-caused sixth extinction overblown? What lies ahead for earth in the next 100 years? How about in the next 800 million? Does the earth’s past offer insights into what is happening now and what will likely happen in the future? Brannen will answer all of these questions, and more. One more thing: read the footnotes.

190,0062364820,http://goodreads.com/user/show/80750585-claudia,3,"Great deal of information about the five major extinctions that have occurred on our amazing planet. Unfortunately, it is only geological records that are providing the tantalizing glimpses into the past and the further back in time, the smaller those glimpses are. Especially when you consider that the only life on the planet was microbial and basically gelatinous. There was nothing to preserve except in the most extraordinary circumstances. In fact, any fossil remnant or petrified bone is an example of profound luck.Anyway, back to the book - This took me quite a while to get through. The early chapters - dealing with the earliest extinctions - were far more theory since geological records of those times give only the most shadowy hints of what happened. And some theories could be based on happenings that actually occurred hundreds of thousands if not millions of years apart. Even the extinction of the dinosaurs which is blamed on an asteroid may have also been due to a massive volcanic eruption that buried India under 2 miles of lava near the same time. The planet's diverse species likely could not withstand both assaults.But life on Earth is very resilient and even if over half the planet's species go extinct in less than a million years (technically what an extinction event is), there are still more willing to fill in those now-empty niches.I must admit that a bit of knowledge in geology, climatology and paleontology would be helpful while reading this work since it will make some of the theories and concepts clearer. Perhaps the hardest part for the general reader to accept is the depth of time. We are lucky to know someone that has lived a hundred years. The U.S. gained it's independence 350 years ago. Rome, the eternal city, was founded over two thousand years ago. The Egyptians erected the Great Pyramid about 2500 years before that. So millions and billions of years - most would have difficulty even conceptualizing the notion.Of course, it had to end with the next expected mass extinction - whether it is due to carbon emissions driving up the temperatures and the acidifying of the oceans where various species are unable to adapt or the continents merging back into one with the center being a sere landscape with little to no water flowing or even the sun entering the last stages of it's own lifespan. So it may be within the next couple centuries . . . or 800 million years in the future.2019-187"

192,0062364820,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4162791-claudia-putnam,4,"Well, that was certainly exciting! After the rippling prose of Andrew Knoll's Life on a Younger Planet, and the astounded reverence of John McPhee's Basin and Range, Brannen's writing is a little too boppy and headlong for my taste. You can't just hurl yourself through 500 million years or so. It's kind of puppylike--I'm sure some people like that about him. Nevertheless. A lot to learn here. I did laugh out loud at the first 3 billion years of evolution so rapturously described by Knoll as the wellspring of life being portrayed by Brannen as ""sluggishy sucking up organic gunk in the disgusting seas of primordial earth."" It turns out there have been more than the 5 mass extinctions everybody (you didn't know? well, brush up) talks about, with us possibly about to trigger the 6th. Snowball Earth, a series of catastrophic glaciations in the middle of the early Slime Period (my term, but I doubt I'm the first to think it up), when complex nucleated bacteria were starting to take hold and were nearly annihilated, was likely the first. Then, as Brannen notes, the sluggish gunk suckers were pretty much wiped out when something called, no lie, penis worms, came along and started burrowing in the (shallow) ocean floors. This stirred up a lot of dirt and also changed the oxygen/carbon/nitrogen/methane ratios in the water and probably air. The atmosphere and sea still weren't too O2-heavy but it was enough to trigger the Cambrian Explosion of (relatively) complex animal life. Which wiped out the sluggy frondy stuff that had existed previously. Even though this is is not really something the book is concerned with, it sort of is, because shows how one species messes with the environment and everyone else dies. ""A sentiment exists--particularly among non-scientists--that the idea of humans seriously disrupting the planet on a geological scale is mere anthropocentric hubris. But this sentiment misunderstands the history of life. In the geological past, seemingly small innovations have reorganized the planet's chemistry, hurling it into drastic phase changes. Surely humans might be as significant as the filter feeding animals of the Cambrian Explosion.""Later it's pointed out that mass extinctions have occurred without the help of overfishing, overhunting, overgrazing, etc, etc. So, minus these two extinctions, we have 5 to discuss. Let's define what we mean by mass extinction: >75% of life on earth, sea and land, wiped out. That 75% figure is for the end-triassic, when the dinosaurs, the most successful species ever, bit the dust, so to speak. That extinction was the mildest of the 5. The worst was the end-Permian, about 252 million years ago, when around 96% of the planet died and the oceans went anoxic. Recovery period: 30 million years. No Netflix series featuring a hardy band of survivors for that one, guys. Brannen mentions that Doug Erwin, who wrote Extinction, which is next on my list, and which focuses on this event, might have consulted with Cormac McCarthy when he was writing The Road. Or perhaps the screenplay. He's not admitting to that. (What gets to me about the dinosaur event? Only two reptilian four-legged species survived. One of them was the leathernecked sea turtle. Endangered now. By us.)All these events have involved massive increases of carbon into the atmosphere via volcanism (yes, I know you think it was an asteroid with the dinosaurs, but there have been other cases of impacts of around the same size with no mass extinction...at the same time the dinosaur asteroid hit, half of India was erupting). One was very gradual. The other 4 were not. It turns out that it isn't so much about the amount of carbon but the rate at which it is added. At some point, it appears there is a tipping point. What that means is that there is a disruption in the food chain. This food chain thing is a web and it's affected in a chaotic way. At some point there is a critical disruption that can't be recovered from. Everything dies off fairly suddenly.Are we in the middle of an extinction event now? That is, are we penis worms? Or are we the equivalent of these massive volcanoes, bringing carbon out of the ground and spewing it into the air? Well, on the one hand, the amount of carbon we've put into the atmosphere is nowhere near equal, in volume, to what was seen during the Permian or Triassic events. On the other, the rate we're spewing is faster than anything ever recorded in geology. It's the rate that matters.And we're messing with our environment, penis-worm-like, in other ways. Converting wildland to farmland. Paradise to parking lot. Putting nitrogen into the ocean. Killing plankton. That plankton thing really is key. Bottom of the food chain thing--turns up time and time again as a Bad Sign. So do dead and dying reefs. So, are we? Well, if we are, it didn't take us long. Any future geologists, arising out of some future slime, or re-evolving from rat or insect, would look at the anthropocene, or the primacene, and maybe not even recognize us. There will be a layer of carbon, microplastics, steroids, nitrogen. A few primate fossils might survive, but maybe not even enough to know which humans were significant or responsible for microplastics, etc. The time layer between us and Lucy may not be geologically significant--they won't be able to tell which came first. They might think Neanderthals made the plastics. Probably not, but maybe. (This is me rambling on, not Brannen.) This extinction will be EXTREMELY mysterious unless an asteroid happens to hit right after, because we'll be gone, and our cities will erode away completely. There won't be any volcanism, unless coincidentally there is within the next 60,000 years. Since there will be so little trace of us, they won't know what happened this time. Well if we are in an extinction, says one of the scientists, I think it's Erwin, there's no way we're turning it back. It's not about carbon sinks, or stopping global warming. This is a horse that has way left the barn. So he says, no. I got the idea he says no because there's no point in thinking yes. I think another expert in these matters, Peter Ward, thinks yes. I think yes. The reason I think yes is that we're asking the question. I think we sense it. If we notice enough to ask, then yes. There's a whole field of psychology called eco-psych. It does a bunch of different things, but one aspect is address a growing sense of despair/depression over what's happening to the planet. Don't you feel it? Consider that orca carrying her dead baby all those days, over two weeks, as it rotted on her back. She and her pod were on a march. Back and forth, up and down the coast. Don't you think? They wanted us to see. They are starving and sick. Their young are dying. They're ancient, they're not in denial. They wanted us to know what they know. Back to the slime. Which, luckily, is the wellspring of life. Something interesting is bound to come of it. There's enough time before the supernova. "

The paragraphs went all over the place. It was as if the author took a scientific narrative, cut it up with scissors, made a collage, and then put emoji stickers all over it. I just could not follow it. And there was no chart or timeline of the eras to refer to, no organized visuals that would have made up for the word salad that was the text. Also, Brannen took what I thought were unscientific liberties with his fanciful adjectives and frivolous, ""fun"" descriptions. It is possible to write about science in a fun way (Mary Roach), but sadly, the fun here was just pointless and distracting. Very disappointing, for what should have been an utterly fascinating book (given the subject). DNF. Actually, CNF...could not finish."

Otherwise if you aren't interested in the subject or even nonfiction writing in truth than I would most definitely steer clear of this book since it isn't one that is for beginners. The author does a great job in actually breaking down the book into the different mass extinctions and giving the year that it has been recorded at. As a result the reader gets to be introduced into the timeframe, what may have been lurking around as the superstar(s) of the cast and then possible events that could have been triggers to these mass events. Besides this information there are also stories told about places where the rock record can be found for those events as well as the leaders of the fields and their belief and/or teaching to help clarify up the information being presented. At the same time there was a small collection of artwork and pictures of some of the briefest moments found in the book. I wish that I had known about them beforehand or even better that they were actually included in the middle of the book instead of way in the back as if they were tucked there as in second thought for they allowed the reader another glimpse into the information that was being read about.  As for what I didn't like was the fact that the book seemed so repetitive. Although the events that seemed to trigger the mass extinctions were almost similar to each other and some of their effects were also similar I didn't need to know repeatedly and repeatedly how we are so close to making these disasters almost upon us but not quite yet. As a result the last two chapters in the book were basically an expansion of all the information that the reader had been introduced as to what we are doing to not fix the problem, how the issues we are doing now will contribute to our own downfall, how there are two sides of the camp with some thinking that we are still good to go until the end arrives and how others aren't, etc. Once or twice would have been enough while if you had wanted to include those chapters than you should have saved the information to be used just in the chapters. All in all it was fun getting to know some more about the other organisms that have shared the spotlight of life and also the events that we cannot imagine that have come to life in their own majestic time under the old sun such as the traps, the evolution of plants and the super continents. Otherwise quite wordy and repetitive this book again is only for those who are quite dedicated to these fields of science and/or are interested in getting to know more about events that have been largely ignored by the general public over the last few decades."
197,0062364820,http://goodreads.com/user/show/53250130-easton-smith,4,"What a horror: the sixth extinction. To think that we, humans, have essentially recreated the sort of poisonous conditions that have, in the past, wiped out nearly every living being on this planet. What a relief: that if we do manage to wipe ourselves out, at least something will survive, and the world will repopulate with all kinds of beings we could never imagine. Those were my opposing moods throughout reading this decently-written popular science book. Geological time helps me to have perspective, which can be a salve (when thinking about how much longer the earth will live) or a knock on the head (when thinking about how our actions will ripple out for millions of years). Brannen does a good job of showing both of these angles, even if he does occasionally repeat himself. I did feel like every few pages he had to reiterate the central storyline of the book (but little did the crustaceans know, Armageddon was coming...). He also tended to present the science behind it all in a bit of a reductive way. He would explore a series of climatic and geological problems that might have occurred in history, and then usually reduce them all to CO2. While this surely helped drive home our current crisis, it did at times feel like he was shaving off a bunch of complexity. This is, perhaps, necessary in this kind of book, but I would have really appreciated a section in the beginning where he lays out his methodology. It would have helped me trust his streamlined conclusions a bit more. I also have some hesitations about the author's discussions of humanity's more recent history and our coming future. He is somewhat dismissive of Native American scholarship that suggests they did not extinct North American megafauna during pre-colonial times (I understand his objections, but it could have been more carefully written). But what bothered me the most was the way that he finishes off with a discussion with some futurist-technology-will-save-us-Elon-Musk-type guy who suggests that the real sad part of humans dying off is that we won't get to explore other planets. Brannen takes us directly from geological time to anthropocentricism so fast that its just jarring. Still, this is a great book. It's discussions of geological history are endlessly fascinating to me, someone who is not well versed in these things. A great companion book to N.K. Jemison's Broken Earth Trilogy. "
198,0062364820,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2129784-bonnie,4,"Most of us have no conception of the age of our planet, or how long it took for there to be any life at all. We tend to think of all the dinosaurs as living at the same time. It’s a shock when Brannen points out that Tyrannosaurus Rex is closer to us in time than it is to Stegosaurus.Brannen’s topic is the five previous major extinctions that have occurred on earth; we may be living through the sixth. Some took millions of years; others, like the extinction of the dinosaurs and virtually all life on earth, may have been instantaneous. Scientists are still trying to figure out exactly what happened. One of the pleasures of this book is learning about the unbelievable variety of animals that have lived on earth. Brannen provides vivid descriptions of the animals and their habitats. However, I found myself looking up the animals in order to get pictures. Toward the end of the book, he provides some illustrations, but the book could have used a lot more.I was a little irritated by his overwriting. Talking about the crocodiles that dominated the Triassic, he says, “This deposed royal family still hunts swamp margins and irritably moseys across gold courses…” Why irritably? Referring to the theory that an asteroid caused the extinction of the dinosaurs (and most of life on earth), Brannen says that the hadrosaurs, “settling down for a fitful sleep would nervously eye this strange new star…” Is there any reason to think that hadrosaurs would notice anything in the sky? Nor is his ascription of human attitudes limited to animals. Referring to the break-up of a supercontinent, he says that India “divorced” Gondwana and was “evidently unsentimental about this union.” Such anthropomorphism is cutesy and distracting.What are the implications of this history for us today? I’m not really sure. It’s possible that climate change will mean the end of the human species in 100 years or so – not close enough to affect me, but it will be horrible for my children and grandchildren. Or perhaps that won’t happen but in millions of years, the last animal on earth will die. That’s not so terrible, but the former is tragic."
199,0062364820,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5806439-ron,4,"This is an excellent survey of the five major extinction events that nearly wiped out all life on the planet. Though the style was a bit too gee-whiz for my taste, it did help lighten up what would be to some, a pretty grim story of asteroid strikes, vulcanism that makes Mt. St. Helens seem like a firecracker, and the deaths of gazillions. He does a great job of making the complex interplay of geology, biology, chemistry and--at least for one extinction event--astrophysics, accessible to the layperson. He managed to generate some mind benders, which is always appreciated. For instance, the planet we call earth existed for something like a billion years before complex life ever appeared, and that our time in existence is absolutely DWARFED by the reign of, say, the dinosaurs (and others). I knew all this, but he laid it out in a way that really made it sink in. There are plenty more factoids and anecdotes that make you stop reading for a moment and say WTF.The latter part of the book deals with the now and the future, with what some theorists say is a sixth mass extinction, already in progress, as well as other possible ways that our existence might end. Or continue. He did a good job presenting both sides of the Sixth Extinction debate, and never really got preachy about it. What did it leave me with? Well, we are certainly at a crossroads and have some very tough decisions ahead. Yes, that is an understatement...There was even a little philosophy thrown in about the significance (or lack of same), of human life to the planet and to existence as a whole. This was less effective for me, though with little wonder: how could you cover subjects in a single chapter that have kept thinkers busy for millennia? It has set the wheels turning in my own mind, which was probably the intent.It might strike some as depressing, to think we're kind of this mold that has spread across the globe in a really short time, and that species who could literally eat us for lunch ruled the globe for 160 *million* years and were wiped out nearly overnight. A subtext here, intentional or not, is that life--maybe not our life, but life-- is nothing if not persistent."

Probably the lasting image I'll take from this is the horrors of ocean acidification, especially on the scale seen at the worst-recorded extinction event at the end of the Permian period, aka, The Great Dying.Of course, this is pertinent to current climate change, and although the potential outcomes are clearly shown to be terrifying, it's also made clear that humanity still has a chance to avert the worst - time is still on our side, if we make the effort to act.However, a major flaw is that it is almost entirely focused on the role of the carbon-cycle. While the dangers of rising carbon-dioxide in the atmosphere are made clear time after time, it spends almost no time on the role of the sun on climate, and Milankovitch cycles get a brief single-sentence mention without even being named.Perhaps there is an argument that the carbon-cycle is the ultimate planetary thermostat, but it seems strange to focus so much on vulcanism and plate tectonics as major causes while ignoring variability in solar output itself, which is arguably a main driver.Even still, an interesting, engaging - and frightening - read.

I mean, Peter Brannen is writing about paleontology and climate change and the words just sing to you, make you see worlds that we actually know very little about and feel for ammonoids like there would be the cutest kittens, looking at you with big eyes and begging not to get extinct. As someone who wants to write himself someday, I really hate this guy. He is that good.That being said, The Ends of the World is a book about the major extinctions in Earth's history, their causes and how they relate to our present lives. It's a captivating read, evoking lost worlds and very carefully analyzing how they disappeared and why. There is humor, drama, interesting interviews with fascinating people. Dinosaurs? Puh-lease. This takes you back to the good old days of the Ediacaran and slowly brings you around our time and even speculates on what could come after us, the hubris filled species that, geologically speaking, was barely born yesterday - or a few seconds ago, depending on how you measure it - and has the chance to outshine all the other species that came, ruled and went.There is no way I can do it justice other than to say that I loved the book. In itself it's a summary of life on Earth so summarizing it myself would be pointless. I highly recommend it."

I learned a ton about 'deep time' and all the various times that life on this planet was (nearly) wiped out. It's one of the things I love about books on space or, is it really gives me a totally different perspective on mankind's role in the universe. And, lots of nifty facts about how different a place everything was in the past.The book doesn't get super technical, which I really appreciate. I'm in it for the story, more than the nitty gritty detail. It only gets four stars because I really found the comparison to current climate change repetitive and frustrating. Nearly every extinction, the author points out how it's basically the same as what we're doing today. Yep, I get it, it's real bad, I totally agree. I just don't need to hear it over and over. The book's final chapter goes into more detail about what kind of havoc we're causing, and different ways that might end up - also fascinating to read.I listened to the audiobook version - it's not particularly notable, which I find to be excellent."

Highly recommended if you want to understand how human-driven climate change is bringing on an extinction caused by too much carbon dioxide in the atmosphere, much like the ones that came before...but way faster. It also points out some differences and actions that mankind can take that will help. In the end, it ends relatively positively (for a book on mass extinction, anyway), with the author pointing out that we aren't yey even closer to the level of chaos and destruction at the end of the Permian extinction, for instance, and that it is not too late to turn it around...but he does point out that one of the perils of educating about climate change is that it can seem super overwhelming and inevitable, which has the opposite effect than intended: it leads to a fatalism and resignation that the end is coming so why bother. It's important to avoid making it seem hopeless, is his point, and I like it."

Maybe six, if you accept that we're in the middle of one right now. The jury's still out on that one. Unless you're keeping up with the technical journals and conferences, you can throw out what you think you know about mass extinctions from your old college geology classes, reading books that are more than 10 years old, or watching PBS or Discovery.The author's style reminds me a lot of John McPhee. He did a lot of research by going out in the field with geologists and amateur fossil hunters, as well as interviewing numerous paleontologists and other geologists. But he keeps it interesting, even for people who don't know geology.To have a mass extinction event, a lot of catastrophic events have to happen more or less at the same geologic time. The asteroid impact at the Cretaceous-Tertiary boundary (blamed for killing the dinosaurs) probably wasn't enough by itself. But there's evidence that the impact restarted & intensified massive flood lava flows on the other side of the planet. Changes in carbon dioxide concentrations in the atmosphere and dissolved in the oceans play a key role. That's tied in with ocean acidification. Starting to sound familiar?There's a lot of discussion in this book about climate change. What does it mean? How bad is it compared to the geologic past? Is there really anything that humans can do to reverse it? Read on & find out. This book will probably change your perspective, even if you're a geology major."

Hey, it turns out we've only killed off less than 1% of the species on the planet so far, and in The Great Dying it was more like 99%. So that's a resilient planet you've got there, so far.I'm more hopeful for the long-term (100,000 years+) survival of complex life in general than I was before reading this, though less so for that of mammals in particular. Reptiles and birds are going to have a good run, though. On the other hand, it does start to feel more certain that another 50 years of life in Massachusetts may not be far north enough to expect political or technological stability.On the rough timeline of 100-500,000 years for this interglacial, 800 million years for life on the planet, and 100 trillion years for potential life in the galaxy, that starts to seem both less and more important. There's plenty of time for future chances at civilization-building life to develop, so it's less relevant if we don't hack it, but also, we may actually be pretty close to an exoplanetary threshold in tech, so it'd be a shame if we shot ourselves in the foot this close to that inflection point."

I have always been fascinated by the age of the world, pre-anthropological history, etc. I was engrossed by his descriptions of the world 500 million, 200 million years ago and it illustrates the absurdly small scale of humankind's existence here. Here's a short cliff notes - it's all about climate change. Climate change has led to the demise of basically everything on earth for 500 million years, in one way or another. And here we go again. As a writer, Peter Brannen has a gift to make the death of algae interesting and extremely readable. However, his final chapter shows the outsized impact we have had in relation to this short time on earth, and how the next decades are critical, even getting into AI and cosmological settlement. It's beyond an ambitious scope at only 300 pages, covering 500 million years of history, that he executes beautifully for a lay audience at least. I wish I could force every religious person I know to read it."

The final chapters are devoted to what may be the Sixth Great Extinction but caused not just by natural forces but by humankind's hellbent destruction of habitat as well as striving to put aeons' worth of carbon back into the atmosphere. A sobering book which adequately explains the mechanisms that drove the previous extinctions and their relevance to events in the last millennia.

208,0062364820,http://goodreads.com/user/show/56646301-colin-ennis,5,"Fascinating review of major extinction events in the Earth's history. Brannen's attention to detail enabled a vivid depiction of each geological period, creating a kind of obituary for the former worlds of our planet. I especially enjoyed his discussion of the Ordovician and Permian extinctions; too often the dinosaurs (somewhat deservedly) capture the public attention, and so learning about these even more ancient planets was fascinating to me.I appreciated too that the book is essentially a covert analysis of the tenuous link between climate and life on this planet; virtually every extinction is caused by massive climate change. True, in some cases a supervolcano or asteroid might aid the process along, but the end result is still the same. Later chapters focussing on a potential Holocene extinction and the extinctions of the far-future (including all life itself) would make for a fascinating book in their own right.Brannen's writing is sobering and sweet, neither full of doom nor hope. A few strange turns of phrase (describing a group of scientists as autistic stands out as particularly unfortunate) do not wholly detract from some of the best science writing I've read in the last few years."

Things like that meteor was really bad for the dinosaurs, but that wasn't the only thing that was going on that wiped them out. Except for their descendants, the birds. It also discusses our current situation regarding the effects of climate change and what we are doing to exacerbate our own end. OK, we are speeding things up A LOT, and that's far from a good thing, but it's been coming for a while, and maybe we aren't the apex of life the way we think we are.

It is hard to imagine a better written or more thoroughly researched book on the Big five extinctions. Peter Brannen covers all sides of scientific debates (e.g., about Deccan traps and the extinction of the dinosaurs). And he includes a lot of detail—maybe too much detail. Even still, so much of what he covers is simply fascinating, from the planet’s first trees in the Devonian (now in NY, about an hour outside of Albany), to the importance of north-south coastline length for surviving climate change, to the geology of Gettysburg (“The gradual slope up Cemetery Ridge where Pickett’s charge met its grisly fate is shaped by the underlying magmatic plumbing of End-Triassic volcanism,” p. 156). Growing up I wanted to be a geologist, so maybe that is why I loved all the details. But even if you skim the details, you would still get a lot out of the book. Are concerns about a human-caused sixth extinction overblown? What lies ahead for earth in the next 100 years? How about in the next 800 million? Does the earth’s past offer insights into what is happening now and what will likely happen in the future? Brannen will answer all of these questions, and more. One more thing: read the footnotes.

The Palisades Sill is not a basalt, it is a diabase sill, making it an intrusive igneous rock, which crystallizes in place and was never at the surface as the word basalt implies.

220,0062364820,http://goodreads.com/user/show/80750585-claudia,3,"Great deal of information about the five major extinctions that have occurred on our amazing planet. Unfortunately, it is only geological records that are providing the tantalizing glimpses into the past and the further back in time, the smaller those glimpses are. Especially when you consider that the only life on the planet was microbial and basically gelatinous. There was nothing to preserve except in the most extraordinary circumstances. In fact, any fossil remnant or petrified bone is an example of profound luck.Anyway, back to the book - This took me quite a while to get through. The early chapters - dealing with the earliest extinctions - were far more theory since geological records of those times give only the most shadowy hints of what happened. And some theories could be based on happenings that actually occurred hundreds of thousands if not millions of years apart. Even the extinction of the dinosaurs which is blamed on an asteroid may have also been due to a massive volcanic eruption that buried India under 2 miles of lava near the same time. The planet's diverse species likely could not withstand both assaults.But life on Earth is very resilient and even if over half the planet's species go extinct in less than a million years (technically what an extinction event is), there are still more willing to fill in those now-empty niches.I must admit that a bit of knowledge in geology, climatology and paleontology would be helpful while reading this work since it will make some of the theories and concepts clearer. Perhaps the hardest part for the general reader to accept is the depth of time. We are lucky to know someone that has lived a hundred years. The U.S. gained it's independence 350 years ago. Rome, the eternal city, was founded over two thousand years ago. The Egyptians erected the Great Pyramid about 2500 years before that. So millions and billions of years - most would have difficulty even conceptualizing the notion.Of course, it had to end with the next expected mass extinction - whether it is due to carbon emissions driving up the temperatures and the acidifying of the oceans where various species are unable to adapt or the continents merging back into one with the center being a sere landscape with little to no water flowing or even the sun entering the last stages of it's own lifespan. So it may be within the next couple centuries . . . or 800 million years in the future.2019-187"

222,0062364820,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4162791-claudia-putnam,4,"Well, that was certainly exciting! After the rippling prose of Andrew Knoll's Life on a Younger Planet, and the astounded reverence of John McPhee's Basin and Range, Brannen's writing is a little too boppy and headlong for my taste. You can't just hurl yourself through 500 million years or so. It's kind of puppylike--I'm sure some people like that about him. Nevertheless. A lot to learn here. I did laugh out loud at the first 3 billion years of evolution so rapturously described by Knoll as the wellspring of life being portrayed by Brannen as ""sluggishy sucking up organic gunk in the disgusting seas of primordial earth."" It turns out there have been more than the 5 mass extinctions everybody (you didn't know? well, brush up) talks about, with us possibly about to trigger the 6th. Snowball Earth, a series of catastrophic glaciations in the middle of the early Slime Period (my term, but I doubt I'm the first to think it up), when complex nucleated bacteria were starting to take hold and were nearly annihilated, was likely the first. Then, as Brannen notes, the sluggish gunk suckers were pretty much wiped out when something called, no lie, penis worms, came along and started burrowing in the (shallow) ocean floors. This stirred up a lot of dirt and also changed the oxygen/carbon/nitrogen/methane ratios in the water and probably air. The atmosphere and sea still weren't too O2-heavy but it was enough to trigger the Cambrian Explosion of (relatively) complex animal life. Which wiped out the sluggy frondy stuff that had existed previously. Even though this is is not really something the book is concerned with, it sort of is, because shows how one species messes with the environment and everyone else dies. ""A sentiment exists--particularly among non-scientists--that the idea of humans seriously disrupting the planet on a geological scale is mere anthropocentric hubris. But this sentiment misunderstands the history of life. In the geological past, seemingly small innovations have reorganized the planet's chemistry, hurling it into drastic phase changes. Surely humans might be as significant as the filter feeding animals of the Cambrian Explosion.""Later it's pointed out that mass extinctions have occurred without the help of overfishing, overhunting, overgrazing, etc, etc. So, minus these two extinctions, we have 5 to discuss. Let's define what we mean by mass extinction: >75% of life on earth, sea and land, wiped out. That 75% figure is for the end-triassic, when the dinosaurs, the most successful species ever, bit the dust, so to speak. That extinction was the mildest of the 5. The worst was the end-Permian, about 252 million years ago, when around 96% of the planet died and the oceans went anoxic. Recovery period: 30 million years. No Netflix series featuring a hardy band of survivors for that one, guys. Brannen mentions that Doug Erwin, who wrote Extinction, which is next on my list, and which focuses on this event, might have consulted with Cormac McCarthy when he was writing The Road. Or perhaps the screenplay. He's not admitting to that. (What gets to me about the dinosaur event? Only two reptilian four-legged species survived. One of them was the leathernecked sea turtle. Endangered now. By us.)All these events have involved massive increases of carbon into the atmosphere via volcanism (yes, I know you think it was an asteroid with the dinosaurs, but there have been other cases of impacts of around the same size with no mass extinction...at the same time the dinosaur asteroid hit, half of India was erupting). One was very gradual. The other 4 were not. It turns out that it isn't so much about the amount of carbon but the rate at which it is added. At some point, it appears there is a tipping point. What that means is that there is a disruption in the food chain. This food chain thing is a web and it's affected in a chaotic way. At some point there is a critical disruption that can't be recovered from. Everything dies off fairly suddenly.Are we in the middle of an extinction event now? That is, are we penis worms? Or are we the equivalent of these massive volcanoes, bringing carbon out of the ground and spewing it into the air? Well, on the one hand, the amount of carbon we've put into the atmosphere is nowhere near equal, in volume, to what was seen during the Permian or Triassic events. On the other, the rate we're spewing is faster than anything ever recorded in geology. It's the rate that matters.And we're messing with our environment, penis-worm-like, in other ways. Converting wildland to farmland. Paradise to parking lot. Putting nitrogen into the ocean. Killing plankton. That plankton thing really is key. Bottom of the food chain thing--turns up time and time again as a Bad Sign. So do dead and dying reefs. So, are we? Well, if we are, it didn't take us long. Any future geologists, arising out of some future slime, or re-evolving from rat or insect, would look at the anthropocene, or the primacene, and maybe not even recognize us. There will be a layer of carbon, microplastics, steroids, nitrogen. A few primate fossils might survive, but maybe not even enough to know which humans were significant or responsible for microplastics, etc. The time layer between us and Lucy may not be geologically significant--they won't be able to tell which came first. They might think Neanderthals made the plastics. Probably not, but maybe. (This is me rambling on, not Brannen.) This extinction will be EXTREMELY mysterious unless an asteroid happens to hit right after, because we'll be gone, and our cities will erode away completely. There won't be any volcanism, unless coincidentally there is within the next 60,000 years. Since there will be so little trace of us, they won't know what happened this time. Well if we are in an extinction, says one of the scientists, I think it's Erwin, there's no way we're turning it back. It's not about carbon sinks, or stopping global warming. This is a horse that has way left the barn. So he says, no. I got the idea he says no because there's no point in thinking yes. I think another expert in these matters, Peter Ward, thinks yes. I think yes. The reason I think yes is that we're asking the question. I think we sense it. If we notice enough to ask, then yes. There's a whole field of psychology called eco-psych. It does a bunch of different things, but one aspect is address a growing sense of despair/depression over what's happening to the planet. Don't you feel it? Consider that orca carrying her dead baby all those days, over two weeks, as it rotted on her back. She and her pod were on a march. Back and forth, up and down the coast. Don't you think? They wanted us to see. They are starving and sick. Their young are dying. They're ancient, they're not in denial. They wanted us to know what they know. Back to the slime. Which, luckily, is the wellspring of life. Something interesting is bound to come of it. There's enough time before the supernova. "

I just could not follow it. And there was no chart or timeline of the eras to refer to, no organized visuals that would have made up for the word salad that was the text. Also, Brannen took what I thought were unscientific liberties with his fanciful adjectives and frivolous, ""fun"" descriptions. It is possible to write about science in a fun way (Mary Roach), but sadly, the fun here was just pointless and distracting. Very disappointing, for what should have been an utterly fascinating book (given the subject). DNF. Actually, CNF...could not finish."

Otherwise if you aren't interested in the subject or even nonfiction writing in truth than I would most definitely steer clear of this book since it isn't one that is for beginners. The author does a great job in actually breaking down the book into the different mass extinctions and giving the year that it has been recorded at. As a result the reader gets to be introduced into the timeframe, what may have been lurking around as the superstar(s) of the cast and then possible events that could have been triggers to these mass events. Besides this information there are also stories told about places where the rock record can be found for those events as well as the leaders of the fields and their belief and/or teaching to help clarify up the information being presented. At the same time there was a small collection of artwork and pictures of some of the briefest moments found in the book. I wish that I had known about them beforehand or even better that they were actually included in the middle of the book instead of way in the back as if they were tucked there as in second thought for they allowed the reader another glimpse into the information that was being read about.  As for what I didn't like was the fact that the book seemed so repetitive. Although the events that seemed to trigger the mass extinctions were almost similar to each other and some of their effects were also similar I didn't need to know repeatedly and repeatedly how we are so close to making these disasters almost upon us but not quite yet. As a result the last two chapters in the book were basically an expansion of all the information that the reader had been introduced as to what we are doing to not fix the problem, how the issues we are doing now will contribute to our own downfall, how there are two sides of the camp with some thinking that we are still good to go until the end arrives and how others aren't, etc. Once or twice would have been enough while if you had wanted to include those chapters than you should have saved the information to be used just in the chapters. All in all it was fun getting to know some more about the other organisms that have shared the spotlight of life and also the events that we cannot imagine that have come to life in their own majestic time under the old sun such as the traps, the evolution of plants and the super continents. Otherwise quite wordy and repetitive this book again is only for those who are quite dedicated to these fields of science and/or are interested in getting to know more about events that have been largely ignored by the general public over the last few decades."
227,0062364820,http://goodreads.com/user/show/53250130-easton-smith,4,"What a horror: the sixth extinction. To think that we, humans, have essentially recreated the sort of poisonous conditions that have, in the past, wiped out nearly every living being on this planet. What a relief: that if we do manage to wipe ourselves out, at least something will survive, and the world will repopulate with all kinds of beings we could never imagine. Those were my opposing moods throughout reading this decently-written popular science book. Geological time helps me to have perspective, which can be a salve (when thinking about how much longer the earth will live) or a knock on the head (when thinking about how our actions will ripple out for millions of years). Brannen does a good job of showing both of these angles, even if he does occasionally repeat himself. I did feel like every few pages he had to reiterate the central storyline of the book (but little did the crustaceans know, Armageddon was coming...). He also tended to present the science behind it all in a bit of a reductive way. He would explore a series of climatic and geological problems that might have occurred in history, and then usually reduce them all to CO2. While this surely helped drive home our current crisis, it did at times feel like he was shaving off a bunch of complexity. This is, perhaps, necessary in this kind of book, but I would have really appreciated a section in the beginning where he lays out his methodology. It would have helped me trust his streamlined conclusions a bit more. I also have some hesitations about the author's discussions of humanity's more recent history and our coming future. He is somewhat dismissive of Native American scholarship that suggests they did not extinct North American megafauna during pre-colonial times (I understand his objections, but it could have been more carefully written). But what bothered me the most was the way that he finishes off with a discussion with some futurist-technology-will-save-us-Elon-Musk-type guy who suggests that the real sad part of humans dying off is that we won't get to explore other planets. Brannen takes us directly from geological time to anthropocentricism so fast that its just jarring. Still, this is a great book. It's discussions of geological history are endlessly fascinating to me, someone who is not well versed in these things. A great companion book to N.K. Jemison's Broken Earth Trilogy. "
228,0062364820,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2129784-bonnie,4,"Most of us have no conception of the age of our planet, or how long it took for there to be any life at all. We tend to think of all the dinosaurs as living at the same time. It’s a shock when Brannen points out that Tyrannosaurus Rex is closer to us in time than it is to Stegosaurus.Brannen’s topic is the five previous major extinctions that have occurred on earth; we may be living through the sixth. Some took millions of years; others, like the extinction of the dinosaurs and virtually all life on earth, may have been instantaneous. Scientists are still trying to figure out exactly what happened. One of the pleasures of this book is learning about the unbelievable variety of animals that have lived on earth. Brannen provides vivid descriptions of the animals and their habitats. However, I found myself looking up the animals in order to get pictures. Toward the end of the book, he provides some illustrations, but the book could have used a lot more.I was a little irritated by his overwriting. Talking about the crocodiles that dominated the Triassic, he says, “This deposed royal family still hunts swamp margins and irritably moseys across gold courses…” Why irritably? Referring to the theory that an asteroid caused the extinction of the dinosaurs (and most of life on earth), Brannen says that the hadrosaurs, “settling down for a fitful sleep would nervously eye this strange new star…” Is there any reason to think that hadrosaurs would notice anything in the sky? Nor is his ascription of human attitudes limited to animals. Referring to the break-up of a supercontinent, he says that India “divorced” Gondwana and was “evidently unsentimental about this union.” Such anthropomorphism is cutesy and distracting.What are the implications of this history for us today? I’m not really sure. It’s possible that climate change will mean the end of the human species in 100 years or so – not close enough to affect me, but it will be horrible for my children and grandchildren. Or perhaps that won’t happen but in millions of years, the last animal on earth will die. That’s not so terrible, but the former is tragic."
229,0062364820,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5806439-ron,4,"This is an excellent survey of the five major extinction events that nearly wiped out all life on the planet. Though the style was a bit too gee-whiz for my taste, it did help lighten up what would be to some, a pretty grim story of asteroid strikes, vulcanism that makes Mt. St. Helens seem like a firecracker, and the deaths of gazillions. He does a great job of making the complex interplay of geology, biology, chemistry and--at least for one extinction event--astrophysics, accessible to the layperson. He managed to generate some mind benders, which is always appreciated. For instance, the planet we call earth existed for something like a billion years before complex life ever appeared, and that our time in existence is absolutely DWARFED by the reign of, say, the dinosaurs (and others). I knew all this, but he laid it out in a way that really made it sink in. There are plenty more factoids and anecdotes that make you stop reading for a moment and say WTF.The latter part of the book deals with the now and the future, with what some theorists say is a sixth mass extinction, already in progress, as well as other possible ways that our existence might end. Or continue. He did a good job presenting both sides of the Sixth Extinction debate, and never really got preachy about it. What did it leave me with? Well, we are certainly at a crossroads and have some very tough decisions ahead. Yes, that is an understatement...There was even a little philosophy thrown in about the significance (or lack of same), of human life to the planet and to existence as a whole. This was less effective for me, though with little wonder: how could you cover subjects in a single chapter that have kept thinkers busy for millennia? It has set the wheels turning in my own mind, which was probably the intent.It might strike some as depressing, to think we're kind of this mold that has spread across the globe in a really short time, and that species who could literally eat us for lunch ruled the globe for 160 *million* years and were wiped out nearly overnight. A subtext here, intentional or not, is that life--maybe not our life, but life-- is nothing if not persistent."
230,0062364820,http://goodreads.com/user/show/32091109-brian-turner,4,"Altogether, an interesting book about the worst mass extinction events in the fossil record, as well as en exploration of current climate change and future climate change possibilities.Written like a newspaper article, it peppers personal interludes and short interviews with information on changes in the geological past, which made for easy and accessible reading.Brannen does almost too good a job of describing how some of these scenarios might not just have played out, but may have also looked like in their aftermath. Probably the lasting image I'll take from this is the horrors of ocean acidification, especially on the scale seen at the worst-recorded extinction event at the end of the Permian period, aka, The Great Dying.Of course, this is pertinent to current climate change, and although the potential outcomes are clearly shown to be terrifying, it's also made clear that humanity still has a chance to avert the worst - time is still on our side, if we make the effort to act.However, a major flaw is that it is almost entirely focused on the role of the carbon-cycle. While the dangers of rising carbon-dioxide in the atmosphere are made clear time after time, it spends almost no time on the role of the sun on climate, and Milankovitch cycles get a brief single-sentence mention without even being named.Perhaps there is an argument that the carbon-cycle is the ultimate planetary thermostat, but it seems strange to focus so much on vulcanism and plate tectonics as major causes while ignoring variability in solar output itself, which is arguably a main driver.Even still, an interesting, engaging - and frightening - read.

I mean, Peter Brannen is writing about paleontology and climate change and the words just sing to you, make you see worlds that we actually know very little about and feel for ammonoids like there would be the cutest kittens, looking at you with big eyes and begging not to get extinct. As someone who wants to write himself someday, I really hate this guy. He is that good.That being said, The Ends of the World is a book about the major extinctions in Earth's history, their causes and how they relate to our present lives. It's a captivating read, evoking lost worlds and very carefully analyzing how they disappeared and why. There is humor, drama, interesting interviews with fascinating people. Dinosaurs? Puh-lease. This takes you back to the good old days of the Ediacaran and slowly brings you around our time and even speculates on what could come after us, the hubris filled species that, geologically speaking, was barely born yesterday - or a few seconds ago, depending on how you measure it - and has the chance to outshine all the other species that came, ruled and went.There is no way I can do it justice other than to say that I loved the book. In itself it's a summary of life on Earth so summarizing it myself would be pointless. I highly recommend it."
232,0062364820,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10586871-mark-dehate,4,"I really enjoyed this - I didn't have a lot of knowledge around past extinctions, other than some vague knowledge about an asteroid and the dinosaurs. I learned a ton about 'deep time' and all the various times that life on this planet was (nearly) wiped out. It's one of the things I love about books on space or, is it really gives me a totally different perspective on mankind's role in the universe. And, lots of nifty facts about how different a place everything was in the past.The book doesn't get super technical, which I really appreciate. I'm in it for the story, more than the nitty gritty detail. It only gets four stars because I really found the comparison to current climate change repetitive and frustrating. Nearly every extinction, the author points out how it's basically the same as what we're doing today. Yep, I get it, it's real bad, I totally agree. I just don't need to hear it over and over. The book's final chapter goes into more detail about what kind of havoc we're causing, and different ways that might end up - also fascinating to read.I listened to the audiobook version - it's not particularly notable, which I find to be excellent."
233,0062364820,http://goodreads.com/user/show/31309611-amber,4,"Lots to ponder in here, especially since I present talks on climate change and extinction daily as part of my work. Highly recommended if you want to understand how human-driven climate change is bringing on an extinction caused by too much carbon dioxide in the atmosphere, much like the ones that came before...but way faster. It also points out some differences and actions that mankind can take that will help. In the end, it ends relatively positively (for a book on mass extinction, anyway), with the author pointing out that we aren't yey even closer to the level of chaos and destruction at the end of the Permian extinction, for instance, and that it is not too late to turn it around...but he does point out that one of the perils of educating about climate change is that it can seem super overwhelming and inevitable, which has the opposite effect than intended: it leads to a fatalism and resignation that the end is coming so why bother. It's important to avoid making it seem hopeless, is his point, and I like it."
234,0062364820,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5938782-jim,4,"Did you know that there were 5 mass extinction events in Earth's geologic history? Maybe six, if you accept that we're in the middle of one right now. The jury's still out on that one. Unless you're keeping up with the technical journals and conferences, you can throw out what you think you know about mass extinctions from your old college geology classes, reading books that are more than 10 years old, or watching PBS or Discovery.The author's style reminds me a lot of John McPhee. He did a lot of research by going out in the field with geologists and amateur fossil hunters, as well as interviewing numerous paleontologists and other geologists. But he keeps it interesting, even for people who don't know geology.To have a mass extinction event, a lot of catastrophic events have to happen more or less at the same geologic time. The asteroid impact at the Cretaceous-Tertiary boundary (blamed for killing the dinosaurs) probably wasn't enough by itself. But there's evidence that the impact restarted & intensified massive flood lava flows on the other side of the planet. Changes in carbon dioxide concentrations in the atmosphere and dissolved in the oceans play a key role. That's tied in with ocean acidification. Starting to sound familiar?There's a lot of discussion in this book about climate change. What does it mean? How bad is it compared to the geologic past? Is there really anything that humans can do to reverse it? Read on & find out. This book will probably change your perspective, even if you're a geology major."
235,0062364820,http://goodreads.com/user/show/286888-ryn,4,"Successfully conveys a sense of scope for comparison of today's anthropocene extinction status to the K-T and other ""real"" mass extinction events. Hey, it turns out we've only killed off less than 1% of the species on the planet so far, and in The Great Dying it was more like 99%. So that's a resilient planet you've got there, so far.I'm more hopeful for the long-term (100,000 years+) survival of complex life in general than I was before reading this, though less so for that of mammals in particular. Reptiles and birds are going to have a good run, though. On the other hand, it does start to feel more certain that another 50 years of life in Massachusetts may not be far north enough to expect political or technological stability.On the rough timeline of 100-500,000 years for this interglacial, 800 million years for life on the planet, and 100 trillion years for potential life in the galaxy, that starts to seem both less and more important. There's plenty of time for future chances at civilization-building life to develop, so it's less relevant if we don't hack it, but also, we may actually be pretty close to an exoplanetary threshold in tech, so it'd be a shame if we shot ourselves in the foot this close to that inflection point."

I have always been fascinated by the age of the world, pre-anthropological history, etc. I was engrossed by his descriptions of the world 500 million, 200 million years ago and it illustrates the absurdly small scale of humankind's existence here. Here's a short cliff notes - it's all about climate change. Climate change has led to the demise of basically everything on earth for 500 million years, in one way or another. And here we go again. As a writer, Peter Brannen has a gift to make the death of algae interesting and extremely readable. However, his final chapter shows the outsized impact we have had in relation to this short time on earth, and how the next decades are critical, even getting into AI and cosmological settlement. It's beyond an ambitious scope at only 300 pages, covering 500 million years of history, that he executes beautifully for a lay audience at least. I wish I could force every religious person I know to read it."

This book covers not only the Five Great Extinctions but offers an analysis of them with input from wide ranging sources. The final chapters are devoted to what may be the Sixth Great Extinction but caused not just by natural forces but by humankind's hellbent destruction of habitat as well as striving to put aeons' worth of carbon back into the atmosphere. A sobering book which adequately explains the mechanisms that drove the previous extinctions and their relevance to events in the last millennia.

238,0062364820,http://goodreads.com/user/show/56646301-colin-ennis,5,"Fascinating review of major extinction events in the Earth's history. Brannen's attention to detail enabled a vivid depiction of each geological period, creating a kind of obituary for the former worlds of our planet. I especially enjoyed his discussion of the Ordovician and Permian extinctions; too often the dinosaurs (somewhat deservedly) capture the public attention, and so learning about these even more ancient planets was fascinating to me.I appreciated too that the book is essentially a covert analysis of the tenuous link between climate and life on this planet; virtually every extinction is caused by massive climate change. True, in some cases a supervolcano or asteroid might aid the process along, but the end result is still the same. Later chapters focussing on a potential Holocene extinction and the extinctions of the far-future (including all life itself) would make for a fascinating book in their own right.Brannen's writing is sobering and sweet, neither full of doom nor hope. A few strange turns of phrase (describing a group of scientists as autistic stands out as particularly unfortunate) do not wholly detract from some of the best science writing I've read in the last few years."

Things like that meteor was really bad for the dinosaurs, but that wasn't the only thing that was going on that wiped them out. Except for their descendants, the birds. It also discusses our current situation regarding the effects of climate change and what we are doing to exacerbate our own end. OK, we are speeding things up A LOT, and that's far from a good thing, but it's been coming for a while, and maybe we aren't the apex of life the way we think we are.

It is hard to imagine a better written or more thoroughly researched book on the Big five extinctions. Peter Brannen covers all sides of scientific debates (e.g., about Deccan traps and the extinction of the dinosaurs). And he includes a lot of detail—maybe too much detail. Even still, so much of what he covers is simply fascinating, from the planet’s first trees in the Devonian (now in NY, about an hour outside of Albany), to the importance of north-south coastline length for surviving climate change, to the geology of Gettysburg (“The gradual slope up Cemetery Ridge where Pickett’s charge met its grisly fate is shaped by the underlying magmatic plumbing of End-Triassic volcanism,” p. 156). Growing up I wanted to be a geologist, so maybe that is why I loved all the details. But even if you skim the details, you would still get a lot out of the book. Are concerns about a human-caused sixth extinction overblown? What lies ahead for earth in the next 100 years? How about in the next 800 million? Does the earth’s past offer insights into what is happening now and what will likely happen in the future? Brannen will answer all of these questions, and more. One more thing: read the footnotes.

250,0062364820,http://goodreads.com/user/show/80750585-claudia,3,"Great deal of information about the five major extinctions that have occurred on our amazing planet. Unfortunately, it is only geological records that are providing the tantalizing glimpses into the past and the further back in time, the smaller those glimpses are. Especially when you consider that the only life on the planet was microbial and basically gelatinous. There was nothing to preserve except in the most extraordinary circumstances. In fact, any fossil remnant or petrified bone is an example of profound luck.Anyway, back to the book - This took me quite a while to get through. The early chapters - dealing with the earliest extinctions - were far more theory since geological records of those times give only the most shadowy hints of what happened. And some theories could be based on happenings that actually occurred hundreds of thousands if not millions of years apart. Even the extinction of the dinosaurs which is blamed on an asteroid may have also been due to a massive volcanic eruption that buried India under 2 miles of lava near the same time. The planet's diverse species likely could not withstand both assaults.But life on Earth is very resilient and even if over half the planet's species go extinct in less than a million years (technically what an extinction event is), there are still more willing to fill in those now-empty niches.I must admit that a bit of knowledge in geology, climatology and paleontology would be helpful while reading this work since it will make some of the theories and concepts clearer. Perhaps the hardest part for the general reader to accept is the depth of time. We are lucky to know someone that has lived a hundred years. The U.S. gained it's independence 350 years ago. Rome, the eternal city, was founded over two thousand years ago. The Egyptians erected the Great Pyramid about 2500 years before that. So millions and billions of years - most would have difficulty even conceptualizing the notion.Of course, it had to end with the next expected mass extinction - whether it is due to carbon emissions driving up the temperatures and the acidifying of the oceans where various species are unable to adapt or the continents merging back into one with the center being a sere landscape with little to no water flowing or even the sun entering the last stages of it's own lifespan. So it may be within the next couple centuries . . . or 800 million years in the future.2019-187"

After the rippling prose of Andrew Knoll's Life on a Younger Planet, and the astounded reverence of John McPhee's Basin and Range, Brannen's writing is a little too boppy and headlong for my taste. You can't just hurl yourself through 500 million years or so. It's kind of puppylike--I'm sure some people like that about him. Nevertheless. A lot to learn here. I did laugh out loud at the first 3 billion years of evolution so rapturously described by Knoll as the wellspring of life being portrayed by Brannen as ""sluggishy sucking up organic gunk in the disgusting seas of primordial earth."" It turns out there have been more than the 5 mass extinctions everybody (you didn't know? well, brush up) talks about, with us possibly about to trigger the 6th. Snowball Earth, a series of catastrophic glaciations in the middle of the early Slime Period (my term, but I doubt I'm the first to think it up), when complex nucleated bacteria were starting to take hold and were nearly annihilated, was likely the first. Then, as Brannen notes, the sluggish gunk suckers were pretty much wiped out when something called, no lie, penis worms, came along and started burrowing in the (shallow) ocean floors. This stirred up a lot of dirt and also changed the oxygen/carbon/nitrogen/methane ratios in the water and probably air. The atmosphere and sea still weren't too O2-heavy but it was enough to trigger the Cambrian Explosion of (relatively) complex animal life. Which wiped out the sluggy frondy stuff that had existed previously. Even though this is is not really something the book is concerned with, it sort of is, because shows how one species messes with the environment and everyone else dies. ""A sentiment exists--particularly among non-scientists--that the idea of humans seriously disrupting the planet on a geological scale is mere anthropocentric hubris. But this sentiment misunderstands the history of life. In the geological past, seemingly small innovations have reorganized the planet's chemistry, hurling it into drastic phase changes. Surely humans might be as significant as the filter feeding animals of the Cambrian Explosion.""Later it's pointed out that mass extinctions have occurred without the help of overfishing, overhunting, overgrazing, etc, etc. So, minus these two extinctions, we have 5 to discuss. Let's define what we mean by mass extinction: >75% of life on earth, sea and land, wiped out. That 75% figure is for the end-triassic, when the dinosaurs, the most successful species ever, bit the dust, so to speak. That extinction was the mildest of the 5. The worst was the end-Permian, about 252 million years ago, when around 96% of the planet died and the oceans went anoxic. Recovery period: 30 million years. No Netflix series featuring a hardy band of survivors for that one, guys. Brannen mentions that Doug Erwin, who wrote Extinction, which is next on my list, and which focuses on this event, might have consulted with Cormac McCarthy when he was writing The Road. Or perhaps the screenplay. He's not admitting to that. (What gets to me about the dinosaur event? Only two reptilian four-legged species survived. One of them was the leathernecked sea turtle. Endangered now. By us.)All these events have involved massive increases of carbon into the atmosphere via volcanism (yes, I know you think it was an asteroid with the dinosaurs, but there have been other cases of impacts of around the same size with no mass extinction...at the same time the dinosaur asteroid hit, half of India was erupting). One was very gradual. The other 4 were not. It turns out that it isn't so much about the amount of carbon but the rate at which it is added. At some point, it appears there is a tipping point. What that means is that there is a disruption in the food chain. This food chain thing is a web and it's affected in a chaotic way. At some point there is a critical disruption that can't be recovered from. Everything dies off fairly suddenly.Are we in the middle of an extinction event now? That is, are we penis worms? Or are we the equivalent of these massive volcanoes, bringing carbon out of the ground and spewing it into the air? Well, on the one hand, the amount of carbon we've put into the atmosphere is nowhere near equal, in volume, to what was seen during the Permian or Triassic events. On the other, the rate we're spewing is faster than anything ever recorded in geology. It's the rate that matters.And we're messing with our environment, penis-worm-like, in other ways. Converting wildland to farmland. Paradise to parking lot. Putting nitrogen into the ocean. Killing plankton. That plankton thing really is key. Bottom of the food chain thing--turns up time and time again as a Bad Sign. So do dead and dying reefs. So, are we? Well, if we are, it didn't take us long. Any future geologists, arising out of some future slime, or re-evolving from rat or insect, would look at the anthropocene, or the primacene, and maybe not even recognize us. There will be a layer of carbon, microplastics, steroids, nitrogen. A few primate fossils might survive, but maybe not even enough to know which humans were significant or responsible for microplastics, etc. The time layer between us and Lucy may not be geologically significant--they won't be able to tell which came first. They might think Neanderthals made the plastics. Probably not, but maybe. (This is me rambling on, not Brannen.) This extinction will be EXTREMELY mysterious unless an asteroid happens to hit right after, because we'll be gone, and our cities will erode away completely. There won't be any volcanism, unless coincidentally there is within the next 60,000 years. Since there will be so little trace of us, they won't know what happened this time. Well if we are in an extinction, says one of the scientists, I think it's Erwin, there's no way we're turning it back. It's not about carbon sinks, or stopping global warming. This is a horse that has way left the barn. So he says, no. I got the idea he says no because there's no point in thinking yes. I think another expert in these matters, Peter Ward, thinks yes. I think yes. The reason I think yes is that we're asking the question. I think we sense it. If we notice enough to ask, then yes. There's a whole field of psychology called eco-psych. It does a bunch of different things, but one aspect is address a growing sense of despair/depression over what's happening to the planet. Don't you feel it? Consider that orca carrying her dead baby all those days, over two weeks, as it rotted on her back. She and her pod were on a march. Back and forth, up and down the coast. Don't you think? They wanted us to see. They are starving and sick. Their young are dying. They're ancient, they're not in denial. They wanted us to know what they know. Back to the slime. Which, luckily, is the wellspring of life. Something interesting is bound to come of it. There's enough time before the supernova. "

The paragraphs went all over the place. It was as if the author took a scientific narrative, cut it up with scissors, made a collage, and then put emoji stickers all over it. I just could not follow it. And there was no chart or timeline of the eras to refer to, no organized visuals that would have made up for the word salad that was the text. Also, Brannen took what I thought were unscientific liberties with his fanciful adjectives and frivolous, ""fun"" descriptions. It is possible to write about science in a fun way (Mary Roach), but sadly, the fun here was just pointless and distracting. Very disappointing, for what should have been an utterly fascinating book (given the subject). DNF. Actually, CNF...could not finish."
254,0062364820,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3424260-kerry,5,"Brannen is able to take complex events, break them down into understandable parts, and then describe how they interact; reconstructing the original event so that you understand it in all its complexity. He does this again and again, moving from the origin of the earth into the future constructing a view of earth's history that is breathtaking."

Otherwise if you aren't interested in the subject or even nonfiction writing in truth than I would most definitely steer clear of this book since it isn't one that is for beginners. The author does a great job in actually breaking down the book into the different mass extinctions and giving the year that it has been recorded at. As a result the reader gets to be introduced into the timeframe, what may have been lurking around as the superstar(s) of the cast and then possible events that could have been triggers to these mass events. Besides this information there are also stories told about places where the rock record can be found for those events as well as the leaders of the fields and their belief and/or teaching to help clarify up the information being presented. At the same time there was a small collection of artwork and pictures of some of the briefest moments found in the book. I wish that I had known about them beforehand or even better that they were actually included in the middle of the book instead of way in the back as if they were tucked there as in second thought for they allowed the reader another glimpse into the information that was being read about.  As for what I didn't like was the fact that the book seemed so repetitive. Although the events that seemed to trigger the mass extinctions were almost similar to each other and some of their effects were also similar I didn't need to know repeatedly and repeatedly how we are so close to making these disasters almost upon us but not quite yet. As a result the last two chapters in the book were basically an expansion of all the information that the reader had been introduced as to what we are doing to not fix the problem, how the issues we are doing now will contribute to our own downfall, how there are two sides of the camp with some thinking that we are still good to go until the end arrives and how others aren't, etc. Once or twice would have been enough while if you had wanted to include those chapters than you should have saved the information to be used just in the chapters. All in all it was fun getting to know some more about the other organisms that have shared the spotlight of life and also the events that we cannot imagine that have come to life in their own majestic time under the old sun such as the traps, the evolution of plants and the super continents. Otherwise quite wordy and repetitive this book again is only for those who are quite dedicated to these fields of science and/or are interested in getting to know more about events that have been largely ignored by the general public over the last few decades."
257,0062364820,http://goodreads.com/user/show/53250130-easton-smith,4,"What a horror: the sixth extinction. To think that we, humans, have essentially recreated the sort of poisonous conditions that have, in the past, wiped out nearly every living being on this planet. What a relief: that if we do manage to wipe ourselves out, at least something will survive, and the world will repopulate with all kinds of beings we could never imagine. Those were my opposing moods throughout reading this decently-written popular science book. Geological time helps me to have perspective, which can be a salve (when thinking about how much longer the earth will live) or a knock on the head (when thinking about how our actions will ripple out for millions of years). Brannen does a good job of showing both of these angles, even if he does occasionally repeat himself. I did feel like every few pages he had to reiterate the central storyline of the book (but little did the crustaceans know, Armageddon was coming...). He also tended to present the science behind it all in a bit of a reductive way. He would explore a series of climatic and geological problems that might have occurred in history, and then usually reduce them all to CO2. While this surely helped drive home our current crisis, it did at times feel like he was shaving off a bunch of complexity. This is, perhaps, necessary in this kind of book, but I would have really appreciated a section in the beginning where he lays out his methodology. It would have helped me trust his streamlined conclusions a bit more. I also have some hesitations about the author's discussions of humanity's more recent history and our coming future. He is somewhat dismissive of Native American scholarship that suggests they did not extinct North American megafauna during pre-colonial times (I understand his objections, but it could have been more carefully written). But what bothered me the most was the way that he finishes off with a discussion with some futurist-technology-will-save-us-Elon-Musk-type guy who suggests that the real sad part of humans dying off is that we won't get to explore other planets. Brannen takes us directly from geological time to anthropocentricism so fast that its just jarring. Still, this is a great book. It's discussions of geological history are endlessly fascinating to me, someone who is not well versed in these things. A great companion book to N.K. Jemison's Broken Earth Trilogy. "
258,0062364820,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2129784-bonnie,4,"Most of us have no conception of the age of our planet, or how long it took for there to be any life at all. We tend to think of all the dinosaurs as living at the same time. It’s a shock when Brannen points out that Tyrannosaurus Rex is closer to us in time than it is to Stegosaurus.Brannen’s topic is the five previous major extinctions that have occurred on earth; we may be living through the sixth. Some took millions of years; others, like the extinction of the dinosaurs and virtually all life on earth, may have been instantaneous. Scientists are still trying to figure out exactly what happened. One of the pleasures of this book is learning about the unbelievable variety of animals that have lived on earth. Brannen provides vivid descriptions of the animals and their habitats. However, I found myself looking up the animals in order to get pictures. Toward the end of the book, he provides some illustrations, but the book could have used a lot more.I was a little irritated by his overwriting. Talking about the crocodiles that dominated the Triassic, he says, “This deposed royal family still hunts swamp margins and irritably moseys across gold courses…” Why irritably? Referring to the theory that an asteroid caused the extinction of the dinosaurs (and most of life on earth), Brannen says that the hadrosaurs, “settling down for a fitful sleep would nervously eye this strange new star…” Is there any reason to think that hadrosaurs would notice anything in the sky? Nor is his ascription of human attitudes limited to animals. Referring to the break-up of a supercontinent, he says that India “divorced” Gondwana and was “evidently unsentimental about this union.” Such anthropomorphism is cutesy and distracting.What are the implications of this history for us today? I’m not really sure. It’s possible that climate change will mean the end of the human species in 100 years or so – not close enough to affect me, but it will be horrible for my children and grandchildren. Or perhaps that won’t happen but in millions of years, the last animal on earth will die. That’s not so terrible, but the former is tragic."
259,0062364820,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5806439-ron,4,"This is an excellent survey of the five major extinction events that nearly wiped out all life on the planet. Though the style was a bit too gee-whiz for my taste, it did help lighten up what would be to some, a pretty grim story of asteroid strikes, vulcanism that makes Mt. St. Helens seem like a firecracker, and the deaths of gazillions. He does a great job of making the complex interplay of geology, biology, chemistry and--at least for one extinction event--astrophysics, accessible to the layperson. He managed to generate some mind benders, which is always appreciated. For instance, the planet we call earth existed for something like a billion years before complex life ever appeared, and that our time in existence is absolutely DWARFED by the reign of, say, the dinosaurs (and others). I knew all this, but he laid it out in a way that really made it sink in. There are plenty more factoids and anecdotes that make you stop reading for a moment and say WTF.The latter part of the book deals with the now and the future, with what some theorists say is a sixth mass extinction, already in progress, as well as other possible ways that our existence might end. Or continue. He did a good job presenting both sides of the Sixth Extinction debate, and never really got preachy about it. What did it leave me with? Well, we are certainly at a crossroads and have some very tough decisions ahead. Yes, that is an understatement...There was even a little philosophy thrown in about the significance (or lack of same), of human life to the planet and to existence as a whole. This was less effective for me, though with little wonder: how could you cover subjects in a single chapter that have kept thinkers busy for millennia? It has set the wheels turning in my own mind, which was probably the intent.It might strike some as depressing, to think we're kind of this mold that has spread across the globe in a really short time, and that species who could literally eat us for lunch ruled the globe for 160 *million* years and were wiped out nearly overnight. A subtext here, intentional or not, is that life--maybe not our life, but life-- is nothing if not persistent."
260,0062364820,http://goodreads.com/user/show/32091109-brian-turner,4,"Altogether, an interesting book about the worst mass extinction events in the fossil record, as well as en exploration of current climate change and future climate change possibilities.Written like a newspaper article, it peppers personal interludes and short interviews with information on changes in the geological past, which made for easy and accessible reading.Brannen does almost too good a job of describing how some of these scenarios might not just have played out, but may have also looked like in their aftermath. Probably the lasting image I'll take from this is the horrors of ocean acidification, especially on the scale seen at the worst-recorded extinction event at the end of the Permian period, aka, The Great Dying.Of course, this is pertinent to current climate change, and although the potential outcomes are clearly shown to be terrifying, it's also made clear that humanity still has a chance to avert the worst - time is still on our side, if we make the effort to act.However, a major flaw is that it is almost entirely focused on the role of the carbon-cycle. While the dangers of rising carbon-dioxide in the atmosphere are made clear time after time, it spends almost no time on the role of the sun on climate, and Milankovitch cycles get a brief single-sentence mention without even being named.Perhaps there is an argument that the carbon-cycle is the ultimate planetary thermostat, but it seems strange to focus so much on vulcanism and plate tectonics as major causes while ignoring variability in solar output itself, which is arguably a main driver.Even still, an interesting, engaging - and frightening - read.

I mean, Peter Brannen is writing about paleontology and climate change and the words just sing to you, make you see worlds that we actually know very little about and feel for ammonoids like there would be the cutest kittens, looking at you with big eyes and begging not to get extinct. As someone who wants to write himself someday, I really hate this guy. He is that good.That being said, The Ends of the World is a book about the major extinctions in Earth's history, their causes and how they relate to our present lives. It's a captivating read, evoking lost worlds and very carefully analyzing how they disappeared and why. There is humor, drama, interesting interviews with fascinating people. Dinosaurs? Puh-lease. This takes you back to the good old days of the Ediacaran and slowly brings you around our time and even speculates on what could come after us, the hubris filled species that, geologically speaking, was barely born yesterday - or a few seconds ago, depending on how you measure it - and has the chance to outshine all the other species that came, ruled and went.There is no way I can do it justice other than to say that I loved the book. In itself it's a summary of life on Earth so summarizing it myself would be pointless. I highly recommend it."
262,0062364820,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10586871-mark-dehate,4,"I really enjoyed this - I didn't have a lot of knowledge around past extinctions, other than some vague knowledge about an asteroid and the dinosaurs. I learned a ton about 'deep time' and all the various times that life on this planet was (nearly) wiped out. It's one of the things I love about books on space or, is it really gives me a totally different perspective on mankind's role in the universe. And, lots of nifty facts about how different a place everything was in the past.The book doesn't get super technical, which I really appreciate. I'm in it for the story, more than the nitty gritty detail. It only gets four stars because I really found the comparison to current climate change repetitive and frustrating. Nearly every extinction, the author points out how it's basically the same as what we're doing today. Yep, I get it, it's real bad, I totally agree. I just don't need to hear it over and over. The book's final chapter goes into more detail about what kind of havoc we're causing, and different ways that might end up - also fascinating to read.I listened to the audiobook version - it's not particularly notable, which I find to be excellent."

Highly recommended if you want to understand how human-driven climate change is bringing on an extinction caused by too much carbon dioxide in the atmosphere, much like the ones that came before...but way faster. It also points out some differences and actions that mankind can take that will help. In the end, it ends relatively positively (for a book on mass extinction, anyway), with the author pointing out that we aren't yey even closer to the level of chaos and destruction at the end of the Permian extinction, for instance, and that it is not too late to turn it around...but he does point out that one of the perils of educating about climate change is that it can seem super overwhelming and inevitable, which has the opposite effect than intended: it leads to a fatalism and resignation that the end is coming so why bother. It's important to avoid making it seem hopeless, is his point, and I like it."

Maybe six, if you accept that we're in the middle of one right now. The jury's still out on that one. Unless you're keeping up with the technical journals and conferences, you can throw out what you think you know about mass extinctions from your old college geology classes, reading books that are more than 10 years old, or watching PBS or Discovery.The author's style reminds me a lot of John McPhee. He did a lot of research by going out in the field with geologists and amateur fossil hunters, as well as interviewing numerous paleontologists and other geologists. But he keeps it interesting, even for people who don't know geology.To have a mass extinction event, a lot of catastrophic events have to happen more or less at the same geologic time. The asteroid impact at the Cretaceous-Tertiary boundary (blamed for killing the dinosaurs) probably wasn't enough by itself. But there's evidence that the impact restarted & intensified massive flood lava flows on the other side of the planet. Changes in carbon dioxide concentrations in the atmosphere and dissolved in the oceans play a key role. That's tied in with ocean acidification. Starting to sound familiar?There's a lot of discussion in this book about climate change. What does it mean? How bad is it compared to the geologic past? Is there really anything that humans can do to reverse it? Read on & find out. This book will probably change your perspective, even if you're a geology major."

Hey, it turns out we've only killed off less than 1% of the species on the planet so far, and in The Great Dying it was more like 99%. So that's a resilient planet you've got there, so far.I'm more hopeful for the long-term (100,000 years+) survival of complex life in general than I was before reading this, though less so for that of mammals in particular. Reptiles and birds are going to have a good run, though. On the other hand, it does start to feel more certain that another 50 years of life in Massachusetts may not be far north enough to expect political or technological stability.On the rough timeline of 100-500,000 years for this interglacial, 800 million years for life on the planet, and 100 trillion years for potential life in the galaxy, that starts to seem both less and more important. There's plenty of time for future chances at civilization-building life to develop, so it's less relevant if we don't hack it, but also, we may actually be pretty close to an exoplanetary threshold in tech, so it'd be a shame if we shot ourselves in the foot this close to that inflection point."

I have always been fascinated by the age of the world, pre-anthropological history, etc. I was engrossed by his descriptions of the world 500 million, 200 million years ago and it illustrates the absurdly small scale of humankind's existence here. Here's a short cliff notes - it's all about climate change. Climate change has led to the demise of basically everything on earth for 500 million years, in one way or another. And here we go again. As a writer, Peter Brannen has a gift to make the death of algae interesting and extremely readable. However, his final chapter shows the outsized impact we have had in relation to this short time on earth, and how the next decades are critical, even getting into AI and cosmological settlement. It's beyond an ambitious scope at only 300 pages, covering 500 million years of history, that he executes beautifully for a lay audience at least.

Brannen's attention to detail enabled a vivid depiction of each geological period, creating a kind of obituary for the former worlds of our planet. I especially enjoyed his discussion of the Ordovician and Permian extinctions; too often the dinosaurs (somewhat deservedly) capture the public attention, and so learning about these even more ancient planets was fascinating to me.I appreciated too that the book is essentially a covert analysis of the tenuous link between climate and life on this planet; virtually every extinction is caused by massive climate change. True, in some cases a supervolcano or asteroid might aid the process along, but the end result is still the same. Later chapters focussing on a potential Holocene extinction and the extinctions of the far-future (including all life itself) would make for a fascinating book in their own right.Brannen's writing is sobering and sweet, neither full of doom nor hope. A few strange turns of phrase (describing a group of scientists as autistic stands out as particularly unfortunate) do not wholly detract from some of the best science writing I've read in the last few years."

Things like that meteor was really bad for the dinosaurs, but that wasn't the only thing that was going on that wiped them out. Except for their descendants, the birds. It also discusses our current situation regarding the effects of climate change and what we are doing to exacerbate our own end. OK, we are speeding things up A LOT, and that's far from a good thing, but it's been coming for a while, and maybe we aren't the apex of life the way we think we are.

It is hard to imagine a better written or more thoroughly researched book on the Big five extinctions. Peter Brannen covers all sides of scientific debates (e.g., about Deccan traps and the extinction of the dinosaurs). And he includes a lot of detail—maybe too much detail. Even still, so much of what he covers is simply fascinating, from the planet’s first trees in the Devonian (now in NY, about an hour outside of Albany), to the importance of north-south coastline length for surviving climate change, to the geology of Gettysburg (“The gradual slope up Cemetery Ridge where Pickett’s charge met its grisly fate is shaped by the underlying magmatic plumbing of End-Triassic volcanism,” p. 156). Growing up I wanted to be a geologist, so maybe that is why I loved all the details. But even if you skim the details, you would still get a lot out of the book. Are concerns about a human-caused sixth extinction overblown? What lies ahead for earth in the next 100 years? How about in the next 800 million? Does the earth’s past offer insights into what is happening now and what will likely happen in the future? Brannen will answer all of these questions, and more. One more thing: read the footnotes.

The Palisades Sill is not a basalt, it is a diabase sill, making it an intrusive igneous rock, which crystallizes in place and was never at the surface as the word basalt implies. Yes it crystallized from a basaltic magma but not at the surface. I’m very surprised that the geologists he spoke to did not correct him on this. Not sure I can believe anything else in the book. "
280,0062364820,http://goodreads.com/user/show/80750585-claudia,3,"Great deal of information about the five major extinctions that have occurred on our amazing planet. Unfortunately, it is only geological records that are providing the tantalizing glimpses into the past and the further back in time, the smaller those glimpses are. Especially when you consider that the only life on the planet was microbial and basically gelatinous. There was nothing to preserve except in the most extraordinary circumstances. In fact, any fossil remnant or petrified bone is an example of profound luck.Anyway, back to the book - This took me quite a while to get through. The early chapters - dealing with the earliest extinctions - were far more theory since geological records of those times give only the most shadowy hints of what happened. And some theories could be based on happenings that actually occurred hundreds of thousands if not millions of years apart. Even the extinction of the dinosaurs which is blamed on an asteroid may have also been due to a massive volcanic eruption that buried India under 2 miles of lava near the same time. The planet's diverse species likely could not withstand both assaults.But life on Earth is very resilient and even if over half the planet's species go extinct in less than a million years (technically what an extinction event is), there are still more willing to fill in those now-empty niches.I must admit that a bit of knowledge in geology, climatology and paleontology would be helpful while reading this work since it will make some of the theories and concepts clearer. Perhaps the hardest part for the general reader to accept is the depth of time. We are lucky to know someone that has lived a hundred years. The U.S. gained it's independence 350 years ago. Rome, the eternal city, was founded over two thousand years ago. The Egyptians erected the Great Pyramid about 2500 years before that. So millions and billions of years - most would have difficulty even conceptualizing the notion.Of course, it had to end with the next expected mass extinction - whether it is due to carbon emissions driving up the temperatures and the acidifying of the oceans where various species are unable to adapt or the continents merging back into one with the center being a sere landscape with little to no water flowing or even the sun entering the last stages of it's own lifespan. So it may be within the next couple centuries . . . or 800 million years in the future.2019-187"

282,0062364820,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4162791-claudia-putnam,4,"Well, that was certainly exciting! After the rippling prose of Andrew Knoll's Life on a Younger Planet, and the astounded reverence of John McPhee's Basin and Range, Brannen's writing is a little too boppy and headlong for my taste. You can't just hurl yourself through 500 million years or so. It's kind of puppylike--I'm sure some people like that about him. Nevertheless. A lot to learn here. I did laugh out loud at the first 3 billion years of evolution so rapturously described by Knoll as the wellspring of life being portrayed by Brannen as ""sluggishy sucking up organic gunk in the disgusting seas of primordial earth."" It turns out there have been more than the 5 mass extinctions everybody (you didn't know? well, brush up) talks about, with us possibly about to trigger the 6th. Snowball Earth, a series of catastrophic glaciations in the middle of the early Slime Period (my term, but I doubt I'm the first to think it up), when complex nucleated bacteria were starting to take hold and were nearly annihilated, was likely the first. Then, as Brannen notes, the sluggish gunk suckers were pretty much wiped out when something called, no lie, penis worms, came along and started burrowing in the (shallow) ocean floors. This stirred up a lot of dirt and also changed the oxygen/carbon/nitrogen/methane ratios in the water and probably air. The atmosphere and sea still weren't too O2-heavy but it was enough to trigger the Cambrian Explosion of (relatively) complex animal life. Which wiped out the sluggy frondy stuff that had existed previously. Even though this is is not really something the book is concerned with, it sort of is, because shows how one species messes with the environment and everyone else dies. ""A sentiment exists--particularly among non-scientists--that the idea of humans seriously disrupting the planet on a geological scale is mere anthropocentric hubris. But this sentiment misunderstands the history of life. In the geological past, seemingly small innovations have reorganized the planet's chemistry, hurling it into drastic phase changes. Surely humans might be as significant as the filter feeding animals of the Cambrian Explosion.""Later it's pointed out that mass extinctions have occurred without the help of overfishing, overhunting, overgrazing, etc, etc. So, minus these two extinctions, we have 5 to discuss. Let's define what we mean by mass extinction: >75% of life on earth, sea and land, wiped out. That 75% figure is for the end-triassic, when the dinosaurs, the most successful species ever, bit the dust, so to speak. That extinction was the mildest of the 5. The worst was the end-Permian, about 252 million years ago, when around 96% of the planet died and the oceans went anoxic. Recovery period: 30 million years. No Netflix series featuring a hardy band of survivors for that one, guys. Brannen mentions that Doug Erwin, who wrote Extinction, which is next on my list, and which focuses on this event, might have consulted with Cormac McCarthy when he was writing The Road. Or perhaps the screenplay. He's not admitting to that. (What gets to me about the dinosaur event? Only two reptilian four-legged species survived. One of them was the leathernecked sea turtle. Endangered now. By us.)All these events have involved massive increases of carbon into the atmosphere via volcanism (yes, I know you think it was an asteroid with the dinosaurs, but there have been other cases of impacts of around the same size with no mass extinction...at the same time the dinosaur asteroid hit, half of India was erupting). One was very gradual. The other 4 were not. It turns out that it isn't so much about the amount of carbon but the rate at which it is added. At some point, it appears there is a tipping point. What that means is that there is a disruption in the food chain. This food chain thing is a web and it's affected in a chaotic way. At some point there is a critical disruption that can't be recovered from. Everything dies off fairly suddenly.Are we in the middle of an extinction event now? That is, are we penis worms? Or are we the equivalent of these massive volcanoes, bringing carbon out of the ground and spewing it into the air? Well, on the one hand, the amount of carbon we've put into the atmosphere is nowhere near equal, in volume, to what was seen during the Permian or Triassic events. On the other, the rate we're spewing is faster than anything ever recorded in geology. It's the rate that matters.And we're messing with our environment, penis-worm-like, in other ways. Converting wildland to farmland. Paradise to parking lot. Putting nitrogen into the ocean. Killing plankton. That plankton thing really is key. Bottom of the food chain thing--turns up time and time again as a Bad Sign. So do dead and dying reefs. So, are we? Well, if we are, it didn't take us long. Any future geologists, arising out of some future slime, or re-evolving from rat or insect, would look at the anthropocene, or the primacene, and maybe not even recognize us. There will be a layer of carbon, microplastics, steroids, nitrogen. A few primate fossils might survive, but maybe not even enough to know which humans were significant or responsible for microplastics, etc. The time layer between us and Lucy may not be geologically significant--they won't be able to tell which came first. They might think Neanderthals made the plastics. Probably not, but maybe. (This is me rambling on, not Brannen.) This extinction will be EXTREMELY mysterious unless an asteroid happens to hit right after, because we'll be gone, and our cities will erode away completely. There won't be any volcanism, unless coincidentally there is within the next 60,000 years. Since there will be so little trace of us, they won't know what happened this time. Well if we are in an extinction, says one of the scientists, I think it's Erwin, there's no way we're turning it back. It's not about carbon sinks, or stopping global warming. This is a horse that has way left the barn. So he says, no. I got the idea he says no because there's no point in thinking yes. I think another expert in these matters, Peter Ward, thinks yes. I think yes. The reason I think yes is that we're asking the question. I think we sense it. If we notice enough to ask, then yes. There's a whole field of psychology called eco-psych. It does a bunch of different things, but one aspect is address a growing sense of despair/depression over what's happening to the planet. Don't you feel it? Consider that orca carrying her dead baby all those days, over two weeks, as it rotted on her back. She and her pod were on a march. Back and forth, up and down the coast. Don't you think? They wanted us to see. They are starving and sick. Their young are dying. They're ancient, they're not in denial. They wanted us to know what they know. Back to the slime. Which, luckily, is the wellspring of life. Something interesting is bound to come of it. There's enough time before the supernova. "
283,0062364820,http://goodreads.com/user/show/52174518-rebecca,1,"I was so looking forward to this book! But I found it almost unreadable. There was no order to anything. The paragraphs went all over the place. It was as if the author took a scientific narrative, cut it up with scissors, made a collage, and then put emoji stickers all over it. I just could not follow it. And there was no chart or timeline of the eras to refer to, no organized visuals that would have made up for the word salad that was the text. Also, Brannen took what I thought were unscientific liberties with his fanciful adjectives and frivolous, ""fun"" descriptions. It is possible to write about science in a fun way (Mary Roach), but sadly, the fun here was just pointless and distracting. Very disappointing, for what should have been an utterly fascinating book (given the subject). DNF. Actually, CNF...could not finish."
284,0062364820,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3424260-kerry,5,"Brannen is able to take complex events, break them down into understandable parts, and then describe how they interact; reconstructing the original event so that you understand it in all its complexity. He does this again and again, moving from the origin of the earth into the future constructing a view of earth's history that is breathtaking."

286,0062364820,http://goodreads.com/user/show/23785775-julia,3," This was one book that not only has a somewhat colorful and interesting cover but also a lengthy name that inspires those who may be quite interested in the subject. Otherwise if you aren't interested in the subject or even nonfiction writing in truth than I would most definitely steer clear of this book since it isn't one that is for beginners. The author does a great job in actually breaking down the book into the different mass extinctions and giving the year that it has been recorded at. As a result the reader gets to be introduced into the timeframe, what may have been lurking around as the superstar(s) of the cast and then possible events that could have been triggers to these mass events. Besides this information there are also stories told about places where the rock record can be found for those events as well as the leaders of the fields and their belief and/or teaching to help clarify up the information being presented. At the same time there was a small collection of artwork and pictures of some of the briefest moments found in the book. I wish that I had known about them beforehand or even better that they were actually included in the middle of the book instead of way in the back as if they were tucked there as in second thought for they allowed the reader another glimpse into the information that was being read about.  As for what I didn't like was the fact that the book seemed so repetitive. Although the events that seemed to trigger the mass extinctions were almost similar to each other and some of their effects were also similar I didn't need to know repeatedly and repeatedly how we are so close to making these disasters almost upon us but not quite yet. As a result the last two chapters in the book were basically an expansion of all the information that the reader had been introduced as to what we are doing to not fix the problem, how the issues we are doing now will contribute to our own downfall, how there are two sides of the camp with some thinking that we are still good to go until the end arrives and how others aren't, etc. Once or twice would have been enough while if you had wanted to include those chapters than you should have saved the information to be used just in the chapters. All in all it was fun getting to know some more about the other organisms that have shared the spotlight of life and also the events that we cannot imagine that have come to life in their own majestic time under the old sun such as the traps, the evolution of plants and the super continents. Otherwise quite wordy and repetitive this book again is only for those who are quite dedicated to these fields of science and/or are interested in getting to know more about events that have been largely ignored by the general public over the last few decades."
287,0062364820,http://goodreads.com/user/show/53250130-easton-smith,4,"What a horror: the sixth extinction. To think that we, humans, have essentially recreated the sort of poisonous conditions that have, in the past, wiped out nearly every living being on this planet. What a relief: that if we do manage to wipe ourselves out, at least something will survive, and the world will repopulate with all kinds of beings we could never imagine. Those were my opposing moods throughout reading this decently-written popular science book. Geological time helps me to have perspective, which can be a salve (when thinking about how much longer the earth will live) or a knock on the head (when thinking about how our actions will ripple out for millions of years). Brannen does a good job of showing both of these angles, even if he does occasionally repeat himself. I did feel like every few pages he had to reiterate the central storyline of the book (but little did the crustaceans know, Armageddon was coming...). He also tended to present the science behind it all in a bit of a reductive way. He would explore a series of climatic and geological problems that might have occurred in history, and then usually reduce them all to CO2. While this surely helped drive home our current crisis, it did at times feel like he was shaving off a bunch of complexity. This is, perhaps, necessary in this kind of book, but I would have really appreciated a section in the beginning where he lays out his methodology. It would have helped me trust his streamlined conclusions a bit more. I also have some hesitations about the author's discussions of humanity's more recent history and our coming future. He is somewhat dismissive of Native American scholarship that suggests they did not extinct North American megafauna during pre-colonial times (I understand his objections, but it could have been more carefully written). But what bothered me the most was the way that he finishes off with a discussion with some futurist-technology-will-save-us-Elon-Musk-type guy who suggests that the real sad part of humans dying off is that we won't get to explore other planets. Brannen takes us directly from geological time to anthropocentricism so fast that its just jarring. Still, this is a great book. It's discussions of geological history are endlessly fascinating to me, someone who is not well versed in these things. A great companion book to N.K. Jemison's Broken Earth Trilogy. "
288,0062364820,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2129784-bonnie,4,"Most of us have no conception of the age of our planet, or how long it took for there to be any life at all. We tend to think of all the dinosaurs as living at the same time. It’s a shock when Brannen points out that Tyrannosaurus Rex is closer to us in time than it is to Stegosaurus.Brannen’s topic is the five previous major extinctions that have occurred on earth; we may be living through the sixth. Some took millions of years; others, like the extinction of the dinosaurs and virtually all life on earth, may have been instantaneous. Scientists are still trying to figure out exactly what happened. One of the pleasures of this book is learning about the unbelievable variety of animals that have lived on earth. Brannen provides vivid descriptions of the animals and their habitats. However, I found myself looking up the animals in order to get pictures. Toward the end of the book, he provides some illustrations, but the book could have used a lot more.I was a little irritated by his overwriting. Talking about the crocodiles that dominated the Triassic, he says, “This deposed royal family still hunts swamp margins and irritably moseys across gold courses…” Why irritably? Referring to the theory that an asteroid caused the extinction of the dinosaurs (and most of life on earth), Brannen says that the hadrosaurs, “settling down for a fitful sleep would nervously eye this strange new star…” Is there any reason to think that hadrosaurs would notice anything in the sky? Nor is his ascription of human attitudes limited to animals. Referring to the break-up of a supercontinent, he says that India “divorced” Gondwana and was “evidently unsentimental about this union.” Such anthropomorphism is cutesy and distracting.What are the implications of this history for us today? I’m not really sure. It’s possible that climate change will mean the end of the human species in 100 years or so – not close enough to affect me, but it will be horrible for my children and grandchildren. Or perhaps that won’t happen but in millions of years, the last animal on earth will die. That’s not so terrible, but the former is tragic."
289,0062364820,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5806439-ron,4,"This is an excellent survey of the five major extinction events that nearly wiped out all life on the planet. Though the style was a bit too gee-whiz for my taste, it did help lighten up what would be to some, a pretty grim story of asteroid strikes, vulcanism that makes Mt. St. Helens seem like a firecracker, and the deaths of gazillions. He does a great job of making the complex interplay of geology, biology, chemistry and--at least for one extinction event--astrophysics, accessible to the layperson. He managed to generate some mind benders, which is always appreciated. For instance, the planet we call earth existed for something like a billion years before complex life ever appeared, and that our time in existence is absolutely DWARFED by the reign of, say, the dinosaurs (and others). I knew all this, but he laid it out in a way that really made it sink in. There are plenty more factoids and anecdotes that make you stop reading for a moment and say WTF.The latter part of the book deals with the now and the future, with what some theorists say is a sixth mass extinction, already in progress, as well as other possible ways that our existence might end. Or continue. He did a good job presenting both sides of the Sixth Extinction debate, and never really got preachy about it. What did it leave me with? Well, we are certainly at a crossroads and have some very tough decisions ahead. Yes, that is an understatement...There was even a little philosophy thrown in about the significance (or lack of same), of human life to the planet and to existence as a whole. This was less effective for me, though with little wonder: how could you cover subjects in a single chapter that have kept thinkers busy for millennia? It has set the wheels turning in my own mind, which was probably the intent.It might strike some as depressing, to think we're kind of this mold that has spread across the globe in a really short time, and that species who could literally eat us for lunch ruled the globe for 160 *million* years and were wiped out nearly overnight. A subtext here, intentional or not, is that life--maybe not our life, but life-- is nothing if not persistent."
290,0062364820,http://goodreads.com/user/show/32091109-brian-turner,4,"Altogether, an interesting book about the worst mass extinction events in the fossil record, as well as en exploration of current climate change and future climate change possibilities.Written like a newspaper article, it peppers personal interludes and short interviews with information on changes in the geological past, which made for easy and accessible reading.Brannen does almost too good a job of describing how some of these scenarios might not just have played out, but may have also looked like in their aftermath. Probably the lasting image I'll take from this is the horrors of ocean acidification, especially on the scale seen at the worst-recorded extinction event at the end of the Permian period, aka, The Great Dying.Of course, this is pertinent to current climate change, and although the potential outcomes are clearly shown to be terrifying, it's also made clear that humanity still has a chance to avert the worst - time is still on our side, if we make the effort to act.However, a major flaw is that it is almost entirely focused on the role of the carbon-cycle. While the dangers of rising carbon-dioxide in the atmosphere are made clear time after time, it spends almost no time on the role of the sun on climate, and Milankovitch cycles get a brief single-sentence mention without even being named.Perhaps there is an argument that the carbon-cycle is the ultimate planetary thermostat, but it seems strange to focus so much on vulcanism and plate tectonics as major causes while ignoring variability in solar output itself, which is arguably a main driver.Even still, an interesting, engaging - and frightening - read.

I mean, Peter Brannen is writing about paleontology and climate change and the words just sing to you, make you see worlds that we actually know very little about and feel for ammonoids like there would be the cutest kittens, looking at you with big eyes and begging not to get extinct. As someone who wants to write himself someday, I really hate this guy. He is that good.That being said, The Ends of the World is a book about the major extinctions in Earth's history, their causes and how they relate to our present lives. It's a captivating read, evoking lost worlds and very carefully analyzing how they disappeared and why. There is humor, drama, interesting interviews with fascinating people. Dinosaurs? Puh-lease. This takes you back to the good old days of the Ediacaran and slowly brings you around our time and even speculates on what could come after us, the hubris filled species that, geologically speaking, was barely born yesterday - or a few seconds ago, depending on how you measure it - and has the chance to outshine all the other species that came, ruled and went.There is no way I can do it justice other than to say that I loved the book. In itself it's a summary of life on Earth so summarizing it myself would be pointless. I highly recommend it."

I learned a ton about 'deep time' and all the various times that life on this planet was (nearly) wiped out. It's one of the things I love about books on space or, is it really gives me a totally different perspective on mankind's role in the universe. And, lots of nifty facts about how different a place everything was in the past.The book doesn't get super technical, which I really appreciate. I'm in it for the story, more than the nitty gritty detail. It only gets four stars because I really found the comparison to current climate change repetitive and frustrating. Nearly every extinction, the author points out how it's basically the same as what we're doing today. Yep, I get it, it's real bad, I totally agree. I just don't need to hear it over and over. The book's final chapter goes into more detail about what kind of havoc we're causing, and different ways that might end up - also fascinating to read.I listened to the audiobook version - it's not particularly notable, which I find to be excellent."
293,0062364820,http://goodreads.com/user/show/31309611-amber,4,"Lots to ponder in here, especially since I present talks on climate change and extinction daily as part of my work. Highly recommended if you want to understand how human-driven climate change is bringing on an extinction caused by too much carbon dioxide in the atmosphere, much like the ones that came before...but way faster. It also points out some differences and actions that mankind can take that will help. In the end, it ends relatively positively (for a book on mass extinction, anyway), with the author pointing out that we aren't yey even closer to the level of chaos and destruction at the end of the Permian extinction, for instance, and that it is not too late to turn it around...but he does point out that one of the perils of educating about climate change is that it can seem super overwhelming and inevitable, which has the opposite effect than intended: it leads to a fatalism and resignation that the end is coming so why bother. It's important to avoid making it seem hopeless, is his point, and I like it."

Maybe six, if you accept that we're in the middle of one right now. The jury's still out on that one. Unless you're keeping up with the technical journals and conferences, you can throw out what you think you know about mass extinctions from your old college geology classes, reading books that are more than 10 years old, or watching PBS or Discovery.The author's style reminds me a lot of John McPhee. He did a lot of research by going out in the field with geologists and amateur fossil hunters, as well as interviewing numerous paleontologists and other geologists. But he keeps it interesting, even for people who don't know geology.To have a mass extinction event, a lot of catastrophic events have to happen more or less at the same geologic time. The asteroid impact at the Cretaceous-Tertiary boundary (blamed for killing the dinosaurs) probably wasn't enough by itself. But there's evidence that the impact restarted & intensified massive flood lava flows on the other side of the planet. Changes in carbon dioxide concentrations in the atmosphere and dissolved in the oceans play a key role. That's tied in with ocean acidification. Starting to sound familiar?There's a lot of discussion in this book about climate change. What does it mean? How bad is it compared to the geologic past? Is there really anything that humans can do to reverse it? Read on & find out. This book will probably change your perspective, even if you're a geology major."
295,0062364820,http://goodreads.com/user/show/286888-ryn,4,"Successfully conveys a sense of scope for comparison of today's anthropocene extinction status to the K-T and other ""real"" mass extinction events. Hey, it turns out we've only killed off less than 1% of the species on the planet so far, and in The Great Dying it was more like 99%. So that's a resilient planet you've got there, so far.I'm more hopeful for the long-term (100,000 years+) survival of complex life in general than I was before reading this, though less so for that of mammals in particular. Reptiles and birds are going to have a good run, though. On the other hand, it does start to feel more certain that another 50 years of life in Massachusetts may not be far north enough to expect political or technological stability.On the rough timeline of 100-500,000 years for this interglacial, 800 million years for life on the planet, and 100 trillion years for potential life in the galaxy, that starts to seem both less and more important. There's plenty of time for future chances at civilization-building life to develop, so it's less relevant if we don't hack it, but also, we may actually be pretty close to an exoplanetary threshold in tech, so it'd be a shame if we shot ourselves in the foot this close to that inflection point."

I have always been fascinated by the age of the world, pre-anthropological history, etc. I was engrossed by his descriptions of the world 500 million, 200 million years ago and it illustrates the absurdly small scale of humankind's existence here. Here's a short cliff notes - it's all about climate change. Climate change has led to the demise of basically everything on earth for 500 million years, in one way or another. And here we go again. As a writer, Peter Brannen has a gift to make the death of algae interesting and extremely readable. However, his final chapter shows the outsized impact we have had in relation to this short time on earth, and how the next decades are critical, even getting into AI and cosmological settlement. It's beyond an ambitious scope at only 300 pages, covering 500 million years of history, that he executes beautifully for a lay audience at least. I wish I could force every religious person I know to read it."

The final chapters are devoted to what may be the Sixth Great Extinction but caused not just by natural forces but by humankind's hellbent destruction of habitat as well as striving to put aeons' worth of carbon back into the atmosphere. A sobering book which adequately explains the mechanisms that drove the previous extinctions and their relevance to events in the last millennia.

298,0062364820,http://goodreads.com/user/show/56646301-colin-ennis,5,"Fascinating review of major extinction events in the Earth's history. Brannen's attention to detail enabled a vivid depiction of each geological period, creating a kind of obituary for the former worlds of our planet. I especially enjoyed his discussion of the Ordovician and Permian extinctions; too often the dinosaurs (somewhat deservedly) capture the public attention, and so learning about these even more ancient planets was fascinating to me.I appreciated too that the book is essentially a covert analysis of the tenuous link between climate and life on this planet; virtually every extinction is caused by massive climate change. True, in some cases a supervolcano or asteroid might aid the process along, but the end result is still the same. Later chapters focussing on a potential Holocene extinction and the extinctions of the far-future (including all life itself) would make for a fascinating book in their own right.Brannen's writing is sobering and sweet, neither full of doom nor hope. A few strange turns of phrase (describing a group of scientists as autistic stands out as particularly unfortunate) do not wholly detract from some of the best science writing I've read in the last few years."
