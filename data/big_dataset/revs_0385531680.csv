0,0385531680,http://goodreads.com/user/show/851956-gerard,4,"A welcome antidote to Malcolm Gladwell's lazy but satisfying answers. But, it ends abrup"
1,0385531680,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1533440-al-bit,2,"This book starts off reasonably well: the first half is devoted to giving us many examples of the failure or inadequacy of 'common sense' to explain or predict the world we live in. The most interesting underlying concept, for me, is that in this world, ALL knowledge is generated and developed for the purposes of prediction: we collect data, develop hypotheses to back up certain patterns we perceive or deduce from that data, and then use these patterns (usually in the form of mathematical formulae) to predict what the future will bring, thus allowing us to devote our resources to benefit most from our predictions. The fact is that in reality such predictions often can and do go disastrously wrong; and then when we re-examine the actual results, we fool ourselves into believing that of course, what resulted was 'common sense'. Watts points out that with such hindsight our vision is always 20/20, but that is an illusion, and if we take it seriously, a delusion as well.It is in the second half of the book, when our sociologist author starts talking about thinking differently, that the work becomes more an apologia for sociology, but using modern technological capabilities to enable us to predict the present. It is perhaps an attribute to the cleverness of the writing that we could easily actually accept that phrase: predicting the present. What he really seems to be arguing about is that, through the use of such technologies as the Internet, Twitter, Facebook, Google, Yahoo! etc. we can cheaply and very quickly establish vastly huge 'data' bases on the preferences of the individual subscribers at any one time, and from which data applied probability theory will 'predict' how these preferences will result in specific purchases 'now'. Note there is nothing 'predictive' about this: it is merely extensive data collection at an incredibly fast rate; the normal distribution curve based on this data will then take the normal standard deviation as being the area which will provide the greatest 'dividends' to any company willing and able to provide the desired products quickly and immediately to satisfy those preferences. This will thus no doubt give the illusion that the result has been 'predicted', but in fact it hasn't been. Since this is exactly the same process as the very techniques used in the first part of the book, which the author argues is basically useless, one can hardly trust, in my opinion, in any long-term benefits of this new strategy. It is the speed of the technology that creates the illusion that one is identifying the most profitable products, and as long as we can quickly respond to these ephemera quickly enough, all will be well in market-town. This, too, is 'common sense'.Our author wants this 'speed-up' ability to be perpetually and continually used by sociologists as a kind of groundwork for the development of a 'science' for the future, and that all corporations worth their salt should make extensive use of this as the necessary basis to establish sociology as a justifiable and real science. He is wrong. It seems to me that instead he is putting his trust in instant immediate response on all levels which, in reality, will be forever 'instantly' changing practically day by day, and which will become increasingly more ephemeral and illusory as a result. What he is proposing is scientism, not science; and serious social dangers lie therein.What I think the book was saying in the beginning is that all predictions as to how or why people act on the information available to them are inherently fallible; the conclusion would be that we should stop doing it, since it is all pretty much a waste of time and money. The same conclusion should be applied to the author's proposed 'solution' — so for me this book ends up by cutting the ground from under its own feet."

His criticism of Nassim Taleb's ""Black Swan"" events3. Great summaries of various behavioral economics/policy/psychology/sociological experiments4. Further proof that Nozick was wrong and Rawls/Sandel are right (obviously)"
3,0385531680,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3749410-aaron-arnold,5,"This is frequently described as a book on common sense, which it is, but more importantly it's an investigation on human cognitive limits more generally and also a call to radically restructure the discipline of sociology in light of modern advances in technology. Sociology often gets made fun of in the hierarchies of academic disciplines, but Watts argues that there are reasons why sociology seems so vague and unscientific: not only are sociological problems very complicated in ways that physics problems like orbital mechanics are not, but in addition to the fact that only now do we have the ability to run experiments to truly test our long-held prejudices about ourselves and how society works, our problem-solving skills are themselves subject to those same prejudices. It's a tall order, and though inevitably the chapters pointing out problems are stronger than the chapters suggesting ways to do better, I think this is an excellent synthesis of a lot of good information and a solid guide to outlining future research directions.That human beings have cognitive biases is well-known, especially to readers of any Dan Ariely or Daniel Kahneman book, but the thing about them is that even if you know what they are and how they work, you're almost guaranteed to fall prey to them constantly anyway. ""Common sense"" is a powerful tool for navigating the complexities of life, but common sense is often just shorthand for a set of fallible mental shortcuts whose workings are almost invisible to us, and whose failures are only excusable by the fact that everyone else has all the same failures too. We use many heuristics to guide us through life, and those rules of thumb are often incoherent (Watts gives examples of proverbs that contradict each other like ""look before you leap"" vs ""he who hesitates is lost""). This extends even down to the level of deeply held and supposedly universal beliefs about justice - when you play the ultimatum game or other simple exercises in game theory with people from different cultures, people behave in strikingly different ways due to cultural norms, and those cultural norms are themselves very difficult to clearly articulate or justify. His brief discussion of the extent to which what we think of as universal institutions like the market system vary dramatically throughout time reminded me a bit of Karl Polanyi's insights about how embedded capitalism is within culture and how unnatural in a way that is.But the main issue is that ""common sense"" simply isn't designed to solve the kinds of sociological problems we now find ourselves encountering. Here Watts goes on a brief tour of some sociocultural phenomena like performance-based financial incentives, and how baffling the evidence is that they do anything at all. Not only are the effects relative to your peers (i.e. a $10,000 bonus can still be disappointing if everyone else got $20,000), but they're also relative to where you were before, and the bar for what prompts additional effort can keep being raised. Even high-value bonuses in both relative and absolute terms can have little effect on performance if what's being measured is unclear or easily gamed (think teachers being paid more for student achievement or Wall Street bankers paid for paper profits), and yet even after mounds of evidence undermining the case for simple performance metrics, it is guaranteed that you will hear someone think that the ""common sense"" insight that paying someone more will automatically result in better quality is essentially irrefutable.Other examples are no less interesting. Watts poses some simple questions about the Mona Lisa: what makes the Mona Lisa the most famous painting in the world? Would the Mona Lisa's qualities have been apparent at 1700 when it was painted? What are the features that we currently consider it as having that no other painting does? Are there other paintings that share similar qualities, whether by da Vinci or someone else? Why aren't they as famous? Steady investigation shows that attempts to justify the painting's #1 ranking are either specious, examples of circular reasoning - ""the Mona Lisa is the best because it has the qualities of the Mona Lisa [e.g. style, composition, brushwork, the smile, etc] and not something else"" - or simply arbitrary, because as he shows, the Mona Lisa was not actually acclaimed with its current status as Best Painting Ever until a dramatic theft attempt in the early 20th century. The real reason it's the Primo Painting is basically that SOME painting has to be, and it really is arbitrary to some extent which one ends up with the top spot.This has dramatic implications for any field where ranking depends on somewhat subjective factors (i.e. almost all fields). Music immediately leaps to mind, and Watts relates experiments he's run where people are asked to rank random songs both independently and also with the ability to see what other people have ranked those songs. Unsurprisingly, herd behavior and ""trendiness"" arises immediately when the equivalent of a Billboard chart is introduced to the experiment, which is something I've noticed myself when using software like last.fm that provides statistics on the music I listen to. Social network technology can just as easily be used to reinforce traditional hierarchies as to eliminate them. People ending up liking things simply because other people like them, and the implication is that many universally acclaimed bands are acclaimed not so much for any intrinsic merit as simple network effects. The same logic, with the slight complication of timing, extends to other ""why this and not that"" cases like Facebook's success and MySpace's failure, Minitel and the Internet, VHS and Betamex, etc etc. A slight initial random push might be enough to one product the edge over another in the cumulative advantage race, and only retrospectively are people able to offer countless competing and equally arbitrary theories on what that initial push was.One implication of this line of reasoning that seems to disturb people is that a lot of life, including huge multi-billion dollar phenomena like why Harry Potter is so popular and not so many other superficially very similar YA series, is basically random. To put it another way, outcomes in a wide range of human endeavors that seem to depend greatly on human initiative follow simple statistical distributions that can also describe things like the outcomes of coin flips. What does that say about the common sense understanding of our own ""specialness"" or of our intuition that the world is divided into a few very influential people and many ordinary people? What does that say about our ability to predict the future to the extent that we follow strategies that leverage ""specialness"", as in trying to find ""the next Harry Potter"" or ""the next Apple"", or by trying to advertise to influential people in the hopes that they will influence their followers? After all, if you knew just the right social levers to push, you could do just about anything. Since we all know that special people are out there, waiting to be found, how do we identify their specialness and find them?The problem is that in many cases, the special people, or the levers of history, are only able to be identified after the fact. As an example, Watts picks on Malcolm Gladwell for trying to figure out why Paul Revere is so famous while a guy named William Dawes, who went on a seemingly very similar ride at the same time, is virtually unknown today. Gladwell says that Revere was a ""connector"", a man unusually well-suited to his task of warning all the people on his route as opposed to the undistinguished Dawes; Watts says that nothing about Revere's current fame was destined at all, and if their routes had been swapped there's absolutely no reason to think that we wouldn't have identical ""one if by land, two if by sea"" poems about Dawes instead. Revere was simply in the right place at the right time, and it was only after the fact that people decided there must have been something unusual about him and his place in such a dramatic event in US history. The same story holds true with music or books: every book publisher in the world would love to be able to find ""the next JK Rowling"", but all save the lucky one couldn't even find the original JK Rowling, who was rejected many times. To many ostensibly well-trained people, there just wasn't anything about her work that seemed to stand out among the countless manuscripts of fantasy young adult novels they read every year (related quick prediction: Rowling's new non-fiction novel is probably pretty decent, but has a 0% chance of ever being placed in the canon alongside her Harry Potter work).This is at root due to the fact that our brain is hard-wired to look for patterns and narratives even in realms where those metaphors are fundamentally inapplicable. History is another great example. Take the idea of the storming of the Bastille being a central event in the French Revolution, worthy of becoming the central national holiday of France. Could someone have known at the time that that particular event among all the chaos of the Revolution would have been so influential? Obviously not, but this means that all history is essentially a competition in storytelling, and that prediction in the Laplacian sense of perfect foreknowledge is impossible even if Newtonian physics were true. This notion has obvious relevance for important institutions like futures markets or business more generally. Rather than repeat myself, I'll just say that in the business sections Watts reiterates that people fall prey to all the same issues of mis-narrating history, learning the wrong lessons from the past, engaging in circular reasoning about why certain things are successful, believing that people are more special than they are, and assuming due to the halo effect that what is doing well now must have all sorts of other great attributes. (As a related note, David Romer had an excellent paper in 2006 called ""Do Firms Maximize? Evidence from Professional Football"" discussing how coaches systematically fail to maximize their expected points by failing to go for it on 4th down, simply because there are prevailing irrational norms about what constitutes acceptable risk; this predates the infamous Patriots 4th-and-2 against the Colts in 2008 but is still worth reading).I'm not sure that all types of prediction are necessarily equal; off the top of my head, I would say that a book like The Limits to Growth, with its carefully-sourced numbers and logical formulae, should be looked at as a more credible forecast than a hedge fund prospectus. However, even if most attempts at predicting the future fail, and it seems best to just stick to simple models like always betting on the home team (which at a 58% success rate is within 3% of the best and most sophisticated algorithms you can concoct), there are important things you can do to reduce the failures, and hence resolve some of the issues raised in the rest of the book. It's not like you can act like the future is completely random; we have a drive to speculate for a reason. Here is where Watts is, predictably as it were, a little less helpful. Some useful sanity-check tools are aggregation of knowledge as opposed to relying on too few sources of information, encouraging experimentation rather than blindly staying the course, relying on local knowledge where possible rather on too much top-down direction (here Watts has a more level-headed take on this Hayekian principle than Tim Harford did in Adapt), and always trying to rely on measurement when rather than on intuition and ""common sense"" even if this is ultimately a somewhat Sisyphean goal.With that, Watts transitions to the Big Picture. Knowing that common sense can mislead us is all when and good, but what new principles can we use to guide us in the future? Societies are big and complicated things, and merely saying that we can't trust common sense isn't good enough, especially when it comes to subjects like justice and fairness. So Watts moves in the direction of Justice as Fairness, explicitly advocating a Rawlsian view of designing institutions to maximize equity, contra Nozick. I agree with him, and I agree that the concepts explored in the book support the idea that social institutions should be designed with the least-well-off in mind, as well as that the ""lemon socialism"" behavior of the wealthy lately of acting like you are a special person on the upside and a helpless victim on the downside is both offensive and unjust. Acknowledging that we are members of a society and not a million Masters of the Universe is an old insight, but well-placed here, because now that we are beginning to have the technology to measure and analyze trends and social movements in great detail and in real time, we are also beginning to be able to subject foundational questions of justice to statistical analysis. Alexander Volokh had a great law review article in 1997 titled ""n Guilty Men"" which analyzed different societies' takes on the concept of ""it is better to let X guilty people escape justice than to let one innocent person be punished"" - Watts would argue that we are getting to the point where we could try to actually calculate that normative value.Obviously that grandiose dream has many precedents - Watts mentions Auguste Comte, as one of many - and even more detractors. The idea that you could calculate something like justice seems absurd. Yet it certainly seems like more and more touchy subjects of the past are being re-examined with something approaching a scientific spirit. Dan Ariely and Michael Norton published a study in 2005 titled ""Building a Better America-One Wealth Quintile at a Time"" that polled people about income inequality that asked people what they thought a fair distribution should be. The results showed that most people, even rich people, supported a much more equal society than the one we have now. What role should that result play in discussions over redesigning the tax code? Is the only appropriate avenue for discussion about income during salary negotiations between each individual un-unionized employee and a hiring manager, or can/should we design broader institutions to better-implement more scientific notions of justice? These and many other questions that before belonged in the backs of philosophy and sociology books are finally able to be looked at with data, analysis, and experimentation - this book is a great overview of some good questions and hints of their answers. I'll be thinking about it for a while."
4,0385531680,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1463934-aimee-just-one-more-page,3,"The book started out with a lot of stories and fascinating new ideas. While we are wired to try to predict outcomes, we really can't do as well as we think. If you're skeptical, you'll become a believer pretty quickly while reading. What we think is ""obvious"" is really only that way after the fact. He illustrates this fact by pretending to give some outcome to a situation where the reader can easily assign reasons why the outcome happened. Then he said the opposite outcome was really true, and again, the reader can find reasons why the opposite outcome could be true. This happens more often than you think.He says we need to apply this to business and daily life. Really the only thing we have been able to predict has been things like science and mathematics that we can replicate over and over. Social, business, predicting how thing will turn out just can never be replicated over and over with the same results. Success is often good planning, but heavily reliant on luck and circumstances.So how can businesses succeed over time? One way is to plan for many possible outcomes --- but even this is certainly fallible -- just better planning. In reality, probably the best way is to constantly reevaluate based on current information and data, and tweak your plan frequently with the newest data. The author gets his point across better when he tells stories. He started out with a bang in this book. I think if one read the first part of the book until bored, and then skimmed Part 2 looking for ways businesses and people can be more successful would be fine. At some point, the stories trail off and theory becomes dominant which made it more difficult to stay engaged. The book could have been edited down, kept only the main points, and made sure to break it up with more stores, and it would have been better."
5,0385531680,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6188366-deb,4,"*Well, that's just obvious!* It's just common sense, right? Think again!This book explores the three main types of common sense errors: systemically flawed mental models of individual behavior, even more flawed models of collective behaviors, and misrepresentations of past events which result in us learning less from history than we think we do. The book does a powerful job in exposing the reality that common sense convinces us that we know more than we really do. (Warning: this truth may be more than you really want to know.)Although common sense does help us *explain* the world, it is not so great at helping us *understand* it. The author highlights this dilemma by noting that:""Bad things happen not because we forget to use our common sense, but rather because the incredible effectiveness of common sense in solving the problems of everyday life causes us to put more faith in it than it can bear."" (p. 23). For example, we often try to explain successes by describing intrinsic attributes, rather than actually identifying the complex set of factors that actually led to the success. This circular reasoning comes in the formula of ""X succeeded because X had the attributes of X."" Illustrative examples of common sense explanations that use this type of circular reasoning include:---""The Mona Lisa is the most famous paining in the world because it has all the attributes of the Mona Lisa""---""Harry Potter was successful because it had exactly the attributes of Harry Potter, and not something else.""---""People have stopped buying the gas-guzzling SUVs because social norms now dictate that people shouldn't buy gas-guzzling SUVs.""---In general: ""X (fill in the blank with whatever success you are trying to explain) happened because that's what people wanted; and we know X is what they wanted because X is what happened.""Another common-sense-centric problem explored in this book is the the micro-macro problem (also known as emergence) where we attempt to go from the micro choices of individuals to explain the macro phenomena of the social world. In our attempts to do so, we use use ""social actors"" (""what families choose,"" ""what the market wants,"") as a way to aggregate individual behaviors, but doing so fail to account for the complex entanglement of situational, contextual, and interactional influences that ultimately determine group behaviors and outcomes. The reality is that knowing the individual does not allow us to predict the group's collective behavior. As the author nicely summarizes:""Just as you can know everything about the behavior of individual neurons and still be mystified by the emergence of the consciousness in the human brain, so too could you know everything about individuals in a given population--their likes, their dislikes, experiences, attitudes, beliefs, hopes, and dreams--and still not be able to predict much about their collective behavior."" (p. 79)And, when we can't explain an outcome in terms of the special attributes, another common sense fallback is to subscribe to the ""law of the few"" and conclude the outcomes resulted from a contagion social process started by a small number of influential or ""special"" people. A classic example of this reasoning (which Gladwell fans will immediately recognize) is:""A few special people revived the fortunes of the Hush Puppies shoe bran because a few people started buying Hush Puppies before everyone else did.""But, it turns out that this explanation is just another example of circular reasoning and that ""in claiming that 'X happened because a few special people made it happen,' we have effectively replaced one piece of circular reasoning with another."" (p, 107). This is another trap where common sense explanations--constructed after we know the outcome itself--simply describe, and not explain.Other common sense traps we fall into when trying to explain ""the obvious"" include: creeping determinism (our tendency to perceive what actually happened as having been inevitable), hindsight bias (our after-the-fact tendency to believe that ""we knew it all along""), sampling bias (focusing on what did happen and paying too little attention on most of what did not happen), the post-hoc fallacy (inferring cause-effect relationships when in fact factors were just a sequence in unrelated events), and confusing stories with theories as a way of using common sense to try to explain the world.Commonsense is extraordinarily good at navigating particular (isolated) circumstances in our every day business and allows us to ""skip from day to day and observation to observation, perpetually replacing the chaos of reality with the soothing fiction of our explanations. And, for everyday purposes, that's good enough, because the mistakes that we inevitably make don't generally have any important consequences. Where these mistakes do start to have important consequences is when we rely on our common sense to make the kinds of plans that underpin government policy or corporate strategy or marketing campaigns."" (p. 157) Common sense approaches fail here as these cases affect large numbers of people over extended periods of time and require solutions that need to work consistently, reliably associate cause and effect, differentiate scientific explanation from mere story telling, and differentiate predictions that can be made reliably from those that can not.As the author suggests, it is in these social world situations where ""uncommonsense"" is called for. He proposes a shift from a ""predict and control"" model for anticipating the future to a ""measure and react"" strategy of dealing with the present as it actually unfolds, explaining:""We cannot suppress our commonsense intuitions any more that we can will our heart to stop beating. What we can do, however, is remember that whenever it comes to questions of business strategy or government policy, or even marketing campaigns and website design, we must rely less on our common sense and more on what we can measure."" (p. 212)And, to help us accurately measure what's real in such social world situations, we need to be mindful of the commonsense traps that often get in the way, including The Halo Effect (our tendency to generalize our evaluations about one particular feature of another person to judgments about other their other, often unrelated, features), believing that success is always a reflection of talent (when in fact is often a result of other contextual factors and luck), and the myth of the corporate savior (our tendency to emphasize the influence of special individuals in directing the course of incredibly complex organizations and events).The reality is that social science is complex, and what seems obvious really isn't so obvious at all:""When you think about the sheer complexity of human behavior, this approach to doing social science seems kind of implausible...Individual behavior is complicated by dozen of psychological biases, many of which operate outside of our conscious awareness and interact in as-yet-unknown ways. And...when individuals interact with one another, their collective behavior may simply not be derivable from their individual attributes and incentives, no matter how much you know of them....The social world, in other words, in far messier than the physical world, and the more we learn about it, the messier it is likely to seem."" (pp. 252- 262)The author's solution to understanding and navigating the messy world of social science is the realization that:""We will probably never have a science of sociology that will resemble physics...The less we worry about looking for general laws in social science, and the more we worry about solving actual problems, the more progress we are likely to make."" (p, 262)An obvious conclusion.**Once you already know the answer."
6,0385531680,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10501519-ethan,4,"Deep. A bit philosophical. Takes on 'common sense' explanations of social phenomenon like influencers and tipping points. Also describes some of his own very cool research (though you gotta go elsewhere for more details of it).A couple of my favorite nuggets:When a forest fire breaks out, we never wonder what made that spark so unique. We only wonder how much dry tinder was lying around the forest and how long the drought had been. But when a video goes viral or a brand takes off, we ONLY wonder what made that thing so unique. When in truth, ANY video or brand could've taken off because the proverbial forest was ready to burn.Social scientists have physics envy. And physicists often disparage social scientists for their lack of rigor, theory, and laws. Well, in truth, social science is NOT rocket science.... it's harder. In rocket science you get to replicate experiments in very controlled environments where you can isolate every variable. And when you build a rocket you can ensure the fuel is pure, the metal is precisely engineered, the o-rings are exactingly elastic. When you build a school you have almost NO control. So how are you supposed to engineer education?"
7,0385531680,http://goodreads.com/user/show/209681-paula,4,"Whenever I hear (or read) an otherwise intelligent person deriding a social psych experiment-- e.g., ""I can't believe someone had to *research* whether the media causes poor body image in teenage girls! Everybody *knows* it does!""--I weep for humanity. The tools of social science are imprecise, and what ""everybody knows"" is often wrong, or not proven by studies, or rendered inconclusive by the data. That's why we do studies, that's why we keep the research and the conversation going when studies contradict each other, and why we need to keep recalibrating our tools*. (*Heh.) It is a great relief to read anything by sociologist Duncan Watts, the world's eminent expert on social networks, who makes a good case for not accepting ""common sense"" wisdom to explain human behavior. People, especially in groups, are far more unpredictable than authors like Malcolm Gladwell, with his tipping points and blinks, would have you believe. Watts is a swell writer--presenting vivid examples in a voice that's one part scholarly, one part folksy (but not condescending)."
8,0385531680,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3498889-cheryl,3,"Ack. I'm convinced that commonsense reasoning fails us. I'm convinced that policy makers should hire social scientists who actually use rigorous methodology instead of intuition and uncontrolled experiments. But I was convinced of that already.... I thought this was actually going to give us some answers. And I didn't find any that actually helped me understand anything... but I've been reading a lot of modern psychology books already....Bonus point for the snaps on Gladwell. Subtractive points for blinkers to his own demographic and culture. Half a point down for basically giving the bulk of each chapter to the common logical fallacies that many of learned in college Freshman English and many more of us can readily research. Half a point down for not enough everyday examples that most of us can actually relate to & appreciate. Bonus point for organization, including a reference summary at the end (at least of my edition).Example of a key logical fallacy that too many of us, including me, are too vulnerable to: ""If we want to do why some people are rich, for example,... it may seem sensible to look for rich people... and identify which attributes they share. But what this exercise can't reveal is that if we instead looked at people who aren't rich... we might have found that they exhibit many of the same attributes."" Watts doesn't go on to suggest an answer, really, but the point is that luck and context have a huge but often underappreciated influence.A motto that I taught my children since they were tiny is ""wishing doesn't make it so."" Watts explains how many of us often (he says simply an absolute ""we"" but I know enough to qualify) tell stories / develop narratives / commit post hoc and other logical fallacies ""because this is how we'd like the world to work, not because that is how it actually works.... Commonsense explanations therefore seem to tell us why something happened when in fact all they're doing is describing what happened.I love the quote Watts used from Alexander Pope: ""Nature and Nature's laws lay hid in night: God said, Let Newton be! and all was light.""I do give Watts credit for his first training as a physicist. As I've said in other reviews, I don't trust science books that are written by journalists rather than by actual scientists. There not always as engaging as this, but they are more valuable.I also am sceptical about science books more than a few years old. If you do want to read this, do so soon, before what he says becomes dated."

If however you have some interest in the psychology of human behavior, this may appeal to you. It is well suited for those of us who have some background training and or experience in clinical trials, study groups, and statistics. The text is a bit dry, but not so much so that it is difficult to read. The author does a reasonably good job in explaining how and why people decide to do what they do and form the opinions they have.I hope you'll forgive me if I make a summation of the book with a personal reference. In the past, I raised cattle. If I wanted to move the herd, I did not try to move all the cows at the same time because they would just scatter and I would be left saying words I normally kept out of my everyday vocabulary. I found that if I selected a single animal and calmly moved it, the rest would easily follow. The message of this book is that humans are easily manipulated, like cattle.

10,0385531680,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4818089-jurgen-appelo,4,Great message. Most of our simplistic conclusions are wrong.
11,0385531680,http://goodreads.com/user/show/12395688-kevin,5,"Consider the last national election, your employer's last annual report, or your favorite sports team's last away-game victory. What made the particular outcome happen? Looking backward, conclusions seem foregone; we construct retrospective explanations that justify how what happened had to happen, because, well, it did. But Duncan J. Wells explains that what seems inevitable once it's already happened, is actually deeply contingent and controversial. Exactly why is both bizarre and revealing.Trained as an engineer but functioning as a sociologist, Wells has conducted intensive research for America's largest corporations, including Yahoo and Microsoft. In that capacity, backed with massive corporate capital and utilizing technocratic research techniques that didn't exist fifteen years ago, he's investigated questions about how humans make decisions. Not only has this included individual decisions, but how uncountable group decisions form a consensus. That is, he's investigate how individuals make a society.Watts' answers prove many and various, and deserve careful reading. Their common thread, however, devolves to common sense. A system useful for negotiating everyday interactions, common sense proves more fraught when confronted with the hidden inner dynamics of large groups. Human interactions prove founded on myriad rules, mostly unspoken--as anybody who has ever traveled abroad and unknowingly transgressed serious taboos already knows. These rules are not only unquestioned, but largely unacknowledged.In this, Watts relies heavily on research avenues first utilized by Stanley Milgram. Though mostly famous for his ""Obedience to Authority"" experiments, Milgram also pioneered research, like the famous Six Degrees experiment, demonstrating how intensively connected society is. We cannot explain who influences us, and by whom we're influenced, because we cannot comprehend our cultural links. Watts actually replicates some Milgram experiments digitally, proving reality is more linked than Milgram could've realized.Society proves difficult to explain. In one experiment, Watts, using double-blind research methods and sophisticated online social networks, manages to recreate the digital music marketplace. By segmenting populations into mutually unaware groups, he manages to simulate several different marketplaces, resulting in completely different bestseller lists. This proves that just because certain circumstances occurred doesn't mean they had to occur; reality is deeply provisional. We cannot prove or understand why what happened, happened.This goes double for situations which, unlike music markets, cannot be segmented and rerun analytically. We cannot, for example, have multiple trial Presidential elections or overseas wars. Explanations for outcomes therefore lack scientific rigor. When Nate Silver gives probabilities for certain electoral outcomes, his numerical assignments mean something very different from Vegas betting pools. The differences are opaque to people who can't access Silver's original math. Therefore we construct explanations retrospectively.This comes across in popular self-help books which examine successful people to unlock their secrets. Authors believe we'll replicate somebody else's miracle if we simply find whichever magic choice or simple connection made their success possible. However, Watts asserts, we cannot see every influence that steered so-and-so to seemingly inevitable success. Essentially we assume somebody had to succeed because they did succeed; Watts calls this creeping determinism.(Watts specifically name-checks Malcolm Gladwell for this tendency, though in fairness, Gladwell did write ""Outliers,"" which examines successful individuals' cultural contexts, to counter this very tendency.)Essentially, according to Watts, we don't explain the past, we describe it. Therefore, attempts to construct actually useful predictions prove frustrating. And because most professional soothsayers' predictions go largely unexamined, we must step over corpses of numberless stupid secular prophecies to reach contemporary reality. Certainly, many people my age lament their missing flying car. But most high-profile attempts to apply past observations to future choices remain equally fruitless, and we often don't realize it's happened.Can we then even make meaningful predictions? Watts says yes, though exactly how defies brief restatement. We must eschew many common prejudices, like expecting meaningful predictions to be particularly precise. We must also limit our horizons: decades-long predictions prove as useless as long-term weather forecasts. And our reliance on either credentialed experts or gifted rookies limits our options. Processes for making actually useful predictions are surprisingly simple, yet because of learned biases, applying them is shockingly difficult.Watts' explanation of human reasoning, and its limits, sheds powerful light on how important decisions fail. Watts explicitly describes several implications for business, government, entertainment, and other fields, while constructive readers can imagine other fields which suffer exactly the field blindness Watts describes. If you've ever wondered how politicians, CEOs, and media pundits can be so spectacularly wrong, this book's explanations will chill your blood. As science for the masses, Watts is a master."

It's like Nihilism for knowledge, which I don't think is a word. Let me back up - I negative learned from this book. I unlearned many explanations for the world I thought I knew, and changed how I perceive and understand my interactions with people around me. Watts very strongly argues that it's very challenging to understand people or predict the future, so humans just kind of guess and mostly guess wrong.Science then tries to come in but basically just confirms what people want to hear, or doesn't and people just make up some story about how that ""makes sense"" and move on. The examples he uses are as painfully simple as they are brilliant and effective. I will never attribute any knowledge to ""common sense"" (a thing I no longer believe exists) ever again. Well done. Where the book fails is where to go from here? Now that the assumptions have been challenged so convincingly, what CAN we even know? He doesn't really make any convincing arguments in the second half of the book.Still, I find the book worthy of great praise. Indeed, potentially unlearning is even harder than learning, but now there is a vacuum of skepticism and doubt that Watts failed to color. He peeled back how I thought, but the tools I have now seem inadequate; which is the only thing keeping this book from 5 stars. I suppose my new outlook and the questions this book has left me asking are more than enough. I'm sure life, experiences, and books will slowly recolor my understanding of the world that Watts so deftly derailed. Very slowly. Until then, I'm asking more questions than ever; which, I hear, is a side effect of knowledge."
13,0385531680,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1400585-malin-friess,2,"Duncan Watts argues that our common sense is not as good as we think it should be. When we trust our common sense we often make bad predictions.His support:We are duped into believing the Mona Lisa is such an extraordinary painting or Shakespeare such amazing writing. The Mona Lisa is small and average work for Da Vinci. We study these works as masterpieces and eventually it becomes self fullfilling. Our common sense is a poor predictor as it should have been obvious that Facebook and Yahoo and Google would be screaming success..but we didnt't but into these companies when they were in their infancies. People predicted that No Child Left Behind would incentivise teachers to teach better, principals to fire bad teachers, and then we would see test scores improve among students. Instead we saw teachers cheat (giving the kids the answers and altering their answer sheets) to improve scores artificially and gain for themselves a nice bonus. Watts writes in the same genre as Malcolm Gladwell (stories that try to pull together and support a sociological theory). I wasn't as engaged and did not feel that stories of Jobs, The Surge in Iraq, or the Mona Lisa really did prove that common sense is poor.2 stars..."
14,0385531680,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7069868-john,3,"This book has a brilliant first half where it shows that common sense is a questionable appeal, a dubious guide to action, and a disastrous foundation to policy, while the second half has some key advice but fails to take the truly courageous step, unlike Kahneman, of telling us how to practically distrust ourselves. What this volume serves up instead, the measure of continually analyzing the communication patterns of the internet will literally serve as the telescope that will lead to the remaking of social science, and that we should use it to react continuously to the present, is both sound strategic advise and the path to personal pathology. Maybe this particular narrative is cleverer than I'm giving credit for, providing the ambitious with a recipe for behaving as though they had developed a sense of self-skepticism. "
15,0385531680,http://goodreads.com/user/show/770522-ben-iverson,5,"This is such an excellent book. It is so underrated in the ""popular social science"" genre, such as Freakonomics or Nudge. The main thesis is that ""common sense"" is really good at coming up with stories for why the world is the way it is, but terrible at determining which stories are actually true. Watts gives example after example of this. One main point is that we need rigorous academic research in economics and other social sciences in order to understand the world, and not just the story-telling that fills up much of the popular media. For example, on any given day you can read in any major news outlet why the market went up or down the day before. But this is just hindsight rationalization, and in reality we have no idea why the market did what it did, or what it will do in the future. Another big takeaway is that we should not be surprised at how hard it is to forecast the future, since we are so far away from understanding the complexities of human society. My one knock on the book is that it is somewhat less engaging to read that other books in this genre, and I suspect this could be why it has not caught on as much. But I found it well-written and very clear, even if it is a bit less colorful than some other books.Anyone who works in business, economics, or politics has to read this book. Really, anyone who thinks about the future should read it. Which is, of course, everyone."

18,0385531680,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1080484-teji,4,"The first part of this book is an extensive discussion of the types of predictive reasoning errors the human brain makes, how that causes us to think that we know more than we actually do and how this type of reasoning leads to a tendency to discount social sciences as ""real science"". The second part then proposes the use of real-time technology for building predictive models. While I think the second part over-reaches a bit, in general a good, and thought-provoking analysis of how common sense creates barriers to to the progress of the social sciences.Quotes(view spoiler)[“If there’s a lesson here, you might think it would be that the problems of social science are hard not just for social scientists, but for everyone, even physicists. But this lesson, it seems, has not been learned. Quite to the contrary…in 2006 Senator Kay Bailey Hutchinson…proposed that Congress cut the entire social and behavioral sciences budget of the National Science Foundation. Bailey Hutchinson, it should be noted, is not antiscience—in 2005 she proposed doubling funds for medical science. Rather, it was exclusively social science research…Presumably, she doesn’t think that social problems are unimportant…Rather it appears that…she doesn’t consider social problems to be scientific problems, requiring the prolonged attention of serious scientists…[Senators] are not alone in their skepticism of what social science has to offer. Since becoming a sociologist, I have frequently been asked…what sociology has to say about the world that an intelligent person couldn’t have figured out on their own… that ‘it’s not rocket science,’…But the sad fact is that we’re actually much better at planning the flight path of an interplanetary rocket than we are at managing the economy, merging two corporations, or event predicting how many copies of a book will sell. So why is it that rocket science seems hard, whereas problems having to do with people… seems like they ought to just be a matter of common sense?... I argue that the key to the paradox is common sense itself…common sense is indeed exquisitely adapted to handling the kind of complexity that arises in everyday situations…But ‘situations’ involving corporations, cultures, markets, nations-sates, and global institutions exhibit a very different kind of complexity from everyday situations. And under these circumstances, common sense turns out to suffer from a number of errors that systematically mislead us. Yet, because of the way we learn from experience…the failings of commonsense reasoning are rarely apparent to us. Rather, they manifest themselves as ‘things we didn’t know at the time’ but which seem obvious in hindsight. The paradox of common sense, therefore, is that even as it helps us make sense of the world, it can actively undermine our ability to understand it…in talking with friends and colleagues about this book, I’ve noticed an interesting pattern. When I describe the argument in the abstract…they nod their heads in vigorous agreement…Yet when the very same argument calls into question some particular belief of their own, they invariably change their tune. ‘Everything you are saying about the pitfalls of common sense and intuition may be right,’ they are in effect saying, ‘but it doesn’t undermine my own confidence in the particular beliefs that I happen to hold.’ It’s as if the failure of commonsense reasoning is only the failure of other people’s reasoning, not their own…people are much more willing to believe that others have misguided beliefs than that their own beliefs are misguided… None of this is to say that we should abandon all of our beliefs…only that we should hold them up to a spotlight and regard them with suspicion” -Preface“…two defining features of common sense that seem to differentiate it from other kinds of human knowledge, like science or mathematics. [First] unlike formal systems of knowledge, which are fundamentally theoretical, common sense is overwhelmingly practical, meaning that it is more concerned with providing answers to questions…[Second]…the power of common sense lies in the ability to deal with every concrete situation on its own terms…It is largely for this reason…that commonsense knowledge has proven so hard to replicate in computers—because, in contrast with theoretical knowledge, it requires a relatively large number of rules to deal with even a small number of special cases…common sense is ‘common’ only to the extent that two people share sufficiently similar social and cultural experiences…But is also means the even among humans, what seems reasonable to one might seem curious, bizarre, or even repugnant to another…Disagreements over matters of common sense, in other words, are hard to resolve because it's unclear to either side on what on what grounds one can even conduct a reasonable argument…whatever it is that people believe to be a matter of common sense, they believe it with absolute certainty…That what is self-evident to one person can be seen as silly by another should give us pause about the reliability of common sense as a basis for understanding the world…especially when we can’t articulate why we think we’re right in the first place” Ch1“The fragmented, inconsistent, and even self-contradictory nature of common sense does not generally present a problem in our everyday lives…everyday life is effectively broken up into small problems, grounded in very specific contexts that we can solve more or less independently of one another. Under these circumstances, being able to connect our thoughts processes in a logical manner isn’t really the point…Where it does start to matter, however, is when we use common sense to solve problems that are notgrounded in the immediate here and now of everyday life—problems that involve anticipating or managing the behavior of large numbers of people, in situations that are distant from us either in time or space…Whenever we form an opinion about financial reform or healthcare…whenever we argue about politics or economics or the law, we are implicitly using our commonsense reasoning to reach conclusions about how society will be affected…In none of these cases are we using our common sense to reason about how we should behave in the here and now. Rather, we are using it to reason about how other people behaved—or will behave—in circumstances about which we have at best an incomplete understanding…when we read [articles about various social problems] we don’t try to understand how all these different problems fit together. We just focus on the one little piece of the huge underlying tapestry of the world that’s being presented to us at that moment, and form an opinion accordingly…Yet politicians, bureaucrats, architects, and regulators continue to make essentially the same mistake all the time. As the economist William Easterly has argued, the foreign aid community has been dominated…by powerful individuals whose ideas about what should and should not work inevitably play a large role in determining how resources will be devoted…these ‘planners,’ as Easterly calls them, are well-meaning and intelligent people who are often passionately devoted to the task of helping…Yet, in spite of the trillions of dollars…there is shockingly little evidence that the recipients are better off for it.” Ch1“There are also so many more corporations than governments that it’s always possible to find success stories, thereby perpetuating the view that the private sector is better at planning than the government sector. But as a number of management scholars have shown in recent years, corporate plans… also fail frequently, and for much the same reasons that government plans do…that is, a small number of people sitting in conference rooms are using heir own commonsense intuition to predict, manage, or manipulate the behavior of thousands or millions of distant and diverse people whose motivations and circumstances are very different from their own.”Ch1“But if common sense is so bad at dealing with complex social phenomena…why are its shortcomings not more obvious to us?…Unlike problems in physics, biology, and so on…when the topic is human or social behavior, the idea of running expensive, time-consuming ‘scientific’ studies to figure out what we’re pretty sure we already know seems largely unnecessary…Nevertheless, the combination of intuition, experience, and received wisdom on which we rely to generate commonsense explanations of the social world also disguises certain errors of reasoning that are every bit as systematic and pervasive as the errors of commonsense physics…Commonsense errors regarding the social world fall into three categories: “The first type of error is that when we think about why people do what they do, we invariably focus on factors like incentives, motivations, and beliefs…decades of research…have shown that this view of human behavior encompasses just the tip of the proverbial iceberg…our mental model of individual behavior is systematically flawed, the second type is that…whenever people get together in groups…they interact with one another, sharing information, spreading rumors...and generally influencing one another…As sociologists have long argued, these influences pile up in unexpected ways, generating collective behavior that…cannot be understood solely in terms of its component parts…The third and final type…is that we learn less from history than we think we do, and that this misperception in turn skews or perception of the future. Whenever something interesting, dramatic, or terrible happens…we instinctively look for explanations. Yet because we seek to explain these events only after the fact, our explanation place far too much emphasis on what actually happened relative to what might have happened but didn’t…The result is that what appear to us to be causal explanations are in fact just…descriptions of what happened that tell us little, if anything, about the mechanisms at work...” Ch1“…our impressive ability to make sense of behavior that we have observed does not imply a corresponding ability to predict it…It is this difference between making sense of behavior and predicting it that is responsible for many of the failures of commonsense reasoning.” Ch2“Trust no one, especially yourself.” Ch7“…Yet the iPod was exactly the kind of strategic play that the lessons of Betamax…should have taught them would fail…So in what sense was Apple’s strategy better than Sony’s?...The only important difference, in Raynor’s view, was that Sony’s choices happened to be wrong while Apple’s happened to be right. / This is the strategy paradox. The main cause of strategic failure, Raynor argues, is not bad strategy, but great strategy that just happens to be wrong…Whether great strategy succeeds or fails therefore depends entirely on whether the initial vision happens to be right or not…that is not just difficult to know in advance, but impossible…The solution to the strategy paradox, Raynor argues, is to acknowledge openly that there are limits to what can be predicted, and to develop methods for planning that respect those limits… look for ways to integrate what he calls strategic uncertainty…into the planning process itself... planners should formulate not one strategy, but rather a portfolio of strategies, each of which is optimized for a given scenario…Managing strategic uncertainty is then a matter of creating ‘strategic flexibility’ by building strategies around the core elements and hedging the contingent elements…”Ch7“...crowdsourcing services like Amazon’s Mechanical Turk…can also be used to perform fast and inexpensive market research…Looking to get feedback on some design choices for a new product or advertising campaign? Throw the images up on Mechanical Turk and have users vote…”Ch8“…what both bright spots and bootstrapping have in common is that they require a shift in the mind-set of the planner…planners must recognize that no matter what the problem is…chances are that somebody out there already has part of the solution…having realized that they do not need to figure out the solution to every problem on their own, planners can instead devote their resources to finding the existing solutions…and spreading their practices more widely…[this requires planners] to abandon the conceit that they can develop plans on the basis of intuition and experience alone…” Ch8“…talent is talent, and success is success and the latter does not always reflect the former…we live in a highly developed society in which disproportionately large rewards can accrue to individuals who happen to possess particular attributes and who experience the right opportunities.” Ch9“…the importance of social networks has a counterintuitive consequence for the notion of individual freedom. Whatever we might like to think, we are never entirely free…The very ties that give our lives meaning also constrain us...Like it or not, our notions of justice must deal with this tension between the individual and the society as a whole…Sandel argues that one ought not to feel proud of one’s heritage as an American without also feeling shame about the country’s history of slavery…one cannot simply decide at one’s convenience when to identify with one’s ancestors and when to absolve oneself of them. Either you’re a part of that extended community, in which case you must share the cost as well as the benefits, or you’re not, in which case you get neither. / Sandel’s argument that our individual actions are inextricably embedded in networks of social relations has consequences not only for arguments about fairness and justice, but also for morality and virtue…one cannot determine what is fair without evaluating the moral status of competing claims. And that in turn requires us to resolve the moral purpose of social institutions…Sandel therefore concludes that a just society is not one that seeks to adjudicate disputes between individuals from a morally neutral perspective, but one that facilitates debate about what the appropriate moral perspective out to be.” Ch9“The social world, in other words, is far messier than the physical world…The result is that we will probably never have a science of sociology that will resemble physics. But that’s OK…the real nature of science is not to exhibit any particular form at all, but rather to follow scientific procedures…to figure things out…attempting to converge on an understanding of how people behave and how the world works…the genomics revolution that began more than fifty years ago with the discovery of DNA has long promised more in the way of medical treatments than it has been able to deliver, yet that hasn’t stopped us from devoting enormous resources to the pursuit of science. Why should the science required to understand social problems such as urban poverty or economic development or public education deserve less attention?"" (hide spoiler)]"

Scathing. ooph. yeah.I will say he uses the same examples as a lot of popular books which makes me kinda nuts. can nobody do their own research anymore?!basically: if you can 'explain' with common sense something in either direction then THERE'S NO COMMON SENSE! 'Common sense' may help us tell stories but it doesn't help us predict the future.bad: his writing style is very hit you over the head. also he denigrates representative agents then the last three chapters he uses them in exactly the way he eschews.So many good quotes and notions:circular reasoning ""We want to believe that x succeeded because it had just the right attributes. But the only attributes we about are the attributes that x possesses. Thus we conclude that these attributes must have been responsible for x's success."" micro-macro problem ""The representative agent is only and always a convenient fiction. And no matter how we try to dress them up in mathematics or other finery, explanations that invoke representative agents are making essentially the same error as common sense explanations that talk about 'firms', 'markets, and 'societies' in the same terms that we use to describe individual people.""on the idea of super connectors: ""It's got to be someone special, we feel compelled to conclude. How else could it work? Nor is the intuitive appeal of special people explanations restricted to problems to do with networks. The 'Great Man' view of history explains important historical events in terms of the actions of a few critical leaders.""Causation in history: ""In reality, of course, this experiment got run only once. And so we never got to see all the other versions of it that may or may not have turned out differently. As a result we can't ever really be sure what caused [thing]. But rather than producing doubt, the absence of counterfactual versions of history tends to have the opposite effect. Namely that we tend to perceive what actually happened as having been inevitable. This tendency which psychologists call creeping determinism is related to the better-known phenomenon of hindsight bias, the after the fact tendency to believe we knew it all along."" only creeping determinism is worse because after the fact we believe things were inevitable.On plausibility: "" Explanations that are skillfully delivered are judged more plausible than poorly delivered ones even when the explanations themselves are identical explanations that are skillfully delivered I judged more plausible than poorly delivered one even when the explanations themselves are identical and explanations that are intuitively plausible are judged more likely than those that are counter-intuitive even though, as we know it from all those Agatha Christie novels, the most plausible explanation can be badly wrong. People are observed to be more confident about their judgments when they have an explanation at hand even when they have no idea how likely the explanation is to be correct.""Past stories vs future predictions""Nevertheless because accounts of the past, once constructed, bear such a strong resemblance to the sorts of theories that we construct in science it is tempting to treat them as if they have the same power of generalization even for the most careful historians..... No matter what we say we are doing, in other words, whenever we seek to learn about the past we are invariably seeking to learn from it as well. An association that is implicit in the woods of the philosopher George Santayana ""Those who cannot remember the past are condemned to repeat it. This confusion between stories and theories gets to the heart of the problem using 'common sense' as a way of understanding the world. In one breath we speak as if all we are trying to do is make sense of the world. But in the next breath we're applying the lesson that we think we have learned to whatever plan or policy we're intending to implement in the future. We make the switch between story telling and theory building so easily and instinctively that most of the time we're not even aware that we're doing it. But the switch overlooks that the two are fundamentally different exercises with different objectives and standards of evidence. It should not be surprising then that explanations that were chosen on the basis of their qualities as stories do a poor job of predicting future patterns or trends. Yet that is nonetheless what we use them for. Understanding the limits of what we can explain about the past ought therefore to shed light on what it is we can predict about the future.""Predictions ""[It's] not that we are universally good or bad at [prediction]. But rather that we are bad at distinguishing predictions that we can make reliably from those that we can't.""Complex systems ""Complexity arises out of many interdependent components interacting in non-linear ways. In complex systems tiny disturbances in one part of the system ca get amplified to produce large effects somewhere else.""Uncertainty ""There is a difference between being uncertain about the future and the future itself being uncertain. The former is really just a lack of information.... whereas the latter implies that the information is in principle unknowable... where the best we can ever hope for is to express our predictions of various outcomes as probabilities""Prophesies ""Common sense intuition about the future [tends] to conflate predictions with prophesies...When we think about the future we imagine it to be a unique thread of events that simply hasn't been revealed to us yet. In reality no such thread exists. [the future is many] possible threads each of which [with a] probability of being drawn... But because we know that at some point in the future all these probabilities will have collapsed onto a single thread we naturally want to focus on the one thread that will actually matter.""On experts: ""Because they are experts we tend to consult only one at a time. Instead what we should do is poll many opinions [experts or not] and take the average....at the end of the day both models and crowds accomplish the same objective.""Executive priorities: ""Constructing scenarios, deciding what is core and what is contingent, devising strategic hedges and so on...necessarily diverts attention from the equally important business of running a company. According to Raynor, the problem with most companies is that their senior management, meaning the board of directors and the top executives, spends too much time managing and optimizing their existing strategies—what he calls operational management—and not enough thinking through strategic uncertainty. Instead he argues that they should devote all their time to managing strategic uncertainty, leaving operational management to division heads.... Once an organization has gone through the process of building scenarios, developing strategic options and identifying and acquiring the desired portfolio of strategic options, it's time to do it all over again.""""The main problem with strategic flexibility as a planning approach is precisely the same problem that it was intended to solve. Namely that in hindsight the trends that turned out to shape a given industry always appear obvious and as a result it is all too easy to persuade ourselves that had we been faced with a strategic decision back then we could have boiled down the list of possible futures to a small list of contenders including of course the one that did in fact transpire.""""But in cases where we only get to try out a plan once, the best way to avoid the halo effect is to focus out energies on evaluating and improving what we are doing while we're doing it. Planning techniques like scenario building and strategic flexibility...can help organizations expose questionable assumptions and avoid obvious mistakes while prediction markets and polls can exploit the collective intelligence of their employees to evaluate the qualities of plans before the outcome is known. Alternatively crowdsourcing, field experiments and bootstrapping... can help organizations learn what is working and what isn't and then adjust on the fly.""""In reality every distribution of wealth reflects a set of choices that a society has made to value some skills over others, to tax or prohibit some activities while subsidizing or encouraging other activities, and to enforce some rule while allowing other rules to sit on the books or be violated in spirit. All these choices can have considerable ramifications for who gets rich and who doesn't. But there is nothing 'natural' about any of these choices which are very bit as much the product of historical accident, political expediency, and corporate lobbying as they are economical rationality or social desirability.... it is certainly valid to argue about whether proposed changes make sense on their merits but it is not valid to oppose them simply on the grounds that altering the distribution of wealth itself is wrong on principle.""""The real reason is philosophical consistency. When times are good banks wish to be perceived as independent risk taking entities entitled to the full fruits of their hard-won labors. But during a crisis they wish to be treated as critical elements in the larger system to which their existential failure would pose a threat.... Either they are libertarians who should bear the full weight of their own failures as well as their successes or else they are Rawlsians, paying their dues to the systems that takes care of them.

21,0385531680,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5575980-leticia-supple,3,"Like many works written by academics, Everything is Obvious: Once you know the answer, starts out promising but ends up losing its way. The edition that I ""read"" was the audio edition, which was narrated (happily) by the author himself. Just as well he was a reasonably competent reader, though somewhat stilted.Everything is Obvious: Once you know the answer is a challenge to the notion that common sense is good sense. It is a presentation of the author's significant researches into this topic. And the conclusion? That common sense is rarely the best way to think, in most situations. Common sense, it transpires, stops us for thinking our ways around problems because we settle for what 'seems' logical, even in face of a lack of data. In fact, Watts concludes that when the data conflicts, we will try to modify the data rather than modify our points of view.This book is filled with studies that illustrate the many sides of this issue, and the many questions that it can raise. But it is in the delivery of these studies, that we start losing the phrase common sense, even though this was part of the promise right from the beginning. By the end of the book, it wasn't clear whether there was a clear assessment of common sense, or whether the notion of common sense was simply introduced as a means of illustrating the concept of obviousness.Watts's book is fascinating, make no mistake. And it's relatively straightforward. But it is heavily academic, and draws so much on other studies to illustrate the point that often the point gets lost. This is a shame. It seems to happen an awful lot in books published by academics. For people who are taught to tell 'em what you're gonna tell 'em, then tell 'em, then tell 'em what you told 'em it's almost as if they want to assert their independence. Or, it could be that this overly academic style just seems kind of silly in an otherwise conversational and interesting book. Or, perhaps editors aren't as good as they used to be at balancing the narrative against the research. Or, maybe the shape of books has changed. Or, some other reason from the eleventy million that also exist. Perhaps, once academics get to a certain point in life, editors don't want to shape authors' works too closely; or perhaps the academics resist the assistance.In any case, it's a shame because it makes books like this wander away from their original intent, when they could be helped to be strong all the way through.This work, however, did shine a lot of light onto a lot of areas. Areas like analytics, marketing, and the establishment (and validity) of research; all areas in which worldview trumps actual data more often than people will admit. As a result of reading Watts's book, I find myself challenging my own perceptions. If I have data in front of me, from my business for example, how do I perceive it? What do I conveniently ignore because it doesn't fit with my view of my own sense? What do I glaze over? And what do I simply 'reorient'?And more to the point, what in my life is actually the result of listening to common sense, when I could have been better served by being a bit clearer about things?The query that Watts pursues is courageous, not so much because of its contested nature among his colleagues, but more so because it challenges one of the most widely held beliefs: That common sense is good sense.What if the best thing to do is not what common sense tells you? For the answer, you'll need to read this book. Despite its meanderingness towards the end, it's very much worthwhile - if only to get you to rethink how you perceive your own world, and why."

This caused me to read and re-read the helpful appendix at the end, which summarized the book chapter-by-chapter. The author of this book can't understand why everybody is always hyperventilating about the Mona Lisa. Although that wasn't my particular bugaboo, I certainly can understand his vexation. For my part, I've always suspected that most people can't really tell the difference between a good symphony orchestra and a great symphony orchestra. Similar, whenever I hear the evening newsreader declare the Dow Jones Industrial Average went up or down X points because of some random bit of news, I get the vapors, because, goddamn it, some bit of economic data simply did NOT have the effect ascribed. This book allowed me to put some intellectual heft behind these previously ill-defined moments of discontent.Occasionally there are some odd lapses, for example:– Kindle location 105: in 2005, this book reports, Senator Key Bailey Hutchinson (R-Texas) proposed zeroing out the social and behavioral science budget of the National Science Foundation. “[I]t appears that … [Hutchinson] doesn't consider social problems to be scientific problems, requiring the prolonged attention of serious scientists.” I'll bet my bottom dollar that Hutchinson did not spend a fraction of a second considering the nature of social and scientific problems. She just doesn't like taxpayer money going to people (i.e., social science researchers) who are likely to vote for the other political party. Although the author is apparently an Australian, he seems to have hung around Columbia University for long enough now to be aware of the sad reality of our blasted political landscape.– location 158 (and elsewhere): Garrison Keillor's fictional little town in Minnesota is “Lake Wobegon”, not “Lake Wobegone”. It's a little thing, but an editor should have noticed it.– location 478: “Why does water spiral down the toilet in opposite directions in the northern and southern hemisphere?” It doesn't – see explanation from snopes.com here. Can you really have a degree in physics and not know this? Was mentioning this some sort of elegant joke that went over my head?– location 650: “When we try to understand why an ordinary Iraqi citizen would wake up one morning and decide to turn himself into a human bomb, we are implicitly rationalizing his behavior.” I haven't done exhaustive research on the motivation of suicide bombers, but I strongly suspect that most of them took a longer route than the one described above on the road to misguided martyrdom.Still, worth reading for the detailed taxonomy of the crazy stuff we tell ourselves in our quest to make the world, such as it is, make sense."
23,0385531680,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1489276-andrew,4,"This book was great at first. I read his original book ""Six Degrees"" and was enjoying this one almost as much. The second half of the book completely lost focus, though, as he jumped around between unrelated points and kept complaining that social scientists aren't given enough credit.The concepts shared in the book about how outcomes of events seem so certain after the fact, how ""common sense"" can be completely wrong, and how we often learn the wrong lessons from history were very interesting. His research study about music tastes was enlightening. It provided strong evidence that if we were able to replay history, the set of books, music, movies, art, etc that becomes popular would be very different. In this study he created large ""worlds"" of participants where people could rate music - in some, people could see others' ratings (from their own ""world"") and in some they couldn't. He noticed large amounts of groupthink that caused music that was hated in one world to be loved in another.Overall, though, there wasn't enough original research in this book for me. Several of the examples presented later in the book were on the weak side, as well, and his points weren't as well supported. I found myself somewhat bored at the end. Still probably good for 3.5 stars, and I rounded up."

It is not because of their intrinsic qualities (although they must have some merit) but because of other complicated processes that I will try to explain in a blog (primarily to try and get it into my head).This book is an example of not quite making it. The book could have been in the same bracket as Thinking Fast and Slow, Sapiens, or The Tipping Point (some of which is debunked in this book), but it doesn't make it--perhaps because of chance but also because it doesn't hang together so well. The core argument of the book is that common sense often deceives us and that social science can help, although it can never have the general rules of physics--because humans and their societies are so much more complicated than the planets. There's lots of fascinating stuff in the book, and I plan other blogs--on the macro-micro problem and possibly junior doctors' pay."

On-line field experiments show that the ""six degrees of separation"" is pretty much true, but the links do not go through a small number of highly-connected people after all. In complex social systems, the response to inputs can be highly nonlinear, and there's no way to predict them. There is a good deal of randomness in what ideas become popular. Social change comes from a critical mass of easily influenced people. The future is unknowable. Complex prediction models are little better than simple models. Scenario methods are perhaps the best way to try to predict the future, but they too sometimes fail. A good decision can lead to a bad outcome because of bad luck. The best approach is not to predict, but to measure and react. Fortunately, the internet now allows detailed study of mass human behavior. The book deals a lot with decision analysis, a field I lecture and teach in. It has a lot of insightful things to say, and nothing I outright disagree with or find misleading. However, it seems a bit diffuse and wandering. I'm not sure what the main point was."

He also has some really interesting critiques of some popular science such as Gladwell and Freakonomics.A couple related articles from the author, which could be a good test of interest:https://www.newscientist.com/article/...https://hbr.org/2012/06/the-importanc..."

The book starts getting predictable, which is an irony.It is part II which made me sit up. Using the Wisdom of crowds, measure and respond and emergent strategies. The Mullet strategy was most interesting, and pinpoints success of blogs. As a designer, what I loved the most is ""Bootstrapping"" and ""The quantification of everything"" before the solution. So it is basically a ""Live in the present"" book and urges us to make predictions based on large sets of data and be ready to course correct when the time comes.

This book advocates that we need to understand our models, their underlying assumptions, their uses and missuses, their limitations, their derivations and implications. From basic models we can build more sophisticated and complex theories, and ultimately a rigorous science. If you are excited about using models to make predictions and are concerned whether predictability is even possible then this book is for you.The writing is lucid, engaging and erudite.

Watts touches on several traps inherent in ""common sense"" thinking, and I've successfully used some of the points he makes to win arguments with my significant other. With that in mind, I highly recommend it.The book's second section details sociologists' difficulty in developing robust grand theories, as well their seeming inability to ""prove"" anything that wouldn't already seem obvious to the average person.

I am rating it much higher.If you can get through the earlier chapters, it really has a lot to say about how we rationalize outcomes, modifying, in many cases, our preconceived opinions to fit the actual outcome. Bottom line: we are not very good at predicting outcomes, but are very good at explaining, in retrospect, why something happened. In other words, we're good Monday morning quarterbacks!"

It'd be nice to be able to incorporate some of the material in here, about prediction and the failure of intuition into an epistemology class, instead of just going on and on about what knowledge might be."
39,0385531680,http://goodreads.com/user/show/72191016-silver-screen-videos,4,"Whenever our government leaders fail to solve a problem such as reducing unemployment or stopping terrorism, a lot of people, including some fairly learned pundits, complain that the solution would be easy if our leaders just used some common sense. Similarly, when business decisions go poorly, such as a heavily promoted new product failing, critics say that the mistake could easily have been avoided if the company's CEO had just used common sense. But, as Everything is Obvious, a fascinating book by Duncan Watts, points out, applying ""common sense"" answers to major political and economic problems is equally, if not more, unlikely to yield a good result.Watts begins by pointing out the difference between individual “common sense” decisions and attempting to use those same solutions on a business-wide or society-wide basis. Looking in all directions before driving into traffic makes an accident less likely because you only need to take into account a few other drivers over a limited period of time. The nation’s economy, on the other hand, is affected by thousands of businesses and millions of individuals throughout the world, interacting in a highly complex manner. And, as Watts notes over and over, groups operate in a vastly different manner than individuals do.In Everything is Obvious, Watts explores and debunks many of the common myths that affect “commons sense” thinking. He notes the tendency to try to explain a highly successful phenomenon, like the Harry Potter books, simply by listing its attributes. In essence, it’s an argument that Harry Potter succeeded because it was more like Harry Potter than anything else was, and not how or why any or all of those attributes contributed to the success. Part of the reason for blockbusters like Potter, is that success breeds success. The more people who like something, the more that others will want to try it and find themselves liking it as well. He points to an experiment in which people were asked to select among a variety of songs to download. Some proved more popular than others, of course. But, when people saw how many people had already downloaded each of the songs, the popular ones became much more popular as a result.The music experiment is one of the reasons why finding answers to sociologically problems has proved more difficult than finding answers to physical ones, Watts notes that physical phenomena can be easily measured and their relationships determined. Once we had accurate telescopes and measuring devices, early astronomers measured the movements of stars and planets, and eventually Newton promulgated his laws. Similarly, in medicine, we can determine if a particular drug is effective in fighting a disease by performing a controlled experiment. Unfortunately, as Watts points out, you can’t invade half of Iraq to determine whether it’s the right thing to do. Sociologists and historians can examine history to determine what happened, but that result may well have been a fluke, since you only fight a war one time. Further, it’s almost always impossible to isolate a single reason, or even the combination of reasons, for why something succeeded or failed.From a literary standpoint, Everything is Obvious is a highly entertaining read. Watts fills the book with familiar anecdotes (Sony’s failed decision to push Betamax instead of Matushita’s VHS format) and other not-so-familiar ones (how the theft of the Mona Lisa in the early 20th century contributed to its popularity). Trivia buffs will have hours of fun just going through the book for its entertainment value alone. But, along the way, Watts is able to poke holes in some very commonly held misconceptions that affect not just the thinking of the average person but those making decisions as well. And, by the way, the “representative person” myth, namely that you seek to determine the behavior of a group by isolating a representative person and figuring out how and why he or she acts is doomed to failure simply because it ignores the group dynamic.As for finding solutions to the “common sense” problem, Watts’s book is somewhat short on answers, in large part because the types of problems he addresses still often aren’t susceptible to scientific solutions in practice. Fortunately, with the advent of the Internet and social media, we can now perform some experiments, like the music sampling one, on a large enough scale and with enough variations, to begin to get some answers. And, as he points out, companies that already practice “measure and react” planning are finding a lot of success.I enjoyed Everything is Obvious a great deal, although at times I found Watts a bit more interested in giving readers the benefit of all the “goodies” his research had unearthed as opposed to writing a more disciplined, highly structured book. So, it’s possible to lose sight of the forest for the trees at times here. However, this book is not a doctoral dissertation or a manual for CEO’s and planners. Instead, it’s a breezy attempt to give the average person better insight into how and why we try, and usually fail, to solve some major problems through “common sense.” And, while it’s not an answer to many problems, common sense tells me that a lot of people will have fun reading Everything is Obvious."

46,0385531680,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4756170-daniel,4,"This is a fantastic book about how popular explanation of success and events lead us to learn the wrong lessons. 1. Common sense is not common at all: we use different rules in different circumstances. ‘Birds of the same kind flock together’ but ‘opposites attract’. Basically we can explain everything after the fact. 2. Case studies of success is filled with problems, because it falls into the circular argument: Mona Lisa is famous because it is Mona Lisa etc. We need to compare the attributes of successful vs unsuccessful companies to find the real difference. 3. Watts was famous for his music experiment, when people were asked to compare different new music. Some were also given the popularity of the music, and that changes the popular list, sometimes rather significantly. Initial small differences from chance will cause huge differences in the final download list. 4. History is often biased because we cannot do experiment to see what would have happened. 5. Watts is highly critical of Gladwell’s Tipping Point. He noted that though the story of influencers sounds nice, no one knows who these people are. In the end it is more important to see the receptiveness of the crowd in assessing whether something will ‘catch’. Just like massive forest fires depend on the undergrowth, temperature and relative humidity etc and not so much on a single lightning strike. 6. Watts is also critical of the Taleb’s Black Swan narrative; history’s significance is only realised after the full effect is seen unfolding long afterwards. When did ‘The internet’ happened? for example. So we don’t even know what to look out for. Predictive markets preform only marginally better than historical averages. 7. Since we cannot predict anything, it is far better to be excellent reactors to current trends than to plan long term. Watts especially liked how Zara keeps experimenting with new styles and its quick inventory management that allows it to come up with a new one in 2 weeks. 8. He pointed out that it is really hard to assess talent, since we judge people by their results (halo effect), but results are affected by chance and circumstances. Initial chance differences result in different opportunities, making success depends sometimes on early chance success (Matthew effect). I think Watts is too pessimistic and is only teaching us how not to fail. The reactive management strategy can only apply to stable industries such as fashion. And nobody can assess real talent anyway (However fortune favours the prepared mind- from the lucky Louis Pasteur). Unfortunately, his proposal does not apply to many areas when years of planning is needed to come up with the product, such as the iPhone, internet, Angry Bird, electric cars, Google, etc. I believe that ultimately we have to accept that individual planning and prediction will always fall short, but society can win as long as experimentation is tried by many entrepreneurs, like evolution. We have to accept that despite the best efforts, many people who actually try coming up with new ideas and products will fail individually; however collectively new useful products will evolve and emerge. If one is afraid of losing, just don’t be an entrepreneur. I am also afraid of blaming all the success on good luck; sure luck is important, but without hard work, luck would not count for much. "
47,0385531680,http://goodreads.com/user/show/62274863-phoenix,3,"If Only This Were Always TrueThis is a personal review - if you haven't come across similar material I think it's a very recommendable read.I'm a big fan of Duncan Watts' work on Small Worlds, but I did not get as much as I would have liked from his latest pop-sci offering. Some of the material I found new, such as Grannovetter's intriguing threshold hypothesis as to why some mobs gel into mass action and others do not, and he had a very good discussion on the use of online networked communities as social science laboratories, with some interesting results generated from twitter, Facebook and email. And, as is necessary for this kind of a book, there are a number of illustrative anecdotes, such as why BetaMax and Discman failed in the market, but iPod succeeded or Amazon's ""Mechanical Turk"" - which I just tried out after reading the book, or Zara's approach to marketing. If nothing else it makes for good entertainment and fodder for conversation.However much of the book hinges around the nature of workable explanations, and I'm surprised that in his wanderings Watts did not come across Herbert Simon's well known The Sciences of the Artificial and his key notion of ""satisficing"" (we tend to stop at explanations that work sufficiently well, not those that are necessarily true); or the idea of ""magical thinking"" in allegedly primitive societies; or Donald Norman's The Psychology Of Everyday Things, which looks at the relationship between internal models vs the real world, all of which would have added greater depth to the themes Watts was pursuing.Then there's the catchy title. If you read Watts carefully one finds that knowing the answer has the effect of increasing the one's confidence in a particular explanation, but that doesn't necessarily make things obvious, in particular when the material requires mathematics, statistics and long chains of reasoning. There's some good material on rational choice but Dan Arielly Dan Arielly (who gave the book a good review on the back cover) and John Paulos  I've found have done better. Nor does he confront conspiracy theorists, where the answer is used to select the ""facts"".So yes, it's enjoyable, but I was hoping for more original results from Watts own work. Your mileage, of course, may vary."
48,0385531680,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5905953-mike-smith,3,"Common sense, according to author Duncan Watts, is the knowledge and experience you accumulate over a lifetime of living in the world (which explains why children have so little of it!), interacting with the people and the physical reality around you. For small-scale, local events, common sense does a pretty good job of helping you comprehend how things and people work. It allows you to make reasonable predictions about how people or the world will respond to your actions and decisions. For large-scale, geographically widespread events, however, common sense fails us. We are terrible at explaining and predicting how societies and economies behave. This is largely because we didn't evolve in country-size or even city-size social groups.Watts explains all this using examples like the popularity of the Mona Lisa and the failure of Sony's Betamax video cassette recorders, which we try to rationalize after the fact but totally fail to predict in advance. The book deals with a number of topics, including predicting large-scale social and economic phenomena, the rather weak results of social theories such as ""rational choice"" and ""influencers"" (people with a special knack for spreading a message or trend), and business-planning processes based on the latest sociological findings. Watts also spends some time, mostly at the very beginning and the very end of the book, defining and defending his chosen field of sociology. Although he doesn't come out and say it, the impression I get is that luck is often as large a factor in determining social and economic winners and losers as talent, planning, and performance.I had a difficult time deciding between two stars and three for this book. There is interesting material here, particularly in the first part of the book. However, I found the style to be quite dry, and I have to admit it put me to sleep a couple of times, especially in the second part of the book, which seems to be more business-oriented than the first part. There is some overlap with the ideas of works like Thinking, Fast and Slow, but from a social perspective instead of a cognitive-science perspective. It also brought to mind the fictional discipline of psychohistory of Isaac Asimov's Foundation series. This book tends towards the academic, and my common sense tells me that this is for academically and scientifically inclined readers."
49,0385531680,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7072727-jeff,5,"There’s an experiment I read about long ago that I often mention to people. The experimenters wanted to test whether music becomes popular because of some intrinsic fact about the music - an it factor, you might say - or for more random reasons. In the early days of MP3s, they created a music site to test this question in which they divided the users into multiple independent worlds. In one of the worlds, the users couldn’t see any information about which songs were popular or listened to the most - this was the control world. The other worlds had lists of what other users in that word were listening to. It turned out each of those words developed in different ways, with different songs becoming hits and others languishing, with little correlation to what was popular in the control world. This book is written by one of the social scientists who ran that experiment. In general, the book is an attempt to answer the question why social science findings seems obvious or trivial, and how far along it’s development sociology is as a science. But along the way the other also demonstrates that the results only seem obvious, because of the way our brains work, which is itself one of the findings. And the author makes the underlying argument that the world might be a lot more random than we normally like to believe. That there is no it factor, that there are no special people, special songs, special celebrities, special business others whose inherent qualities actually explain what happens. Of course, that may seem obvious to you too. "
50,0385531680,http://goodreads.com/user/show/83694789-keith-weaver,5,"Watts makes a number of very good points very well:o	Describes the micro-macro problem: e.g. a knowledge of the behaviour of the electron doesn’t lead automatically to a knowledge of the atom; a knowledge of the atom doesn’t lead automatically to a knowledge of chemistry; a knowledge of chemistry doesn’t lead automatically to a knowledge of biology; a knowledge of biology doesn’t lead automatically to a knowledge of physiology; etc.o	We cannot have an understanding of history while it is happening because we can’t know at the time what will turn out to be important; we won’t know this until it has become obvious at some later time what really was importanto	The previous point relates not only to the difficulty of making predictions (there are too many possibilities before the fact) but also to the reasons why the narrative fallacy is a fallacy, and relates also to the often overwhelming role of chance or randomness to outcomes in history and in everyday lifeo	Chapters 8 and 9 are particularly good because of the practical suggestions given (Chapter 8) and the very good discussion of the views of Rawls and Nozick and the book by Sandel (Chapter 9)."

Reviews like this have to be long because this book talks about so much stuff, but they are most useful after you've read the book. I'd like to highlight some things for people who haven't read it yet, and yet which might help those who have read it appreciate it more.Duncan Watts is one of my heroes for two achievements: (1) expanding, with colleagues, the state of the art in path-dependent non-ergodic random processes theory, and (2) running, with colleagues, the famous MusicLab experiment, which demonstrated the power and real-world applicability of the first result. MusicLab, to me, is one of the great experiments of the last hundred years, and Watts himself has written a cogent summary of its meaning and relevance---highly, highly recommended, no matter where you think your interests lie, I guarantee you will find this article arresting. a more modern and appy description of the experiment is given by Kieran Healy on Flappy Bird. (I don't really have a great link for the first, other than Watts' previous books, Small Worlds: The Dynamics of Networks Between Order and Randomness and Six Degrees: The Science of a Connected Age.)These two achievements establish him as more than a psychologist studying WEIRD (western, educated, industrialized, rich, democratic) college student volunteers. His research stints at Yahoo and Microsoft speak to a modern, digital-oriented approach to social science: his research is something hard-nosed engineering types like me cannot scoff at, no matter how silly we think sociology in general is. For these reasons, it was a no-brainer for me to pick this book up.This book is composed to two parts, which take turns in the book. First is Watts's summarization and condensation of the combined literatures of cognitive psychology, behavioral economics, data science, but also philosophies of history and epistemology, forecasting and backcasting, and others from a very diverse set of academic pursuits. Summaries like Deb's (mentioned above) are valuable in helping readers keep track the sheer variety of experiments and analyses and hypotheses that Watts has professionally curated for a reader's consideration.Interleaved with this extremely wide but carefully selected net of topics is Watts' commentaries on them, including his own experiments. And this is what I think some readers panning this book have missed. Because of the size, diversity, and technicality of the first part (discussing others' works), some people think that's all there is in this book: a summary of things they've read in Kahneman, Gigerenzer, Nozick and Rawls, and (my favorite) Arthur Danto. Watts has been humble in interleaving his own commentaries without much fanfare through the broader discussion, and the true value of the book is in what he, as someone who lives and breathes data-driven social experimentation, has to say.For example, I have just reread the discussion of rational choice theory in chapter two. This is the idea of ""homo economicus"", bread and butter to classical economists, and today perhaps best known through the work of Freakonomics. Watts' details the theory and its many triumphs: how puzzling things like cheating teachers and lazy realtors and poor gang members and gift-reciprocating tribespeople playing Ultimatum can be explained, can be rationalized by finding the incentives people face. Once we unearth the potentially surprising and unexpected set of incentives at play in any given situation, puzzling phenomena can be reduced to rational actors maximizing their utility---as natural and simple as water finding its own level.Watts is certainly not alone in criticizing rational choice theory, and he spends time giving a ""litany"" of cognitive biases that hamstring rationality, summarizing others' work: priming, framing, anchoring, availability, motivated reasoning, loss aversion, &c. But then he mounts an unusual (and possibly novel?) attack: one of the big problems with rational choice theory is that it can only explain phenomena in hindsight, and is terrible at predicting them, simply because the set of potentially relevant factors affecting a particular situation is so large (potentially infinite). Thus, while we should celebrate research that identifies the set of incentives at play in a specific behavior, we should also recognize that it won't help us with predicting behaviors in situations even slightly different.It may be the case that this is just due to the youth of this field, and that at some point in the future, the number of incentives in their combinatorial complexity starts shrinking. But we're not there yet. And we may never get there.This is to give an example of Watts' criticism with one specific topic. Other reviews give you a summary of just how many topics there are in this book, and you should know that for most of them you can find primary sources, but nearly all of them have this unique Wattsian twist: a criticism, an experimental extension, some connection to a totally different field that hasn't been considered before.Therefore, this book has much novel content in it. It is much more than a summary of the state of the art in cognitive science or epistemology. Read it and be sure to pay attention to the humbly-offered fresh insights."

Nicely thought-out contrast for a) why what seems obvious can't be taken for granted as fact, and b) why it's so much harder to come up with ""laws"" in the interpersonal world than in the ""hard sciences."" Key takeaways include the limitations on risk assessments, our tendency to focus on the most probable outcome rather than the range of possibilities, and the overemphasis on ""special people"" due to narrative tropes. The example of how a riot can spread due to the presence or absence of a particular tipping-point person and therefore a focus on outcomes misses some of the key catalysts was mind-expanding for me.When I worked at a bank, one of the challenges I faced was a tendency to want to reward our employees based on results, which may or may not accurately reflect the employees' merit. I wrote a piece on SMART goals that I think relates: https://jacobklehman.com/2015/07/15/w..."
53,0385531680,http://goodreads.com/user/show/27816389-duncan,0,"One of the best books on modern sociology for the non-sociologist. Watts walks us through some of the fundamental tenets of what I would call ""scientific"" sociology in a very easy-to-follow and entertaining way. While he frames it as discussing common sense -- its limits, and its failings -- he really is describing the philosophical foundations of modern sociology. The implications of what he is saying (that we can't really trust our senses or what we think we know about human behavior) are profound, but I expect they will go over the head of most readers. I personally know sociologists who do understand what he is saying, yet still fall into the trap of ""using their common sense"". One thing I'd like is for an updated version of the book. It was written in 2011, and some of its examples (those with Yahoo particularly) are already starting to feel a little dated. Also, I can imagine that there might me so much more to add after 9 more years of sociological research."

While I appreciated many of his findings, I felt he waxed on loquaciously all too often. After finishing the main portion of the book, I leafed through the various appendices, indexes, and notes. One of these was a summary of each chapter: it would state the chapter name, the main arguments, and the conclusion, all in one paragraph. I wish the book had been shorter, and focused in more on just the things that ended up in that summary. Overall, I'd say it felt like this book was 15% observation and findings, and 85% attempting to convince all readers (but especially the scientific community) of the value of sociology. Could have done with a little less of that."
55,0385531680,http://goodreads.com/user/show/12871942-rishabh-srivastava,3,"Had some fascinating insights, but also a lot of non value-added content. Would have worked better as a series of 3 long essays instead of a book.My main takeaways were:1. Post-hoc reasoning is 20-20. Be skeptical about legit-sounding explanations of anything that is not a randomised control trial. Examples of this are explanations for political shifts, market movements, or sociological theories.2. Making predictions is really hard. Instead of spending your resources to predict what's going to happen, build capabilities to monitor what's happening in the present. Then, build capabilities to respond quickly to shifts in your market.3. Rely less on theories and more on the scientific method and data."

The nuances AI is trying to understand how to use the NYC subway .... How the Mona Lisa became the greatest painting in the world William Shakespeare the best writer.Each chapter started with so many possibilities. Especially as we moved into the later chapters, the narrative became more theoretical and less, well ... narrative. I was reading a lecture without the grounding of talking about people and their stories.And at the conclusion, I don't really know what I read ... except well, now I have a better idea why the Mona Lisa is so famous.

There is also some original work from the author himself, but overall the book is more other peoples work.Personally I do not like this style of writing. First of all, it is not fair to the original authors. Second, it is unpleasant to regularly run into a piece of text that you already know. Since I read several of the original books, I found this book particularly unpleasant to read.I gave the book 3 stars. I judge it however to be more close to a score of 2 than 4. If I could give it a digit, I would probably give it like a 2.6 or 2.7."
58,0385531680,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6401157-meg,3,"It's difficult to accept the idea that our strongest intuitions, ones that work beautifully under certain small-level constraints, are so often completely wrong when we attempt to apply them at a broader level. Watts does a good job convincing the reader that this is the case. I thought that certain sections suffered from circular reasoning and, interestingly, from Watts committing some of the same kinds of errors in reasoning that he brings to light in the book. However, my reading was choppy, only a few pages at a time, sometimes with very sleepy eyes, so there's a good chance that I missed some things. "
59,0385531680,http://goodreads.com/user/show/101355281-steve-parker,2,Starts off okay with some interesting observations and some clever survey methods but then turns into a sort of job application where the author is arguing that social sciences is a jolly good thing that ought to be paid for widely.Not enough examples of where common sense is misleading and too much time telling the reader that social science is really vital to the world. Got bored and fed up with the cerebral arguments in favour of employing more social scientists.I got the message about common sense being misleading sometimes in the first quarter of the book. After that......time slowed down and circled round a few times.
