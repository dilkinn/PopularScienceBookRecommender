0,0684846349,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3897817-morgan-blackledge,2,"Oh man I really took a chance on this one. And oh man do I feel like a dip. Who ate skittles and farted? My brain did when I bought this book. It's by Candice Pert (1946 – 2013) an American neuroscientist and pharmacologist who discovered the opiate receptor, the cellular binding site for endorphins in the brain, as well as being a distinguished lead researcher at the NIMH, who published over 250 scientific articles on peptides and their receptors and the role of these neuropeptides in the immune system. I decided to read the book despite her association with the new age movement and appearance in the film What the #$*! Do We Know!? (a major black mark against anyone, regardless of their scientific accomplishments).So I held my nose and did it. The first part of the book is a surprisingly lucid account of Perts groundbreaking research, told in an autobiographical form that reads like part feminist critique of the old boy network of research science circa 1970, and part confessional of a rather ruthless woman who got hers by all means necessary. In other words, when she gets passed over or ripped off by a male colleague, she's righteous and indignant (and rightly so), and when she flat out rips off male colleagues, she's brawling with the boys and doing what it takes to be successful in science (and that's life so what ever).In addition to being a fascinating and entertaining glimpse into the cutthroat world of bench science. The book is also an informative tour of affective neuroscience and endocrinology. If you're a fan of Robert Sapolsky's work you will dig some or most of the science Ms. Pert drops.As I read the book, I found myself waiting for her to veer south of hard science and float some rainbow flavored new age doucery. But every time it looked like she was going off the rails, she made a reasonable, evidence based claim. So I cautiously preceded despite the lingering, faint sound and smell of skittle colored farts! When would the other shoe drop. When would she fly off the rails on a crystal Pegasus?It's like one of those scary movies that keeps tricking you into thinking the killer is about to jump out at the victim, and then it turns out to be the goofy roommate with a mask on, or a cat in the bushes. You're tension is relieved for a moment but you know what's going to happen, so you're right back on the edge of your seat waiting for the massacre, and then you let your guard down and PAPOW!And so it goes, slowly but surely Dr. Perts apparent personality flaws seem to catch up to her, and she goes to science jail (i.e. she pulls a slow mo Lindsey Lohan and alienates her colleagues to the point that they no longer support her and shwoop. She's suddenly an outsider, misunderstood righteous victim who's down with the Depak Chopra, and from there its a full on crystal catastrophe, replete with Christian conversion and dream healing experiences.Ewe it stinks like a men's room at a Dairy farm all the sudden! Pure gas! I'm as ashamed as if it were I who dealt it. I'm fully aware that I like what the other reviewers hated about the book, and disliked what other reviews seem to be after, i.e. the so called ""Mind Body"" medicine stuff of Dr. Perts later career. Side rant: the fact that people still say mind body any more is totally irritating, the mind is a property of the brain, and last time I checked, the brain is a part of the body. Saying mind body is like saying vista view, what a lovely view of the vista. Calling the mind ""non-physical"" is not even wrong. That's how lame the idea is. For that matter, calling anything ""non-physical"" is not even wrong.Anyway.Before you write me off as a total dick skeptic, no wait a minute, I kind of am a total dick skeptic so go ahead and write me off. But if you're still reading this, I want to say that I'm not your average total dick skeptic. I’m a therapist. I’m pretty close to finished with a doctorate degree. I teach psychology at a Buddhist University. I practice a mindfulness based psychotherapy modality as a mental health clinician, I have been meditating seriously for over 30 years. I have been doing Yoga for almost as long. I lived in India for a bit, meditated in a cave, the whole nine. But I also love science and I am a total neuroscience dork. All I can say is, there is really interesting hard science exploring mindfulness and wellbeing. Don't waste your time with this shit if you're really interested in this subject."
1,0684846349,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1068763-grace,2,"The title of this book is misleading. This book is not about the molecules of emotion or explaining why you feel the way you feel. It is the outlet for author, scientist, and conference speaker Candace Pert chose to share her personal and professional history, toot her own horn so to speak, and educate the average person on the new paradigm in scientific research that promotes a holistic approach concerning mind, body, and soul. The way Pert makes it sound, she is spearheading the new paradigm movement by being the token scientist to lend her extensive research expertise. I just couldn't stop asking myself, ""But what about the molecules of emotion? When is she going to talk about feelings?""She did cover emotions and the role feelings play in sickness, recovery, and good health; however, it seemed as an afterthought or a bonus discovery as she detailed her research career in peptides and receptors in search of a cure for cancer (her father died of lunch cancer in the early 1980s) and AIDS. She also used the book as a platform to discuss the male chauvinism, intense competition, the failure of science to recognize new discoveries, and the bureaucracy of an system that should be helping people live healthier happy lives instead of bolstering up the egos of men in power. Even though I felt grossly mislead by the title, I couldn't help but get caught up in the author's narrative. Her many years of science writing (the boring passive voice) did not negatively impact this playful yet straight forward narrative that was easy to understand by someone who is not on the science field. She broke down her research and provided easy to understand examples without talking down to the reader. This is key for any science book targeted for a general mainstream audience. If you are interested in learning of one particular scientist's journey through science between the 1970's and the 1990's whose research spanned cancer and HIV, then this is the book for you. It won't disappoint. If you are interested in the science behind either of these diseases, then this is the book for you. If you want to be beat over the head with holistic adages like eating organic food and not doing drugs or drinking alcohol, the last chapter is definitely for you. This is where the book became annoying and lost some of its credibility with me. It could also stem from the fact that the book was written well over a decade ago and her earth-shattering advice is common knowledge for almost all Americans at this point. Overall, I could only give this book two stars. I would have given it three or four if it actually focused on emotions. "
2,0684846349,http://goodreads.com/user/show/45244872-rivka-levy,5,"This was the first book that helped me to start connect the dots, energy-medicine wise, that the body is just a 'mirror' for the soul. Pert's assertion that the body is actual the subconscious mind made flesh completely blew me away.She also lived a very interesting life, and wrote this book with a lot of passion (and occasional melancholy) making it the first scientific page-turner I ever came across.Brilliant book, and highly recommended for people who want an introduction to a more holistic way of viewing their health and happiness, with a scientific stamp of approval from a bona fide PhD."
3,0684846349,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4442364-franz,5,"Excellent account of the politics and egos and one-upmanship involved in big science, in this case molecular biology. Author is a scientist deeply involved in the discovery of the peptides that influence emotions a couple decades ago. She tells the story of the hard work and good luck necessary to find these elusive molecules, the challenge of being a woman in a field dominated by alpha males, and her own personal journey from a hard core materialist to exploring the connections between the mind and the body. Well written for us lay people."
4,0684846349,http://goodreads.com/user/show/229581-zeke,3,"This is a really interesting story of the struggle that women go through in the scientific community. But really, you're not a superhero. And your writing is imprecise. And you contradict yourself. I read the whole thing, but was really frustrated along the way."
5,0684846349,http://goodreads.com/user/show/26634995-doris-jean,5,I read the 1997 edition. This is truly a landmark book. Dr. Pert made some astonishing biological discoveries about the human body and mind. She had to work within the political framework of university research which hindered the science somewhat.I would say that the material in this book would helpful to everyone to understand their own physical and mental health better.Highly recommended.
6,0684846349,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2720349-teresa-tl-bruce,3,"I decided to review this book as I go through it so my impressions are fresh. Why? Because as I began I found myself over-analyzing my own response to the writing. So be warned, this will be the longest Goodreads review I have ever done by the time I am through with it.The author began by introducing herself and all her credentials. It crossed over the line from autobiography to bragging, making me question why she needed to spend so many pages telling me of her brilliance. Makes me a bit skeptical...[Later:] The 2nd and 3rd chapters have ""hooked"" me as the author relates the story of how (& why) she went about seeking to find proof of the opiate receptor (a cellular molecule with which certain drugs interact, leading to pain relief and altered consciousness). Her struggles to overcome the ""good old boy"" mentality and the competitive atmosphere in the scientific community of the 1970's has had me riveted. I am still struggling with some of the technical/scientific jargon, though she does try to explain it in lay terms.[Chapters 4 and 5:] Still not seeing what I thought the book would be about, I am getting either mad or suspicious. Either the author is making up a lot of bitter accusations or she really got shafted by her 1970's/80's ""alpha male"" scientific colleagues. I must go read more![now in chapter 8:] Hmm. I never really thought before about how the body communicates on a cellular level, nor about how our emotions filter our sensory and memory processing.[much, MUCH later!:] Having FINALLY finished the book I can now say I found it enlightening, but with reservations. I usually do not take so long to finish a nonfiction work of this length! Sometimes the writing was compelling enough to keep me immersed in the pages, such as the fast-paced accounts of espionage-like laboratory drama. However, most portions were too easy for me to set aside. The text shifts abruptly between present and past tenses while jumping back and forth from scientific minutiae to lecture hall monologue to panel discussion dialogues. Other portions come across as a memoir-oriented autobiography of the author's achievements and struggles within the highly politicized scientific community.While I agree with the author's premise that the body and mind are more inseparable in function than most of mainstream medicine acknowledges, I found some of her ideas a little too far ""out there"" for my taste.Two quotations from the book stood out to me: (from page 222) ""...absence of proof is not proof of absence."" (from page 306, wherein the author quotes the words of Dr. Brian Luke Seaward) ""The body becomes the battlefield for the war games of the mind. All the unresolved thoughts and emotions, the negativity we hold on to, shows up in the body and makes us sick."""
7,0684846349,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3726509-lis-carey,3,"Candace Pert, a neuroscientist and discoveror of the opiate receptor, recounts both the intricate relationship between mind, body, and emotions, and her own career uncovering those connections and the neurochemical basis of them. Beginning her career in the early 1970s, gender was an even bigger obstacle than it is now, which no cultural or legal expectation that it shouldn't be. Sometimes she had to fight for recognition of her contributions; other times she had to fight to be able to do the work at all.But along the way, she made major discoveries, and had life-changing experiences. The mind-body dichotomy was still unquestioned scientific orthodoxy in her early days. She doesn't say, but I will: Rene Descartes has a lot to answer for. Pert's work with neuropeptides and their receptors helps to rebuild the essential unity of the person, mind, body, and emotions, and uncover the connections between our emotional health and our physical health.There are times when this goes right up to edge of woo-woo, but it doesn't cross over. Pert is spiritual, religious, and very much a scientist. No, that's not a contradiction or a paradox. She's quite open about her beliefs, and the interrelations among the different aspects. Her central, guiding principle is a commitment to truth.It's a fascinating story. There are times when I find it quite frustrating. It is, however, well worth reading if you are interested in the topic.I bought this audiobook."
8,0684846349,http://goodreads.com/user/show/12340407-nancy,5,"Not only was this a friendly read, but I learned a lot about the Scientific community, the politics or the system, and how it works. When people ask me about this book, I find it hard to categorize. It's a little bit memoir, a little bit science and understanding of the human body, and a little bit personal philosophy on healing. Overall, it was both educational and uplifting and recommended to anyone who wants to explore more the connection between physiology and the mind. "
9,0684846349,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2105523-bob-nichols,4,"The book has some downsides, but I thought her discussion of the biological basis for emotion was excellent. Emotions are chemical signals that course throughout the body, like hormones, moving as inner signals to the outside world and vice versa. Under the old and still standard model, bodily communication moves via physical mechanism – neurons connected by synapses. This, Perk states, is a small part of bodily communication. The remainder is via neuropeptide movement – specific chemical signals (1) that bind with specific receptors throughout the body. Hers is a “new theory of information exchange outside the bounds of the hardwired nervous system, focused on a purely chemical, nonsynaptic communication between cells.” (2) I suppose this helps to account for those “flashes” of emotion that we are familiar with. They are immediate in time and felt body-wide in space. But Pert also says that more generalized and “chronic” feeling states operate in a similar body-wide way. (3)Pert’s argues that the separation of mind and body is wrong. Mind functions as the “means” for the body. Inner needs are met by mind telling the body what it must do (seeking behavior) to satisfy those needs. Outer, relevant stimuli are funneled through mind or body via senses to tell the body how to react (defending behavior) appropriately. She writes that “peptides serve to weave the body’s organs and systems into a single web that reacts to both internal and external environmental changes with complex, subtly orchestrated responses. Peptides are the sheet music containing the notes, phrases, and rhythms that all the orchestra – your body – to play as an integrated entity. And the music that results is the tone or feeling that you experience subjectively as your emotions.” Mind and body, in other words, function as a team. (4)As with other emotion theorists, Pert lumps all the emotions (fear, anger, love, pain, pleasure, joy, contentment, sadness, awe, bliss) together and, when mixed with “other factors such as intensity and duration of emotion…there may easily be hundreds of subtle emotional states.” This, in my view, is a muddled mess. And there’s a need for a theoretical framework that can pull all of this together more coherently. Pert’s central theme that molecules of emotions link the body’s (survival, well-being, replication) needs with the outside world (what it needs from the world) and, in reverse, (what the body doesn’t need), can provide a solid foundation for such a theory. Taking from Schopenhauer, pain and pleasure are not just other emotions. They are primary emotion states, and they are primary because all specific emotions (Pert’s ligands and receptors) contain these overall pain and pleasure elements. Pain is a need state. It is what we need to live and these move us (i.e., motivate us to move) out into the world toward relevant nurture, social and sexual objects. Pain also moves us to defend against threats and harm coming toward us. When we are successful at seeking and defending, we are in a pleasure state. Pain and pleasure states vary in intensity. Low-grade pain doesn’t result in action or reaction, but festers beneath the surface, much as Freud observed (uncovering and expressing processes release energy). Pleasure comes in a variety of forms, depending on the nature of the object but especially by the intensity (contentment is pleasure, but so is bliss). When pain intensity is high enough, energy converts to behavior (via instinct, disposition, learning and reason) that is appropriate vis-à-vis the relevant object. When we are not successful, we experience sadness in its various forms, including grief which is an irrevocable loss (where nothing can be done to rectify).From this theoretical schema, specific emotion structures can be deduced from Darwinian theory. We need nurture (hence, the emotions of love, attachment). We need the group to survive (hence, the full-suite of social [tribal] emotions), and we need a sexual mate (hence, sexual drive and associated behaviors). In the same way, we fear what we don’t need. Here too, fear is not just another emotion. It is the negative version of need and both are pain. Threats and harm create fear states that convert to fear reaction (“flight”) or defensive anger (“fight”). Or, when objects resist our seeking behavior, they in effect become “hostile” and we react the same as defensive anger: we get angry at the object because it doesn’t behave as we want. Pert is an excellent writer. She intertwines all of this stuff in the first three-quarters of her book with her personal journey as a woman scientist in a male-dominated world. She writes extensively of her experiences in this regard, but one gets the strong feeling that she’s doing a lot of score-settling, mainly against men. (5) She’s also surprisingly oblivious to her own male-like traits that she dislikes. Throughout this book, Pert finds ways to toot her own horn and does a good amount of name-dropping along the way. (6) I suppose in her defense that she had to self-advertise to advance in a man’s world, but I found it tiresome and annoying. I am also surprised that she would actually feel comfortable writing about herself in this way. The main issue I have with the book is in the last part where I think she, reflecting perhaps the 1970s, strays into the nether land. She links her body-mind chemical theory to an external body of “information,” which is her entry into the spiritual, God, world. Information coursing through the body makes sense. Information taken from the environment makes sense. But statements that such information have an extra-terrestrial standing does not. Pert also makes a pitch for “mind-body medicine,” which is basically that the right (spiritual) mind flow can correct various medical ills. There’s probably more room for this than what Western medicine is comfortable with, but she downplays Western medicine relative to various Eastern-like meditative health and healing practices. The one part of her theory of emotion that she does not discuss but I would have loved to have had her point of view, is how the molecules of emotion convert into abstractions of memory and thought.(1) Pert sees “emotions as chemical ligands – that is to say, peptides.” (2) “Miles [a colleague researcher] has estimated that, counter to the collective wisdom of the neuropharmacologists and neuroscientists, less than 2 percent of neuronal communication actually occurs at the synapse.” She adds that “the way in which peptides circulate through the body, finding their target receptors in regions far more distant than had ever previously been thought possible, made the brain communication system resemble the endocrine system, whose hormones can travel the length and breadth of our bodies. The brain is like a bag of hormones!”(3) “When I use the term ‘emotion,’ I am speaking in the broadest of terms, to include not only the familiar human experiences of anger, fear, and sadness, as well as joy, contentment, and courage, but also sensations such as pleasure and pain, as well as the ‘drive states’ studied by the experimental psychologists, such as hunger and thirst. In addition, I also refer to an assortment of other intangible, subjective experiences that are probably unique to humans, such as spiritual inspiration, awe, bliss and other states of consciousness that we all have experienced but that have been up until now, physiologically unexplained.” Though Pert minimizes the role of pleasure and pain (I discuss why in the body of this review), I believe she is correct in seeing “drives” as emotions. Her reference to “other intangible, subjective experiences” is probably connected to her later discussion of an externalized world of consciousness (also discussed in the body of this review).(4) Earlier, Pert writes that “if we accept the idea that peptides and other information substances are the biochemicals of emotion, their distribution in the body’s nerves has all kinds of significance, which Sigmund Freud, were he alive today, would gleefully point out as the molecular confirmation of his theories. The body is the unconscious mind!”(5) “Don’t get me wrong, I like men – but in their place, which is the bedroom. Let them out, and they start wars.” This could be passed off as a statement for effect, but it does reflect an underlying attitude in the book.(6) “A large bulletin board frames my ‘famous-person montage,’ where I’ve arranged the photographs I’ve collected of myself with various public figures.” "
10,0684846349,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1092387-amity,5,"I really enjoyed this book because Candace Pert is a scientist who has developed the skill of sharing her discoveries and scientific pursuits with diverse audiences. There is a hefty dose of science - explaining the way the body and mind communicate and her work on neurotransmitter receptors in the brain and body, AIDS research and the politics of science and pharmacology and her struggles as a woman in a male dominated field (especially in the 70s & 80s.)This is the first time I have read solid scientific research regarding the way our minds, spirits and bodies work together. I found it fascinating that the emotional information or psychosomatic network (in the form of emotional energy, hormone, neurotransmitters, etc within the body) correlates with the chakras, subtle energies & many ideas from holistic, eastern and traditional medicine (which I have found interesting, but needed this extra level of ""proof"" or evidence to pique my interest in continued study).I especially like her discussion of self-honesty (p. 294) as a way to reduce stress and free emotional blockages. I also resonated with her discussion of focusing our intent and working through inner conflicts to increase our success and enjoyment of life."
11,0684846349,http://goodreads.com/user/show/37666248-mayda-ochoa,0,"Molecules of emotionsA book written by a scientist, which is (was) also a woman, and a superb human being, who walked a long road to be able to explain scientifically why she was the way she was, and how our emotions could predestine and predict our health and even our death. She had to fight for her knowledge in a world of men who took from her even her most precious scientific awards. This is a book, which will open your eyes to how our bodies and minds are parts of a higher existence."
12,0684846349,http://goodreads.com/user/show/19049492-terry-seven,4,"I am of two minds regarding this book. On the one hand, the ideas here about the source, meaning and potential power of emotions in the body completely blew my mind. I find them compelling and plausible, and I wish there were more attention paid to these notions in modern medicine.I also did not object, as some people appear to, to learning better what it's like to be a woman and a renegade in the hyper-competitive world of medical research, or to the author's reflections on relevant personal events like the death of her father. On the other hand, the flow of the book was ridiculous. Framing the whole thing within an in-person talk was corny and confusing. I can see that the frame of the story could easily be made of the *contents* of her talk, since they probably sum up her conclusions nicely, but I don't need to hear how she feels in the moments before she gives the talk, or that she pretends not to be the speaker in order to find out people's thoughts in advance. Is this bragging? Or should I care for some reason?Also, many of these personal stories made me think of the author as a complete flake! An alternately whiny & smug flake! It seems to me that a person so aware of the power of emotions might try harder to control her own, and have a clearer image of herself. It does seem that the geniuses of the world are like this, however: unlikable. And the book itself still broke open a world of real possibilities. I would reread it tomorrow if I had the time."
13,0684846349,http://goodreads.com/user/show/102720-rebecca-bruce,5,"I loved this book! What an eye-opening experience! Candace Pert, PhD discovered the opiate receptor back in the 70's. Her discovery led to the making of SSRI drugs and all kinds of mood-altering substances that she warms against. Her book describes how your body is your subconscious mind, your health is a product of how you think about yourself. Taking many of the drugs on the market today alter the bodies chemistry, but that in a way that can be sustained. Pert give advice on how to actually change your molecular functioning so that pharmaceuticals are no longer needed. Pert gives a scientific explanation of the biomolecular basis of for our emotions and also the everyday ways that one can promote health in themselves. The book is an inspiration for exploring the body-mind connection and empowering one in their quest for health and happiness. "
14,0684846349,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2253227-beth-haynes,3,"Interesting recounting of the author's experience and evolution from conventional science/medical research to a mind/body/spirit perspective on health and illness. Especially interesting because of her experience as a lab scientist working in academia and at the NIH at the forefront of neuroscience physiology. As a graduate student, the author discovered the opiate neuroreceptor (a Nobel Prize level discovery). The main thesis of her book centers on neuropeptides as the physical basis of emotional experience.What struck me most is just how much was known about mind/body connections 20 years ago - and how little mainstream medicine and medical research have embraced this perspective - it's still considered unscientific and ""alternative."""
15,0684846349,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1467567-natalie,3,"Pert, of 'What The Bleep Do We Know' fame, discusses her scientific discoveries (including the locating and verification of the opiate receptor) in the context of her life. The life part is interesting but gets in the way sometimes of the science, leaving me with a lot of questions about her ideas that stem from both her experiences and her science. I can't argue with the suggestions for living at the end, but I wanted more depth on the actual molecules and how they interact in the body to influence (or 'create,' as she claims) emotion, rather than how the scientific community is an egotistical and difficult environment."

Neuropeptides are the receptors that join the brain, glands, and immune system in a network of communication between brain and body. This explains how we really do feel emotion in our gut and heart. Our emotions impact our immune system. It explained to me why essential oils actually do heal. I have quotes from the book on my website, www.myvibranthealth.net, under the Health Related Info menu."
17,0684846349,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2069818-sarah,1,"Misleading. It's not about the molecules of emotion, it's a tedious autobiography that trickles out bits of the content that the cover and inside flap lead us to expect.

18,0684846349,http://goodreads.com/user/show/76054408-jack-elliott,5,"During her post doc studies, Pert discovered the keyhole in the brain that unlocks opiates and the man she was working under took the credit. It took awhile to get that straightened out but she finally was vindicated. She does a splendid job of explaining, in lay terms, how the mind and body are ""one and the same"" and do not function separately. Some fascinating science of the human mind and body. After this book she became involved in eastern spirituality and incorporated that with her brilliant scientific experience. If you're really interested in how the human body and mind function you will want to read this because she does an excellent job of writing to the lay reader."
19,0684846349,http://goodreads.com/user/show/25992143-amanda,3,"Dr Candace Pert is a good scientist but not a very good writer. Her message about the bodymind connection is important, but it was overshadowed by all the drama she injected into this book. She comes across as a pretty ruthless, aggressive sort of person, one who has no issues alienating others for personal glory. I think the book would have been better if she left her personal issues at the door and focused more on the science."
20,0684846349,http://goodreads.com/user/show/94480351-brent,0,Much more of a memoir depicting how her research was published rather than the actual content of her research.
21,0684846349,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11445634-matthew-green,3,"Molecules of Emotion is not exactly what it claims to be. Dr. Pert describes the book as a description of her research that discovered the scientific link that proves that emotions are modulated by chemicals within the body, thereby bridging the gap between mind and body. That's only part of what's happening in the book, however.Positively, Pert is an engaging writer. Her stories hook you, and her explanations of scientific details are relatively clear despite their intricacy, though she is, of course, getting into more complex material than probably most of her readers will be familiar with. She presents her research and her process along the way in a way that makes it attainable and worth attending to.However, the book primarily reads like a memoir rather than an explanation of her intended point. She spends a great deal of time talking about her life and her internal thoughts and feelings, which makes the book feel more personal and engaging, but also makes it feel scattered and disconnected. She tried to make the idea of peptides bonding to cells throughout the body as the means of communicating and producing emotion the main theme, but there was quite a bit that didn't contribute to it. Long sections of the book were unrelated to the idea entirely. Some of those other sections were still interesting and made valuable points, such as the competitive and misogynistic culture of medical research, but it's not what the book advertised itself to be.Finally, while Pert was very exact in her microscopic research and theorizing, she was much more loose in her speculating on the macroscopic implications of that research. I trust her lab research, but I don't trust her conclusions about it beyond the biochemistry. She increasingly pushed toward New Age ideas, particularly in the last chapter, arguing that her research proved these ideas valid, but in order to link one to the other, there were significant leaps in logic. For example, it does not follow that because the body runs on information, cause and effect are no longer useful or valid aspects of its functioning or that because information is not specific to a particular time or space, it does not belong to the material realm. She tried to keep such conclusions bound to scientific thought, but she couldn't seem to help but draw in ideas and conclusions that the science can't support. Molecules of Emotion is an interesting and engaging read, and I appreciate her contributions to neuroscientific and immunological knowledge, though the book isn't quite what it claims to be, and not all of her thoughts here were grounded in the science."
22,0684846349,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4057501-karissa,3,"I got this as a free audiobook from audible.com. I am a chemical engineer/chemist by trade and thought this sounded like an interesting read. The book is narrated by the author Candace Pert.The very first thing I noticed is that the author is incredibly conceited, she spends a lot of time bragging about her accomplishments right away. This book is more of an autobiography than an actually book behind the science of emotion.There are some interesting theories in this book, that I think many people would agree with. The main theory is that emotional state is caused by a variety of chemicals, particularly peptids. These molecules not only have an influence on your emotions but on your overall physical health as well, you can't really separate the two. I think this theory was groundbreaking at the time, but much more widely accepted now.There is a also a lot of discussion about the male domination of science and how hard the author had to work to get recognized. I think maybe this might have been more true in the 70's than today. The author also comes to the realization by the end that maybe it was her aggressive attitude and combativeness that caused some of her issues with her male cohorts and I couldn't agree more. Working as a female in a male dominated field I have found that the opinion of those around you (male or otherwise) is fed by your attitude towards them. I have never had a ton of issue with my male coworkers respecting me and treating me as an equal. I had some issues in college, but now that I am working with the people I want to work with and in a field I am comfortable in it just hasn't been an issue. If you have an attitude of competence, but aren't completely arrogant, I don't think you will have much of an issue.Okay stepping off my soapbox now...Overall this was an interesting read, but not exactly what I was hoping for or expecting. It is more an autobiography of Pert’s work and a treatise on the struggles of female scientists than an explanation behind the chemicals that guide our emotional and physical health. It was free so I can’t really complain, but I wouldn’t really recommend it either."

From a I-don't-understand-science perspective the book did an okay job of explaining how emotions and other sciency things work in our body. My main problem with this book was the inconsistency of writing style; it kind of jumps from scientific mumbo jumbo to Dr. Pert's life experiences, skips to the past, and the present, jumping from giving a presentation, to just normally speaking, and uses random italics and paragraph splits as transitions. This made it really hard to follow the timeline of what was happening and just confused me a lot. Besides that, I found Dr. Pert to be kind of obnoxious in that she was always saying she was treated unfairly because she was a woman, which yes, that may be true, but throwing a hissy fit every time that happens is not how to overcome that problem, and actually, makes men feel more like women should not be in high positions."
24,0684846349,http://goodreads.com/user/show/610762-amberjean,3,"There's some very interesting stuff in this book. Theories, science history, yadda yadda. It truly is fascinating stuff...But it's very much mired in the administrative and, ironically, emotional, details of how scientific research gets done. While this might be a fascinating window for some folks, since I work in the sciences, it was a little too much like my daily life to hold any interest for me, and it was certainly not in the scope of what I expected, which was a pop-science book about an interesting topic. It turned out to be 1/3 about the topic, and 2/3 about the trajectory of the author's career and personal life as a woman in the sciences. The sciences were and are a tremendously tough place for women to work, but I felt the book focused more on those issues than on the science of how emotion happens. A more appropriate (if less titillating) title would be ""A Short History of Psychoneuroimmunology."""

Candace Pert started off her career with a bang, being the first scientist to isolate what we now commonly call pain receptors in the human body. This book basically walks you through her experience into her own personal, somewhat pseudo-scientific study of a direct link between human emotions and biological function. This is required reading for a course I'm taking, not something I pick up on preference, but I thoroughly enjoyed the book, even if I may have felt Dr. Pert might take her conclusions a bit far sometimes: She is heading into the unknown, so she may in fact, when the chips are all cashed in, be right again. This would be a great book for medical students who like the idea of a more holistic approach to medicine."

Pert uses her own life story to illustrate her scientific findings and gives recommendations for how her findings can affect the lives of her readers.At the end of her book, Pert gives recommendations for a healthy bodymind: 1) become conscious, 2) access your psychosomatic network, 3) tap into your dreams, 4) get in touch with your body, 5) reduce stress, 6) exercise, 7) eat wisely, and 8) avoid substance abuse."

I now understand why things work the way I observe - and with things I mean spirituality, meditation, therapies...Sometimes her trip into spiritual realm is too far without any evidence but I could take it as someone else’s interpretation of reality.Let me add that one of the first things I got known when googling was Candace Pert´s reputation of an assertive bad girl.

It took something like 120 pages before Pert finally dug into the book's declared topic, and I found myself growing increasingly impatient and thinking about giving up on it.

217,0684846349,http://goodreads.com/user/show/19380980-lisa-townsend,5,"Dr. Candace Pert, Ph.D. was a neuroscientist that ascended to the top of her field and ended up at ""The Palace"", The National Institutes of Health. The first seven chapters outline that trauma, and it was mostly zipper worshipping, ego, patriarchal, misogynist trauma that she was not fully aware of at the start. She ran right into it and learned as she went which maybe made it worthwhile, but it did shorten her life. She died fairly young it turns out; age 71.As an intelligent, empowered woman myself, I had a very hard time reading about her experience in the top echelons of science. That was the 80's but I don't believe it's that different in 2017!! Scientific materialist dogma is dying a slow death because it's so tied to the big money from the State. Dr. Pert did come around to holism and was on the cutting edge of finding a cure for AIDS so it came to a happy end. Still, it was fascinating for me to see how dated her mindset was in the story (1946-2013) being born in the 1940's. Socialization cannot be stripped by intelligence. Her personal and professional contributions were enormous. This is a GREAT non-fiction memoir. "

Recommended to me by a nutritionist I really respect, I thought there was going to be something more tangible to take away from the discovery of emotions being *in* the body as well as the mind. What it was instead was a blunt overview of neuroscience research practices (some of which were hard to stomach), a story about being overlooked for a Nobel prize that made me audibly cry out in contempt for the unfair practices and sexism demonstrated, get the gist that Candace moved ever closer to alternative therapies as her career progressed, and that there’s more to be said about the HIV/AIDS treatment (which is featured in the 2013 film The Dallas Buyers Club, though obviously this doesn’t get mentioned in a boiled written in the 90s). All of these stories could have been developed into more detailed accounts of their own, and the whole book felt like a series of thoughts that aren’t fully formed.
