0,0671027034,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3530961-caroline,2,"This book had a profound effect on me, however, of the negative variety. It did give me pointers on how to actually break out of my shell and ""win friends"" but in the long term, it did way more harm than good. Not the book per se, but my choice to follow the advice given there. The book basically tells you to be agreeable to everybody, find something to honestly like about them and compliment them on it, talk about their interests only and, practically, act like a people pleaser all the time.It might sound like a harmless, or even attractive idea in theory, but choosing to apply it in your every day life can lead to dangerous results. Case in point: after being a smiley happy person with loads of friends for about a year, the unpleasant realization began to creep in, that by being so agreeable to everybody else, I rarely ever got my way. I also sustained friendships with people who were self-centered, so talking about their interests was all we got to do together, which drained me of my energy. The worst thing still, is that by trying to find something to like about every person, I completely disregarded their glaring faults. It didn't matter that those people did have redeeming qualities - they weren't redeeming enough! I ended up with a bunch of friends I didn't really want and, because I was so preoccupied with ""winning"" those friendships I missed out on the chance to form relationships with good people. I suppose, for somebody who is a better judge of character, the principles outlined in this book *could* be of some value. But that's really just me trying to find something positive (using the ""principles"") in a book that I am still trying to UNlearn.If you want to win friends, you have to do it the hard way, by being yourself and risking rejection (and daring to do some rejection of your own, as well). And if you want to influence people the only fair way to do it is through honesty. All the rest is manipulation and pretending. Do not read this book, you'll only learn how to manipulate yourself & others. Do not read it out of fear of rejection & low self-esteem, there are better ways to gain some courage in approaching people. This will harm you in the long run.Thank you for reading this review."
1,0671027034,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1277173-brent,4,"This is an incredible book. I've heard people mention it for years and years and thought the idea of it was so stupid. The way some people talked about it made it seem like it was a book for scoundrels or for socially awkward people. I didn't want to be either, so I didn't want to read it. Finally, a great friend of mine recommended it to me and I started reading it. This is a book for people. It's not about being evil or admitting you're nerdy; it's about how to get along with people. Anyone who ever has problems getting along with people should read this book. I know I do, but this book has completely changed my perspective. This really comes close to a life changing book. The main point of this book is that if you want to have friends and be successful, you should be nice not mean. It sounds so obvious and I thought I was doing it, but now I realize all the mean things that I've done and still do to people when I don't get along with them. As I've read this book (and I'll work hard to do this from now on) I've tried to think more about the other person's perspective when I disagree with them and it helps so much. I've already noticed a change in the way I interact with people. This is a great book. I highly recommend it to anyone who wants to get along with other people. It's a very humbling yet empowering book. "

It's also aimed at salespeople and not regular humans."
3,0671027034,http://goodreads.com/user/show/287127-ivan,4,"Three things about this book surprised me and I liked it a lot more than I thought I would. One - it seemed pretty much timeless. Not much anachronism here, because language still serves the same purposes as ever, and people still want basically the same things they've always wanted. I liked the examples taken from Abe Lincoln, etc.Two - the techniques described in the book aren't duplicitous. We all try to do what the title says, just like everyone else, whether we're admitting it to ourselves or not. Readers are repeatedly encouraged to develop genuine interest in others, be honest and ethical, and obey the golden rule.Three - I enjoyed it (read twice back to back) and it felt easy and natural to apply some of the ideas in my life. Shortly after reading this book, I was a little bit better at communicating and a little bit happier about my interactions with others in general."
4,0671027034,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1027554-paul-rhodes,1,"Utter dreck! Anyone who thinks this book offers important wise advice on friendship is an idiot.Dale Carnegie was nothing but a huckstering sophist, and a very repulsive one at that. For those of you who may not know, Carnegie's How to Win Friends and Influence People is a handbook on how to exploit friendship for the sake of financial and political gain. Now fans of this book (why such people are allowed to read, much less vote, I do not know) will say this book helped them overcome their shyness and make real friendships. But Dale Carnegie is not interested in real friendship. His only concern is to exploit friendship for financial and political gain. One need not be Einstein to know this. One need only read all the garish claims on the back of the book (I have an earlier edition than the one usually found in bookstores today) such as, say, ""Increase your earning power"" ""(Carnegie's book will) [m]ake you a better salesman, a better executive."" If the book were really about true friendship, as its many lobotomized fans insist, then one would expect the blurbs to claim that the book will make the reader a better friend, not a better salesman. A true friend cares about his friends, but a salesman cares about his profit, and if friendship come between him and his profit, then so much for friendship. Dale Carnegie's groupies are utterly oblivious to his promotion of such shameless exploitation, which is as obvious as a communal bedpan. And they are also utterly oblivious to historical facts. Had they some historical knowledge, then these sycophants-in-training surely would have read Dale Carnegie's pilpul with slightly less pollyannish gullibility. For instance, if they knew anything about the Age of the Robber Barons, they might have found Dale Carnegie's depiction of Andrew Carnegie as a man truly concerned for the lot of his fellow man a bit hard to stomach. Sure, Andrew Carnegie smiled a lot and presented a friendly appearance to the press and public, and that was enough for Dale. Dale--like all other sophists, politicians, and prostitutes--cared only for appearances, but underneath the accommodating demeanor of Andrew Carnegie was a heart as hard as the steel his factories forged. Andrew Carnegie would publicly declare his support for rights of the worker and yet let his Manager Frick hire Pinkerton Guards to massacre the union workers. Andrew Carnegie would snatch good PR with his various philanthropies but also poured much of his money into the American Eugenics Movement which managed to get laws passed all over this country that mandated the sterilization of cripples like me. American Eugenics also had a profound influence upon German Eugenics, an influence which one can see documented in the minutes of The Nuremberg Trials. I hope even Carnegie groupies are not that ignorant not to know that influence, however nice, pleasant, and smiling it may be, is bad when it leads to genocide. Yet, I suspect those who swear by this book will continue to have nothing but admiration for Dale Carnegie, whose sycophantic adulation for the ruthless rich who killed off unionized workers and funded the genocide of the weak should offend, repel, and disgust anyone with even a modicum of human thought and decency. Carnegie fans are idiots."

It's an icon of self help books and that was a problem because I kind of hate that genre. I decided to get rid of this one as well but not without trying, at least, to see if there is anything of value in it. Well, I was surprised to read some sensible advice and I decided to actually read more. charming in their archaic ways. So, the book wasn't total garbage. As I said above, it had some good advice about the subject of win friends and influence people although there was a lot of filler in order to make his principle into a book. Some examples were really interesting others a bit ridiculous. One of the problems I had with the author and one I find too often in self-help books is the condescending tone, the ones that tells you how smart he is and that she is the only one capable to tell you how success is achieved. It was an interesting read, I learn some useful skills but it isn't groundbreaking anymore in my opinion."

A book that aims to turn us into manipulating individuals who would want to achieve their means through flattery and other verbal-mental tricks. Even technically, it seems to me that the ploys' in this book would never really work. Here is a quote from the book - “Don't be afraid of enemies who attack you. Be afraid of the friends who flatter you.” And what does the book do? It tries, or at least pretends to turn you into a someone who would flatter everything that moves – so that you get - WHAT YOU WANT. Most of us read so that we are inspired, moved, even shocked or atleast entertained by stories. We also read so that we understand better and stretch the possibilities of our minds and hearts, to be better human beings. We definitely do not read to become conniving ugly creatures to be held prisoners by our greed. And come on get a grip – this is essentially a sales book. "

When dealing with people, let us remember we are not dealing with creatures of logic. We are dealing with creatures of emotion, creatures bristling with prejudices and motivated by pride and vanity.
Dale Carnegie is a quintessentially American type. He is like George F. Babbitt come to life—except considerably smarter. And here he presents us with the Bible for the American secular religion: capitalism with a smile. In a series of short chapters, Carnegie lays out a philosophy of human interaction. The tenets of this philosophy are very simple. People are selfish, prideful, and sensitive creatures. To get along with people you need to direct your actions towards their egos. To make people like you, compliment them, talk in terms of their wants, make them feel important, smile big, and remember their name. If you want to persuade somebody, don’t argue, and never contradict them; instead, be friendly, emphasize the things you agree on, get them to do most of the talking, and let them take credit for every bright idea. The most common criticism lodged at this book is that it teaches manipulation, not genuine friendship. Well, I agree that this book doesn’t teach how to achieve genuine intimacy with people. A real friendship requires some self-expression, and self-expression is not part of Carnegie’s system. As another reviewer points out, if you use this mindset to try to get real friends, you’ll end up in highly unsatisfying relationships. Good friends aren't like difficult customers; they are people you can argue with and vent to, people who you don't have to impress. Nevertheless, I think it’s not accurate to say that Carnegie is teaching manipulation. Manipulation is when you get somebody to do something against their own interests; but Carnegie’s whole system is directed towards getting others to see that their self-interest is aligned with yours. This is what I meant by calling him the prophet of “capitalism with a smile,” since his philosophy is built on the notion that, most of the time, people can do business with each other that is mutually beneficial. He never advocates being duplicitous: “Let me repeat: The principles taught in this book will work only when they come from the heart. I am not advocating a bag of tricks. I am talking about a new way of life.” Maybe what puts people off is his somewhat cynical view of human nature. He sees people as inherently selfish creatures who are obsessed with their own wants; egotists with a fragile sense of self-esteem: “People are not interested in you. They are not interested in me. They are interested in themselves—morning, noon and after dinner.” Well, maybe it's just because I am an American, but this conception of human nature feels quite accurate to me. Even the nicest people are absorbed with their own desires, troubles, and opinions. Indeed, the only reason that it’s easy to forget that other people are preoccupied with their own priorities is because we are so preoccupied with our own that it’s hard to imagine anyone thinks otherwise. The other day, for example, I ran into my neighbor, a wonderfully nice woman, who immediately proceeded to unload all her recent troubles on me while scarcely asking me a single question. This isn’t because she is bad or selfish, but because she’s human and wanted a listening ear. I don’t see anything wrong with it. In any case, I think this book is worth reading just for its historical value. As one of the first and most successful examples of the self-help genre, it is an illuminating document. Already in this book, we have what I call “Self-Help Miracle Stories”—you know, the stories about somebody applying the lessons from this book and achieving a complete life turnaround. Although the author always insists the stories are real, the effect is often comical: “Jim applied this lesson, and his customer was so happy he named his first-born son after him!” “Rebecca impressed her boss so much that he wrote her a check for one million dollars on the spot!” “Frank did such a good job at the meeting that one of his clients bought him a Ferrari, and another one offered him his daughter in marriage!” (These are only slight exaggerations.) Because of this book’s age, the writing is quaint and charming. Take, for example, this piece of advice on how to get the most out of the book: “Make a lively game out of your learning by offering some friend a dime or a dollar every time he or she catches you violating one of these principles.” A lively game! How utterly delightful.Probably this book would be far more effective if Carnegie included some exercises instead of focusing on anecdotes. But then again, it would be far less enjoyable reading in that case, since the anecdotes are told with such verve and pep (to quote Babbitt). And I think we could all use a little more pep in our lives."

There is so much that can be learned from it and I encourage everyone to give it a try. It's a textbook, written for a course, but it's incredibly engaging. I will be coming back to it frequently in the future."
10,0671027034,http://goodreads.com/user/show/63328133-sheri,5,"Easy to understand advice for building and improving positive and successful relationships with people in all areas of your life. Not a book per se for making friends, although it certainly can be used that way (with a grain of salt perhaps), but more directly a book that promotes good communication, kindness, and the social skills to foster healthy and productive working relationships. I can see how some people are taken aback by Carnegie’s advice. You have to be in the right frame of mind to truly gain from this book. Go into it with a reflective approach and a genuine and concentrated effort to gain wisdom and you will be rewarded with the insights to achieve the goodwill of others as well as solid and lasting relationships."
11,0671027034,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10999850-cathy-carpenter,1,"This is the most boring, tedious, inane book I've ever read. It is a total of 236 pages but the essence could be boiled down to 12 at most. Every chapter, he has one point summarized in a neat box at the end. I skimmed the rest. He gives you six examples when one or two would do. He deliberately repeats himself. He wastes the readers' time.Do yourself a favor and just read the ""In a Nutshell"" summary points at the end of each chapter. You won't miss anything. "

Some things that are described in this book I realized before reading this book, but there were a lot of things I never thought about myself but are so true. I don't like conflicts and I found a lot of tips in this book about this topic..so how not to be in fights with people. Yaaay, my zen is safe! =)"
13,0671027034,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5617661-jan-maat,0,"Reading between the lines and paying attention to the biographical details you realise that Carnegie never was a successful salesman himself. Success only came late in life when he was teaching an evening school class on the topic of how to win friends and influence people. His students would share their stories about changes in thinking or attitude which had changed their lives, these then made their way in to the book. Once the book was published readers would send in their own stories which were added to later editions.As a result the book is a collection of anecdotes, many of which have people changing their circumstances or changing their lives by changing the way they thought, but all the same you think that the unending pile of washing up featured in one story always remains an unending pile of washing up whether you enjoy it, despise it, value it or feel oppressed by it. Still, the book keys into a timeless message that you may not be able to change reality, but you can certainly change the way you think about it(view spoiler)[ although you could smash the plates I suppose (hide spoiler)].On the sinister side this is a book that celebrates positive thinking, which is to say that it ignores a realistic appraisal of the world in favour of having your cake and eating it, on one level this is a fairly harmless book on another it tends towards The Secret and the belief that others and oneself are to blame if you die when a ferry sinks, or if you are persecuted, or if you develop cancer because plainly such things only happen because you weren't positive enough . Barbara Ehrenreich discusses this all very nicely in Smile or Die. It is only a short book and won't harm you if you give it a read, but despite the title doesn't have a lot of advice on how to win friends or influence people. A good book to lend to people with a big smile as they will suspect that you are trying to win their friendship and/or influence them the beerfree way."

“You can make more friends in two months by becoming interested in other people than you can in two years by trying to get other people interested in you.”
‘How to win friends and influence people’ is one of the best self-help books I read in 2018. It’s a very popular book that I managed to avoid for years simply because I thought it might have cliché advice that I’d probably already know and I won’t find anything useful. Boy, was I wrong! It definitely has pieces of advice you probably have heard a million times already, from your parents, teachers or just any adult; you listen and get inspired for like 15 minutes but you don’t spend time pondering on it and it’s forgotten. I guess you need to be in a certain state of mind to absorb opinions and ideas. This book had me in that state and was able to hold my attention throughout.One of the most important things I took away from this book was ‘Give unto others what we would have others give unto us’. Now, I know everybody knows that! We, humans, are complex creatures; we have different personalities, temperaments, motivations but when everything is taken away, there are some core values that are similar in all of us. Our actions spring from what we desire, we crave appreciation, feeling of importance, and we want to be respected and listened to. This book tells you to peer into your mind and learn about yourself.It’s really important to get to know yourself first, to know what you like and what you don’t. In order to influence people, you need to put yourself in their shoes and approach the situation in that way. This takes tactfulness and patience. The author also makes use of wise quotes from philosophers and great people to explain his ideas, which I really liked. He also gives examples from the lives of successful people to elaborate his point and also, gives pointers on how to incorporate those pieces of advice in our daily lives. Every advice given in this book is valuable, no matter how commonplace it is. I believe this book should be a necessary read for students in school and college.All in all, it was very informative and useful book. There were so many great advises you could use in your daily life. I believe everyone should read this book at least once in their lives because it’s really worth your time. Read On Blog"
15,0671027034,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1171789-viraj,4,"Overall: A well written book with a lot of examples, including many of good folks from the history and many without any citation, but none-the-less seem real. The examples are written so that the message goes across well. Repetition is avoided. The stuff mentioned is pretty obvious and simple, but important and often ignored. Worth reading multiple times as the preface recommends. TEXT DELETED105	SIX WAYS TO MAKE PEOPLE LIKE YOUPRINCIPLE 1: Become genuinely interested in other people. PRINCIPLE 2: SmilePRINCIPLE 3: Remember that a person’s name is to that person the sweetest and most important sound in any language. PRINCIPLE 4: Be a good listener. Encourage others to talk about themselves. PRINCIPLE 5: Talk in terms of the other person’s interests. PRINCIPLE 6: Make the other person feel important–and do it sincerely. 110	You cannot win an argumentWhy not let him save his face? He didn’t ask for your opinion. He didn’t want it. Why argue with him? Always avoid the acute angle. Don’t forget this lesson! I have come to the conclusion that there is only one way under high heaven to get the best of an argument—and that is to avoid it. You can’t win an argument. You can’t because if you lose it, you lose it; and if you win it, you lose it. Why? Well, suppose you triumph over the other man and shoot his argument full of holes and prove that he is non compos mentis. Then what? You will feel fine. But what about him? You have made him feel inferior. You have hurt his pride. He will always resent your triumph and “a man convinced against his will is of the same opinion still…” 112	Which would you rather have, an academic theatrical victory or a person’s good will? You can seldom have both. Buddha said, “Hatred is never ended by hatred but by love,” and a misunderstanding is never ended by an argument but by tact, diplomacy, conciliation, and a sympathetic desire to see the other person’s viewpoint. Better give your path to a dog than be bitten by him in contesting for the right. Even killing the dog would not cute the bite. 114	How to keep a disagreement from becoming an argument:1.	Welcome the disagreement: Remember the slogan, “When two partners always agree, one of them is not necessary.” If there is some point you haven’t thought about, be thankful if it is brought to your attention. Perhaps this disagreement is your opportunity to be corrected before you make a serious mistake. 2.	Distrust your first instinctive impressions: Our first natural reaction in a disagreeable situation is to be defensive. Be careful. Keep calm and watch out for your first reaction. It may be you at your worst, not at your best. 3.	Control your temper: Remember, you can measure the size of a person by what makes him or her angry. 4.	Listen first; Give your opponents a chance to talk. Let them finish. Do not resist, defend, or debate. This only raises barriers. Try to build bridges of understanding. Don’t build higher barriers of misunderstanding. 5.	Look for areas of agreement: When you have heard your opponents out, dwell first on the points and areas on which you agree. 6.	Be honest: Look for areas where you can admit error and say so. Apologize for your mistakes. It will help disarm your opponents and reduce defensiveness. 7.	Promise to think over your opponents’ ideas and study them carefully: and mean it! Your opponents may be right. It is a lot easier at this stage to agree to think about their points than to move rapidly ahead and find yourself in a position where your opponents can say: “We tried to tell you, but you wouldn’t listen.” 8.	Thank your opponents sincerely for their interest: Anyone who takes the time to adisagree with you is interested in the same things you are. Think of them as people who really want to help you, and you may turn your opponents into friends. 9.	Postpone actions to give both sides time to think through the problem: Suggest that a new meeting be held later that day or the next day, when all the facts may be brought to bear to preparation for this meeting, ask yourself some hard questions. Could my opponents be right? Partly right? Is there truth or merit in their position or argument? Is my reaction one that will relieve the problem or will it just relieve any frustration? Will my reaction drive my opponents further away or draw them closer to me? Will my reaction elevate the estimation good people have of me? Will I win or lose? What price will I have to pay if I win? If I am quiet about it, what the disagreement blow over? Is this difficult situation an opportunity for me? PRINCIPLE 1: The only way to get the best of an argument is to avoid it. MORE LATER... "

Teachers, emotional teenagers, employers, employees, husbands, wives, brothers, sisters, friends, neighbors, politicians etc...I truly found this book oddly entertaining. Although it is a self-improvement type book, I couldn't put it down. Through the examples of many famous and successful people throughout history, this book teaches us how to work with others and be nice. I sincerely believed that my ability to effectively communicate and work with other people improved exponentially through reading this book and putting what I learned into action.I love this book and am going to require that my children read it before they get a job, a drivers' license, or a date.

It is easy to read and its tenants are easy to follow. The one criticism that many have justly laid on it is the feeling that you are manipulating people into being your friends or accomplices (thus the ""win"" in the title). As such, the techniques work with a subpopulation of people you run into over the span of your life nut certainly not all of them. And true friendships are about depth and mutual respect so no techniques are required. A more appropriate use of the book is how to behave and fit in in corporate America and for that, other than losing the tie and the hat, manners and ambitions have not changed so much for the book to become irrelevant. I prefer Getting Things Done personally."
18,0671027034,http://goodreads.com/user/show/958786-james,4,"Why did I read this book?We’ve all heard of it. But none of us have ever really read it.And I know why. It was originally published in 1936. How can it possibly be relevant in 2009? Plus these types of advice, self-help, new-agey textbooks reek of banal, trite, clichéd, stereotypical drivel. We’re too good for that. They seem a little cheesy at least. They’re all like The Secret, right?We don’t want to sip on watered down hotel iced tea and listen to Zig Ziglar. We want to take a toke of a high-grade sativa strain and listen to some Creedence tapes!Regardless of my skepticism and cynicism, I found How to Win Friends and Influence People to be extremely applicable and relevant.First of all, a note on the title: “How to Win Friends” is not accurate. It’s not at all about winning friends in the sense that we modern youths would consider a friend. Carnegie seems “how to win friends” to mean the “accumulation of calculated, beneficial relationships.”I feel very strongly that “friends” are the people we can be dicks to, the people we can get drunk with, yell at, act stupid, and not have to worry about the third of six ways to make people like you (remember their name). Everyone else? Everyone else you’re actually nice to (bosses, co-workers, certain family members, people you pass on the street) are not friends. Friends are the people you can tell to fuck off and they’ll still drive you to the airport at 6am the next day. This book is how to deal with everyone else with seemingly-obvious principles such as smile, be a good listener, talk in terms of other people’s interests, and make the other person feel important.So friends, not so much. But how to influence people, yes.Carnegie’s seminal work is packed full of anecdotal evidence illuminating the principle of each chapter and reinforced with a healthy peppering of Emerson quotes:“Every man I meet is my superior in some way. In that, I learn of him.”Though written in 1936, HTWFAIF is refreshingly relevant in a modern age marked by the dichotomy between incredible scientific accomplishments, brilliant discoveries, understanding, knowledge, curiosity, but yet a stunted ability to talk and peacefully coexist with those we disagree.Take, for instance, Carnegie’s encouragement to dramatize your intentions in order for them to be recognized and accepted:“This is the day of dramatization. Merely stating a truth isn’t enough. The truth has to be made vivid, interesting, dramatic. You have to use showmanship. The movies do it. Television does it. And you will have to do it if you want attention.”And on the eighth day, God created cable news.Carnegie thwarts our skepticism about the nobility of his intentions and promises that he is no self-help scammer, a Kevin Trudeau, Carnegie promises, he is not:“The principles taught in this book will work only when they come from the heart. I am not advocating a bag of tricks. I am talking about a new way of life.”And for the most part, I have to agree with Carnegie. I like this book. Its advice and suggestions are totally useful and effective. We tend to consider ourselves living in grim times, what with the wars, crumbling economy, job losses, and uncertain future, why not have a little possitivity and engaged enthusiasm for our fellow man?And Carnegie even foretold a danger in our current time. He warns us of Obama:“The ability to speak is a shortcut to distinction. It puts a person in the limelight, raises one head and shoulders above the crowd. And the person who can speak acceptably is usually given credit for an ability out of all proportion to what he or she really possesses.”Uh oh."

He's a huge fan, so for whatever reason I decided to give it a shot. This is by no means a bad book, but since we're on the topic, I'll mention the cons first. I skimmed through the latter half of this book today. The first half took me over a month. This isn't boring per se, I just happen to have the attention span of your average Millennial. I have the worst patience (as in non-existent) to boot. If I'm not constantly entertained by something and it takes longer than ten seconds, I get irritable. This book was full of real life examples. Whenever you thought it would finish, another would come.A lot of the principles are obvious, but let's be honest. Am I going to apply any of them to my life? Nope.The thing is, I don't want to win friends and influence people. I want to avoid people and take long solitary walks. I don't want to influence anyone because I am a bad influence. My tactic for gaining friends is very simple.
Stage 1: Hiss and moan when anyone shows interest in you, but silently be flattered. Never show interest in anyone. That's antisocial suicide.Stage 2: Go into asshole mode - make snide remarks, but be nice enough so the person will let you keep making snide remarks.Stage 3: Have no tact or diplomacy because that means you're lying and possibly weak.Stage 4: Finally decide you may like them and go into nice-but-hyper-and-distracted mode. NB, this does not occur during shark week.Stage 5: Fluctuate constantly and be a burden forever. Cut ties with anyone who slightly irritates you because you believe in minimalism in all things.This method works wonders and leaves me nearly friendless. How I influence people is slightly more corrupt so I won't go into that. In the end there's not many wonderful things I can say about this book. Still, I don't feel like it's bad. It's just not for me personally."

It comes off to some people as a book on how to manipulate people, but that is really far from it. In my experience there's really no way to put the practices this book preaches into effect with your life and not become someone who actually treats people better as a result. Funny how treating people better leads to leadership, friends, and influencing them. It's not an accident.I've read the book at least 3 times, with another time soon approaching as it's been awhile. I would recommend it to anyone interested in being more friendly. And in reality, I think pretty much everyone should read it.I didn't give it an ""amazing"", 5 star rating, due to the fact that it wasn't the type of book that was hard to put down, but that said it's still a great book. Read it. Seriously."
22,0671027034,http://goodreads.com/user/show/350218-booklady,5,"Re-read (or rather re-listened to) this, as I promised myself I was going to do when I got it last year. I really think the title is misleading. It should be something like, How to Have Healthier, Happier and More Positive Relationships with People. This time I actually got to put some of the principles of this book into practice when tutoring an unwilling 7th grader. Receiving D's and F's and reading at 3rd grade level, ""M"" is not unintelligent. She is just one (of the many) child(ren) pushed through the system ready or not.Anyway, when M failed to respond to my charming personality, I realized that I needed to find what interested and motivated her. Ever since, we have been gradually building a relationship based on who she is, what she wants, and how I can help her. Admittedly I started at a very low level (candy for good performance!) but it got her attention and we are slowly making progress, little by little each week. Anyway, she at least talks to me now and doesn't hide behind her long hair anymore. This last week I challenged her to show me her first test or quiz, in any class, above 80% and promised an unspecified reward.Thank you Mr. Carnegie!<><><><><><>Recently a good friend and colleague told me how much this book helped her and I remembered how much I enjoyed it when I first read it (years ago). As I could hardly remember any specifics from that distant time—only the overall favorable impression—I learned a great deal from this reread. The author and my friend both recommend returning to the principles of this book at least once @ year. Based on my own desire to have happy and positive human relations I agree this is a worthwhile book. I hope to make reading/listening to it something I do every January. We all need to get along and this book is chock full of helpful ideas for improving all of our relations with others. It isn't about using other people to get what we want, except insofar as we learn how to achieve happy, loving relationship(s), mutual respect and peaceful homes/workplaces.Highly recommended! "
23,0671027034,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4460829-11811-eleven,2,"This was about two things that don't interest me. At the time, I picked it up for the business perspective but I don't think I ever finished it.*****2/5/2017That sounds so anti-social I want to briefly annotate. I favor an alternative philosophy of being genuine. You will likely yield fewer friends of higher quality and perhaps be less successful but I think it will ultimately result in a higher quality of life.Other than that, this book does have practical advice on business etiquette."
24,0671027034,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5109654-marks54,2,"This book presents one of the classic statements of popular psychology oriented around positive self-image, self reliance, and cooperative relationships with others. It is one of the most popular and influential books of its type ever and provided the foundations for contemporary self-help celebrities, such as Oprah Winfrey, as well as much of current motivational and organizational psychology that one finds in current business school curricula.What to make of it? I tend to side with the critics, who are numerous. It is difficult to argue with the basic points of the book, taken at a surface level. Most people enjoy being respected, agreed with, and successful. Confidence and self-reliance are no doubt important personal characteristics in personal success. Many people do not enjoy conflict or being disagreed with and would prefer instead cooperative relations with others. OK, but so what?The problem comes once it is realized that Carnegie is highlighting an ambivalence that is inherent in many of our social relationships. On the one hand, we can interact with people on their own terms and without expectations of obligations, duties, or norms of reciprocity. We can deal with and respect people as they are. On the other hand, however, much of what we do in social life involves either trying to accomplish something through other people or having other people trying to use us to accomplish something of importance to them. In trying to balance these two aspects of social relations, most of us become aware of the need to balance. We do not usually treat commercial relationships as close friends. We do not draw up elaborate performance-based contracts with loved ones such as family members. The problem is that people who expect to be treated as independent persons do not appreciate being used by others for some personal end. It is conceptually difficult to see how someone can be both taken authentically and respected as a person while at the same time being viewed as an agent for someone else. Family members and loved ones do not like to be used. Commercial partners do not appreciate being treated as friends when more immediate personal goals were the basis for interactions.Many adults learn to balance these differing perspectives towards others. Sometimes we treat others at arms length while at other times friendships can develop. Carnegie's classic work calls on the reader to both treat people on their own terms and also to attempt to influence them to get their cooperation in attaining one's objectives. Without more specification of how and where to balance, however, the book becomes a more cynical effort to redefine the problem of positive social relations in the form of a solution -- in order to influence people and get your way, treat them authentically. The rub, of course, is how to go about doing this. It is akin to arguing that the solution to poverty is easy -- just get some money!The faux sincerity and false positivity in the service of influencing others come across as phony and manipulative after a while. This recalls another old maxim - if something seems to good to be true, it probably is too good to be true. The oversimplified examples and testimonials also get old in a hurry. The reduction of large business enterprises and their managers to a series of positive work interactions with employees is simplistic at well. The details matter, individual skills matter, industry structures matter, history matters. It is nice to imagine that a positive attitude can conquer all and bring one riches. That lets a lot of other factors off the hook for explaining success or failure. But wishing it is so does not make it so. The more I read it, the more it sounds like a text on manipulation and less like an industrial manual."
25,0671027034,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7584700-keertana,3,"Every week for the past seven years my father has diligently asked me--without fail--whether or not I had finally read this book. How to Win Friends & Influence People changed my father's life when he first read it, back during the 1970s, and as such he's wanted me to read it as well. I have three copies of this book in my house--the first an aqua paperback my father originally bought for me, the second the very same paperback my father re-bought for me when in a fit of rebellion I told him I'd lost the first copy, and the third my father's own disheveled edition he brought back from India. If your parents have ever shoved anything down your throat, you can probably understand why it took me seven years to finally pick up this volume. Even now, I've only read it under the threat that my father wouldn't pay my college tuition bills for the fall semester unless I would read and discuss it with him before the payment deadline. Lo and behold, Dale Carnegie's non-fiction piece finally made it into my hands. Admittedly, this isn't a bad book. It shares useful pieces of advice with plenty of support to back up its claims. Only, in my eyes, I don't believe that each and every individual can truly put Carnegie's advice into effect. Certain tid-bits, such as listening to others or offering genuine praise, can definitely be employed by all but others, such as manipulating a situation so that the other person believes your idea is really his or her own, are much harder. We've all met charismatic and charming people who can take advantage of any situation seamlessly. It isn't a learned skill, but rather an innate one. Thus, having read How to Win Friends & Influence People I truly cannot influence people unless I find myself in the same exact situations outlined by Carnegie. Thrown into another one, I fear I'd sink and find myself influenced instead. Winning friends isn't overly difficult, in my opinion. Much of what Carnegie writes are valuable stepping stones I've picked up over the course of my two years blogging online. I offer genuine praise when I enjoy a blog post, I take the time to read--or ""listen""--to what others have to say, I use their name when commenting because it builds that personal connection. Consequently, I don't find this book to be particularly helpful. When it comes to winning friends, I think we all undergo certain trajectories in life where we make genuine friends and others where we don't, but we learn from those experiences to know the advice Carnegie puts into chapters. (I also dislike the phrase ""winning"" friends...) So, the first part of this book was useless, the second part--""influence people""--isn't as helpful as it should be and the last part, leadership attributes, are yet again qualities I don't think can be completely taught. Carnegie speaks of traits a good leader possesses, but oftentimes the difficulty doesn't lie in being a good leader but rather in becoming a leader in the first place. Perhaps I am overly critical of this book considering my past experiences with it, but I will not deny that, in the right hands, this book is certainly moving. In today's day and age, with the internet altering our perception of face-to-face interactions, this volume may be even more significant to individuals who cannot cease texting and are hooked onto technology. For others, though, this book is merely repetitive (seriously, so many of the same pieces of advice are repeated in different phrases throughout the novel) and rather dull. "
26,0671027034,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5081086-kendel-christensen,5,"Save the gospel itself, and my mission president, this book has been the single most influential thing in my life. Insightful? Yes. Timeless, Absolutely. But for someone who had no social skills to speak of until his mission? Transformative.Here are just a FEW of the nuggets in this amazing book:“Every man I meet is my superior in some way. In that, I learn of him.”(Emerson, As quoted by Dale Carnegie, How to Win Friends and Influence People, p. 31)“You will never get into trouble by admitting that you may be wrong. That will . . . inspire your opponent to be just as fair and open . . . as you are. It will make him want to admit that he, too, may be wrong.”(Dale Carnegie, How to Win Friends and Influence People, p. 125)“Any fool can criticize, condemn, and complain—and most fools do. But it takes character and self-control to be understanding and forgiving.“‘A great man shows his greatness,’ said Carlyle, ‘by the way he treats little men.’”“Criticisms are like homing pigeons. They always return home. Let’s realize that the person we are going to correct and condemn will probably justify himself or herself, and condemn us in return”“There is a certain degree of satisfaction in having the courage to admit one's errors. It not only clears the air of guilt and defensiveness, but often helps solve the problem created by the error.”(Dale Carnegie, How to Win Friends and Influence People, p. 138)But my #1, favorite principle from this book is DEFINITELY: ‘If there is any one secret of success, it lies in the ability to get the other person’s point of view and see things from that person’s angle as well as from your own.’ “That is so simple, so obvious . . . yet 90 percent of the people on this earth ignore it 90 percent of the time.”(Henry Ford, then Dale Carnegie, How to Win Friends and Influence People, p. 37)"
27,0671027034,http://goodreads.com/user/show/80152812-maciej-nowicki,5,"How to Win Friends and Influence People by Dale Carnegie is about communication skills and leadership. It’s an interesting guide about the interpersonal relationship, written in simple words and built on a few pillars. By implementing them you might succeed in your daily life and career. So, if you want to influence people and be a leader this book is essential. At this point it’s worth to say that it is not about manipulation, it is rather about improving your emotional intelligence. Next, if you are the more experienced person you might treat the book as a kind of review of your communication skills, however, if you perceive yourself as a poor communicator and a weak influencer this book might turn your world upside down.Anyway, the interesting fact is that the book was originally written in 1936 and who knew that something applicable so long ago would be so useful in today’s age. The book is divided into 4 parts which are:1. Fundamental techniques in handling people2. 6 ways to make people like you3. How to win people to your way of thinking4. How to change people without giving offensive or arousing resentmentNevertheless, I think that there are 9 takeaways worth mentioning in this review and these are:1. Talk in terms of the other person’s interests, so the key to this concept is putting yourself in another person’s perspective. It’s about seeing through their eyes, seeing what they want and learning how to align what they want. For instance, if you’d like to convince somebody to something, tell him why it would be great for him not for you. By doing that you have a higher chance to get their attention and acceptance.2. Give honest and sincere appreciation which is something opposite to using flattery. Don’t ask somebody a favour just after making compliments, don’t expect anything in return. Being nice and kind is really great.3. Call attention to people’s mistakes indirectly. The major point here is exchanging “but” for “and”. So, for example, if your child has just brought a high mark in math by, simultaneously got a lower mark in English don’t tell him that he made a great job, but should catch up with English. Separate these to points clearly by talking about something else.4. If you are wrong admit it emphatically and without hesitation. If you did it right you would be surprised how the other person, all of a sudden, becomes on your side. He would even make some excuses for you. Avoid arguments.5. Talk about your own mistakes before criticising the other person. If you know that the idea of somebody else is wrong, tell it honestly and support your statement with your own experience. Do not just tell that something is wrong.6. Let the other person save his face, which means that if someone made a mistake or they’re wrong never do it in front of a group of people. The other rule is to make your statement responsively and allow the other person to conclude on his own. Never attack.7. Get the other person saying “Yes, Yes” immediately. Basically speaking it about receiving a few yeses before asking your big-deal question. For instance, if you’d like somebody to accept your project ask him a few questions that should be answered “yes”. Next, when you get a general alignment with your speaker ask you a major question.8. Let the other person feel that the idea is his own. As people don’t like to feel that they’re being sold something or to admit they’re wrong...(if you like to read my full review please visit my blog https://leadersarereaders.blog/how-to...)"
28,0671027034,http://goodreads.com/user/show/823100-jared,3,"At the end of the Great Depression, Dale Carnegie wrote one of the benchmark self-help books of American literary history. He encapsulated the formula to “pull yourself up by your bootstraps” in the midst of a market downturn, to put it mildly. His title, How to Win Friends and Influence People, was probably used to win and influence book sales rather than cleverly and accurately describe the content of his book. Simply, it is a misnomer. With chapters on considerate social intercourse and sincerely understanding the opponent’s point of view, he is a herald of the golden rule. But Carnegie gives you a 10 step program to follow (the Ten Commandments must have been too vague).I guess the whole idea is that when you are agreeable, intellectual, considerate, proper, quick, thoughtful and strong, people will go out of their way to be nice to you and do you favors. That social axiom is my particular beef with self-help books in general. But of all self-help authors, Carnegie outlines it fairly and motivationally. He must have been a courageously dynamic speaker—he sold his seminars for a thousand a pop, back then! But with uninterrupted sales since the late 30s and over 15 million copies sold worldwide, Carnegie’s book is well worth the read…or the skim."
29,0671027034,http://goodreads.com/user/show/70951605-tucker-tuckerthereader,3,Lol this title doesn’t beat around the bush. Just straight up “this is what I’m going to teach you”| Goodreads | Blog | Pinterest | LinkedIn | YouTube | Instagram
30,0671027034,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9777942-joe,3,"Popular self-help books have the most misleading titles. Men are From Mars Women are from Venus, for example, promises a provocative thesis but proves a bland and repetitive read. By contrast, The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People enlightens the mind and tugs at the heart despite its dry label.And so it is with How to Win Friends and Influence People. The title suggests cloak-and-dagger tactics. 'Winning friends' implies competition; that if you don't win them someone else will! And 'influencing people' implies trickery; how to get them to do what's best for you, instead of what's best for themselves.Yet the content of the book proves warm and friendly. Tips include admitting fault when you've erred, showing sincere interest in other people and putting effort into learning their names. These ideas are supported by a series of heartwarming anecdotes from historical figures and ordinary people from Carnegie's day. The overall theme is that if you do right by others they'll do right by you.Toward the end, there's a suggestion or two that feel like psychological tricks. For example, there's a chapter on that old sales tactic of asking a lot of yes/no questions (Are you feeling well today? Have you used a product like ours before?) to get someone saying 'yes' so they'll be primed to say 'yes' once you start your sales-pitch. But these were exceptions to the rule and felt mild compared with what I was expecting.I have to wonder why the book wasn't named 'How to make friends and get along with people?' I guess the sneakier title helps attract competitive business types; roping them in with the promise of shady tactics before giving them flowers and sunshine. The title implies underhanded schemes but may be the most underhanded element of the book.Edited 5-21-2017"

I am friendlier and more influential now.I owe it all to Dale Carnegie, the failed actor from Missouri who discovered he had a knack for jazzing up people’s confidence. His foundational work, “How to Win Friends & Influence People,” blasted off in 1936, but for anyone who wants a pill-sized dose of encouragement, a “mini abridged edition” is being released this week to celebrate the book’s 80th year.You could call “How to Win Friends & Influence People” the grandfather of America’s self-help movement, except this grandfather is running circles around the rest of the industry, selling 300,000 copies last year.

I really appreciate the focus on kindness and positively, especially in avoiding letting appreciation become empty flattery. But like... at one point Carnegie randomly tells a “plain” acquaintance that she’s capable of greatness... and then sort of takes responsibility for changing her life? Because suddenly she was confident and into skin care and got married. I think men sometimes inflate how important a single compliment is to a woman.There is a lot of good information on how to use positive reinforcement and “make people want what you want” and a lot of great reminders for dealing with people tho!"
34,0671027034,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5875398-rebecca,3,"For a book to have been in print continuously for nearly 80 years, it must be doing something right. Many of the principles are still applicable, but Carnegie’s case studies struck me as hopelessly outdated as well as exclusively American (the Teapot Dome scandal?!). In teaching public speaking to thousands of businessmen, he developed pointed advice for how to get people to like you and do what you want. Examples: show genuine interest in others and draw out their stories, express sincere appreciation, and try to see things from the other person’s point of view. Although he insists this is not about trickery or flattery, I still sensed a hint of manipulation. A lot of what he says just seems like common sense, but he spells it out and puts it all together in a helpful, reader-friendly format. He also draws on anecdote and experience, much like contemporary self-help authors like Gretchen Rubin and Brené Brown."

Although I generally agree with his principles, I think Carnegie makes following them sound too easy.Carnegie states that 15% of success is due to technical knowledge, and the other 85% is due to personality and leadership. He says that the #1 secret to success in dealing with people is having a sympathetic grasp of the other person’s point of view. He talks a lot about respecting and understanding other people, and quotes Ralph Waldo Emerson: ""Every man I meet is my superior in some way. In that, I learn of him.""Carnegie also talks a lot about praise; he says that praise is more effective than criticism for changing behavior and winning people over, so you should be “hearty in your approbation and lavish in your praise.”The book includes lessons from people like Jesus, Confucius, Buddha, Abraham Lincoln, Andrew Carnegie, Ben Franklin, John Rockefeller, Charles Schwab, and J.P. Morgan. Carnegie provides anecdotes of his own experiences, and those of the people who took his courses.I first read this book when co-workers suggested I improve my social skills, because I received many recommendations for this book. I re-read it because the lessons are so important and worthwhile.Below are the book's principles, along with my notes.Fundamental Techniques in Handling People1. Don't criticize, condemn, or complain.• Criticism is futile.2. Give honest and sincere appreciation.• Avoid flattery.3. Arouse in the other person an eager want.• Salespeople need to show how their products and services solve customers’ problems• Each party should gain; there must be mutual benefit.Six Ways to Make People Like You1. Become genuinely interested in other people.• “You can make more friends in two months by becoming more interested in other people than you can in two years by trying to get people interested in you”• Greet people with animation and enthusiasm. When someone calls on the phone, sound like you’re pleased.2. Smile.• A facial expression is more important than clothes.• Encouragement is more effective than punishment.• Don’t feel like smiling? Force yourself; feeling follows action.3. Remember that a man's Name is to him the sweetest and most important sound in any language.• To remember names, tie the name to a person’s features, use the person’s name in conversation, and write and memorize the name.4. Be a good listener. Encourage others to talk about themselves.• To be a good conversationalist, listen and pay attention.• To be interesting, be interested.5. Talk in the terms of the other man's interest.6. Make the other person feel important and do it sincerely.• The law of human conduct: always make the other person feel important.• Follow the Golden Rule: ""Do unto others as you would have them do unto you"".Twelve Ways to Win People to Your Way of Thinking1. Avoid arguments.• You can’t win an argument. Even if you win, you make your opponent feel inferior, so you lose.2. Show respect for the other person's opinions. Never tell someone they are wrong.3. If you're wrong, admit it quickly and emphatically.4. Begin in a friendly way.• ""'A drop of honey catches more flies than a gallon of gall.' So with men. If you would win a man to your cause, first convince him that you are his sincere friend."" – Lincoln5. Start with questions the other person will answer yes to.• The more yeses you can get at the outset, the more likely the person is to accept your ultimate proposal.6. Let the other person do the talking.• “If you want enemies, excel your friends; but if you want friends, let your friends excel you”.7. Let the other person feel the idea is his/hers.8. Try honestly to see things from the other person's point of view.9. Sympathize with the other person.10. Appeal to noble motives.• Treat people as if they are honest and fair.11. Dramatize your ideas.12. Throw down a challenge.• Use showmanship when selling or convincing.Be a Leader: How to Change People Without Giving Offense or Arousing Resentment1. Begin with praise and honest appreciation.• Use ""and"", not ""but"" as your conjunction between praise and criticism. Give praise, then say “and”, then give criticism/correction. Don’t give praise, say “but”, then criticize; it cheapens the praise.2. Call attention to other people's mistakes indirectly.3. Talk about your own mistakes first.4. Ask questions instead of directly giving orders.• People are more likely to accept an order if they had a part in the decision.5. Let the other person save face.6. Praise every improvement.• Give specific, sincere praise.• Praise is more effective at changing behavior than criticism.7. Give them a fine reputation to live up to.• Praise people, and they’ll feel obligated to live up to their good reputation.8. Encourage them by making their faults seem easy to correct.9. Make the other person happy about doing what you suggest.• Convince people by telling them specifically how they’ll personally benefit."

My wife and I run a small business and sometimes clients can be a real pain in the behind, I used to sometimes sass back but after reading this life guide I’ve begun to sing a different tune, and the results speak for themselves, they are very positive. This book can be used as a life guide, whenever we run into issues dive into Carnegie’s book and you may just find what you’re looking for. I will definitely be recommending this and re reading in the future. Below are some of my favorite quotes. ""It is an old and true maxim that 'a drop of honey catches more flies than a gallon of gall.' So with men, if you would win a man to your cause, first convince him that you are his sincere friend.”-Abe Lincoln “All men have fears, but the brave put down their fears and go forward, sometimes to death, but always to victory” was the motto of the King’s Guard in Ancient Greece.  “You must develop a deep, driving desire to learn, a vigorous determination to increase your ability to deal with people” “Any fool can criticize, condemn, and complain — and most fools do.”“The deepest urge in human nature is the desire to be important … always make the other person feel important.” “Listening is one of the highest compliments we can pay anyone.”“There is only one way under the high heaven to get the best of an argument — and that is to avoid it. Avoid arguments as you would rattlesnakes and earthquakes.”“We are interested in others when they are interested in us.”“In our interpersonal relationships, we should never forget that all our associates are human begins and hunger for appreciation.”"

There are some interesting examples and valuable thoughts, though I struggled to enjoy this read for a number of factors;- The writing itself wasn't particularly interesting or eloquent- The repetition was tiresome - whilst it was purposefully repeated, it made me feel bored and patronised- Not only were actual sentences repeated - the ideas and concepts in the book were all similar conveyed in a slightly different variant- Examples seem to form the main bulk of the content which made the book feel like a collection of anecdotesOn top of all of the above, I feel like anyone taking the advice in this book too seriously would end up being walked over; pleasing people, letting others take the credit, always being the bigger person, never complaining or criticising. As such, I feel like these ideas need to be taken with a large pinch of salt and maybe in this way one or two may become useful in small doses!"

As I was looking through my bookshelfs this afternoon, I found a very old copy of this classic. It must have come from my father's library as it is marked as a 77th printing - probably printed in the early 50's. I LOVE old books...The best tidbit to share from this book, is if you want people to like you, emulate a dog. Carnegie says: ""When you get within ten feet of him, he will begin to wag his tail. If you stop and pat him, he will almost jump out of his skin to show you how much he likes you. And you know that behind this show of affection on his part, there are no ulterior motives: he doesn't want to sell you any real estate, and he doesn't want to marry you."""

Basically, it argues that if you earnestly invest in other people, care about them in ways that few people do, you will have success throughout your life. As many others have already commented, the name of the book leads you to believe that it will be a load of sleaze. And indeed, the book's title did put me off it for quite a while. After all, this is a book about how to influence people. For the most part, I haven't found the part of the book where the sleaze comes out. One thing I am wondering about however is how the book will address dealing with horrible people: with the tyrants, emotion terrorists, or just plain whiners. More importantly--the first rule: not criticizing anyone. That seems like it would take quite a toll after a while. "

47,0671027034,http://goodreads.com/user/show/17442587-hannah,0,"Well, I thought a lot of things while reading this. I admit I wasn't too gung-ho about the book in the first place, and read it because it was assigned reading at work. I've heard about Carnegie plenty of times in the past and was pretty sure he wasn't the sort of author whose philosophies I'd give five stars to.However, I did try to read it objectively. Yes, he is a proponent of the ""social gospel"" of his time, but it also wasn't as bad as I thought it might be (I didn't end by throwing the book across the room. So far, Descartes remains alone in the dubious distinction of being lobbed at the further wall). I'll write my review in sections according to the structure of the book.Part one: Fundamental Techniques in Handling People1. Don't criticize, condemn, or complain.Point given: no one wants to be around a whiner. Sure, I agree with that.Application made: Lawbreakers, such as Al Capone and Two Gun Crowley, believed themselves to be good people at heart, even helpers of the community: ""people don't criticize themselves for anything, no matter how wrong it may be....Criticism is futile because it puts a person on the defensive and usually makes him strive to justify himself. Criticism is dangerous because it wounds a person's precious pride, hurts his sense of importance, and arouses resentment.""All right, wait a moment here. If my friends never voice any criticism, how would I know I'm wandering around with mud on my cheek? with a stain on my blouse? How am I to know that something is wrong? The last thing I wish to do is wander through life with the rest of the world afraid to let me know what I'm doing wrong. Constructive criticism is a good thing. As a music teacher, it is imperative that sometimes I get to say, ""No. Don't do it that way."" Why? Because certain positions can be harmful to the student's muscles and a hindrance to their progress. I compliment them on progress made and tell them how to make it better. It requires much less time and intellectual fishing than trying to influence them to deduct that the position may not be to their greatest advantage.2. Give honest and sincere appreciation.Point given: Everyone is glad to know they are valuable.Application: If you want people to do something for you, your best bet is to make them want to do it. Using an application of Sigmund Freud's and Dewey's theories that every man has ""the desire to be great"" or ""the desire to be important,"" Carnegie mentions the successes who have made themselves great--Lincoln and Dickens--and moves on to criminals. ""The average young criminal...is filled with ego...If you tell me how you get your feeling of importance, I'll tell you what you are. That determines your character,"" he finishes. Mr. Carnegie, I beg to differ. What puffs your chest out is not the sum total of who you are. That is only one symptom of the man as a whole. Are you trustworthy? Are you a friend to others? If you are either of those, or of any other things, and yet lack a real feeling of importance, it does not make you a nobody, as Carnegie more than implies. Finding your self-worth is not the only goal in life for a successful person.He continues the chapter by giving examples of people who have gone insane because of having unfulfilled dreams in life...well, nobody can quite say it for sure, of course, but this is his argument: ""...the other half of people who go insane apparently have nothing wrong with their brain cells...Why do these people go insane? [the doctor he spoke with said] Nobody knows for sure. But he did say that many people who go insane find in insanity a feeling of importance that they were unable to achieve in the world of reality."" His implication is clear that some people prefer to lose touch with reality than to lose touch with their dreams and their exalted view of themselves.What about flattery? We do get warned against flattery. ""Flattery is counterfeit, and like counterfeit money, it will eventually get you into trouble if you pass it to someone else...Flattery is telling the other person precisely what he thinks about himself."" But to give a person compliments in the hope of gaining one's own ends reeks of insincerity. The examples given show that a sloppy person will suddenly do a great job when given praise instead of critique. I'm sorry, but I've tried this. Contrary to Carnegie's opinion, people are not all going to do what you want if you convince them they are good people and they do a good job. All too many react with pleasure at the status quo and see absolutely no need to do better. So I will add that, yes, it's wonderful to appreciate others. But it is wrong and often cruel to them to make them think they are perfect when they are doing a sloppy job that may cause danger to others (such as breaking health laws or leaving messes in walkways.) Carnegie denies the implication that making someone want what you want by telling them how good they are is manipulation, but in most of the examples it slides dangerously close to that line.3. Arouse in the other person an eager want.Point given: People's acts are entirely driven by their wants.Application: To impose what we want, we have to convince others that they want what we want more than they want what they want...that, in fact, what we want is even better than what they wanted in the first place. While I'm all for positive inspiration, this message has a sordid underbelly.Carnegie believes that all actions have one root: desire. The only way to change a person's actions is to change their desires. He does not believe that people will gladly follow rules unless there is something in it for them. In the previous chapter, he posited that those appreciated will do a great job merely because someone's compliment makes them wish to do well. Yes, I do agree that continual criticism will sap a person's motivations, but praise all the time is not necessarily a motivator. According to Carnegie's philosophy, there are no people who are lazy for the joy of being lazy. Or, if there are such people, all they need is someone to come along and affirm them and present to them a good reason to get up and do a good job.One of the examples given is of a child who refused to eat his vegetables despite being scolded by his parents. He had an issue with a neighborhood bully, and the father decided to use the bully as the force behind his argument. ""When his father explained that the boy would be able to wallop the daylights out of the bigger kid someday if he would only eat the things his mother wanted him to eat--when his father promised him that--there was no longer any problem of dietetics."" I'm sorry, but no parent can ever make a promise like that, because there is no guarantee of its being fulfilled. The boy may have grown to 5'6"" and the bully to 6'5"" and no vegetables in the world could reverse the sizes. Then where would the father's promise be? He has broken a promise to his child that he had no right to make in the first place. The father's persuasion becomes a lie. The two pages of the child's story show that they gained mastery over the child by ""making him feel important."" Another child eats her cereal because by preparing it she ""achieved a feeling of importance; she had found in making the cereal an avenue of self-expression.""The danger of Carnegie's philosophy in this point is that one's self-esteem becomes the generator of their actions. If their self-esteem fails, apparently they do a horrible job and are uninterested in good ideas. Well, that doesn't bear out in real life. Some people who have damaged self-worth are hard workers, and some with excellent self-worth are sloppy and lazy. But Carnegie's chapter ends with a quote: ""William Winter once remarked that 'self-expression is the dominant necessity of human nature.'"" Well, if we are so busy fueling the self-expression of all those around us, where are we? We see a goal and coax others to want that goal, but ourselves are left behind in the dust of their ascent.Part Two. Six Ways to Make People Like You(well, I feel quarrelsome just reading that. If everyone likes you there's something wrong with your self-expression, because in being all things to all people there is no room left to be yourself.)1. Become genuinely interested in other people.All well and good, except he makes the cynical point ""People are not interested in you. They are not interested in me. They are interested in themselves--morning, noon, and after dinner."" So we are to figure out some way to become genuinely interested in others, to be silent when they talk, to encourage them always to express themselves around us.2. SmilePlease do!3. Remember that a person's name is to that person the sweetest and most important sound in any language.Helpful, but not the ""sweetest sound"" he claims. It's nice to remember names, but that honestly doesn't influence me much. I wonder if other people are more influenced by this, and I'm just some sort of anomaly? When I'm at work and someone comes through my checkout line, if it's a stranger I don't know, I'm not at all tempted to give them a bigger drink than they paid for because they say my name. Really, that's creepy...being nice to me doesn't entitle them to more of the company's food than they paid for, anyway. It isn't my food to give away.4. Be a good listener. Encourage others to talk about themselves.This one's easy...Other people's lives are just interesting. A side effect of being a hopeful novelist.5. Talk in terms of other people's interests.This creeps back towards flattery and worse. ""You want me to be your friend because I can do thus and so for you."" Isn't that just asking others to exploit your talents? I don't want friends who want me only on the basis of what I can do for them. When seeking a job, yes. But not when seeking friends.6. Make the other person feel important--and do it sincerely.This reminded me of an Andy Griffith show I saw recently on Netflix. Aunt Bee makes horrible pickles, but Andy and Barney are determined to not make her feel bad. After going to great and hilarious lengths of deception, they are left doomed to eat a double batch of bad pickles. They were sincere in their desire to please Aunt Bee because they could recognize she'd worked hard on those pickles. But it didn't rebound in their favor. They were insincere and deceptive in their effort to reward her for her work.Making others feel important isn't going to automatically result in a handout of exactly what you wanted. This action, done in order to gain a goal (as shown in the examples), is risky indeed, and oftentimes even deceptive.....out of time....more tomorrow and later on my blog...including ""Carnegie's book in light of Scripture."""
48,0671027034,http://goodreads.com/user/show/16996132-abeer-abdullah,2,"Working with a wide variety of people in my particular function in my company has left me seeking guidance on how to approach people, how to influence them, guide them and understand them. This is a great challenge for me for many reasons, for one thing I am over a decade younger than most people I am trying to influence, I am a 24 years old Arab girl who studied poetry who is trying to give council to and work with 40 year old Arab male engineers. Who, rightfully, may see it as ridiculous and be dismissive. It feels like a genuinely impossible task. Consequently, I am now trying to read as much about effective communication as possible, but it seems that a lot of the so called classics and best sellers are just incredibly shallow, and without true substance. This book tries to put forward the idea that empathy is at the core of winning friends and influencing people. As true as that is, it is not something revolutionary for us now in the early 21st century. Harvard Business Review's collection of books on various topics such as Emotional Intelligence and Communication for me have proved much more effective. They give detailed analysis, up to date studies, and real life examples. "
49,0671027034,http://goodreads.com/user/show/54266751-jennifer,4,"I really enjoyed this book. The advice is timeless and is as relevant today as it was eaight year's ago. I stumbled across How to Win Friends & Influence People while looking for something on change management. I wanted a book that explored the human component and not the process piece of change management.Dale Carnegie illustrates each lesson, or principle, by using both professional and personal examples. I love Carnegie’s writing style and use of words, which had a calming effect and transported me back in time. An informative and enjoyable read."
50,0671027034,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5789353-giselle,4,"Great advice, which is pretty much a given for any business person. There’s a lot of name dropping in almost every chapter.

52,0671027034,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10471943-igor-ljubuncic,2,"So ... I am opposed to self-help books. I don't believe in self-help books. I think they are paradoxical in that people who read them expect a miraculous solution to an internal problem and those who don't read them probably don't need them in the first place. Moreover, most of these fall into a very typical template - written for the US audience and revolving around some well-proven formulas with a significant monetary incentive.The only reason I decided to try to read this book was because a valued colleague recommended it, as it has had a profound impact on his life. Disassociating his experience from the novel I set about reading, and soon I realized, it is impossible to not judge this book through the eyes of my colleague and the sum of his life's doings. Which is why the message that worked so successfully for him does not work for me at all. Because the way we have lived our lives and approach our problems are completely different, and so is the depth, scope, magnitude, and variety of our problems.I munched through three chapters before giving up. The material is repetitive, with one example after another rehashing the one-liner message summarized at the end of each chapter. Almost like whoever is reading needs convincing that what is being told is the way to do it. And perhaps it is, but a bullet-list would work equally well, if the reader is willing to embrace the message. So maybe the book is all about convincing people into trying to change their lifestyle rather than actually learning some helpful tips, if that's actually possible, on how to manage life situations.I like the concept, the ideas are noble - and valid - but the delivery mechanism completely fails me. I realize that I'm 100% not the intended audience, and that the message is designed to instill introspection, regret, remorse, enlightenment, and illumination, which I failed to grasp. Not because I'm cold-hearted, obstinate, stubborn, or opposed to change, simply because I do not need convincing 100x over that I should do XYZ. Be considerate to people and compliment them. Yes. Agreed. No need to repeat that on 10 pages of text with 27 examples. One is enough.What is missing for me is context. There isn't enough of it - so you know that people did something and that it worked for them, but not the WHY. And that's more important than actions, because anyone can be lucky, or look back and justify their successes by creating a template that fits the bill. Because let's face it, people don't write books on how to be successful BEFORE they become successful. Hindsight is camp.All in all, there's nothing wrong with the book. But it can be 99% shorter, the message can be summed up on one page, and most importantly, the book is there to reaffirm people's needs in doing things that they have already set about doing, or they are facing an existential crisis and grasping for straws of hope. In other words, if you're not one of the two, or you don't believe books can help you change, which, let's face it, they can't, unless you're already set on making that happen, and the fact you consider buying this book is the VERY step needed to change, then you will not enjoy it. Like hypnosis. It takes a willing patient. Otherwise, you can spend your time just being nice to people than reading how other people succeeded by doing things that worked for them, and you hope to be able to achieve one day, the same illusive way glamor and status are the coveted jewels of celebrities.How to win friends and influence people?Be nice. Listen to others. Try not to be a c**t. That's it.Now go back to your life and enjoy the passive-aggressive PC nonsense at your workplace :)Igor"
53,0671027034,http://goodreads.com/user/show/108599067-wout-biesheuvel,5,"The book is quite a nice read; short fun anecdotes based around some of the insights the writer is willing to share. I'd suggest taking his advice with a grain of salt but there certainly are things that I know that work, and that are great when applied. Some other things give me this weird feeling of 'fake superficiality' and it decribes a world where people can't disagree or be frank with eachother; this might be a cultural angle that hasn't been taken into account. A balance is certainly worth looking for sometimes as the 'rules' suggested are only looked at from the positive side; that seems a downside of this book.If I had to pick one 'rule' I really like it would be the simple, but oh so effective; ""Smile"". What bad can it cause? Overall, I'd still give this book 5 stars since even though its a little bit old, it's written in a great way, and let's be honest it's just a great positive book that hss some great insights and take aways to share about human relationships."
54,0671027034,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1042653-ashlie,5,"This is one of the most profound books to understand others behaviors and in teaching you skills to communicate effectively with others. A lot of the information is quite basic, but the examples and the message is quite profound. It has certainly made me stop and reevaluate my responses with others in the past few weeks when needing to work through difficult professional and personal situations. I think this book is a must read and will continue to be timeless classic book."
55,0671027034,http://goodreads.com/user/show/931082-arminius,4,"This book lays out a plan you can use to succeed in life.To make friends:Never criticize, show sincere appreciation, find out what others want and show them how to get it, become interested in them, smile at them, and know their name.To Influence:Praise and appreciate, ask questions instead of giving a direct order, give the other person a reputation to live up to, and make the other person happy about doing what you suggest.

56,0671027034,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5610133-sologdin,1,"Douchey crap, overall. There should, that is, be no need for a text that argues one should actually listen to what others say or that sometimes criticism and complaints get on people's nerves.Other items, such as stating one's interlocutor's name with frequency, is just manifestly obsequious, and constantly smiling is plain oleaginous, a recipe for resting douchebag face."
57,0671027034,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7810515-una-tiers,5,This was a re-read. I'd forgotten it was about positive thinking and all the benefits it has.

I’ve actually learned a lot of these techniques in my business classes. I admit I’m not the best at applying these principles, even though I’ve been familiar with them for a long time. This was an amazing refresher.Basically, you can’t create positive change in the world by attacking, criticizing or belittling others. Real change comes from finding empathy, compassion and common ground."
59,0671027034,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4992138-brittany,5,"This is truly and oldie but a goodie. It was written in the 1930s, but has been updated a few times and is still very readable.The title has more to mock in it than the rest of the book. It's not as corny or pedantic as that title makes it sound. Frankly, I think, ""How to Be a Decent Human Being in Ways You Know You Should Know About Already, but Don't"" would probably be better.I can see that if you truly take most of the advice in this book to heart, it will definitely have a positive influence on your life. I picked it up as a recommended reading for salespeople at work, but it goes way beyond that.The best part about the book is the fact that is mostly made up of fascinating anecdotes that Carnegie uses to illustrate the instructive points he's trying to make. How will talking about someone's kids help you make a sale? How will smiling at your wife over you cereal in the morning revolutionize your home life? You gotta read to find out.If you're like me, by the end of the book, you will have a whole list of people from your life who you wish you could force to read it."
60,0671027034,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9777942-joe,3,"Popular self-help books have the most misleading titles. Men are From Mars Women are from Venus, for example, promises a provocative thesis but proves a bland and repetitive read. By contrast, The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People enlightens the mind and tugs at the heart despite its dry label.And so it is with How to Win Friends and Influence People. The title suggests cloak-and-dagger tactics. 'Winning friends' implies competition; that if you don't win them someone else will! And 'influencing people' implies trickery; how to get them to do what's best for you, instead of what's best for themselves.Yet the content of the book proves warm and friendly. Tips include admitting fault when you've erred, showing sincere interest in other people and putting effort into learning their names. These ideas are supported by a series of heartwarming anecdotes from historical figures and ordinary people from Carnegie's day. The overall theme is that if you do right by others they'll do right by you.Toward the end, there's a suggestion or two that feel like psychological tricks. For example, there's a chapter on that old sales tactic of asking a lot of yes/no questions (Are you feeling well today? Have you used a product like ours before?) to get someone saying 'yes' so they'll be primed to say 'yes' once you start your sales-pitch. But these were exceptions to the rule and felt mild compared with what I was expecting.I have to wonder why the book wasn't named 'How to make friends and get along with people?' I guess the sneakier title helps attract competitive business types; roping them in with the promise of shady tactics before giving them flowers and sunshine. The title implies underhanded schemes but may be the most underhanded element of the book.Edited 5-21-2017"

I am friendlier and more influential now.I owe it all to Dale Carnegie, the failed actor from Missouri who discovered he had a knack for jazzing up people’s confidence. His foundational work, “How to Win Friends & Influence People,” blasted off in 1936, but for anyone who wants a pill-sized dose of encouragement, a “mini abridged edition” is being released this week to celebrate the book’s 80th year.You could call “How to Win Friends & Influence People” the grandfather of America’s self-help movement, except this grandfather is running circles around the rest of the industry, selling 300,000 copies last year. That was all news to me. Until recently, I had assumed Carnegie’s book was. . . .

I really appreciate the focus on kindness and positively, especially in avoiding letting appreciation become empty flattery. But like... at one point Carnegie randomly tells a “plain” acquaintance that she’s capable of greatness... and then sort of takes responsibility for changing her life? Because suddenly she was confident and into skin care and got married. I think men sometimes inflate how important a single compliment is to a woman.There is a lot of good information on how to use positive reinforcement and “make people want what you want” and a lot of great reminders for dealing with people tho!"
64,0671027034,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5875398-rebecca,3,"For a book to have been in print continuously for nearly 80 years, it must be doing something right. Many of the principles are still applicable, but Carnegie’s case studies struck me as hopelessly outdated as well as exclusively American (the Teapot Dome scandal?!). In teaching public speaking to thousands of businessmen, he developed pointed advice for how to get people to like you and do what you want. Examples: show genuine interest in others and draw out their stories, express sincere appreciation, and try to see things from the other person’s point of view. Although he insists this is not about trickery or flattery, I still sensed a hint of manipulation. A lot of what he says just seems like common sense, but he spells it out and puts it all together in a helpful, reader-friendly format. He also draws on anecdote and experience, much like contemporary self-help authors like Gretchen Rubin and Brené Brown."

66,0671027034,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1586355-chad-warner,4,"Despite its manipulative-sounding title, this book is about genuinely improving your social skills and winning people to your way of thinking. Although I generally agree with his principles, I think Carnegie makes following them sound too easy.Carnegie states that 15% of success is due to technical knowledge, and the other 85% is due to personality and leadership. He says that the #1 secret to success in dealing with people is having a sympathetic grasp of the other person’s point of view. He talks a lot about respecting and understanding other people, and quotes Ralph Waldo Emerson: ""Every man I meet is my superior in some way. In that, I learn of him.""Carnegie also talks a lot about praise; he says that praise is more effective than criticism for changing behavior and winning people over, so you should be “hearty in your approbation and lavish in your praise.”The book includes lessons from people like Jesus, Confucius, Buddha, Abraham Lincoln, Andrew Carnegie, Ben Franklin, John Rockefeller, Charles Schwab, and J.P. Morgan. Carnegie provides anecdotes of his own experiences, and those of the people who took his courses.I first read this book when co-workers suggested I improve my social skills, because I received many recommendations for this book. I re-read it because the lessons are so important and worthwhile.Below are the book's principles, along with my notes.Fundamental Techniques in Handling People1. Don't criticize, condemn, or complain.• Criticism is futile.2. Give honest and sincere appreciation.• Avoid flattery.3. Arouse in the other person an eager want.• Salespeople need to show how their products and services solve customers’ problems• Each party should gain; there must be mutual benefit.Six Ways to Make People Like You1. Become genuinely interested in other people.• “You can make more friends in two months by becoming more interested in other people than you can in two years by trying to get people interested in you”• Greet people with animation and enthusiasm. When someone calls on the phone, sound like you’re pleased.2. Smile.• A facial expression is more important than clothes.• Encouragement is more effective than punishment.• Don’t feel like smiling? Force yourself; feeling follows action.3. Remember that a man's Name is to him the sweetest and most important sound in any language.• To remember names, tie the name to a person’s features, use the person’s name in conversation, and write and memorize the name.4. Be a good listener. Encourage others to talk about themselves.• To be a good conversationalist, listen and pay attention.• To be interesting, be interested.5. Talk in the terms of the other man's interest.6. Make the other person feel important and do it sincerely.• The law of human conduct: always make the other person feel important.• Follow the Golden Rule: ""Do unto others as you would have them do unto you"".Twelve Ways to Win People to Your Way of Thinking1. Avoid arguments.• You can’t win an argument. Even if you win, you make your opponent feel inferior, so you lose.2. Show respect for the other person's opinions. Never tell someone they are wrong.3. If you're wrong, admit it quickly and emphatically.4. Begin in a friendly way.• ""'A drop of honey catches more flies than a gallon of gall.' So with men. If you would win a man to your cause, first convince him that you are his sincere friend."" – Lincoln5. Start with questions the other person will answer yes to.• The more yeses you can get at the outset, the more likely the person is to accept your ultimate proposal.6. Let the other person do the talking.• “If you want enemies, excel your friends; but if you want friends, let your friends excel you”.7. Let the other person feel the idea is his/hers.8. Try honestly to see things from the other person's point of view.9. Sympathize with the other person.10. Appeal to noble motives.• Treat people as if they are honest and fair.11. Dramatize your ideas.12. Throw down a challenge.• Use showmanship when selling or convincing.Be a Leader: How to Change People Without Giving Offense or Arousing Resentment1. Begin with praise and honest appreciation.• Use ""and"", not ""but"" as your conjunction between praise and criticism. Give praise, then say “and”, then give criticism/correction. Don’t give praise, say “but”, then criticize; it cheapens the praise.2. Call attention to other people's mistakes indirectly.3. Talk about your own mistakes first.4. Ask questions instead of directly giving orders.• People are more likely to accept an order if they had a part in the decision.5. Let the other person save face.6. Praise every improvement.• Give specific, sincere praise.• Praise is more effective at changing behavior than criticism.7. Give them a fine reputation to live up to.• Praise people, and they’ll feel obligated to live up to their good reputation.8. Encourage them by making their faults seem easy to correct.9. Make the other person happy about doing what you suggest.• Convince people by telling them specifically how they’ll personally benefit."

68,0671027034,http://goodreads.com/user/show/25883565-gator,4,"Dale Carnegie put together one heck of a book, I’ve already begun applying his techniques and advice to great success, with my wife, children and clients. My wife and I run a small business and sometimes clients can be a real pain in the behind, I used to sometimes sass back but after reading this life guide I’ve begun to sing a different tune, and the results speak for themselves, they are very positive. This book can be used as a life guide, whenever we run into issues dive into Carnegie’s book and you may just find what you’re looking for. I will definitely be recommending this and re reading in the future. Below are some of my favorite quotes. ""It is an old and true maxim that 'a drop of honey catches more flies than a gallon of gall.' So with men, if you would win a man to your cause, first convince him that you are his sincere friend.”-Abe Lincoln “All men have fears, but the brave put down their fears and go forward, sometimes to death, but always to victory” was the motto of the King’s Guard in Ancient Greece.  “You must develop a deep, driving desire to learn, a vigorous determination to increase your ability to deal with people” “Any fool can criticize, condemn, and complain — and most fools do.”“The deepest urge in human nature is the desire to be important … always make the other person feel important.” “Listening is one of the highest compliments we can pay anyone.”“There is only one way under the high heaven to get the best of an argument — and that is to avoid it. Avoid arguments as you would rattlesnakes and earthquakes.”“We are interested in others when they are interested in us.”“In our interpersonal relationships, we should never forget that all our associates are human begins and hunger for appreciation.”"
69,0671027034,http://goodreads.com/user/show/32557533-claire,1,"Overall I can see why some people value this book and go on to practice some of the ideas in their lives, whether personally or in business. There are some interesting examples and valuable thoughts, though I struggled to enjoy this read for a number of factors;- The writing itself wasn't particularly interesting or eloquent- The repetition was tiresome - whilst it was purposefully repeated, it made me feel bored and patronised- Not only were actual sentences repeated - the ideas and concepts in the book were all similar conveyed in a slightly different variant- Examples seem to form the main bulk of the content which made the book feel like a collection of anecdotesOn top of all of the above, I feel like anyone taking the advice in this book too seriously would end up being walked over; pleasing people, letting others take the credit, always being the bigger person, never complaining or criticising. As such, I feel like these ideas need to be taken with a large pinch of salt and maybe in this way one or two may become useful in small doses!"
70,0671027034,http://goodreads.com/user/show/302414-dave,5,"I have read this book many times over the years. As I was looking through my bookshelfs this afternoon, I found a very old copy of this classic. It must have come from my father's library as it is marked as a 77th printing - probably printed in the early 50's. I LOVE old books...The best tidbit to share from this book, is if you want people to like you, emulate a dog. Carnegie says: ""When you get within ten feet of him, he will begin to wag his tail. If you stop and pat him, he will almost jump out of his skin to show you how much he likes you. And you know that behind this show of affection on his part, there are no ulterior motives: he doesn't want to sell you any real estate, and he doesn't want to marry you."""

Basically, it argues that if you earnestly invest in other people, care about them in ways that few people do, you will have success throughout your life. As many others have already commented, the name of the book leads you to believe that it will be a load of sleaze. And indeed, the book's title did put me off it for quite a while. After all, this is a book about how to influence people. For the most part, I haven't found the part of the book where the sleaze comes out. One thing I am wondering about however is how the book will address dealing with horrible people: with the tyrants, emotion terrorists, or just plain whiners. More importantly--the first rule: not criticizing anyone. That seems like it would take quite a toll after a while. "

77,0671027034,http://goodreads.com/user/show/17442587-hannah,0,"Well, I thought a lot of things while reading this. I admit I wasn't too gung-ho about the book in the first place, and read it because it was assigned reading at work. I've heard about Carnegie plenty of times in the past and was pretty sure he wasn't the sort of author whose philosophies I'd give five stars to.However, I did try to read it objectively. Yes, he is a proponent of the ""social gospel"" of his time, but it also wasn't as bad as I thought it might be (I didn't end by throwing the book across the room. So far, Descartes remains alone in the dubious distinction of being lobbed at the further wall). I'll write my review in sections according to the structure of the book.Part one: Fundamental Techniques in Handling People1. Don't criticize, condemn, or complain.Point given: no one wants to be around a whiner. Sure, I agree with that.Application made: Lawbreakers, such as Al Capone and Two Gun Crowley, believed themselves to be good people at heart, even helpers of the community: ""people don't criticize themselves for anything, no matter how wrong it may be....Criticism is futile because it puts a person on the defensive and usually makes him strive to justify himself. Criticism is dangerous because it wounds a person's precious pride, hurts his sense of importance, and arouses resentment.""All right, wait a moment here. If my friends never voice any criticism, how would I know I'm wandering around with mud on my cheek? with a stain on my blouse? How am I to know that something is wrong? The last thing I wish to do is wander through life with the rest of the world afraid to let me know what I'm doing wrong. Constructive criticism is a good thing. As a music teacher, it is imperative that sometimes I get to say, ""No. Don't do it that way."" Why? Because certain positions can be harmful to the student's muscles and a hindrance to their progress. I compliment them on progress made and tell them how to make it better. It requires much less time and intellectual fishing than trying to influence them to deduct that the position may not be to their greatest advantage.2. Give honest and sincere appreciation.Point given: Everyone is glad to know they are valuable.Application: If you want people to do something for you, your best bet is to make them want to do it. Using an application of Sigmund Freud's and Dewey's theories that every man has ""the desire to be great"" or ""the desire to be important,"" Carnegie mentions the successes who have made themselves great--Lincoln and Dickens--and moves on to criminals. ""The average young criminal...is filled with ego...If you tell me how you get your feeling of importance, I'll tell you what you are. That determines your character,"" he finishes. Mr. Carnegie, I beg to differ. What puffs your chest out is not the sum total of who you are. That is only one symptom of the man as a whole. Are you trustworthy? Are you a friend to others? If you are either of those, or of any other things, and yet lack a real feeling of importance, it does not make you a nobody, as Carnegie more than implies. Finding your self-worth is not the only goal in life for a successful person.He continues the chapter by giving examples of people who have gone insane because of having unfulfilled dreams in life...well, nobody can quite say it for sure, of course, but this is his argument: ""...the other half of people who go insane apparently have nothing wrong with their brain cells...Why do these people go insane? [the doctor he spoke with said] Nobody knows for sure. But he did say that many people who go insane find in insanity a feeling of importance that they were unable to achieve in the world of reality."" His implication is clear that some people prefer to lose touch with reality than to lose touch with their dreams and their exalted view of themselves.What about flattery? We do get warned against flattery. ""Flattery is counterfeit, and like counterfeit money, it will eventually get you into trouble if you pass it to someone else...Flattery is telling the other person precisely what he thinks about himself."" But to give a person compliments in the hope of gaining one's own ends reeks of insincerity. The examples given show that a sloppy person will suddenly do a great job when given praise instead of critique. I'm sorry, but I've tried this. Contrary to Carnegie's opinion, people are not all going to do what you want if you convince them they are good people and they do a good job. All too many react with pleasure at the status quo and see absolutely no need to do better. So I will add that, yes, it's wonderful to appreciate others. But it is wrong and often cruel to them to make them think they are perfect when they are doing a sloppy job that may cause danger to others (such as breaking health laws or leaving messes in walkways.) Carnegie denies the implication that making someone want what you want by telling them how good they are is manipulation, but in most of the examples it slides dangerously close to that line.3. Arouse in the other person an eager want.Point given: People's acts are entirely driven by their wants.Application: To impose what we want, we have to convince others that they want what we want more than they want what they want...that, in fact, what we want is even better than what they wanted in the first place. While I'm all for positive inspiration, this message has a sordid underbelly.Carnegie believes that all actions have one root: desire. The only way to change a person's actions is to change their desires. He does not believe that people will gladly follow rules unless there is something in it for them. In the previous chapter, he posited that those appreciated will do a great job merely because someone's compliment makes them wish to do well. Yes, I do agree that continual criticism will sap a person's motivations, but praise all the time is not necessarily a motivator. According to Carnegie's philosophy, there are no people who are lazy for the joy of being lazy. Or, if there are such people, all they need is someone to come along and affirm them and present to them a good reason to get up and do a good job.One of the examples given is of a child who refused to eat his vegetables despite being scolded by his parents. He had an issue with a neighborhood bully, and the father decided to use the bully as the force behind his argument. ""When his father explained that the boy would be able to wallop the daylights out of the bigger kid someday if he would only eat the things his mother wanted him to eat--when his father promised him that--there was no longer any problem of dietetics."" I'm sorry, but no parent can ever make a promise like that, because there is no guarantee of its being fulfilled. The boy may have grown to 5'6"" and the bully to 6'5"" and no vegetables in the world could reverse the sizes. Then where would the father's promise be? He has broken a promise to his child that he had no right to make in the first place. The father's persuasion becomes a lie. The two pages of the child's story show that they gained mastery over the child by ""making him feel important."" Another child eats her cereal because by preparing it she ""achieved a feeling of importance; she had found in making the cereal an avenue of self-expression.""The danger of Carnegie's philosophy in this point is that one's self-esteem becomes the generator of their actions. If their self-esteem fails, apparently they do a horrible job and are uninterested in good ideas. Well, that doesn't bear out in real life. Some people who have damaged self-worth are hard workers, and some with excellent self-worth are sloppy and lazy. But Carnegie's chapter ends with a quote: ""William Winter once remarked that 'self-expression is the dominant necessity of human nature.'"" Well, if we are so busy fueling the self-expression of all those around us, where are we? We see a goal and coax others to want that goal, but ourselves are left behind in the dust of their ascent.Part Two. Six Ways to Make People Like You(well, I feel quarrelsome just reading that. If everyone likes you there's something wrong with your self-expression, because in being all things to all people there is no room left to be yourself.)1. Become genuinely interested in other people.All well and good, except he makes the cynical point ""People are not interested in you. They are not interested in me. They are interested in themselves--morning, noon, and after dinner."" So we are to figure out some way to become genuinely interested in others, to be silent when they talk, to encourage them always to express themselves around us.2. SmilePlease do!3. Remember that a person's name is to that person the sweetest and most important sound in any language.Helpful, but not the ""sweetest sound"" he claims. It's nice to remember names, but that honestly doesn't influence me much. I wonder if other people are more influenced by this, and I'm just some sort of anomaly? When I'm at work and someone comes through my checkout line, if it's a stranger I don't know, I'm not at all tempted to give them a bigger drink than they paid for because they say my name. Really, that's creepy...being nice to me doesn't entitle them to more of the company's food than they paid for, anyway. It isn't my food to give away.4. Be a good listener. Encourage others to talk about themselves.This one's easy...Other people's lives are just interesting. A side effect of being a hopeful novelist.5. Talk in terms of other people's interests.This creeps back towards flattery and worse. ""You want me to be your friend because I can do thus and so for you."" Isn't that just asking others to exploit your talents? I don't want friends who want me only on the basis of what I can do for them. When seeking a job, yes. But not when seeking friends.6. Make the other person feel important--and do it sincerely.This reminded me of an Andy Griffith show I saw recently on Netflix. Aunt Bee makes horrible pickles, but Andy and Barney are determined to not make her feel bad. After going to great and hilarious lengths of deception, they are left doomed to eat a double batch of bad pickles. They were sincere in their desire to please Aunt Bee because they could recognize she'd worked hard on those pickles. But it didn't rebound in their favor. They were insincere and deceptive in their effort to reward her for her work.Making others feel important isn't going to automatically result in a handout of exactly what you wanted. This action, done in order to gain a goal (as shown in the examples), is risky indeed, and oftentimes even deceptive.....out of time....more tomorrow and later on my blog...including ""Carnegie's book in light of Scripture."""
78,0671027034,http://goodreads.com/user/show/16996132-abeer-abdullah,2,"Working with a wide variety of people in my particular function in my company has left me seeking guidance on how to approach people, how to influence them, guide them and understand them. This is a great challenge for me for many reasons, for one thing I am over a decade younger than most people I am trying to influence, I am a 24 years old Arab girl who studied poetry who is trying to give council to and work with 40 year old Arab male engineers. Who, rightfully, may see it as ridiculous and be dismissive. It feels like a genuinely impossible task. Consequently, I am now trying to read as much about effective communication as possible, but it seems that a lot of the so called classics and best sellers are just incredibly shallow, and without true substance. This book tries to put forward the idea that empathy is at the core of winning friends and influencing people. As true as that is, it is not something revolutionary for us now in the early 21st century. Harvard Business Review's collection of books on various topics such as Emotional Intelligence and Communication for me have proved much more effective. They give detailed analysis, up to date studies, and real life examples. "
79,0671027034,http://goodreads.com/user/show/54266751-jennifer,4,"I really enjoyed this book. The advice is timeless and is as relevant today as it was eaight year's ago. I stumbled across How to Win Friends & Influence People while looking for something on change management. I wanted a book that explored the human component and not the process piece of change management.Dale Carnegie illustrates each lesson, or principle, by using both professional and personal examples. I love Carnegie’s writing style and use of words, which had a calming effect and transported me back in time. An informative and enjoyable read."
80,0671027034,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5789353-giselle,4,"Great advice, which is pretty much a given for any business person. There’s a lot of name dropping in almost every chapter. And he provides you with a ton of examples for each part. A quick and easy read if you’re looking at ways to understand people more."
81,0671027034,http://goodreads.com/user/show/88366321-jeffrey-egolf,0,I think I should wait for the book club meeting to post this review.
82,0671027034,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10471943-igor-ljubuncic,2,"So ... I am opposed to self-help books. I don't believe in self-help books. I think they are paradoxical in that people who read them expect a miraculous solution to an internal problem and those who don't read them probably don't need them in the first place. Moreover, most of these fall into a very typical template - written for the US audience and revolving around some well-proven formulas with a significant monetary incentive.The only reason I decided to try to read this book was because a valued colleague recommended it, as it has had a profound impact on his life. Disassociating his experience from the novel I set about reading, and soon I realized, it is impossible to not judge this book through the eyes of my colleague and the sum of his life's doings. Which is why the message that worked so successfully for him does not work for me at all. Because the way we have lived our lives and approach our problems are completely different, and so is the depth, scope, magnitude, and variety of our problems.I munched through three chapters before giving up. The material is repetitive, with one example after another rehashing the one-liner message summarized at the end of each chapter. Almost like whoever is reading needs convincing that what is being told is the way to do it. And perhaps it is, but a bullet-list would work equally well, if the reader is willing to embrace the message. So maybe the book is all about convincing people into trying to change their lifestyle rather than actually learning some helpful tips, if that's actually possible, on how to manage life situations.I like the concept, the ideas are noble - and valid - but the delivery mechanism completely fails me. I realize that I'm 100% not the intended audience, and that the message is designed to instill introspection, regret, remorse, enlightenment, and illumination, which I failed to grasp. Not because I'm cold-hearted, obstinate, stubborn, or opposed to change, simply because I do not need convincing 100x over that I should do XYZ. Be considerate to people and compliment them. Yes. Agreed. No need to repeat that on 10 pages of text with 27 examples. One is enough.What is missing for me is context. There isn't enough of it - so you know that people did something and that it worked for them, but not the WHY. And that's more important than actions, because anyone can be lucky, or look back and justify their successes by creating a template that fits the bill. Because let's face it, people don't write books on how to be successful BEFORE they become successful. Hindsight is camp.All in all, there's nothing wrong with the book. But it can be 99% shorter, the message can be summed up on one page, and most importantly, the book is there to reaffirm people's needs in doing things that they have already set about doing, or they are facing an existential crisis and grasping for straws of hope. In other words, if you're not one of the two, or you don't believe books can help you change, which, let's face it, they can't, unless you're already set on making that happen, and the fact you consider buying this book is the VERY step needed to change, then you will not enjoy it. Like hypnosis. It takes a willing patient. Otherwise, you can spend your time just being nice to people than reading how other people succeeded by doing things that worked for them, and you hope to be able to achieve one day, the same illusive way glamor and status are the coveted jewels of celebrities.How to win friends and influence people?Be nice. Listen to others. Try not to be a c**t. That's it.Now go back to your life and enjoy the passive-aggressive PC nonsense at your workplace :)Igor"
83,0671027034,http://goodreads.com/user/show/108599067-wout-biesheuvel,5,"The book is quite a nice read; short fun anecdotes based around some of the insights the writer is willing to share. I'd suggest taking his advice with a grain of salt but there certainly are things that I know that work, and that are great when applied. Some other things give me this weird feeling of 'fake superficiality' and it decribes a world where people can't disagree or be frank with eachother; this might be a cultural angle that hasn't been taken into account. A balance is certainly worth looking for sometimes as the 'rules' suggested are only looked at from the positive side; that seems a downside of this book.If I had to pick one 'rule' I really like it would be the simple, but oh so effective; ""Smile"". What bad can it cause? Overall, I'd still give this book 5 stars since even though its a little bit old, it's written in a great way, and let's be honest it's just a great positive book that hss some great insights and take aways to share about human relationships."
84,0671027034,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1042653-ashlie,5,"This is one of the most profound books to understand others behaviors and in teaching you skills to communicate effectively with others. A lot of the information is quite basic, but the examples and the message is quite profound. It has certainly made me stop and reevaluate my responses with others in the past few weeks when needing to work through difficult professional and personal situations. I think this book is a must read and will continue to be timeless classic book."
85,0671027034,http://goodreads.com/user/show/931082-arminius,4,"This book lays out a plan you can use to succeed in life.To make friends:Never criticize, show sincere appreciation, find out what others want and show them how to get it, become interested in them, smile at them, and know their name.To Influence:Praise and appreciate, ask questions instead of giving a direct order, give the other person a reputation to live up to, and make the other person happy about doing what you suggest. "

There should, that is, be no need for a text that argues one should actually listen to what others say or that sometimes criticism and complaints get on people's nerves.Other items, such as stating one's interlocutor's name with frequency, is just manifestly obsequious, and constantly smiling is plain oleaginous, a recipe for resting douchebag face."

I’ve actually learned a lot of these techniques in my business classes. I admit I’m not the best at applying these principles, even though I’ve been familiar with them for a long time. This was an amazing refresher.Basically, you can’t create positive change in the world by attacking, criticizing or belittling others. Real change comes from finding empathy, compassion and common ground."

It was written in the 1930s, but has been updated a few times and is still very readable.The title has more to mock in it than the rest of the book. It's not as corny or pedantic as that title makes it sound. Frankly, I think, ""How to Be a Decent Human Being in Ways You Know You Should Know About Already, but Don't"" would probably be better.I can see that if you truly take most of the advice in this book to heart, it will definitely have a positive influence on your life. I picked it up as a recommended reading for salespeople at work, but it goes way beyond that.The best part about the book is the fact that is mostly made up of fascinating anecdotes that Carnegie uses to illustrate the instructive points he's trying to make. How will talking about someone's kids help you make a sale? How will smiling at your wife over you cereal in the morning revolutionize your home life? You gotta read to find out.If you're like me, by the end of the book, you will have a whole list of people from your life who you wish you could force to read it."

Men are From Mars Women are from Venus, for example, promises a provocative thesis but proves a bland and repetitive read. By contrast, The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People enlightens the mind and tugs at the heart despite its dry label.And so it is with How to Win Friends and Influence People. The title suggests cloak-and-dagger tactics. 'Winning friends' implies competition; that if you don't win them someone else will! And 'influencing people' implies trickery; how to get them to do what's best for you, instead of what's best for themselves.Yet the content of the book proves warm and friendly. Tips include admitting fault when you've erred, showing sincere interest in other people and putting effort into learning their names. These ideas are supported by a series of heartwarming anecdotes from historical figures and ordinary people from Carnegie's day. The overall theme is that if you do right by others they'll do right by you.Toward the end, there's a suggestion or two that feel like psychological tricks. For example, there's a chapter on that old sales tactic of asking a lot of yes/no questions (Are you feeling well today? Have you used a product like ours before?) to get someone saying 'yes' so they'll be primed to say 'yes' once you start your sales-pitch. But these were exceptions to the rule and felt mild compared with what I was expecting.I have to wonder why the book wasn't named 'How to make friends and get along with people?' I guess the sneakier title helps attract competitive business types; roping them in with the promise of shady tactics before giving them flowers and sunshine. The title implies underhanded schemes but may be the most underhanded element of the book.Edited 5-21-2017"

I am friendlier and more influential now.I owe it all to Dale Carnegie, the failed actor from Missouri who discovered he had a knack for jazzing up people’s confidence. His foundational work, “How to Win Friends & Influence People,” blasted off in 1936, but for anyone who wants a pill-sized dose of encouragement, a “mini abridged edition” is being released this week to celebrate the book’s 80th year.You could call “How to Win Friends & Influence People” the grandfather of America’s self-help movement, except this grandfather is running circles around the rest of the industry, selling 300,000 copies last year. That was all news to me. Until recently, I had assumed Carnegie’s book was. . . .

I really appreciate the focus on kindness and positively, especially in avoiding letting appreciation become empty flattery. But like... at one point Carnegie randomly tells a “plain” acquaintance that she’s capable of greatness... and then sort of takes responsibility for changing her life? Because suddenly she was confident and into skin care and got married. I think men sometimes inflate how important a single compliment is to a woman.There is a lot of good information on how to use positive reinforcement and “make people want what you want” and a lot of great reminders for dealing with people tho!"
94,0671027034,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5875398-rebecca,3,"For a book to have been in print continuously for nearly 80 years, it must be doing something right. Many of the principles are still applicable, but Carnegie’s case studies struck me as hopelessly outdated as well as exclusively American (the Teapot Dome scandal?!). In teaching public speaking to thousands of businessmen, he developed pointed advice for how to get people to like you and do what you want. Examples: show genuine interest in others and draw out their stories, express sincere appreciation, and try to see things from the other person’s point of view. Although he insists this is not about trickery or flattery, I still sensed a hint of manipulation. A lot of what he says just seems like common sense, but he spells it out and puts it all together in a helpful, reader-friendly format. He also draws on anecdote and experience, much like contemporary self-help authors like Gretchen Rubin and Brené Brown."

96,0671027034,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1586355-chad-warner,4,"Despite its manipulative-sounding title, this book is about genuinely improving your social skills and winning people to your way of thinking. Although I generally agree with his principles, I think Carnegie makes following them sound too easy.Carnegie states that 15% of success is due to technical knowledge, and the other 85% is due to personality and leadership. He says that the #1 secret to success in dealing with people is having a sympathetic grasp of the other person’s point of view. He talks a lot about respecting and understanding other people, and quotes Ralph Waldo Emerson: ""Every man I meet is my superior in some way. In that, I learn of him.""Carnegie also talks a lot about praise; he says that praise is more effective than criticism for changing behavior and winning people over, so you should be “hearty in your approbation and lavish in your praise.”The book includes lessons from people like Jesus, Confucius, Buddha, Abraham Lincoln, Andrew Carnegie, Ben Franklin, John Rockefeller, Charles Schwab, and J.P. Morgan. Carnegie provides anecdotes of his own experiences, and those of the people who took his courses.I first read this book when co-workers suggested I improve my social skills, because I received many recommendations for this book. I re-read it because the lessons are so important and worthwhile.Below are the book's principles, along with my notes.Fundamental Techniques in Handling People1. Don't criticize, condemn, or complain.• Criticism is futile.2. Give honest and sincere appreciation.• Avoid flattery.3. Arouse in the other person an eager want.• Salespeople need to show how their products and services solve customers’ problems• Each party should gain; there must be mutual benefit.Six Ways to Make People Like You1.

When someone calls on the phone, sound like you’re pleased.2. Smile.• A facial expression is more important than clothes.• Encouragement is more effective than punishment.• Don’t feel like smiling? Force yourself; feeling follows action.3. Remember that a man's Name is to him the sweetest and most important sound in any language.• To remember names, tie the name to a person’s features, use the person’s name in conversation, and write and memorize the name.4. Be a good listener. Encourage others to talk about themselves.• To be a good conversationalist, listen and pay attention.• To be interesting, be interested.5. Talk in the terms of the other man's interest.6.

98,0671027034,http://goodreads.com/user/show/25883565-gator,4,"Dale Carnegie put together one heck of a book, I’ve already begun applying his techniques and advice to great success, with my wife, children and clients. My wife and I run a small business and sometimes clients can be a real pain in the behind, I used to sometimes sass back but after reading this life guide I’ve begun to sing a different tune, and the results speak for themselves, they are very positive. This book can be used as a life guide, whenever we run into issues dive into Carnegie’s book and you may just find what you’re looking for. I will definitely be recommending this and re reading in the future. Below are some of my favorite quotes. ""It is an old and true maxim that 'a drop of honey catches more flies than a gallon of gall.' So with men, if you would win a man to your cause, first convince him that you are his sincere friend.”-Abe Lincoln “All men have fears, but the brave put down their fears and go forward, sometimes to death, but always to victory” was the motto of the King’s Guard in Ancient Greece.  “You must develop a deep, driving desire to learn, a vigorous determination to increase your ability to deal with people” “Any fool can criticize, condemn, and complain — and most fools do.”“The deepest urge in human nature is the desire to be important … always make the other person feel important.” “Listening is one of the highest compliments we can pay anyone.”“There is only one way under the high heaven to get the best of an argument — and that is to avoid it. Avoid arguments as you would rattlesnakes and earthquakes.”“We are interested in others when they are interested in us.”“In our interpersonal relationships, we should never forget that all our associates are human begins and hunger for appreciation.”"
99,0671027034,http://goodreads.com/user/show/32557533-claire,1,"Overall I can see why some people value this book and go on to practice some of the ideas in their lives, whether personally or in business. There are some interesting examples and valuable thoughts, though I struggled to enjoy this read for a number of factors;- The writing itself wasn't particularly interesting or eloquent- The repetition was tiresome - whilst it was purposefully repeated, it made me feel bored and patronised- Not only were actual sentences repeated - the ideas and concepts in the book were all similar conveyed in a slightly different variant- Examples seem to form the main bulk of the content which made the book feel like a collection of anecdotesOn top of all of the above, I feel like anyone taking the advice in this book too seriously would end up being walked over; pleasing people, letting others take the credit, always being the bigger person, never complaining or criticising. As such, I feel like these ideas need to be taken with a large pinch of salt and maybe in this way one or two may become useful in small doses!"

As I was looking through my bookshelfs this afternoon, I found a very old copy of this classic. It must have come from my father's library as it is marked as a 77th printing - probably printed in the early 50's. I LOVE old books...The best tidbit to share from this book, is if you want people to like you, emulate a dog. Carnegie says: ""When you get within ten feet of him, he will begin to wag his tail. If you stop and pat him, he will almost jump out of his skin to show you how much he likes you. And you know that behind this show of affection on his part, there are no ulterior motives: he doesn't want to sell you any real estate, and he doesn't want to marry you."""

Basically, it argues that if you earnestly invest in other people, care about them in ways that few people do, you will have success throughout your life. As many others have already commented, the name of the book leads you to believe that it will be a load of sleaze. And indeed, the book's title did put me off it for quite a while. After all, this is a book about how to influence people. For the most part, I haven't found the part of the book where the sleaze comes out. One thing I am wondering about however is how the book will address dealing with horrible people: with the tyrants, emotion terrorists, or just plain whiners. More importantly--the first rule: not criticizing anyone. That seems like it would take quite a toll after a while. "

107,0671027034,http://goodreads.com/user/show/17442587-hannah,0,"Well, I thought a lot of things while reading this. I admit I wasn't too gung-ho about the book in the first place, and read it because it was assigned reading at work. I've heard about Carnegie plenty of times in the past and was pretty sure he wasn't the sort of author whose philosophies I'd give five stars to.However, I did try to read it objectively. Yes, he is a proponent of the ""social gospel"" of his time, but it also wasn't as bad as I thought it might be (I didn't end by throwing the book across the room. So far, Descartes remains alone in the dubious distinction of being lobbed at the further wall). I'll write my review in sections according to the structure of the book.Part one: Fundamental Techniques in Handling People1. Don't criticize, condemn, or complain.Point given: no one wants to be around a whiner. Sure, I agree with that.Application made: Lawbreakers, such as Al Capone and Two Gun Crowley, believed themselves to be good people at heart, even helpers of the community: ""people don't criticize themselves for anything, no matter how wrong it may be....Criticism is futile because it puts a person on the defensive and usually makes him strive to justify himself. Criticism is dangerous because it wounds a person's precious pride, hurts his sense of importance, and arouses resentment.""All right, wait a moment here. If my friends never voice any criticism, how would I know I'm wandering around with mud on my cheek? with a stain on my blouse? How am I to know that something is wrong? The last thing I wish to do is wander through life with the rest of the world afraid to let me know what I'm doing wrong. Constructive criticism is a good thing. As a music teacher, it is imperative that sometimes I get to say, ""No. Don't do it that way."" Why? Because certain positions can be harmful to the student's muscles and a hindrance to their progress. I compliment them on progress made and tell them how to make it better. It requires much less time and intellectual fishing than trying to influence them to deduct that the position may not be to their greatest advantage.2. Give honest and sincere appreciation.Point given: Everyone is glad to know they are valuable.Application: If you want people to do something for you, your best bet is to make them want to do it. Using an application of Sigmund Freud's and Dewey's theories that every man has ""the desire to be great"" or ""the desire to be important,"" Carnegie mentions the successes who have made themselves great--Lincoln and Dickens--and moves on to criminals. ""The average young criminal...is filled with ego...If you tell me how you get your feeling of importance, I'll tell you what you are. That determines your character,"" he finishes. Mr. Carnegie, I beg to differ. What puffs your chest out is not the sum total of who you are. That is only one symptom of the man as a whole. Are you trustworthy? Are you a friend to others? If you are either of those, or of any other things, and yet lack a real feeling of importance, it does not make you a nobody, as Carnegie more than implies. Finding your self-worth is not the only goal in life for a successful person.He continues the chapter by giving examples of people who have gone insane because of having unfulfilled dreams in life...well, nobody can quite say it for sure, of course, but this is his argument: ""...the other half of people who go insane apparently have nothing wrong with their brain cells...Why do these people go insane? [the doctor he spoke with said] Nobody knows for sure. But he did say that many people who go insane find in insanity a feeling of importance that they were unable to achieve in the world of reality."" His implication is clear that some people prefer to lose touch with reality than to lose touch with their dreams and their exalted view of themselves.What about flattery? We do get warned against flattery. ""Flattery is counterfeit, and like counterfeit money, it will eventually get you into trouble if you pass it to someone else...Flattery is telling the other person precisely what he thinks about himself."" But to give a person compliments in the hope of gaining one's own ends reeks of insincerity. The examples given show that a sloppy person will suddenly do a great job when given praise instead of critique. I'm sorry, but I've tried this. Contrary to Carnegie's opinion, people are not all going to do what you want if you convince them they are good people and they do a good job. All too many react with pleasure at the status quo and see absolutely no need to do better. So I will add that, yes, it's wonderful to appreciate others. But it is wrong and often cruel to them to make them think they are perfect when they are doing a sloppy job that may cause danger to others (such as breaking health laws or leaving messes in walkways.) Carnegie denies the implication that making someone want what you want by telling them how good they are is manipulation, but in most of the examples it slides dangerously close to that line.3. Arouse in the other person an eager want.Point given: People's acts are entirely driven by their wants.Application: To impose what we want, we have to convince others that they want what we want more than they want what they want...that, in fact, what we want is even better than what they wanted in the first place. While I'm all for positive inspiration, this message has a sordid underbelly.Carnegie believes that all actions have one root: desire. The only way to change a person's actions is to change their desires. He does not believe that people will gladly follow rules unless there is something in it for them. In the previous chapter, he posited that those appreciated will do a great job merely because someone's compliment makes them wish to do well. Yes, I do agree that continual criticism will sap a person's motivations, but praise all the time is not necessarily a motivator. According to Carnegie's philosophy, there are no people who are lazy for the joy of being lazy. Or, if there are such people, all they need is someone to come along and affirm them and present to them a good reason to get up and do a good job.One of the examples given is of a child who refused to eat his vegetables despite being scolded by his parents. He had an issue with a neighborhood bully, and the father decided to use the bully as the force behind his argument. ""When his father explained that the boy would be able to wallop the daylights out of the bigger kid someday if he would only eat the things his mother wanted him to eat--when his father promised him that--there was no longer any problem of dietetics."" I'm sorry, but no parent can ever make a promise like that, because there is no guarantee of its being fulfilled. The boy may have grown to 5'6"" and the bully to 6'5"" and no vegetables in the world could reverse the sizes. Then where would the father's promise be? He has broken a promise to his child that he had no right to make in the first place. The father's persuasion becomes a lie. The two pages of the child's story show that they gained mastery over the child by ""making him feel important."" Another child eats her cereal because by preparing it she ""achieved a feeling of importance; she had found in making the cereal an avenue of self-expression.""The danger of Carnegie's philosophy in this point is that one's self-esteem becomes the generator of their actions. If their self-esteem fails, apparently they do a horrible job and are uninterested in good ideas. Well, that doesn't bear out in real life. Some people who have damaged self-worth are hard workers, and some with excellent self-worth are sloppy and lazy. But Carnegie's chapter ends with a quote: ""William Winter once remarked that 'self-expression is the dominant necessity of human nature.'"" Well, if we are so busy fueling the self-expression of all those around us, where are we? We see a goal and coax others to want that goal, but ourselves are left behind in the dust of their ascent.Part Two. Six Ways to Make People Like You(well, I feel quarrelsome just reading that. If everyone likes you there's something wrong with your self-expression, because in being all things to all people there is no room left to be yourself.)1. Become genuinely interested in other people.All well and good, except he makes the cynical point ""People are not interested in you. They are not interested in me. They are interested in themselves--morning, noon, and after dinner."" So we are to figure out some way to become genuinely interested in others, to be silent when they talk, to encourage them always to express themselves around us.2. SmilePlease do!3. Remember that a person's name is to that person the sweetest and most important sound in any language.Helpful, but not the ""sweetest sound"" he claims. It's nice to remember names, but that honestly doesn't influence me much. I wonder if other people are more influenced by this, and I'm just some sort of anomaly? When I'm at work and someone comes through my checkout line, if it's a stranger I don't know, I'm not at all tempted to give them a bigger drink than they paid for because they say my name. Really, that's creepy...being nice to me doesn't entitle them to more of the company's food than they paid for, anyway. It isn't my food to give away.4. Be a good listener. Encourage others to talk about themselves.This one's easy...Other people's lives are just interesting. A side effect of being a hopeful novelist.5. Talk in terms of other people's interests.This creeps back towards flattery and worse. ""You want me to be your friend because I can do thus and so for you."" Isn't that just asking others to exploit your talents? I don't want friends who want me only on the basis of what I can do for them. When seeking a job, yes. But not when seeking friends.6. Make the other person feel important--and do it sincerely.This reminded me of an Andy Griffith show I saw recently on Netflix. Aunt Bee makes horrible pickles, but Andy and Barney are determined to not make her feel bad. After going to great and hilarious lengths of deception, they are left doomed to eat a double batch of bad pickles. They were sincere in their desire to please Aunt Bee because they could recognize she'd worked hard on those pickles. But it didn't rebound in their favor. They were insincere and deceptive in their effort to reward her for her work.Making others feel important isn't going to automatically result in a handout of exactly what you wanted. This action, done in order to gain a goal (as shown in the examples), is risky indeed, and oftentimes even deceptive.....out of time....more tomorrow and later on my blog...including ""Carnegie's book in light of Scripture."""

Consequently, I am now trying to read as much about effective communication as possible, but it seems that a lot of the so called classics and best sellers are just incredibly shallow, and without true substance. This book tries to put forward the idea that empathy is at the core of winning friends and influencing people. As true as that is, it is not something revolutionary for us now in the early 21st century. Harvard Business Review's collection of books on various topics such as Emotional Intelligence and Communication for me have proved much more effective. They give detailed analysis, up to date studies, and real life examples. "

I stumbled across How to Win Friends & Influence People while looking for something on change management. I wanted a book that explored the human component and not the process piece of change management.Dale Carnegie illustrates each lesson, or principle, by using both professional and personal examples. I love Carnegie’s writing style and use of words, which had a calming effect and transported me back in time. An informative and enjoyable read."
110,0671027034,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5789353-giselle,4,"Great advice, which is pretty much a given for any business person. There’s a lot of name dropping in almost every chapter. And he provides you with a ton of examples for each part. A quick and easy read if you’re looking at ways to understand people more."
111,0671027034,http://goodreads.com/user/show/88366321-jeffrey-egolf,0,I think I should wait for the book club meeting to post this review.
112,0671027034,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10471943-igor-ljubuncic,2,"So ... I am opposed to self-help books. I don't believe in self-help books. I think they are paradoxical in that people who read them expect a miraculous solution to an internal problem and those who don't read them probably don't need them in the first place. Moreover, most of these fall into a very typical template - written for the US audience and revolving around some well-proven formulas with a significant monetary incentive.The only reason I decided to try to read this book was because a valued colleague recommended it, as it has had a profound impact on his life. Disassociating his experience from the novel I set about reading, and soon I realized, it is impossible to not judge this book through the eyes of my colleague and the sum of his life's doings. Which is why the message that worked so successfully for him does not work for me at all. Because the way we have lived our lives and approach our problems are completely different, and so is the depth, scope, magnitude, and variety of our problems.I munched through three chapters before giving up. The material is repetitive, with one example after another rehashing the one-liner message summarized at the end of each chapter. Almost like whoever is reading needs convincing that what is being told is the way to do it. And perhaps it is, but a bullet-list would work equally well, if the reader is willing to embrace the message. So maybe the book is all about convincing people into trying to change their lifestyle rather than actually learning some helpful tips, if that's actually possible, on how to manage life situations.I like the concept, the ideas are noble - and valid - but the delivery mechanism completely fails me. I realize that I'm 100% not the intended audience, and that the message is designed to instill introspection, regret, remorse, enlightenment, and illumination, which I failed to grasp. Not because I'm cold-hearted, obstinate, stubborn, or opposed to change, simply because I do not need convincing 100x over that I should do XYZ. Be considerate to people and compliment them. Yes. Agreed. No need to repeat that on 10 pages of text with 27 examples. One is enough.What is missing for me is context. There isn't enough of it - so you know that people did something and that it worked for them, but not the WHY. And that's more important than actions, because anyone can be lucky, or look back and justify their successes by creating a template that fits the bill. Because let's face it, people don't write books on how to be successful BEFORE they become successful. Hindsight is camp.All in all, there's nothing wrong with the book. But it can be 99% shorter, the message can be summed up on one page, and most importantly, the book is there to reaffirm people's needs in doing things that they have already set about doing, or they are facing an existential crisis and grasping for straws of hope. In other words, if you're not one of the two, or you don't believe books can help you change, which, let's face it, they can't, unless you're already set on making that happen, and the fact you consider buying this book is the VERY step needed to change, then you will not enjoy it. Like hypnosis. It takes a willing patient. Otherwise, you can spend your time just being nice to people than reading how other people succeeded by doing things that worked for them, and you hope to be able to achieve one day, the same illusive way glamor and status are the coveted jewels of celebrities.How to win friends and influence people?Be nice. Listen to others. Try not to be a c**t. That's it.Now go back to your life and enjoy the passive-aggressive PC nonsense at your workplace :)Igor"
113,0671027034,http://goodreads.com/user/show/108599067-wout-biesheuvel,5,"The book is quite a nice read; short fun anecdotes based around some of the insights the writer is willing to share. I'd suggest taking his advice with a grain of salt but there certainly are things that I know that work, and that are great when applied. Some other things give me this weird feeling of 'fake superficiality' and it decribes a world where people can't disagree or be frank with eachother; this might be a cultural angle that hasn't been taken into account. A balance is certainly worth looking for sometimes as the 'rules' suggested are only looked at from the positive side; that seems a downside of this book.If I had to pick one 'rule' I really like it would be the simple, but oh so effective; ""Smile"". What bad can it cause? Overall, I'd still give this book 5 stars since even though its a little bit old, it's written in a great way, and let's be honest it's just a great positive book that hss some great insights and take aways to share about human relationships."
114,0671027034,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1042653-ashlie,5,"This is one of the most profound books to understand others behaviors and in teaching you skills to communicate effectively with others. A lot of the information is quite basic, but the examples and the message is quite profound. It has certainly made me stop and reevaluate my responses with others in the past few weeks when needing to work through difficult professional and personal situations. I think this book is a must read and will continue to be timeless classic book."
115,0671027034,http://goodreads.com/user/show/931082-arminius,4,"This book lays out a plan you can use to succeed in life.To make friends:Never criticize, show sincere appreciation, find out what others want and show them how to get it, become interested in them, smile at them, and know their name.To Influence:Praise and appreciate, ask questions instead of giving a direct order, give the other person a reputation to live up to, and make the other person happy about doing what you suggest. "
116,0671027034,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5610133-sologdin,1,"Douchey crap, overall. There should, that is, be no need for a text that argues one should actually listen to what others say or that sometimes criticism and complaints get on people's nerves.Other items, such as stating one's interlocutor's name with frequency, is just manifestly obsequious, and constantly smiling is plain oleaginous, a recipe for resting douchebag face."
117,0671027034,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7810515-una-tiers,5,This was a re-read. I'd forgotten it was about positive thinking and all the benefits it has.
118,0671027034,http://goodreads.com/user/show/13329837-rachel,5,"Everyone could benefit from reading this right now, when the world is more divided than ever.The main takeaway is to empathize with others and see things from their point of view.This is great, age-old advice for business and personal success. I’ve actually learned a lot of these techniques in my business classes. I admit I’m not the best at applying these principles, even though I’ve been familiar with them for a long time. This was an amazing refresher.Basically, you can’t create positive change in the world by attacking, criticizing or belittling others. Real change comes from finding empathy, compassion and common ground."
119,0671027034,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4992138-brittany,5,"This is truly and oldie but a goodie. It was written in the 1930s, but has been updated a few times and is still very readable.The title has more to mock in it than the rest of the book. It's not as corny or pedantic as that title makes it sound. Frankly, I think, ""How to Be a Decent Human Being in Ways You Know You Should Know About Already, but Don't"" would probably be better.I can see that if you truly take most of the advice in this book to heart, it will definitely have a positive influence on your life. I picked it up as a recommended reading for salespeople at work, but it goes way beyond that.The best part about the book is the fact that is mostly made up of fascinating anecdotes that Carnegie uses to illustrate the instructive points he's trying to make. How will talking about someone's kids help you make a sale? How will smiling at your wife over you cereal in the morning revolutionize your home life? You gotta read to find out.If you're like me, by the end of the book, you will have a whole list of people from your life who you wish you could force to read it."
120,0671027034,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9777942-joe,3,"Popular self-help books have the most misleading titles. Men are From Mars Women are from Venus, for example, promises a provocative thesis but proves a bland and repetitive read. By contrast, The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People enlightens the mind and tugs at the heart despite its dry label.And so it is with How to Win Friends and Influence People. The title suggests cloak-and-dagger tactics. 'Winning friends' implies competition; that if you don't win them someone else will! And 'influencing people' implies trickery; how to get them to do what's best for you, instead of what's best for themselves.Yet the content of the book proves warm and friendly. Tips include admitting fault when you've erred, showing sincere interest in other people and putting effort into learning their names. These ideas are supported by a series of heartwarming anecdotes from historical figures and ordinary people from Carnegie's day. The overall theme is that if you do right by others they'll do right by you.Toward the end, there's a suggestion or two that feel like psychological tricks. For example, there's a chapter on that old sales tactic of asking a lot of yes/no questions (Are you feeling well today? Have you used a product like ours before?) to get someone saying 'yes' so they'll be primed to say 'yes' once you start your sales-pitch. But these were exceptions to the rule and felt mild compared with what I was expecting.I have to wonder why the book wasn't named 'How to make friends and get along with people?' I guess the sneakier title helps attract competitive business types; roping them in with the promise of shady tactics before giving them flowers and sunshine. The title implies underhanded schemes but may be the most underhanded element of the book.Edited 5-21-2017"

I am friendlier and more influential now.I owe it all to Dale Carnegie, the failed actor from Missouri who discovered he had a knack for jazzing up people’s confidence. His foundational work, “How to Win Friends & Influence People,” blasted off in 1936, but for anyone who wants a pill-sized dose of encouragement, a “mini abridged edition” is being released this week to celebrate the book’s 80th year.You could call “How to Win Friends & Influence People” the grandfather of America’s self-help movement, except this grandfather is running circles around the rest of the industry, selling 300,000 copies last year. That was all news to me. Until recently, I had assumed Carnegie’s book was. . . .

122,0671027034,http://goodreads.com/user/show/38028659-madelyn,3,Well researched and documented but many of the tactics are too manipulative to be applied ethically.

I really appreciate the focus on kindness and positively, especially in avoiding letting appreciation become empty flattery. But like... at one point Carnegie randomly tells a “plain” acquaintance that she’s capable of greatness... and then sort of takes responsibility for changing her life? Because suddenly she was confident and into skin care and got married. I think men sometimes inflate how important a single compliment is to a woman.There is a lot of good information on how to use positive reinforcement and “make people want what you want” and a lot of great reminders for dealing with people tho!"
124,0671027034,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5875398-rebecca,3,"For a book to have been in print continuously for nearly 80 years, it must be doing something right. Many of the principles are still applicable, but Carnegie’s case studies struck me as hopelessly outdated as well as exclusively American (the Teapot Dome scandal?!). In teaching public speaking to thousands of businessmen, he developed pointed advice for how to get people to like you and do what you want. Examples: show genuine interest in others and draw out their stories, express sincere appreciation, and try to see things from the other person’s point of view. Although he insists this is not about trickery or flattery, I still sensed a hint of manipulation. A lot of what he says just seems like common sense, but he spells it out and puts it all together in a helpful, reader-friendly format. He also draws on anecdote and experience, much like contemporary self-help authors like Gretchen Rubin and Brené Brown."

126,0671027034,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1586355-chad-warner,4,"Despite its manipulative-sounding title, this book is about genuinely improving your social skills and winning people to your way of thinking. Although I generally agree with his principles, I think Carnegie makes following them sound too easy.Carnegie states that 15% of success is due to technical knowledge, and the other 85% is due to personality and leadership. He says that the #1 secret to success in dealing with people is having a sympathetic grasp of the other person’s point of view. He talks a lot about respecting and understanding other people, and quotes Ralph Waldo Emerson: ""Every man I meet is my superior in some way. In that, I learn of him.""Carnegie also talks a lot about praise; he says that praise is more effective than criticism for changing behavior and winning people over, so you should be “hearty in your approbation and lavish in your praise.”The book includes lessons from people like Jesus, Confucius, Buddha, Abraham Lincoln, Andrew Carnegie, Ben Franklin, John Rockefeller, Charles Schwab, and J.P. Morgan. Carnegie provides anecdotes of his own experiences, and those of the people who took his courses.I first read this book when co-workers suggested I improve my social skills, because I received many recommendations for this book. I re-read it because the lessons are so important and worthwhile.Below are the book's principles, along with my notes.Fundamental Techniques in Handling People1. Don't criticize, condemn, or complain.• Criticism is futile.2. Give honest and sincere appreciation.• Avoid flattery.3. Arouse in the other person an eager want.• Salespeople need to show how their products and services solve customers’ problems• Each party should gain; there must be mutual benefit.Six Ways to Make People Like You1. Become genuinely interested in other people.• “You can make more friends in two months by becoming more interested in other people than you can in two years by trying to get people interested in you”• Greet people with animation and enthusiasm. When someone calls on the phone, sound like you’re pleased.2. Smile.• A facial expression is more important than clothes.• Encouragement is more effective than punishment.• Don’t feel like smiling? Force yourself; feeling follows action.3. Remember that a man's Name is to him the sweetest and most important sound in any language.• To remember names, tie the name to a person’s features, use the person’s name in conversation, and write and memorize the name.4. Be a good listener. Encourage others to talk about themselves.• To be a good conversationalist, listen and pay attention.• To be interesting, be interested.5. Talk in the terms of the other man's interest.6. Make the other person feel important and do it sincerely.• The law of human conduct: always make the other person feel important.• Follow the Golden Rule: ""Do unto others as you would have them do unto you"".Twelve Ways to Win People to Your Way of Thinking1. Avoid arguments.• You can’t win an argument. Even if you win, you make your opponent feel inferior, so you lose.2. Show respect for the other person's opinions. Never tell someone they are wrong.3. If you're wrong, admit it quickly and emphatically.4. Begin in a friendly way.• ""'A drop of honey catches more flies than a gallon of gall.' So with men. If you would win a man to your cause, first convince him that you are his sincere friend."" – Lincoln5. Start with questions the other person will answer yes to.• The more yeses you can get at the outset, the more likely the person is to accept your ultimate proposal.6. Let the other person do the talking.• “If you want enemies, excel your friends; but if you want friends, let your friends excel you”.7. Let the other person feel the idea is his/hers.8. Try honestly to see things from the other person's point of view.9. Sympathize with the other person.10. Appeal to noble motives.• Treat people as if they are honest and fair.11. Dramatize your ideas.12. Throw down a challenge.• Use showmanship when selling or convincing.Be a Leader: How to Change People Without Giving Offense or Arousing Resentment1. Begin with praise and honest appreciation.• Use ""and"", not ""but"" as your conjunction between praise and criticism. Give praise, then say “and”, then give criticism/correction. Don’t give praise, say “but”, then criticize; it cheapens the praise.2. Call attention to other people's mistakes indirectly.3. Talk about your own mistakes first.4. Ask questions instead of directly giving orders.• People are more likely to accept an order if they had a part in the decision.5. Let the other person save face.6. Praise every improvement.• Give specific, sincere praise.• Praise is more effective at changing behavior than criticism.7. Give them a fine reputation to live up to.• Praise people, and they’ll feel obligated to live up to their good reputation.8. Encourage them by making their faults seem easy to correct.9. Make the other person happy about doing what you suggest.• Convince people by telling them specifically how they’ll personally benefit."

128,0671027034,http://goodreads.com/user/show/25883565-gator,4,"Dale Carnegie put together one heck of a book, I’ve already begun applying his techniques and advice to great success, with my wife, children and clients. My wife and I run a small business and sometimes clients can be a real pain in the behind, I used to sometimes sass back but after reading this life guide I’ve begun to sing a different tune, and the results speak for themselves, they are very positive. This book can be used as a life guide, whenever we run into issues dive into Carnegie’s book and you may just find what you’re looking for. I will definitely be recommending this and re reading in the future. Below are some of my favorite quotes. ""It is an old and true maxim that 'a drop of honey catches more flies than a gallon of gall.' So with men, if you would win a man to your cause, first convince him that you are his sincere friend.”-Abe Lincoln “All men have fears, but the brave put down their fears and go forward, sometimes to death, but always to victory” was the motto of the King’s Guard in Ancient Greece.  “You must develop a deep, driving desire to learn, a vigorous determination to increase your ability to deal with people” “Any fool can criticize, condemn, and complain — and most fools do.”“The deepest urge in human nature is the desire to be important … always make the other person feel important.” “Listening is one of the highest compliments we can pay anyone.”“There is only one way under the high heaven to get the best of an argument — and that is to avoid it. Avoid arguments as you would rattlesnakes and earthquakes.”“We are interested in others when they are interested in us.”“In our interpersonal relationships, we should never forget that all our associates are human begins and hunger for appreciation.”"
129,0671027034,http://goodreads.com/user/show/32557533-claire,1,"Overall I can see why some people value this book and go on to practice some of the ideas in their lives, whether personally or in business. There are some interesting examples and valuable thoughts, though I struggled to enjoy this read for a number of factors;- The writing itself wasn't particularly interesting or eloquent- The repetition was tiresome - whilst it was purposefully repeated, it made me feel bored and patronised- Not only were actual sentences repeated - the ideas and concepts in the book were all similar conveyed in a slightly different variant- Examples seem to form the main bulk of the content which made the book feel like a collection of anecdotesOn top of all of the above, I feel like anyone taking the advice in this book too seriously would end up being walked over; pleasing people, letting others take the credit, always being the bigger person, never complaining or criticising. As such, I feel like these ideas need to be taken with a large pinch of salt and maybe in this way one or two may become useful in small doses!"

As I was looking through my bookshelfs this afternoon, I found a very old copy of this classic. It must have come from my father's library as it is marked as a 77th printing - probably printed in the early 50's. I LOVE old books...The best tidbit to share from this book, is if you want people to like you, emulate a dog. Carnegie says: ""When you get within ten feet of him, he will begin to wag his tail. If you stop and pat him, he will almost jump out of his skin to show you how much he likes you. And you know that behind this show of affection on his part, there are no ulterior motives: he doesn't want to sell you any real estate, and he doesn't want to marry you."""

Basically, it argues that if you earnestly invest in other people, care about them in ways that few people do, you will have success throughout your life. As many others have already commented, the name of the book leads you to believe that it will be a load of sleaze. And indeed, the book's title did put me off it for quite a while. After all, this is a book about how to influence people. For the most part, I haven't found the part of the book where the sleaze comes out. One thing I am wondering about however is how the book will address dealing with horrible people: with the tyrants, emotion terrorists, or just plain whiners. More importantly--the first rule: not criticizing anyone. That seems like it would take quite a toll after a while. "

137,0671027034,http://goodreads.com/user/show/17442587-hannah,0,"Well, I thought a lot of things while reading this. I admit I wasn't too gung-ho about the book in the first place, and read it because it was assigned reading at work. I've heard about Carnegie plenty of times in the past and was pretty sure he wasn't the sort of author whose philosophies I'd give five stars to.However, I did try to read it objectively. Yes, he is a proponent of the ""social gospel"" of his time, but it also wasn't as bad as I thought it might be (I didn't end by throwing the book across the room. So far, Descartes remains alone in the dubious distinction of being lobbed at the further wall). I'll write my review in sections according to the structure of the book.Part one: Fundamental Techniques in Handling People1. Don't criticize, condemn, or complain.Point given: no one wants to be around a whiner. Sure, I agree with that.Application made: Lawbreakers, such as Al Capone and Two Gun Crowley, believed themselves to be good people at heart, even helpers of the community: ""people don't criticize themselves for anything, no matter how wrong it may be....Criticism is futile because it puts a person on the defensive and usually makes him strive to justify himself. Criticism is dangerous because it wounds a person's precious pride, hurts his sense of importance, and arouses resentment.""All right, wait a moment here. If my friends never voice any criticism, how would I know I'm wandering around with mud on my cheek? with a stain on my blouse? How am I to know that something is wrong? The last thing I wish to do is wander through life with the rest of the world afraid to let me know what I'm doing wrong. Constructive criticism is a good thing. As a music teacher, it is imperative that sometimes I get to say, ""No. Don't do it that way."" Why? Because certain positions can be harmful to the student's muscles and a hindrance to their progress. I compliment them on progress made and tell them how to make it better. It requires much less time and intellectual fishing than trying to influence them to deduct that the position may not be to their greatest advantage.2. Give honest and sincere appreciation.Point given: Everyone is glad to know they are valuable.Application: If you want people to do something for you, your best bet is to make them want to do it. Using an application of Sigmund Freud's and Dewey's theories that every man has ""the desire to be great"" or ""the desire to be important,"" Carnegie mentions the successes who have made themselves great--Lincoln and Dickens--and moves on to criminals. ""The average young criminal...is filled with ego...If you tell me how you get your feeling of importance, I'll tell you what you are. That determines your character,"" he finishes. Mr. Carnegie, I beg to differ. What puffs your chest out is not the sum total of who you are. That is only one symptom of the man as a whole. Are you trustworthy? Are you a friend to others? If you are either of those, or of any other things, and yet lack a real feeling of importance, it does not make you a nobody, as Carnegie more than implies. Finding your self-worth is not the only goal in life for a successful person.He continues the chapter by giving examples of people who have gone insane because of having unfulfilled dreams in life...well, nobody can quite say it for sure, of course, but this is his argument: ""...the other half of people who go insane apparently have nothing wrong with their brain cells...Why do these people go insane? [the doctor he spoke with said] Nobody knows for sure. But he did say that many people who go insane find in insanity a feeling of importance that they were unable to achieve in the world of reality."" His implication is clear that some people prefer to lose touch with reality than to lose touch with their dreams and their exalted view of themselves.What about flattery? We do get warned against flattery. ""Flattery is counterfeit, and like counterfeit money, it will eventually get you into trouble if you pass it to someone else...Flattery is telling the other person precisely what he thinks about himself."" But to give a person compliments in the hope of gaining one's own ends reeks of insincerity. The examples given show that a sloppy person will suddenly do a great job when given praise instead of critique. I'm sorry, but I've tried this. Contrary to Carnegie's opinion, people are not all going to do what you want if you convince them they are good people and they do a good job. All too many react with pleasure at the status quo and see absolutely no need to do better. So I will add that, yes, it's wonderful to appreciate others. But it is wrong and often cruel to them to make them think they are perfect when they are doing a sloppy job that may cause danger to others (such as breaking health laws or leaving messes in walkways.) Carnegie denies the implication that making someone want what you want by telling them how good they are is manipulation, but in most of the examples it slides dangerously close to that line.3. Arouse in the other person an eager want.Point given: People's acts are entirely driven by their wants.Application: To impose what we want, we have to convince others that they want what we want more than they want what they want...that, in fact, what we want is even better than what they wanted in the first place. While I'm all for positive inspiration, this message has a sordid underbelly.Carnegie believes that all actions have one root: desire. The only way to change a person's actions is to change their desires. He does not believe that people will gladly follow rules unless there is something in it for them. In the previous chapter, he posited that those appreciated will do a great job merely because someone's compliment makes them wish to do well. Yes, I do agree that continual criticism will sap a person's motivations, but praise all the time is not necessarily a motivator. According to Carnegie's philosophy, there are no people who are lazy for the joy of being lazy. Or, if there are such people, all they need is someone to come along and affirm them and present to them a good reason to get up and do a good job.One of the examples given is of a child who refused to eat his vegetables despite being scolded by his parents. He had an issue with a neighborhood bully, and the father decided to use the bully as the force behind his argument. ""When his father explained that the boy would be able to wallop the daylights out of the bigger kid someday if he would only eat the things his mother wanted him to eat--when his father promised him that--there was no longer any problem of dietetics."" I'm sorry, but no parent can ever make a promise like that, because there is no guarantee of its being fulfilled. The boy may have grown to 5'6"" and the bully to 6'5"" and no vegetables in the world could reverse the sizes. Then where would the father's promise be? He has broken a promise to his child that he had no right to make in the first place. The father's persuasion becomes a lie. The two pages of the child's story show that they gained mastery over the child by ""making him feel important."" Another child eats her cereal because by preparing it she ""achieved a feeling of importance; she had found in making the cereal an avenue of self-expression.""The danger of Carnegie's philosophy in this point is that one's self-esteem becomes the generator of their actions. If their self-esteem fails, apparently they do a horrible job and are uninterested in good ideas. Well, that doesn't bear out in real life. Some people who have damaged self-worth are hard workers, and some with excellent self-worth are sloppy and lazy. But Carnegie's chapter ends with a quote: ""William Winter once remarked that 'self-expression is the dominant necessity of human nature.'"" Well, if we are so busy fueling the self-expression of all those around us, where are we? We see a goal and coax others to want that goal, but ourselves are left behind in the dust of their ascent.Part Two. Six Ways to Make People Like You(well, I feel quarrelsome just reading that. If everyone likes you there's something wrong with your self-expression, because in being all things to all people there is no room left to be yourself.)1. Become genuinely interested in other people.All well and good, except he makes the cynical point ""People are not interested in you. They are not interested in me. They are interested in themselves--morning, noon, and after dinner."" So we are to figure out some way to become genuinely interested in others, to be silent when they talk, to encourage them always to express themselves around us.2. SmilePlease do!3. Remember that a person's name is to that person the sweetest and most important sound in any language.Helpful, but not the ""sweetest sound"" he claims. It's nice to remember names, but that honestly doesn't influence me much. I wonder if other people are more influenced by this, and I'm just some sort of anomaly? When I'm at work and someone comes through my checkout line, if it's a stranger I don't know, I'm not at all tempted to give them a bigger drink than they paid for because they say my name. Really, that's creepy...being nice to me doesn't entitle them to more of the company's food than they paid for, anyway. It isn't my food to give away.4. Be a good listener. Encourage others to talk about themselves.This one's easy...Other people's lives are just interesting. A side effect of being a hopeful novelist.5. Talk in terms of other people's interests.This creeps back towards flattery and worse. ""You want me to be your friend because I can do thus and so for you."" Isn't that just asking others to exploit your talents? I don't want friends who want me only on the basis of what I can do for them. When seeking a job, yes. But not when seeking friends.6. Make the other person feel important--and do it sincerely.This reminded me of an Andy Griffith show I saw recently on Netflix. Aunt Bee makes horrible pickles, but Andy and Barney are determined to not make her feel bad. After going to great and hilarious lengths of deception, they are left doomed to eat a double batch of bad pickles. They were sincere in their desire to please Aunt Bee because they could recognize she'd worked hard on those pickles. But it didn't rebound in their favor. They were insincere and deceptive in their effort to reward her for her work.Making others feel important isn't going to automatically result in a handout of exactly what you wanted. This action, done in order to gain a goal (as shown in the examples), is risky indeed, and oftentimes even deceptive.....out of time....more tomorrow and later on my blog...including ""Carnegie's book in light of Scripture."""
138,0671027034,http://goodreads.com/user/show/16996132-abeer-abdullah,2,"Working with a wide variety of people in my particular function in my company has left me seeking guidance on how to approach people, how to influence them, guide them and understand them. This is a great challenge for me for many reasons, for one thing I am over a decade younger than most people I am trying to influence, I am a 24 years old Arab girl who studied poetry who is trying to give council to and work with 40 year old Arab male engineers. Who, rightfully, may see it as ridiculous and be dismissive. It feels like a genuinely impossible task. Consequently, I am now trying to read as much about effective communication as possible, but it seems that a lot of the so called classics and best sellers are just incredibly shallow, and without true substance. This book tries to put forward the idea that empathy is at the core of winning friends and influencing people. As true as that is, it is not something revolutionary for us now in the early 21st century. Harvard Business Review's collection of books on various topics such as Emotional Intelligence and Communication for me have proved much more effective. They give detailed analysis, up to date studies, and real life examples. "
139,0671027034,http://goodreads.com/user/show/54266751-jennifer,4,"I really enjoyed this book. The advice is timeless and is as relevant today as it was eaight year's ago. I stumbled across How to Win Friends & Influence People while looking for something on change management. I wanted a book that explored the human component and not the process piece of change management.Dale Carnegie illustrates each lesson, or principle, by using both professional and personal examples. I love Carnegie’s writing style and use of words, which had a calming effect and transported me back in time. An informative and enjoyable read."
140,0671027034,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5789353-giselle,4,"Great advice, which is pretty much a given for any business person. There’s a lot of name dropping in almost every chapter. And he provides you with a ton of examples for each part. A quick and easy read if you’re looking at ways to understand people more."
141,0671027034,http://goodreads.com/user/show/88366321-jeffrey-egolf,0,I think I should wait for the book club meeting to post this review.
142,0671027034,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10471943-igor-ljubuncic,2,"So ... I am opposed to self-help books. I don't believe in self-help books. I think they are paradoxical in that people who read them expect a miraculous solution to an internal problem and those who don't read them probably don't need them in the first place. Moreover, most of these fall into a very typical template - written for the US audience and revolving around some well-proven formulas with a significant monetary incentive.The only reason I decided to try to read this book was because a valued colleague recommended it, as it has had a profound impact on his life. Disassociating his experience from the novel I set about reading, and soon I realized, it is impossible to not judge this book through the eyes of my colleague and the sum of his life's doings. Which is why the message that worked so successfully for him does not work for me at all. Because the way we have lived our lives and approach our problems are completely different, and so is the depth, scope, magnitude, and variety of our problems.I munched through three chapters before giving up. The material is repetitive, with one example after another rehashing the one-liner message summarized at the end of each chapter. Almost like whoever is reading needs convincing that what is being told is the way to do it. And perhaps it is, but a bullet-list would work equally well, if the reader is willing to embrace the message. So maybe the book is all about convincing people into trying to change their lifestyle rather than actually learning some helpful tips, if that's actually possible, on how to manage life situations.I like the concept, the ideas are noble - and valid - but the delivery mechanism completely fails me. I realize that I'm 100% not the intended audience, and that the message is designed to instill introspection, regret, remorse, enlightenment, and illumination, which I failed to grasp. Not because I'm cold-hearted, obstinate, stubborn, or opposed to change, simply because I do not need convincing 100x over that I should do XYZ. Be considerate to people and compliment them. Yes. Agreed. No need to repeat that on 10 pages of text with 27 examples. One is enough.What is missing for me is context. There isn't enough of it - so you know that people did something and that it worked for them, but not the WHY. And that's more important than actions, because anyone can be lucky, or look back and justify their successes by creating a template that fits the bill. Because let's face it, people don't write books on how to be successful BEFORE they become successful. Hindsight is camp.All in all, there's nothing wrong with the book. But it can be 99% shorter, the message can be summed up on one page, and most importantly, the book is there to reaffirm people's needs in doing things that they have already set about doing, or they are facing an existential crisis and grasping for straws of hope. In other words, if you're not one of the two, or you don't believe books can help you change, which, let's face it, they can't, unless you're already set on making that happen, and the fact you consider buying this book is the VERY step needed to change, then you will not enjoy it. Like hypnosis. It takes a willing patient. Otherwise, you can spend your time just being nice to people than reading how other people succeeded by doing things that worked for them, and you hope to be able to achieve one day, the same illusive way glamor and status are the coveted jewels of celebrities.How to win friends and influence people?Be nice. Listen to others. Try not to be a c**t. That's it.Now go back to your life and enjoy the passive-aggressive PC nonsense at your workplace :)Igor"
143,0671027034,http://goodreads.com/user/show/108599067-wout-biesheuvel,5,"The book is quite a nice read; short fun anecdotes based around some of the insights the writer is willing to share. I'd suggest taking his advice with a grain of salt but there certainly are things that I know that work, and that are great when applied. Some other things give me this weird feeling of 'fake superficiality' and it decribes a world where people can't disagree or be frank with eachother; this might be a cultural angle that hasn't been taken into account. A balance is certainly worth looking for sometimes as the 'rules' suggested are only looked at from the positive side; that seems a downside of this book.If I had to pick one 'rule' I really like it would be the simple, but oh so effective; ""Smile"". What bad can it cause? Overall, I'd still give this book 5 stars since even though its a little bit old, it's written in a great way, and let's be honest it's just a great positive book that hss some great insights and take aways to share about human relationships."
144,0671027034,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1042653-ashlie,5,"This is one of the most profound books to understand others behaviors and in teaching you skills to communicate effectively with others. A lot of the information is quite basic, but the examples and the message is quite profound. It has certainly made me stop and reevaluate my responses with others in the past few weeks when needing to work through difficult professional and personal situations. I think this book is a must read and will continue to be timeless classic book."
145,0671027034,http://goodreads.com/user/show/931082-arminius,4,"This book lays out a plan you can use to succeed in life.To make friends:Never criticize, show sincere appreciation, find out what others want and show them how to get it, become interested in them, smile at them, and know their name.To Influence:Praise and appreciate, ask questions instead of giving a direct order, give the other person a reputation to live up to, and make the other person happy about doing what you suggest. "
146,0671027034,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5610133-sologdin,1,"Douchey crap, overall. There should, that is, be no need for a text that argues one should actually listen to what others say or that sometimes criticism and complaints get on people's nerves.Other items, such as stating one's interlocutor's name with frequency, is just manifestly obsequious, and constantly smiling is plain oleaginous, a recipe for resting douchebag face."
147,0671027034,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7810515-una-tiers,5,This was a re-read. I'd forgotten it was about positive thinking and all the benefits it has.
148,0671027034,http://goodreads.com/user/show/13329837-rachel,5,"Everyone could benefit from reading this right now, when the world is more divided than ever.The main takeaway is to empathize with others and see things from their point of view.This is great, age-old advice for business and personal success. I’ve actually learned a lot of these techniques in my business classes. I admit I’m not the best at applying these principles, even though I’ve been familiar with them for a long time. This was an amazing refresher.Basically, you can’t create positive change in the world by attacking, criticizing or belittling others. Real change comes from finding empathy, compassion and common ground."
149,0671027034,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4992138-brittany,5,"This is truly and oldie but a goodie. It was written in the 1930s, but has been updated a few times and is still very readable.The title has more to mock in it than the rest of the book. It's not as corny or pedantic as that title makes it sound. Frankly, I think, ""How to Be a Decent Human Being in Ways You Know You Should Know About Already, but Don't"" would probably be better.I can see that if you truly take most of the advice in this book to heart, it will definitely have a positive influence on your life. I picked it up as a recommended reading for salespeople at work, but it goes way beyond that.The best part about the book is the fact that is mostly made up of fascinating anecdotes that Carnegie uses to illustrate the instructive points he's trying to make. How will talking about someone's kids help you make a sale? How will smiling at your wife over you cereal in the morning revolutionize your home life? You gotta read to find out.If you're like me, by the end of the book, you will have a whole list of people from your life who you wish you could force to read it."
150,0671027034,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9777942-joe,3,"Popular self-help books have the most misleading titles. Men are From Mars Women are from Venus, for example, promises a provocative thesis but proves a bland and repetitive read. By contrast, The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People enlightens the mind and tugs at the heart despite its dry label.And so it is with How to Win Friends and Influence People. The title suggests cloak-and-dagger tactics. 'Winning friends' implies competition; that if you don't win them someone else will! And 'influencing people' implies trickery; how to get them to do what's best for you, instead of what's best for themselves.Yet the content of the book proves warm and friendly. Tips include admitting fault when you've erred, showing sincere interest in other people and putting effort into learning their names. These ideas are supported by a series of heartwarming anecdotes from historical figures and ordinary people from Carnegie's day. The overall theme is that if you do right by others they'll do right by you.Toward the end, there's a suggestion or two that feel like psychological tricks. For example, there's a chapter on that old sales tactic of asking a lot of yes/no questions (Are you feeling well today? Have you used a product like ours before?) to get someone saying 'yes' so they'll be primed to say 'yes' once you start your sales-pitch. But these were exceptions to the rule and felt mild compared with what I was expecting.I have to wonder why the book wasn't named 'How to make friends and get along with people?' I guess the sneakier title helps attract competitive business types; roping them in with the promise of shady tactics before giving them flowers and sunshine. The title implies underhanded schemes but may be the most underhanded element of the book.Edited 5-21-2017"

I am friendlier and more influential now.I owe it all to Dale Carnegie, the failed actor from Missouri who discovered he had a knack for jazzing up people’s confidence. His foundational work, “How to Win Friends & Influence People,” blasted off in 1936, but for anyone who wants a pill-sized dose of encouragement, a “mini abridged edition” is being released this week to celebrate the book’s 80th year.You could call “How to Win Friends & Influence People” the grandfather of America’s self-help movement, except this grandfather is running circles around the rest of the industry, selling 300,000 copies last year. That was all news to me. Until recently, I had assumed Carnegie’s book was. . . .

I really appreciate the focus on kindness and positively, especially in avoiding letting appreciation become empty flattery. But like... at one point Carnegie randomly tells a “plain” acquaintance that she’s capable of greatness... and then sort of takes responsibility for changing her life? Because suddenly she was confident and into skin care and got married. I think men sometimes inflate how important a single compliment is to a woman.There is a lot of good information on how to use positive reinforcement and “make people want what you want” and a lot of great reminders for dealing with people tho!"
154,0671027034,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5875398-rebecca,3,"For a book to have been in print continuously for nearly 80 years, it must be doing something right. Many of the principles are still applicable, but Carnegie’s case studies struck me as hopelessly outdated as well as exclusively American (the Teapot Dome scandal?!). In teaching public speaking to thousands of businessmen, he developed pointed advice for how to get people to like you and do what you want. Examples: show genuine interest in others and draw out their stories, express sincere appreciation, and try to see things from the other person’s point of view. Although he insists this is not about trickery or flattery, I still sensed a hint of manipulation. A lot of what he says just seems like common sense, but he spells it out and puts it all together in a helpful, reader-friendly format. He also draws on anecdote and experience, much like contemporary self-help authors like Gretchen Rubin and Brené Brown."

156,0671027034,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1586355-chad-warner,4,"Despite its manipulative-sounding title, this book is about genuinely improving your social skills and winning people to your way of thinking. Although I generally agree with his principles, I think Carnegie makes following them sound too easy.Carnegie states that 15% of success is due to technical knowledge, and the other 85% is due to personality and leadership. He says that the #1 secret to success in dealing with people is having a sympathetic grasp of the other person’s point of view. He talks a lot about respecting and understanding other people, and quotes Ralph Waldo Emerson: ""Every man I meet is my superior in some way. In that, I learn of him.""Carnegie also talks a lot about praise; he says that praise is more effective than criticism for changing behavior and winning people over, so you should be “hearty in your approbation and lavish in your praise.”The book includes lessons from people like Jesus, Confucius, Buddha, Abraham Lincoln, Andrew Carnegie, Ben Franklin, John Rockefeller, Charles Schwab, and J.P. Morgan. Carnegie provides anecdotes of his own experiences, and those of the people who took his courses.I first read this book when co-workers suggested I improve my social skills, because I received many recommendations for this book. I re-read it because the lessons are so important and worthwhile.Below are the book's principles, along with my notes.Fundamental Techniques in Handling People1. Don't criticize, condemn, or complain.• Criticism is futile.2. Give honest and sincere appreciation.• Avoid flattery.3. Arouse in the other person an eager want.• Salespeople need to show how their products and services solve customers’ problems• Each party should gain; there must be mutual benefit.Six Ways to Make People Like You1.

Force yourself; feeling follows action.3. Remember that a man's Name is to him the sweetest and most important sound in any language.• To remember names, tie the name to a person’s features, use the person’s name in conversation, and write and memorize the name.4. Be a good listener. Encourage others to talk about themselves.• To be a good conversationalist, listen and pay attention.• To be interesting, be interested.5.

158,0671027034,http://goodreads.com/user/show/25883565-gator,4,"Dale Carnegie put together one heck of a book, I’ve already begun applying his techniques and advice to great success, with my wife, children and clients. My wife and I run a small business and sometimes clients can be a real pain in the behind, I used to sometimes sass back but after reading this life guide I’ve begun to sing a different tune, and the results speak for themselves, they are very positive. This book can be used as a life guide, whenever we run into issues dive into Carnegie’s book and you may just find what you’re looking for. I will definitely be recommending this and re reading in the future. Below are some of my favorite quotes. ""It is an old and true maxim that 'a drop of honey catches more flies than a gallon of gall.' So with men, if you would win a man to your cause, first convince him that you are his sincere friend.”-Abe Lincoln “All men have fears, but the brave put down their fears and go forward, sometimes to death, but always to victory” was the motto of the King’s Guard in Ancient Greece.  “You must develop a deep, driving desire to learn, a vigorous determination to increase your ability to deal with people” “Any fool can criticize, condemn, and complain — and most fools do.”“The deepest urge in human nature is the desire to be important … always make the other person feel important.” “Listening is one of the highest compliments we can pay anyone.”“There is only one way under the high heaven to get the best of an argument — and that is to avoid it. Avoid arguments as you would rattlesnakes and earthquakes.”“We are interested in others when they are interested in us.”“In our interpersonal relationships, we should never forget that all our associates are human begins and hunger for appreciation.”"

There are some interesting examples and valuable thoughts, though I struggled to enjoy this read for a number of factors;- The writing itself wasn't particularly interesting or eloquent- The repetition was tiresome - whilst it was purposefully repeated, it made me feel bored and patronised- Not only were actual sentences repeated - the ideas and concepts in the book were all similar conveyed in a slightly different variant- Examples seem to form the main bulk of the content which made the book feel like a collection of anecdotesOn top of all of the above, I feel like anyone taking the advice in this book too seriously would end up being walked over; pleasing people, letting others take the credit, always being the bigger person, never complaining or criticising. As such, I feel like these ideas need to be taken with a large pinch of salt and maybe in this way one or two may become useful in small doses!"

As I was looking through my bookshelfs this afternoon, I found a very old copy of this classic. It must have come from my father's library as it is marked as a 77th printing - probably printed in the early 50's. I LOVE old books...The best tidbit to share from this book, is if you want people to like you, emulate a dog. Carnegie says: ""When you get within ten feet of him, he will begin to wag his tail. If you stop and pat him, he will almost jump out of his skin to show you how much he likes you. And you know that behind this show of affection on his part, there are no ulterior motives: he doesn't want to sell you any real estate, and he doesn't want to marry you."""

Basically, it argues that if you earnestly invest in other people, care about them in ways that few people do, you will have success throughout your life. As many others have already commented, the name of the book leads you to believe that it will be a load of sleaze. And indeed, the book's title did put me off it for quite a while. After all, this is a book about how to influence people. For the most part, I haven't found the part of the book where the sleaze comes out. One thing I am wondering about however is how the book will address dealing with horrible people: with the tyrants, emotion terrorists, or just plain whiners. More importantly--the first rule: not criticizing anyone. That seems like it would take quite a toll after a while. "

167,0671027034,http://goodreads.com/user/show/17442587-hannah,0,"Well, I thought a lot of things while reading this. I admit I wasn't too gung-ho about the book in the first place, and read it because it was assigned reading at work. I've heard about Carnegie plenty of times in the past and was pretty sure he wasn't the sort of author whose philosophies I'd give five stars to.However, I did try to read it objectively. Yes, he is a proponent of the ""social gospel"" of his time, but it also wasn't as bad as I thought it might be (I didn't end by throwing the book across the room. So far, Descartes remains alone in the dubious distinction of being lobbed at the further wall). I'll write my review in sections according to the structure of the book.Part one: Fundamental Techniques in Handling People1. Don't criticize, condemn, or complain.Point given: no one wants to be around a whiner. Sure, I agree with that.Application made: Lawbreakers, such as Al Capone and Two Gun Crowley, believed themselves to be good people at heart, even helpers of the community: ""people don't criticize themselves for anything, no matter how wrong it may be....Criticism is futile because it puts a person on the defensive and usually makes him strive to justify himself. Criticism is dangerous because it wounds a person's precious pride, hurts his sense of importance, and arouses resentment.""All right, wait a moment here. If my friends never voice any criticism, how would I know I'm wandering around with mud on my cheek? with a stain on my blouse? How am I to know that something is wrong? The last thing I wish to do is wander through life with the rest of the world afraid to let me know what I'm doing wrong. Constructive criticism is a good thing. As a music teacher, it is imperative that sometimes I get to say, ""No. Don't do it that way."" Why? Because certain positions can be harmful to the student's muscles and a hindrance to their progress. I compliment them on progress made and tell them how to make it better. It requires much less time and intellectual fishing than trying to influence them to deduct that the position may not be to their greatest advantage.2. Give honest and sincere appreciation.Point given: Everyone is glad to know they are valuable.Application: If you want people to do something for you, your best bet is to make them want to do it. Using an application of Sigmund Freud's and Dewey's theories that every man has ""the desire to be great"" or ""the desire to be important,"" Carnegie mentions the successes who have made themselves great--Lincoln and Dickens--and moves on to criminals. ""The average young criminal...is filled with ego...If you tell me how you get your feeling of importance, I'll tell you what you are. That determines your character,"" he finishes. Mr. Carnegie, I beg to differ. What puffs your chest out is not the sum total of who you are. That is only one symptom of the man as a whole. Are you trustworthy? Are you a friend to others? If you are either of those, or of any other things, and yet lack a real feeling of importance, it does not make you a nobody, as Carnegie more than implies. Finding your self-worth is not the only goal in life for a successful person.He continues the chapter by giving examples of people who have gone insane because of having unfulfilled dreams in life...well, nobody can quite say it for sure, of course, but this is his argument: ""...the other half of people who go insane apparently have nothing wrong with their brain cells...Why do these people go insane? [the doctor he spoke with said] Nobody knows for sure. But he did say that many people who go insane find in insanity a feeling of importance that they were unable to achieve in the world of reality."" His implication is clear that some people prefer to lose touch with reality than to lose touch with their dreams and their exalted view of themselves.What about flattery? We do get warned against flattery. ""Flattery is counterfeit, and like counterfeit money, it will eventually get you into trouble if you pass it to someone else...Flattery is telling the other person precisely what he thinks about himself."" But to give a person compliments in the hope of gaining one's own ends reeks of insincerity. The examples given show that a sloppy person will suddenly do a great job when given praise instead of critique. I'm sorry, but I've tried this. Contrary to Carnegie's opinion, people are not all going to do what you want if you convince them they are good people and they do a good job. All too many react with pleasure at the status quo and see absolutely no need to do better. So I will add that, yes, it's wonderful to appreciate others. But it is wrong and often cruel to them to make them think they are perfect when they are doing a sloppy job that may cause danger to others (such as breaking health laws or leaving messes in walkways.) Carnegie denies the implication that making someone want what you want by telling them how good they are is manipulation, but in most of the examples it slides dangerously close to that line.3. Arouse in the other person an eager want.Point given: People's acts are entirely driven by their wants.Application: To impose what we want, we have to convince others that they want what we want more than they want what they want...that, in fact, what we want is even better than what they wanted in the first place. While I'm all for positive inspiration, this message has a sordid underbelly.Carnegie believes that all actions have one root: desire. The only way to change a person's actions is to change their desires. He does not believe that people will gladly follow rules unless there is something in it for them. In the previous chapter, he posited that those appreciated will do a great job merely because someone's compliment makes them wish to do well. Yes, I do agree that continual criticism will sap a person's motivations, but praise all the time is not necessarily a motivator. According to Carnegie's philosophy, there are no people who are lazy for the joy of being lazy. Or, if there are such people, all they need is someone to come along and affirm them and present to them a good reason to get up and do a good job.One of the examples given is of a child who refused to eat his vegetables despite being scolded by his parents. He had an issue with a neighborhood bully, and the father decided to use the bully as the force behind his argument. ""When his father explained that the boy would be able to wallop the daylights out of the bigger kid someday if he would only eat the things his mother wanted him to eat--when his father promised him that--there was no longer any problem of dietetics."" I'm sorry, but no parent can ever make a promise like that, because there is no guarantee of its being fulfilled. The boy may have grown to 5'6"" and the bully to 6'5"" and no vegetables in the world could reverse the sizes. Then where would the father's promise be? He has broken a promise to his child that he had no right to make in the first place. The father's persuasion becomes a lie. The two pages of the child's story show that they gained mastery over the child by ""making him feel important."" Another child eats her cereal because by preparing it she ""achieved a feeling of importance; she had found in making the cereal an avenue of self-expression.""The danger of Carnegie's philosophy in this point is that one's self-esteem becomes the generator of their actions. If their self-esteem fails, apparently they do a horrible job and are uninterested in good ideas. Well, that doesn't bear out in real life. Some people who have damaged self-worth are hard workers, and some with excellent self-worth are sloppy and lazy. But Carnegie's chapter ends with a quote: ""William Winter once remarked that 'self-expression is the dominant necessity of human nature.'"" Well, if we are so busy fueling the self-expression of all those around us, where are we? We see a goal and coax others to want that goal, but ourselves are left behind in the dust of their ascent.Part Two. Six Ways to Make People Like You(well, I feel quarrelsome just reading that. If everyone likes you there's something wrong with your self-expression, because in being all things to all people there is no room left to be yourself.)1. Become genuinely interested in other people.All well and good, except he makes the cynical point ""People are not interested in you. They are not interested in me. They are interested in themselves--morning, noon, and after dinner."" So we are to figure out some way to become genuinely interested in others, to be silent when they talk, to encourage them always to express themselves around us.2. SmilePlease do!3. Remember that a person's name is to that person the sweetest and most important sound in any language.Helpful, but not the ""sweetest sound"" he claims. It's nice to remember names, but that honestly doesn't influence me much. I wonder if other people are more influenced by this, and I'm just some sort of anomaly? When I'm at work and someone comes through my checkout line, if it's a stranger I don't know, I'm not at all tempted to give them a bigger drink than they paid for because they say my name. Really, that's creepy...being nice to me doesn't entitle them to more of the company's food than they paid for, anyway. It isn't my food to give away.4. Be a good listener. Encourage others to talk about themselves.This one's easy...Other people's lives are just interesting. A side effect of being a hopeful novelist.5. Talk in terms of other people's interests.This creeps back towards flattery and worse. ""You want me to be your friend because I can do thus and so for you."" Isn't that just asking others to exploit your talents? I don't want friends who want me only on the basis of what I can do for them. When seeking a job, yes. But not when seeking friends.6. Make the other person feel important--and do it sincerely.This reminded me of an Andy Griffith show I saw recently on Netflix. Aunt Bee makes horrible pickles, but Andy and Barney are determined to not make her feel bad. After going to great and hilarious lengths of deception, they are left doomed to eat a double batch of bad pickles. They were sincere in their desire to please Aunt Bee because they could recognize she'd worked hard on those pickles. But it didn't rebound in their favor. They were insincere and deceptive in their effort to reward her for her work.Making others feel important isn't going to automatically result in a handout of exactly what you wanted. This action, done in order to gain a goal (as shown in the examples), is risky indeed, and oftentimes even deceptive.....out of time....more tomorrow and later on my blog...including ""Carnegie's book in light of Scripture."""
168,0671027034,http://goodreads.com/user/show/16996132-abeer-abdullah,2,"Working with a wide variety of people in my particular function in my company has left me seeking guidance on how to approach people, how to influence them, guide them and understand them. This is a great challenge for me for many reasons, for one thing I am over a decade younger than most people I am trying to influence, I am a 24 years old Arab girl who studied poetry who is trying to give council to and work with 40 year old Arab male engineers. Who, rightfully, may see it as ridiculous and be dismissive. It feels like a genuinely impossible task. Consequently, I am now trying to read as much about effective communication as possible, but it seems that a lot of the so called classics and best sellers are just incredibly shallow, and without true substance. This book tries to put forward the idea that empathy is at the core of winning friends and influencing people. As true as that is, it is not something revolutionary for us now in the early 21st century. Harvard Business Review's collection of books on various topics such as Emotional Intelligence and Communication for me have proved much more effective. They give detailed analysis, up to date studies, and real life examples. "
169,0671027034,http://goodreads.com/user/show/54266751-jennifer,4,"I really enjoyed this book. The advice is timeless and is as relevant today as it was eaight year's ago. I stumbled across How to Win Friends & Influence People while looking for something on change management. I wanted a book that explored the human component and not the process piece of change management.Dale Carnegie illustrates each lesson, or principle, by using both professional and personal examples. I love Carnegie’s writing style and use of words, which had a calming effect and transported me back in time. An informative and enjoyable read."
170,0671027034,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5789353-giselle,4,"Great advice, which is pretty much a given for any business person. There’s a lot of name dropping in almost every chapter. And he provides you with a ton of examples for each part. A quick and easy read if you’re looking at ways to understand people more."

172,0671027034,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10471943-igor-ljubuncic,2,"So ... I am opposed to self-help books. I don't believe in self-help books. I think they are paradoxical in that people who read them expect a miraculous solution to an internal problem and those who don't read them probably don't need them in the first place. Moreover, most of these fall into a very typical template - written for the US audience and revolving around some well-proven formulas with a significant monetary incentive.The only reason I decided to try to read this book was because a valued colleague recommended it, as it has had a profound impact on his life. Disassociating his experience from the novel I set about reading, and soon I realized, it is impossible to not judge this book through the eyes of my colleague and the sum of his life's doings. Which is why the message that worked so successfully for him does not work for me at all. Because the way we have lived our lives and approach our problems are completely different, and so is the depth, scope, magnitude, and variety of our problems.I munched through three chapters before giving up. The material is repetitive, with one example after another rehashing the one-liner message summarized at the end of each chapter. Almost like whoever is reading needs convincing that what is being told is the way to do it. And perhaps it is, but a bullet-list would work equally well, if the reader is willing to embrace the message. So maybe the book is all about convincing people into trying to change their lifestyle rather than actually learning some helpful tips, if that's actually possible, on how to manage life situations.I like the concept, the ideas are noble - and valid - but the delivery mechanism completely fails me. I realize that I'm 100% not the intended audience, and that the message is designed to instill introspection, regret, remorse, enlightenment, and illumination, which I failed to grasp. Not because I'm cold-hearted, obstinate, stubborn, or opposed to change, simply because I do not need convincing 100x over that I should do XYZ. Be considerate to people and compliment them. Yes. Agreed. No need to repeat that on 10 pages of text with 27 examples. One is enough.What is missing for me is context. There isn't enough of it - so you know that people did something and that it worked for them, but not the WHY. And that's more important than actions, because anyone can be lucky, or look back and justify their successes by creating a template that fits the bill. Because let's face it, people don't write books on how to be successful BEFORE they become successful. Hindsight is camp.All in all, there's nothing wrong with the book. But it can be 99% shorter, the message can be summed up on one page, and most importantly, the book is there to reaffirm people's needs in doing things that they have already set about doing, or they are facing an existential crisis and grasping for straws of hope. In other words, if you're not one of the two, or you don't believe books can help you change, which, let's face it, they can't, unless you're already set on making that happen, and the fact you consider buying this book is the VERY step needed to change, then you will not enjoy it. Like hypnosis. It takes a willing patient. Otherwise, you can spend your time just being nice to people than reading how other people succeeded by doing things that worked for them, and you hope to be able to achieve one day, the same illusive way glamor and status are the coveted jewels of celebrities.How to win friends and influence people?Be nice. Listen to others. Try not to be a c**t. That's it.Now go back to your life and enjoy the passive-aggressive PC nonsense at your workplace :)Igor"
173,0671027034,http://goodreads.com/user/show/108599067-wout-biesheuvel,5,"The book is quite a nice read; short fun anecdotes based around some of the insights the writer is willing to share. I'd suggest taking his advice with a grain of salt but there certainly are things that I know that work, and that are great when applied. Some other things give me this weird feeling of 'fake superficiality' and it decribes a world where people can't disagree or be frank with eachother; this might be a cultural angle that hasn't been taken into account. A balance is certainly worth looking for sometimes as the 'rules' suggested are only looked at from the positive side; that seems a downside of this book.If I had to pick one 'rule' I really like it would be the simple, but oh so effective; ""Smile"". What bad can it cause? Overall, I'd still give this book 5 stars since even though its a little bit old, it's written in a great way, and let's be honest it's just a great positive book that hss some great insights and take aways to share about human relationships."
174,0671027034,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1042653-ashlie,5,"This is one of the most profound books to understand others behaviors and in teaching you skills to communicate effectively with others. A lot of the information is quite basic, but the examples and the message is quite profound. It has certainly made me stop and reevaluate my responses with others in the past few weeks when needing to work through difficult professional and personal situations. I think this book is a must read and will continue to be timeless classic book."
175,0671027034,http://goodreads.com/user/show/931082-arminius,4,"This book lays out a plan you can use to succeed in life.To make friends:Never criticize, show sincere appreciation, find out what others want and show them how to get it, become interested in them, smile at them, and know their name.To Influence:Praise and appreciate, ask questions instead of giving a direct order, give the other person a reputation to live up to, and make the other person happy about doing what you suggest.

176,0671027034,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5610133-sologdin,1,"Douchey crap, overall. There should, that is, be no need for a text that argues one should actually listen to what others say or that sometimes criticism and complaints get on people's nerves.Other items, such as stating one's interlocutor's name with frequency, is just manifestly obsequious, and constantly smiling is plain oleaginous, a recipe for resting douchebag face."
177,0671027034,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7810515-una-tiers,5,This was a re-read. I'd forgotten it was about positive thinking and all the benefits it has.

I’ve actually learned a lot of these techniques in my business classes. I admit I’m not the best at applying these principles, even though I’ve been familiar with them for a long time. This was an amazing refresher.Basically, you can’t create positive change in the world by attacking, criticizing or belittling others. Real change comes from finding empathy, compassion and common ground."
179,0671027034,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4992138-brittany,5,"This is truly and oldie but a goodie. It was written in the 1930s, but has been updated a few times and is still very readable.The title has more to mock in it than the rest of the book. It's not as corny or pedantic as that title makes it sound. Frankly, I think, ""How to Be a Decent Human Being in Ways You Know You Should Know About Already, but Don't"" would probably be better.I can see that if you truly take most of the advice in this book to heart, it will definitely have a positive influence on your life. I picked it up as a recommended reading for salespeople at work, but it goes way beyond that.The best part about the book is the fact that is mostly made up of fascinating anecdotes that Carnegie uses to illustrate the instructive points he's trying to make. How will talking about someone's kids help you make a sale? How will smiling at your wife over you cereal in the morning revolutionize your home life? You gotta read to find out.If you're like me, by the end of the book, you will have a whole list of people from your life who you wish you could force to read it."
180,0671027034,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9777942-joe,3,"Popular self-help books have the most misleading titles. Men are From Mars Women are from Venus, for example, promises a provocative thesis but proves a bland and repetitive read. By contrast, The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People enlightens the mind and tugs at the heart despite its dry label.And so it is with How to Win Friends and Influence People. The title suggests cloak-and-dagger tactics. 'Winning friends' implies competition; that if you don't win them someone else will! And 'influencing people' implies trickery; how to get them to do what's best for you, instead of what's best for themselves.Yet the content of the book proves warm and friendly. Tips include admitting fault when you've erred, showing sincere interest in other people and putting effort into learning their names. These ideas are supported by a series of heartwarming anecdotes from historical figures and ordinary people from Carnegie's day. The overall theme is that if you do right by others they'll do right by you.Toward the end, there's a suggestion or two that feel like psychological tricks. For example, there's a chapter on that old sales tactic of asking a lot of yes/no questions (Are you feeling well today? Have you used a product like ours before?) to get someone saying 'yes' so they'll be primed to say 'yes' once you start your sales-pitch. But these were exceptions to the rule and felt mild compared with what I was expecting.I have to wonder why the book wasn't named 'How to make friends and get along with people?' I guess the sneakier title helps attract competitive business types; roping them in with the promise of shady tactics before giving them flowers and sunshine. The title implies underhanded schemes but may be the most underhanded element of the book.Edited 5-21-2017"

I am friendlier and more influential now.I owe it all to Dale Carnegie, the failed actor from Missouri who discovered he had a knack for jazzing up people’s confidence. His foundational work, “How to Win Friends & Influence People,” blasted off in 1936, but for anyone who wants a pill-sized dose of encouragement, a “mini abridged edition” is being released this week to celebrate the book’s 80th year.You could call “How to Win Friends & Influence People” the grandfather of America’s self-help movement, except this grandfather is running circles around the rest of the industry, selling 300,000 copies last year. That was all news to me. Until recently, I had assumed Carnegie’s book was. . . .

I really appreciate the focus on kindness and positively, especially in avoiding letting appreciation become empty flattery. But like... at one point Carnegie randomly tells a “plain” acquaintance that she’s capable of greatness... and then sort of takes responsibility for changing her life? Because suddenly she was confident and into skin care and got married. I think men sometimes inflate how important a single compliment is to a woman.There is a lot of good information on how to use positive reinforcement and “make people want what you want” and a lot of great reminders for dealing with people tho!"
184,0671027034,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5875398-rebecca,3,"For a book to have been in print continuously for nearly 80 years, it must be doing something right. Many of the principles are still applicable, but Carnegie’s case studies struck me as hopelessly outdated as well as exclusively American (the Teapot Dome scandal?!). In teaching public speaking to thousands of businessmen, he developed pointed advice for how to get people to like you and do what you want. Examples: show genuine interest in others and draw out their stories, express sincere appreciation, and try to see things from the other person’s point of view. Although he insists this is not about trickery or flattery, I still sensed a hint of manipulation. A lot of what he says just seems like common sense, but he spells it out and puts it all together in a helpful, reader-friendly format. He also draws on anecdote and experience, much like contemporary self-help authors like Gretchen Rubin and Brené Brown."

Although I generally agree with his principles, I think Carnegie makes following them sound too easy.Carnegie states that 15% of success is due to technical knowledge, and the other 85% is due to personality and leadership. He says that the #1 secret to success in dealing with people is having a sympathetic grasp of the other person’s point of view. He talks a lot about respecting and understanding other people, and quotes Ralph Waldo Emerson: ""Every man I meet is my superior in some way. In that, I learn of him.""Carnegie also talks a lot about praise; he says that praise is more effective than criticism for changing behavior and winning people over, so you should be “hearty in your approbation and lavish in your praise.”The book includes lessons from people like Jesus, Confucius, Buddha, Abraham Lincoln, Andrew Carnegie, Ben Franklin, John Rockefeller, Charles Schwab, and J.P. Morgan. Carnegie provides anecdotes of his own experiences, and those of the people who took his courses.I first read this book when co-workers suggested I improve my social skills, because I received many recommendations for this book. I re-read it because the lessons are so important and worthwhile.Below are the book's principles, along with my notes.Fundamental Techniques in Handling People1. Don't criticize, condemn, or complain.• Criticism is futile.2. Give honest and sincere appreciation.• Avoid flattery.3. Arouse in the other person an eager want.• Salespeople need to show how their products and services solve customers’ problems• Each party should gain; there must be mutual benefit.Six Ways to Make People Like You1. Become genuinely interested in other people.• “You can make more friends in two months by becoming more interested in other people than you can in two years by trying to get people interested in you”• Greet people with animation and enthusiasm. When someone calls on the phone, sound like you’re pleased.2. Smile.• A facial expression is more important than clothes.• Encouragement is more effective than punishment.• Don’t feel like smiling? Force yourself; feeling follows action.3. Remember that a man's Name is to him the sweetest and most important sound in any language.• To remember names, tie the name to a person’s features, use the person’s name in conversation, and write and memorize the name.4. Be a good listener. Encourage others to talk about themselves.• To be a good conversationalist, listen and pay attention.• To be interesting, be interested.5. Talk in the terms of the other man's interest.6. Make the other person feel important and do it sincerely.• The law of human conduct: always make the other person feel important.• Follow the Golden Rule: ""Do unto others as you would have them do unto you"".Twelve Ways to Win People to Your Way of Thinking1. Avoid arguments.• You can’t win an argument. Even if you win, you make your opponent feel inferior, so you lose.2. Show respect for the other person's opinions. Never tell someone they are wrong.3. If you're wrong, admit it quickly and emphatically.4. Begin in a friendly way.• ""'A drop of honey catches more flies than a gallon of gall.' So with men. If you would win a man to your cause, first convince him that you are his sincere friend."" – Lincoln5. Start with questions the other person will answer yes to.• The more yeses you can get at the outset, the more likely the person is to accept your ultimate proposal.6. Let the other person do the talking.• “If you want enemies, excel your friends; but if you want friends, let your friends excel you”.7. Let the other person feel the idea is his/hers.8. Try honestly to see things from the other person's point of view.9. Sympathize with the other person.10. Appeal to noble motives.• Treat people as if they are honest and fair.11. Dramatize your ideas.12. Throw down a challenge.• Use showmanship when selling or convincing.Be a Leader: How to Change People Without Giving Offense or Arousing Resentment1. Begin with praise and honest appreciation.• Use ""and"", not ""but"" as your conjunction between praise and criticism. Give praise, then say “and”, then give criticism/correction. Don’t give praise, say “but”, then criticize; it cheapens the praise.2. Call attention to other people's mistakes indirectly.3. Talk about your own mistakes first.4. Ask questions instead of directly giving orders.• People are more likely to accept an order if they had a part in the decision.5. Let the other person save face.6. Praise every improvement.• Give specific, sincere praise.• Praise is more effective at changing behavior than criticism.7. Give them a fine reputation to live up to.• Praise people, and they’ll feel obligated to live up to their good reputation.8. Encourage them by making their faults seem easy to correct.9. Make the other person happy about doing what you suggest.• Convince people by telling them specifically how they’ll personally benefit."

188,0671027034,http://goodreads.com/user/show/25883565-gator,4,"Dale Carnegie put together one heck of a book, I’ve already begun applying his techniques and advice to great success, with my wife, children and clients. My wife and I run a small business and sometimes clients can be a real pain in the behind, I used to sometimes sass back but after reading this life guide I’ve begun to sing a different tune, and the results speak for themselves, they are very positive. This book can be used as a life guide, whenever we run into issues dive into Carnegie’s book and you may just find what you’re looking for. I will definitely be recommending this and re reading in the future. Below are some of my favorite quotes. ""It is an old and true maxim that 'a drop of honey catches more flies than a gallon of gall.' So with men, if you would win a man to your cause, first convince him that you are his sincere friend.”-Abe Lincoln “All men have fears, but the brave put down their fears and go forward, sometimes to death, but always to victory” was the motto of the King’s Guard in Ancient Greece.  “You must develop a deep, driving desire to learn, a vigorous determination to increase your ability to deal with people” “Any fool can criticize, condemn, and complain — and most fools do.”“The deepest urge in human nature is the desire to be important … always make the other person feel important.” “Listening is one of the highest compliments we can pay anyone.”“There is only one way under the high heaven to get the best of an argument — and that is to avoid it. Avoid arguments as you would rattlesnakes and earthquakes.”“We are interested in others when they are interested in us.”“In our interpersonal relationships, we should never forget that all our associates are human begins and hunger for appreciation.”"
189,0671027034,http://goodreads.com/user/show/32557533-claire,1,"Overall I can see why some people value this book and go on to practice some of the ideas in their lives, whether personally or in business. There are some interesting examples and valuable thoughts, though I struggled to enjoy this read for a number of factors;- The writing itself wasn't particularly interesting or eloquent- The repetition was tiresome - whilst it was purposefully repeated, it made me feel bored and patronised- Not only were actual sentences repeated - the ideas and concepts in the book were all similar conveyed in a slightly different variant- Examples seem to form the main bulk of the content which made the book feel like a collection of anecdotesOn top of all of the above, I feel like anyone taking the advice in this book too seriously would end up being walked over; pleasing people, letting others take the credit, always being the bigger person, never complaining or criticising. As such, I feel like these ideas need to be taken with a large pinch of salt and maybe in this way one or two may become useful in small doses!"

As I was looking through my bookshelfs this afternoon, I found a very old copy of this classic. It must have come from my father's library as it is marked as a 77th printing - probably printed in the early 50's. I LOVE old books...The best tidbit to share from this book, is if you want people to like you, emulate a dog. Carnegie says: ""When you get within ten feet of him, he will begin to wag his tail. If you stop and pat him, he will almost jump out of his skin to show you how much he likes you. And you know that behind this show of affection on his part, there are no ulterior motives: he doesn't want to sell you any real estate, and he doesn't want to marry you."""

Basically, it argues that if you earnestly invest in other people, care about them in ways that few people do, you will have success throughout your life. As many others have already commented, the name of the book leads you to believe that it will be a load of sleaze. And indeed, the book's title did put me off it for quite a while. After all, this is a book about how to influence people. For the most part, I haven't found the part of the book where the sleaze comes out. One thing I am wondering about however is how the book will address dealing with horrible people: with the tyrants, emotion terrorists, or just plain whiners. More importantly--the first rule: not criticizing anyone. That seems like it would take quite a toll after a while. "

197,0671027034,http://goodreads.com/user/show/17442587-hannah,0,"Well, I thought a lot of things while reading this. I admit I wasn't too gung-ho about the book in the first place, and read it because it was assigned reading at work. I've heard about Carnegie plenty of times in the past and was pretty sure he wasn't the sort of author whose philosophies I'd give five stars to.However, I did try to read it objectively. Yes, he is a proponent of the ""social gospel"" of his time, but it also wasn't as bad as I thought it might be (I didn't end by throwing the book across the room. So far, Descartes remains alone in the dubious distinction of being lobbed at the further wall). I'll write my review in sections according to the structure of the book.Part one: Fundamental Techniques in Handling People1. Don't criticize, condemn, or complain.Point given: no one wants to be around a whiner. Sure, I agree with that.Application made: Lawbreakers, such as Al Capone and Two Gun Crowley, believed themselves to be good people at heart, even helpers of the community: ""people don't criticize themselves for anything, no matter how wrong it may be....Criticism is futile because it puts a person on the defensive and usually makes him strive to justify himself. Criticism is dangerous because it wounds a person's precious pride, hurts his sense of importance, and arouses resentment.""All right, wait a moment here. If my friends never voice any criticism, how would I know I'm wandering around with mud on my cheek? with a stain on my blouse? How am I to know that something is wrong? The last thing I wish to do is wander through life with the rest of the world afraid to let me know what I'm doing wrong. Constructive criticism is a good thing. As a music teacher, it is imperative that sometimes I get to say, ""No. Don't do it that way."" Why? Because certain positions can be harmful to the student's muscles and a hindrance to their progress. I compliment them on progress made and tell them how to make it better. It requires much less time and intellectual fishing than trying to influence them to deduct that the position may not be to their greatest advantage.2. Give honest and sincere appreciation.Point given: Everyone is glad to know they are valuable.Application: If you want people to do something for you, your best bet is to make them want to do it. Using an application of Sigmund Freud's and Dewey's theories that every man has ""the desire to be great"" or ""the desire to be important,"" Carnegie mentions the successes who have made themselves great--Lincoln and Dickens--and moves on to criminals. ""The average young criminal...is filled with ego...If you tell me how you get your feeling of importance, I'll tell you what you are. That determines your character,"" he finishes. Mr. Carnegie, I beg to differ. What puffs your chest out is not the sum total of who you are. That is only one symptom of the man as a whole. Are you trustworthy? Are you a friend to others? If you are either of those, or of any other things, and yet lack a real feeling of importance, it does not make you a nobody, as Carnegie more than implies. Finding your self-worth is not the only goal in life for a successful person.He continues the chapter by giving examples of people who have gone insane because of having unfulfilled dreams in life...well, nobody can quite say it for sure, of course, but this is his argument: ""...the other half of people who go insane apparently have nothing wrong with their brain cells...Why do these people go insane? [the doctor he spoke with said] Nobody knows for sure. But he did say that many people who go insane find in insanity a feeling of importance that they were unable to achieve in the world of reality."" His implication is clear that some people prefer to lose touch with reality than to lose touch with their dreams and their exalted view of themselves.What about flattery? We do get warned against flattery. ""Flattery is counterfeit, and like counterfeit money, it will eventually get you into trouble if you pass it to someone else...Flattery is telling the other person precisely what he thinks about himself."" But to give a person compliments in the hope of gaining one's own ends reeks of insincerity. The examples given show that a sloppy person will suddenly do a great job when given praise instead of critique. I'm sorry, but I've tried this. Contrary to Carnegie's opinion, people are not all going to do what you want if you convince them they are good people and they do a good job. All too many react with pleasure at the status quo and see absolutely no need to do better. So I will add that, yes, it's wonderful to appreciate others. But it is wrong and often cruel to them to make them think they are perfect when they are doing a sloppy job that may cause danger to others (such as breaking health laws or leaving messes in walkways.) Carnegie denies the implication that making someone want what you want by telling them how good they are is manipulation, but in most of the examples it slides dangerously close to that line.3. Arouse in the other person an eager want.Point given: People's acts are entirely driven by their wants.Application: To impose what we want, we have to convince others that they want what we want more than they want what they want...that, in fact, what we want is even better than what they wanted in the first place. While I'm all for positive inspiration, this message has a sordid underbelly.Carnegie believes that all actions have one root: desire. The only way to change a person's actions is to change their desires. He does not believe that people will gladly follow rules unless there is something in it for them. In the previous chapter, he posited that those appreciated will do a great job merely because someone's compliment makes them wish to do well. Yes, I do agree that continual criticism will sap a person's motivations, but praise all the time is not necessarily a motivator. According to Carnegie's philosophy, there are no people who are lazy for the joy of being lazy. Or, if there are such people, all they need is someone to come along and affirm them and present to them a good reason to get up and do a good job.One of the examples given is of a child who refused to eat his vegetables despite being scolded by his parents. He had an issue with a neighborhood bully, and the father decided to use the bully as the force behind his argument. ""When his father explained that the boy would be able to wallop the daylights out of the bigger kid someday if he would only eat the things his mother wanted him to eat--when his father promised him that--there was no longer any problem of dietetics."" I'm sorry, but no parent can ever make a promise like that, because there is no guarantee of its being fulfilled. The boy may have grown to 5'6"" and the bully to 6'5"" and no vegetables in the world could reverse the sizes. Then where would the father's promise be? He has broken a promise to his child that he had no right to make in the first place. The father's persuasion becomes a lie. The two pages of the child's story show that they gained mastery over the child by ""making him feel important."" Another child eats her cereal because by preparing it she ""achieved a feeling of importance; she had found in making the cereal an avenue of self-expression.""The danger of Carnegie's philosophy in this point is that one's self-esteem becomes the generator of their actions. If their self-esteem fails, apparently they do a horrible job and are uninterested in good ideas. Well, that doesn't bear out in real life. Some people who have damaged self-worth are hard workers, and some with excellent self-worth are sloppy and lazy. But Carnegie's chapter ends with a quote: ""William Winter once remarked that 'self-expression is the dominant necessity of human nature.'"" Well, if we are so busy fueling the self-expression of all those around us, where are we? We see a goal and coax others to want that goal, but ourselves are left behind in the dust of their ascent.Part Two. Six Ways to Make People Like You(well, I feel quarrelsome just reading that. If everyone likes you there's something wrong with your self-expression, because in being all things to all people there is no room left to be yourself.)1. Become genuinely interested in other people.All well and good, except he makes the cynical point ""People are not interested in you. They are not interested in me. They are interested in themselves--morning, noon, and after dinner."" So we are to figure out some way to become genuinely interested in others, to be silent when they talk, to encourage them always to express themselves around us.2. SmilePlease do!3. Remember that a person's name is to that person the sweetest and most important sound in any language.Helpful, but not the ""sweetest sound"" he claims. It's nice to remember names, but that honestly doesn't influence me much. I wonder if other people are more influenced by this, and I'm just some sort of anomaly? When I'm at work and someone comes through my checkout line, if it's a stranger I don't know, I'm not at all tempted to give them a bigger drink than they paid for because they say my name. Really, that's creepy...being nice to me doesn't entitle them to more of the company's food than they paid for, anyway. It isn't my food to give away.4. Be a good listener. Encourage others to talk about themselves.This one's easy...Other people's lives are just interesting. A side effect of being a hopeful novelist.5. Talk in terms of other people's interests.This creeps back towards flattery and worse. ""You want me to be your friend because I can do thus and so for you."" Isn't that just asking others to exploit your talents? I don't want friends who want me only on the basis of what I can do for them. When seeking a job, yes. But not when seeking friends.6. Make the other person feel important--and do it sincerely.This reminded me of an Andy Griffith show I saw recently on Netflix. Aunt Bee makes horrible pickles, but Andy and Barney are determined to not make her feel bad. After going to great and hilarious lengths of deception, they are left doomed to eat a double batch of bad pickles. They were sincere in their desire to please Aunt Bee because they could recognize she'd worked hard on those pickles. But it didn't rebound in their favor. They were insincere and deceptive in their effort to reward her for her work.Making others feel important isn't going to automatically result in a handout of exactly what you wanted. This action, done in order to gain a goal (as shown in the examples), is risky indeed, and oftentimes even deceptive.....out of time....more tomorrow and later on my blog...including ""Carnegie's book in light of Scripture."""
198,0671027034,http://goodreads.com/user/show/16996132-abeer-abdullah,2,"Working with a wide variety of people in my particular function in my company has left me seeking guidance on how to approach people, how to influence them, guide them and understand them. This is a great challenge for me for many reasons, for one thing I am over a decade younger than most people I am trying to influence, I am a 24 years old Arab girl who studied poetry who is trying to give council to and work with 40 year old Arab male engineers. Who, rightfully, may see it as ridiculous and be dismissive. It feels like a genuinely impossible task. Consequently, I am now trying to read as much about effective communication as possible, but it seems that a lot of the so called classics and best sellers are just incredibly shallow, and without true substance. This book tries to put forward the idea that empathy is at the core of winning friends and influencing people. As true as that is, it is not something revolutionary for us now in the early 21st century. Harvard Business Review's collection of books on various topics such as Emotional Intelligence and Communication for me have proved much more effective. They give detailed analysis, up to date studies, and real life examples. "
199,0671027034,http://goodreads.com/user/show/54266751-jennifer,4,"I really enjoyed this book. The advice is timeless and is as relevant today as it was eaight year's ago. I stumbled across How to Win Friends & Influence People while looking for something on change management. I wanted a book that explored the human component and not the process piece of change management.Dale Carnegie illustrates each lesson, or principle, by using both professional and personal examples. I love Carnegie’s writing style and use of words, which had a calming effect and transported me back in time. An informative and enjoyable read."
200,0671027034,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5789353-giselle,4,"Great advice, which is pretty much a given for any business person. There’s a lot of name dropping in almost every chapter. And he provides you with a ton of examples for each part. A quick and easy read if you’re looking at ways to understand people more."
201,0671027034,http://goodreads.com/user/show/88366321-jeffrey-egolf,0,I think I should wait for the book club meeting to post this review.
202,0671027034,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10471943-igor-ljubuncic,2,"So ... I am opposed to self-help books. I don't believe in self-help books. I think they are paradoxical in that people who read them expect a miraculous solution to an internal problem and those who don't read them probably don't need them in the first place. Moreover, most of these fall into a very typical template - written for the US audience and revolving around some well-proven formulas with a significant monetary incentive.The only reason I decided to try to read this book was because a valued colleague recommended it, as it has had a profound impact on his life. Disassociating his experience from the novel I set about reading, and soon I realized, it is impossible to not judge this book through the eyes of my colleague and the sum of his life's doings. Which is why the message that worked so successfully for him does not work for me at all. Because the way we have lived our lives and approach our problems are completely different, and so is the depth, scope, magnitude, and variety of our problems.I munched through three chapters before giving up. The material is repetitive, with one example after another rehashing the one-liner message summarized at the end of each chapter. Almost like whoever is reading needs convincing that what is being told is the way to do it. And perhaps it is, but a bullet-list would work equally well, if the reader is willing to embrace the message. So maybe the book is all about convincing people into trying to change their lifestyle rather than actually learning some helpful tips, if that's actually possible, on how to manage life situations.I like the concept, the ideas are noble - and valid - but the delivery mechanism completely fails me. I realize that I'm 100% not the intended audience, and that the message is designed to instill introspection, regret, remorse, enlightenment, and illumination, which I failed to grasp. Not because I'm cold-hearted, obstinate, stubborn, or opposed to change, simply because I do not need convincing 100x over that I should do XYZ. Be considerate to people and compliment them. Yes. Agreed. No need to repeat that on 10 pages of text with 27 examples. One is enough.What is missing for me is context. There isn't enough of it - so you know that people did something and that it worked for them, but not the WHY. And that's more important than actions, because anyone can be lucky, or look back and justify their successes by creating a template that fits the bill. Because let's face it, people don't write books on how to be successful BEFORE they become successful. Hindsight is camp.All in all, there's nothing wrong with the book. But it can be 99% shorter, the message can be summed up on one page, and most importantly, the book is there to reaffirm people's needs in doing things that they have already set about doing, or they are facing an existential crisis and grasping for straws of hope. In other words, if you're not one of the two, or you don't believe books can help you change, which, let's face it, they can't, unless you're already set on making that happen, and the fact you consider buying this book is the VERY step needed to change, then you will not enjoy it. Like hypnosis. It takes a willing patient. Otherwise, you can spend your time just being nice to people than reading how other people succeeded by doing things that worked for them, and you hope to be able to achieve one day, the same illusive way glamor and status are the coveted jewels of celebrities.How to win friends and influence people?Be nice. Listen to others. Try not to be a c**t. That's it.Now go back to your life and enjoy the passive-aggressive PC nonsense at your workplace :)Igor"
203,0671027034,http://goodreads.com/user/show/108599067-wout-biesheuvel,5,"The book is quite a nice read; short fun anecdotes based around some of the insights the writer is willing to share. I'd suggest taking his advice with a grain of salt but there certainly are things that I know that work, and that are great when applied. Some other things give me this weird feeling of 'fake superficiality' and it decribes a world where people can't disagree or be frank with eachother; this might be a cultural angle that hasn't been taken into account. A balance is certainly worth looking for sometimes as the 'rules' suggested are only looked at from the positive side; that seems a downside of this book.If I had to pick one 'rule' I really like it would be the simple, but oh so effective; ""Smile"". What bad can it cause? Overall, I'd still give this book 5 stars since even though its a little bit old, it's written in a great way, and let's be honest it's just a great positive book that hss some great insights and take aways to share about human relationships."
204,0671027034,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1042653-ashlie,5,"This is one of the most profound books to understand others behaviors and in teaching you skills to communicate effectively with others. A lot of the information is quite basic, but the examples and the message is quite profound. It has certainly made me stop and reevaluate my responses with others in the past few weeks when needing to work through difficult professional and personal situations. I think this book is a must read and will continue to be timeless classic book."
205,0671027034,http://goodreads.com/user/show/931082-arminius,4,"This book lays out a plan you can use to succeed in life.To make friends:Never criticize, show sincere appreciation, find out what others want and show them how to get it, become interested in them, smile at them, and know their name.To Influence:Praise and appreciate, ask questions instead of giving a direct order, give the other person a reputation to live up to, and make the other person happy about doing what you suggest.

There should, that is, be no need for a text that argues one should actually listen to what others say or that sometimes criticism and complaints get on people's nerves.Other items, such as stating one's interlocutor's name with frequency, is just manifestly obsequious, and constantly smiling is plain oleaginous, a recipe for resting douchebag face."
207,0671027034,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7810515-una-tiers,5,This was a re-read. I'd forgotten it was about positive thinking and all the benefits it has.
208,0671027034,http://goodreads.com/user/show/13329837-rachel,5,"Everyone could benefit from reading this right now, when the world is more divided than ever.The main takeaway is to empathize with others and see things from their point of view.This is great, age-old advice for business and personal success. I’ve actually learned a lot of these techniques in my business classes. I admit I’m not the best at applying these principles, even though I’ve been familiar with them for a long time. This was an amazing refresher.Basically, you can’t create positive change in the world by attacking, criticizing or belittling others. Real change comes from finding empathy, compassion and common ground."

It was written in the 1930s, but has been updated a few times and is still very readable.The title has more to mock in it than the rest of the book. It's not as corny or pedantic as that title makes it sound. Frankly, I think, ""How to Be a Decent Human Being in Ways You Know You Should Know About Already, but Don't"" would probably be better.I can see that if you truly take most of the advice in this book to heart, it will definitely have a positive influence on your life. I picked it up as a recommended reading for salespeople at work, but it goes way beyond that.The best part about the book is the fact that is mostly made up of fascinating anecdotes that Carnegie uses to illustrate the instructive points he's trying to make. How will talking about someone's kids help you make a sale? How will smiling at your wife over you cereal in the morning revolutionize your home life? You gotta read to find out.If you're like me, by the end of the book, you will have a whole list of people from your life who you wish you could force to read it."

Men are From Mars Women are from Venus, for example, promises a provocative thesis but proves a bland and repetitive read. By contrast, The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People enlightens the mind and tugs at the heart despite its dry label.And so it is with How to Win Friends and Influence People. The title suggests cloak-and-dagger tactics. 'Winning friends' implies competition; that if you don't win them someone else will! And 'influencing people' implies trickery; how to get them to do what's best for you, instead of what's best for themselves.Yet the content of the book proves warm and friendly. Tips include admitting fault when you've erred, showing sincere interest in other people and putting effort into learning their names. These ideas are supported by a series of heartwarming anecdotes from historical figures and ordinary people from Carnegie's day. The overall theme is that if you do right by others they'll do right by you.Toward the end, there's a suggestion or two that feel like psychological tricks. For example, there's a chapter on that old sales tactic of asking a lot of yes/no questions (Are you feeling well today? Have you used a product like ours before?) to get someone saying 'yes' so they'll be primed to say 'yes' once you start your sales-pitch. But these were exceptions to the rule and felt mild compared with what I was expecting.I have to wonder why the book wasn't named 'How to make friends and get along with people?' I guess the sneakier title helps attract competitive business types; roping them in with the promise of shady tactics before giving them flowers and sunshine. The title implies underhanded schemes but may be the most underhanded element of the book.Edited 5-21-2017"

I am friendlier and more influential now.I owe it all to Dale Carnegie, the failed actor from Missouri who discovered he had a knack for jazzing up people’s confidence. His foundational work, “How to Win Friends & Influence People,” blasted off in 1936, but for anyone who wants a pill-sized dose of encouragement, a “mini abridged edition” is being released this week to celebrate the book’s 80th year.You could call “How to Win Friends & Influence People” the grandfather of America’s self-help movement, except this grandfather is running circles around the rest of the industry, selling 300,000 copies last year. That was all news to me. Until recently, I had assumed Carnegie’s book was. . . .

I really appreciate the focus on kindness and positively, especially in avoiding letting appreciation become empty flattery. But like... at one point Carnegie randomly tells a “plain” acquaintance that she’s capable of greatness... and then sort of takes responsibility for changing her life? Because suddenly she was confident and into skin care and got married. I think men sometimes inflate how important a single compliment is to a woman.There is a lot of good information on how to use positive reinforcement and “make people want what you want” and a lot of great reminders for dealing with people tho!"
214,0671027034,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5875398-rebecca,3,"For a book to have been in print continuously for nearly 80 years, it must be doing something right. Many of the principles are still applicable, but Carnegie’s case studies struck me as hopelessly outdated as well as exclusively American (the Teapot Dome scandal?!). In teaching public speaking to thousands of businessmen, he developed pointed advice for how to get people to like you and do what you want. Examples: show genuine interest in others and draw out their stories, express sincere appreciation, and try to see things from the other person’s point of view. Although he insists this is not about trickery or flattery, I still sensed a hint of manipulation. A lot of what he says just seems like common sense, but he spells it out and puts it all together in a helpful, reader-friendly format. He also draws on anecdote and experience, much like contemporary self-help authors like Gretchen Rubin and Brené Brown."

216,0671027034,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1586355-chad-warner,4,"Despite its manipulative-sounding title, this book is about genuinely improving your social skills and winning people to your way of thinking. Although I generally agree with his principles, I think Carnegie makes following them sound too easy.Carnegie states that 15% of success is due to technical knowledge, and the other 85% is due to personality and leadership. He says that the #1 secret to success in dealing with people is having a sympathetic grasp of the other person’s point of view. He talks a lot about respecting and understanding other people, and quotes Ralph Waldo Emerson: ""Every man I meet is my superior in some way. In that, I learn of him.""Carnegie also talks a lot about praise; he says that praise is more effective than criticism for changing behavior and winning people over, so you should be “hearty in your approbation and lavish in your praise.”The book includes lessons from people like Jesus, Confucius, Buddha, Abraham Lincoln, Andrew Carnegie, Ben Franklin, John Rockefeller, Charles Schwab, and J.P. Morgan. Carnegie provides anecdotes of his own experiences, and those of the people who took his courses.I first read this book when co-workers suggested I improve my social skills, because I received many recommendations for this book. I re-read it because the lessons are so important and worthwhile.Below are the book's principles, along with my notes.Fundamental Techniques in Handling People1. Don't criticize, condemn, or complain.• Criticism is futile.2. Give honest and sincere appreciation.• Avoid flattery.3. Arouse in the other person an eager want.• Salespeople need to show how their products and services solve customers’ problems• Each party should gain; there must be mutual benefit.Six Ways to Make People Like You1. Become genuinely interested in other people.• “You can make more friends in two months by becoming more interested in other people than you can in two years by trying to get people interested in you”• Greet people with animation and enthusiasm. When someone calls on the phone, sound like you’re pleased.2. Smile.• A facial expression is more important than clothes.• Encouragement is more effective than punishment.• Don’t feel like smiling? Force yourself; feeling follows action.3. Remember that a man's Name is to him the sweetest and most important sound in any language.• To remember names, tie the name to a person’s features, use the person’s name in conversation, and write and memorize the name.4. Be a good listener. Encourage others to talk about themselves.• To be a good conversationalist, listen and pay attention.• To be interesting, be interested.5. Talk in the terms of the other man's interest.6. Make the other person feel important and do it sincerely.• The law of human conduct: always make the other person feel important.• Follow the Golden Rule: ""Do unto others as you would have them do unto you"".Twelve Ways to Win People to Your Way of Thinking1.

If you're wrong, admit it quickly and emphatically.4. Begin in a friendly way.• ""'A drop of honey catches more flies than a gallon of gall.' So with men.

Don’t give praise, say “but”, then criticize; it cheapens the praise.2. Call attention to other people's mistakes indirectly.3. Talk about your own mistakes first.4. Ask questions instead of directly giving orders.• People are more likely to accept an order if they had a part in the decision.5. Let the other person save face.6. Praise every improvement.• Give specific, sincere praise.• Praise is more effective at changing behavior than criticism.7. Give them a fine reputation to live up to.• Praise people, and they’ll feel obligated to live up to their good reputation.8. Encourage them by making their faults seem easy to correct.9.

218,0671027034,http://goodreads.com/user/show/25883565-gator,4,"Dale Carnegie put together one heck of a book, I’ve already begun applying his techniques and advice to great success, with my wife, children and clients. My wife and I run a small business and sometimes clients can be a real pain in the behind, I used to sometimes sass back but after reading this life guide I’ve begun to sing a different tune, and the results speak for themselves, they are very positive. This book can be used as a life guide, whenever we run into issues dive into Carnegie’s book and you may just find what you’re looking for. I will definitely be recommending this and re reading in the future. Below are some of my favorite quotes. ""It is an old and true maxim that 'a drop of honey catches more flies than a gallon of gall.' So with men, if you would win a man to your cause, first convince him that you are his sincere friend.”-Abe Lincoln “All men have fears, but the brave put down their fears and go forward, sometimes to death, but always to victory” was the motto of the King’s Guard in Ancient Greece.  “You must develop a deep, driving desire to learn, a vigorous determination to increase your ability to deal with people” “Any fool can criticize, condemn, and complain — and most fools do.”“The deepest urge in human nature is the desire to be important … always make the other person feel important.” “Listening is one of the highest compliments we can pay anyone.”“There is only one way under the high heaven to get the best of an argument — and that is to avoid it. Avoid arguments as you would rattlesnakes and earthquakes.”“We are interested in others when they are interested in us.”“In our interpersonal relationships, we should never forget that all our associates are human begins and hunger for appreciation.”"
219,0671027034,http://goodreads.com/user/show/32557533-claire,1,"Overall I can see why some people value this book and go on to practice some of the ideas in their lives, whether personally or in business. There are some interesting examples and valuable thoughts, though I struggled to enjoy this read for a number of factors;- The writing itself wasn't particularly interesting or eloquent- The repetition was tiresome - whilst it was purposefully repeated, it made me feel bored and patronised- Not only were actual sentences repeated - the ideas and concepts in the book were all similar conveyed in a slightly different variant- Examples seem to form the main bulk of the content which made the book feel like a collection of anecdotesOn top of all of the above, I feel like anyone taking the advice in this book too seriously would end up being walked over; pleasing people, letting others take the credit, always being the bigger person, never complaining or criticising. As such, I feel like these ideas need to be taken with a large pinch of salt and maybe in this way one or two may become useful in small doses!"

As I was looking through my bookshelfs this afternoon, I found a very old copy of this classic. It must have come from my father's library as it is marked as a 77th printing - probably printed in the early 50's. I LOVE old books...The best tidbit to share from this book, is if you want people to like you, emulate a dog. Carnegie says: ""When you get within ten feet of him, he will begin to wag his tail. If you stop and pat him, he will almost jump out of his skin to show you how much he likes you. And you know that behind this show of affection on his part, there are no ulterior motives: he doesn't want to sell you any real estate, and he doesn't want to marry you."""

Basically, it argues that if you earnestly invest in other people, care about them in ways that few people do, you will have success throughout your life. As many others have already commented, the name of the book leads you to believe that it will be a load of sleaze. And indeed, the book's title did put me off it for quite a while. After all, this is a book about how to influence people. For the most part, I haven't found the part of the book where the sleaze comes out. One thing I am wondering about however is how the book will address dealing with horrible people: with the tyrants, emotion terrorists, or just plain whiners. More importantly--the first rule: not criticizing anyone. That seems like it would take quite a toll after a while. "

227,0671027034,http://goodreads.com/user/show/17442587-hannah,0,"Well, I thought a lot of things while reading this. I admit I wasn't too gung-ho about the book in the first place, and read it because it was assigned reading at work. I've heard about Carnegie plenty of times in the past and was pretty sure he wasn't the sort of author whose philosophies I'd give five stars to.However, I did try to read it objectively. Yes, he is a proponent of the ""social gospel"" of his time, but it also wasn't as bad as I thought it might be (I didn't end by throwing the book across the room. So far, Descartes remains alone in the dubious distinction of being lobbed at the further wall). I'll write my review in sections according to the structure of the book.Part one: Fundamental Techniques in Handling People1. Don't criticize, condemn, or complain.Point given: no one wants to be around a whiner. Sure, I agree with that.Application made: Lawbreakers, such as Al Capone and Two Gun Crowley, believed themselves to be good people at heart, even helpers of the community: ""people don't criticize themselves for anything, no matter how wrong it may be....Criticism is futile because it puts a person on the defensive and usually makes him strive to justify himself. Criticism is dangerous because it wounds a person's precious pride, hurts his sense of importance, and arouses resentment.""All right, wait a moment here. If my friends never voice any criticism, how would I know I'm wandering around with mud on my cheek? with a stain on my blouse? How am I to know that something is wrong? The last thing I wish to do is wander through life with the rest of the world afraid to let me know what I'm doing wrong. Constructive criticism is a good thing. As a music teacher, it is imperative that sometimes I get to say, ""No. Don't do it that way."" Why? Because certain positions can be harmful to the student's muscles and a hindrance to their progress. I compliment them on progress made and tell them how to make it better. It requires much less time and intellectual fishing than trying to influence them to deduct that the position may not be to their greatest advantage.2. Give honest and sincere appreciation.Point given: Everyone is glad to know they are valuable.Application: If you want people to do something for you, your best bet is to make them want to do it. Using an application of Sigmund Freud's and Dewey's theories that every man has ""the desire to be great"" or ""the desire to be important,"" Carnegie mentions the successes who have made themselves great--Lincoln and Dickens--and moves on to criminals. ""The average young criminal...is filled with ego...If you tell me how you get your feeling of importance, I'll tell you what you are. That determines your character,"" he finishes. Mr. Carnegie, I beg to differ. What puffs your chest out is not the sum total of who you are. That is only one symptom of the man as a whole. Are you trustworthy? Are you a friend to others? If you are either of those, or of any other things, and yet lack a real feeling of importance, it does not make you a nobody, as Carnegie more than implies. Finding your self-worth is not the only goal in life for a successful person.He continues the chapter by giving examples of people who have gone insane because of having unfulfilled dreams in life...well, nobody can quite say it for sure, of course, but this is his argument: ""...the other half of people who go insane apparently have nothing wrong with their brain cells...Why do these people go insane? [the doctor he spoke with said] Nobody knows for sure. But he did say that many people who go insane find in insanity a feeling of importance that they were unable to achieve in the world of reality."" His implication is clear that some people prefer to lose touch with reality than to lose touch with their dreams and their exalted view of themselves.What about flattery? We do get warned against flattery. ""Flattery is counterfeit, and like counterfeit money, it will eventually get you into trouble if you pass it to someone else...Flattery is telling the other person precisely what he thinks about himself."" But to give a person compliments in the hope of gaining one's own ends reeks of insincerity. The examples given show that a sloppy person will suddenly do a great job when given praise instead of critique. I'm sorry, but I've tried this. Contrary to Carnegie's opinion, people are not all going to do what you want if you convince them they are good people and they do a good job. All too many react with pleasure at the status quo and see absolutely no need to do better. So I will add that, yes, it's wonderful to appreciate others. But it is wrong and often cruel to them to make them think they are perfect when they are doing a sloppy job that may cause danger to others (such as breaking health laws or leaving messes in walkways.) Carnegie denies the implication that making someone want what you want by telling them how good they are is manipulation, but in most of the examples it slides dangerously close to that line.3. Arouse in the other person an eager want.Point given: People's acts are entirely driven by their wants.Application: To impose what we want, we have to convince others that they want what we want more than they want what they want...that, in fact, what we want is even better than what they wanted in the first place. While I'm all for positive inspiration, this message has a sordid underbelly.Carnegie believes that all actions have one root: desire. The only way to change a person's actions is to change their desires. He does not believe that people will gladly follow rules unless there is something in it for them. In the previous chapter, he posited that those appreciated will do a great job merely because someone's compliment makes them wish to do well. Yes, I do agree that continual criticism will sap a person's motivations, but praise all the time is not necessarily a motivator. According to Carnegie's philosophy, there are no people who are lazy for the joy of being lazy. Or, if there are such people, all they need is someone to come along and affirm them and present to them a good reason to get up and do a good job.One of the examples given is of a child who refused to eat his vegetables despite being scolded by his parents. He had an issue with a neighborhood bully, and the father decided to use the bully as the force behind his argument. ""When his father explained that the boy would be able to wallop the daylights out of the bigger kid someday if he would only eat the things his mother wanted him to eat--when his father promised him that--there was no longer any problem of dietetics."" I'm sorry, but no parent can ever make a promise like that, because there is no guarantee of its being fulfilled. The boy may have grown to 5'6"" and the bully to 6'5"" and no vegetables in the world could reverse the sizes. Then where would the father's promise be? He has broken a promise to his child that he had no right to make in the first place. The father's persuasion becomes a lie. The two pages of the child's story show that they gained mastery over the child by ""making him feel important."" Another child eats her cereal because by preparing it she ""achieved a feeling of importance; she had found in making the cereal an avenue of self-expression.""The danger of Carnegie's philosophy in this point is that one's self-esteem becomes the generator of their actions. If their self-esteem fails, apparently they do a horrible job and are uninterested in good ideas. Well, that doesn't bear out in real life. Some people who have damaged self-worth are hard workers, and some with excellent self-worth are sloppy and lazy. But Carnegie's chapter ends with a quote: ""William Winter once remarked that 'self-expression is the dominant necessity of human nature.'"" Well, if we are so busy fueling the self-expression of all those around us, where are we? We see a goal and coax others to want that goal, but ourselves are left behind in the dust of their ascent.Part Two. Six Ways to Make People Like You(well, I feel quarrelsome just reading that. If everyone likes you there's something wrong with your self-expression, because in being all things to all people there is no room left to be yourself.)1. Become genuinely interested in other people.All well and good, except he makes the cynical point ""People are not interested in you. They are not interested in me. They are interested in themselves--morning, noon, and after dinner."" So we are to figure out some way to become genuinely interested in others, to be silent when they talk, to encourage them always to express themselves around us.2. SmilePlease do!3. Remember that a person's name is to that person the sweetest and most important sound in any language.Helpful, but not the ""sweetest sound"" he claims. It's nice to remember names, but that honestly doesn't influence me much. I wonder if other people are more influenced by this, and I'm just some sort of anomaly? When I'm at work and someone comes through my checkout line, if it's a stranger I don't know, I'm not at all tempted to give them a bigger drink than they paid for because they say my name. Really, that's creepy...being nice to me doesn't entitle them to more of the company's food than they paid for, anyway. It isn't my food to give away.4. Be a good listener. Encourage others to talk about themselves.This one's easy...Other people's lives are just interesting. A side effect of being a hopeful novelist.5. Talk in terms of other people's interests.This creeps back towards flattery and worse. ""You want me to be your friend because I can do thus and so for you."" Isn't that just asking others to exploit your talents? I don't want friends who want me only on the basis of what I can do for them. When seeking a job, yes. But not when seeking friends.6. Make the other person feel important--and do it sincerely.This reminded me of an Andy Griffith show I saw recently on Netflix. Aunt Bee makes horrible pickles, but Andy and Barney are determined to not make her feel bad. After going to great and hilarious lengths of deception, they are left doomed to eat a double batch of bad pickles. They were sincere in their desire to please Aunt Bee because they could recognize she'd worked hard on those pickles. But it didn't rebound in their favor. They were insincere and deceptive in their effort to reward her for her work.Making others feel important isn't going to automatically result in a handout of exactly what you wanted. This action, done in order to gain a goal (as shown in the examples), is risky indeed, and oftentimes even deceptive.....out of time....more tomorrow and later on my blog...including ""Carnegie's book in light of Scripture."""

Consequently, I am now trying to read as much about effective communication as possible, but it seems that a lot of the so called classics and best sellers are just incredibly shallow, and without true substance. This book tries to put forward the idea that empathy is at the core of winning friends and influencing people. As true as that is, it is not something revolutionary for us now in the early 21st century. Harvard Business Review's collection of books on various topics such as Emotional Intelligence and Communication for me have proved much more effective. They give detailed analysis, up to date studies, and real life examples. "
229,0671027034,http://goodreads.com/user/show/54266751-jennifer,4,"I really enjoyed this book. The advice is timeless and is as relevant today as it was eaight year's ago. I stumbled across How to Win Friends & Influence People while looking for something on change management. I wanted a book that explored the human component and not the process piece of change management.Dale Carnegie illustrates each lesson, or principle, by using both professional and personal examples. I love Carnegie’s writing style and use of words, which had a calming effect and transported me back in time. An informative and enjoyable read."
230,0671027034,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5789353-giselle,4,"Great advice, which is pretty much a given for any business person. There’s a lot of name dropping in almost every chapter. And he provides you with a ton of examples for each part. A quick and easy read if you’re looking at ways to understand people more."
231,0671027034,http://goodreads.com/user/show/88366321-jeffrey-egolf,0,I think I should wait for the book club meeting to post this review.
232,0671027034,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10471943-igor-ljubuncic,2,"So ... I am opposed to self-help books. I don't believe in self-help books. I think they are paradoxical in that people who read them expect a miraculous solution to an internal problem and those who don't read them probably don't need them in the first place. Moreover, most of these fall into a very typical template - written for the US audience and revolving around some well-proven formulas with a significant monetary incentive.The only reason I decided to try to read this book was because a valued colleague recommended it, as it has had a profound impact on his life. Disassociating his experience from the novel I set about reading, and soon I realized, it is impossible to not judge this book through the eyes of my colleague and the sum of his life's doings. Which is why the message that worked so successfully for him does not work for me at all. Because the way we have lived our lives and approach our problems are completely different, and so is the depth, scope, magnitude, and variety of our problems.I munched through three chapters before giving up. The material is repetitive, with one example after another rehashing the one-liner message summarized at the end of each chapter. Almost like whoever is reading needs convincing that what is being told is the way to do it. And perhaps it is, but a bullet-list would work equally well, if the reader is willing to embrace the message. So maybe the book is all about convincing people into trying to change their lifestyle rather than actually learning some helpful tips, if that's actually possible, on how to manage life situations.I like the concept, the ideas are noble - and valid - but the delivery mechanism completely fails me. I realize that I'm 100% not the intended audience, and that the message is designed to instill introspection, regret, remorse, enlightenment, and illumination, which I failed to grasp. Not because I'm cold-hearted, obstinate, stubborn, or opposed to change, simply because I do not need convincing 100x over that I should do XYZ. Be considerate to people and compliment them. Yes. Agreed. No need to repeat that on 10 pages of text with 27 examples. One is enough.What is missing for me is context. There isn't enough of it - so you know that people did something and that it worked for them, but not the WHY. And that's more important than actions, because anyone can be lucky, or look back and justify their successes by creating a template that fits the bill. Because let's face it, people don't write books on how to be successful BEFORE they become successful. Hindsight is camp.All in all, there's nothing wrong with the book. But it can be 99% shorter, the message can be summed up on one page, and most importantly, the book is there to reaffirm people's needs in doing things that they have already set about doing, or they are facing an existential crisis and grasping for straws of hope. In other words, if you're not one of the two, or you don't believe books can help you change, which, let's face it, they can't, unless you're already set on making that happen, and the fact you consider buying this book is the VERY step needed to change, then you will not enjoy it. Like hypnosis. It takes a willing patient. Otherwise, you can spend your time just being nice to people than reading how other people succeeded by doing things that worked for them, and you hope to be able to achieve one day, the same illusive way glamor and status are the coveted jewels of celebrities.How to win friends and influence people?Be nice. Listen to others. Try not to be a c**t. That's it.Now go back to your life and enjoy the passive-aggressive PC nonsense at your workplace :)Igor"
233,0671027034,http://goodreads.com/user/show/108599067-wout-biesheuvel,5,"The book is quite a nice read; short fun anecdotes based around some of the insights the writer is willing to share. I'd suggest taking his advice with a grain of salt but there certainly are things that I know that work, and that are great when applied. Some other things give me this weird feeling of 'fake superficiality' and it decribes a world where people can't disagree or be frank with eachother; this might be a cultural angle that hasn't been taken into account. A balance is certainly worth looking for sometimes as the 'rules' suggested are only looked at from the positive side; that seems a downside of this book.If I had to pick one 'rule' I really like it would be the simple, but oh so effective; ""Smile"". What bad can it cause? Overall, I'd still give this book 5 stars since even though its a little bit old, it's written in a great way, and let's be honest it's just a great positive book that hss some great insights and take aways to share about human relationships."
234,0671027034,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1042653-ashlie,5,"This is one of the most profound books to understand others behaviors and in teaching you skills to communicate effectively with others. A lot of the information is quite basic, but the examples and the message is quite profound. It has certainly made me stop and reevaluate my responses with others in the past few weeks when needing to work through difficult professional and personal situations. I think this book is a must read and will continue to be timeless classic book."
235,0671027034,http://goodreads.com/user/show/931082-arminius,4,"This book lays out a plan you can use to succeed in life.To make friends:Never criticize, show sincere appreciation, find out what others want and show them how to get it, become interested in them, smile at them, and know their name.To Influence:Praise and appreciate, ask questions instead of giving a direct order, give the other person a reputation to live up to, and make the other person happy about doing what you suggest. "
236,0671027034,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5610133-sologdin,1,"Douchey crap, overall. There should, that is, be no need for a text that argues one should actually listen to what others say or that sometimes criticism and complaints get on people's nerves.Other items, such as stating one's interlocutor's name with frequency, is just manifestly obsequious, and constantly smiling is plain oleaginous, a recipe for resting douchebag face."
237,0671027034,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7810515-una-tiers,5,This was a re-read. I'd forgotten it was about positive thinking and all the benefits it has.
238,0671027034,http://goodreads.com/user/show/13329837-rachel,5,"Everyone could benefit from reading this right now, when the world is more divided than ever.The main takeaway is to empathize with others and see things from their point of view.This is great, age-old advice for business and personal success. I’ve actually learned a lot of these techniques in my business classes. I admit I’m not the best at applying these principles, even though I’ve been familiar with them for a long time. This was an amazing refresher.Basically, you can’t create positive change in the world by attacking, criticizing or belittling others. Real change comes from finding empathy, compassion and common ground."
239,0671027034,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4992138-brittany,5,"This is truly and oldie but a goodie. It was written in the 1930s, but has been updated a few times and is still very readable.The title has more to mock in it than the rest of the book. It's not as corny or pedantic as that title makes it sound. Frankly, I think, ""How to Be a Decent Human Being in Ways You Know You Should Know About Already, but Don't"" would probably be better.I can see that if you truly take most of the advice in this book to heart, it will definitely have a positive influence on your life. I picked it up as a recommended reading for salespeople at work, but it goes way beyond that.The best part about the book is the fact that is mostly made up of fascinating anecdotes that Carnegie uses to illustrate the instructive points he's trying to make. How will talking about someone's kids help you make a sale? How will smiling at your wife over you cereal in the morning revolutionize your home life? You gotta read to find out.If you're like me, by the end of the book, you will have a whole list of people from your life who you wish you could force to read it."
240,0671027034,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9777942-joe,3,"Popular self-help books have the most misleading titles. Men are From Mars Women are from Venus, for example, promises a provocative thesis but proves a bland and repetitive read. By contrast, The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People enlightens the mind and tugs at the heart despite its dry label.And so it is with How to Win Friends and Influence People. The title suggests cloak-and-dagger tactics. 'Winning friends' implies competition; that if you don't win them someone else will! And 'influencing people' implies trickery; how to get them to do what's best for you, instead of what's best for themselves.Yet the content of the book proves warm and friendly. Tips include admitting fault when you've erred, showing sincere interest in other people and putting effort into learning their names. These ideas are supported by a series of heartwarming anecdotes from historical figures and ordinary people from Carnegie's day. The overall theme is that if you do right by others they'll do right by you.Toward the end, there's a suggestion or two that feel like psychological tricks. For example, there's a chapter on that old sales tactic of asking a lot of yes/no questions (Are you feeling well today? Have you used a product like ours before?) to get someone saying 'yes' so they'll be primed to say 'yes' once you start your sales-pitch. But these were exceptions to the rule and felt mild compared with what I was expecting.I have to wonder why the book wasn't named 'How to make friends and get along with people?' I guess the sneakier title helps attract competitive business types; roping them in with the promise of shady tactics before giving them flowers and sunshine. The title implies underhanded schemes but may be the most underhanded element of the book.Edited 5-21-2017"

I am friendlier and more influential now.I owe it all to Dale Carnegie, the failed actor from Missouri who discovered he had a knack for jazzing up people’s confidence. His foundational work, “How to Win Friends & Influence People,” blasted off in 1936, but for anyone who wants a pill-sized dose of encouragement, a “mini abridged edition” is being released this week to celebrate the book’s 80th year.You could call “How to Win Friends & Influence People” the grandfather of America’s self-help movement, except this grandfather is running circles around the rest of the industry, selling 300,000 copies last year. That was all news to me. Until recently, I had assumed Carnegie’s book was. . . .

242,0671027034,http://goodreads.com/user/show/38028659-madelyn,3,Well researched and documented but many of the tactics are too manipulative to be applied ethically.

I really appreciate the focus on kindness and positively, especially in avoiding letting appreciation become empty flattery. But like... at one point Carnegie randomly tells a “plain” acquaintance that she’s capable of greatness... and then sort of takes responsibility for changing her life? Because suddenly she was confident and into skin care and got married. I think men sometimes inflate how important a single compliment is to a woman.There is a lot of good information on how to use positive reinforcement and “make people want what you want” and a lot of great reminders for dealing with people tho!"
244,0671027034,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5875398-rebecca,3,"For a book to have been in print continuously for nearly 80 years, it must be doing something right. Many of the principles are still applicable, but Carnegie’s case studies struck me as hopelessly outdated as well as exclusively American (the Teapot Dome scandal?!). In teaching public speaking to thousands of businessmen, he developed pointed advice for how to get people to like you and do what you want. Examples: show genuine interest in others and draw out their stories, express sincere appreciation, and try to see things from the other person’s point of view. Although he insists this is not about trickery or flattery, I still sensed a hint of manipulation. A lot of what he says just seems like common sense, but he spells it out and puts it all together in a helpful, reader-friendly format. He also draws on anecdote and experience, much like contemporary self-help authors like Gretchen Rubin and Brené Brown."

246,0671027034,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1586355-chad-warner,4,"Despite its manipulative-sounding title, this book is about genuinely improving your social skills and winning people to your way of thinking. Although I generally agree with his principles, I think Carnegie makes following them sound too easy.Carnegie states that 15% of success is due to technical knowledge, and the other 85% is due to personality and leadership. He says that the #1 secret to success in dealing with people is having a sympathetic grasp of the other person’s point of view. He talks a lot about respecting and understanding other people, and quotes Ralph Waldo Emerson: ""Every man I meet is my superior in some way. In that, I learn of him.""Carnegie also talks a lot about praise; he says that praise is more effective than criticism for changing behavior and winning people over, so you should be “hearty in your approbation and lavish in your praise.”The book includes lessons from people like Jesus, Confucius, Buddha, Abraham Lincoln, Andrew Carnegie, Ben Franklin, John Rockefeller, Charles Schwab, and J.P. Morgan. Carnegie provides anecdotes of his own experiences, and those of the people who took his courses.I first read this book when co-workers suggested I improve my social skills, because I received many recommendations for this book. I re-read it because the lessons are so important and worthwhile.Below are the book's principles, along with my notes.Fundamental Techniques in Handling People1. Don't criticize, condemn, or complain.• Criticism is futile.2. Give honest and sincere appreciation.• Avoid flattery.3. Arouse in the other person an eager want.• Salespeople need to show how their products and services solve customers’ problems• Each party should gain; there must be mutual benefit.Six Ways to Make People Like You1. Become genuinely interested in other people.• “You can make more friends in two months by becoming more interested in other people than you can in two years by trying to get people interested in you”• Greet people with animation and enthusiasm. When someone calls on the phone, sound like you’re pleased.2. Smile.• A facial expression is more important than clothes.• Encouragement is more effective than punishment.• Don’t feel like smiling? Force yourself; feeling follows action.3. Remember that a man's Name is to him the sweetest and most important sound in any language.• To remember names, tie the name to a person’s features, use the person’s name in conversation, and write and memorize the name.4. Be a good listener. Encourage others to talk about themselves.• To be a good conversationalist, listen and pay attention.• To be interesting, be interested.5. Talk in the terms of the other man's interest.6. Make the other person feel important and do it sincerely.• The law of human conduct: always make the other person feel important.• Follow the Golden Rule: ""Do unto others as you would have them do unto you"".Twelve Ways to Win People to Your Way of Thinking1. Avoid arguments.• You can’t win an argument. Even if you win, you make your opponent feel inferior, so you lose.2. Show respect for the other person's opinions. Never tell someone they are wrong.3. If you're wrong, admit it quickly and emphatically.4. Begin in a friendly way.• ""'A drop of honey catches more flies than a gallon of gall.' So with men. If you would win a man to your cause, first convince him that you are his sincere friend."" – Lincoln5. Start with questions the other person will answer yes to.• The more yeses you can get at the outset, the more likely the person is to accept your ultimate proposal.6. Let the other person do the talking.• “If you want enemies, excel your friends; but if you want friends, let your friends excel you”.7. Let the other person feel the idea is his/hers.8. Try honestly to see things from the other person's point of view.9. Sympathize with the other person.10. Appeal to noble motives.• Treat people as if they are honest and fair.11. Dramatize your ideas.12. Throw down a challenge.• Use showmanship when selling or convincing.Be a Leader: How to Change People Without Giving Offense or Arousing Resentment1. Begin with praise and honest appreciation.• Use ""and"", not ""but"" as your conjunction between praise and criticism. Give praise, then say “and”, then give criticism/correction. Don’t give praise, say “but”, then criticize; it cheapens the praise.2. Call attention to other people's mistakes indirectly.3. Talk about your own mistakes first.4. Ask questions instead of directly giving orders.• People are more likely to accept an order if they had a part in the decision.5. Let the other person save face.6. Praise every improvement.• Give specific, sincere praise.• Praise is more effective at changing behavior than criticism.7. Give them a fine reputation to live up to.• Praise people, and they’ll feel obligated to live up to their good reputation.8. Encourage them by making their faults seem easy to correct.9. Make the other person happy about doing what you suggest.• Convince people by telling them specifically how they’ll personally benefit."

248,0671027034,http://goodreads.com/user/show/25883565-gator,4,"Dale Carnegie put together one heck of a book, I’ve already begun applying his techniques and advice to great success, with my wife, children and clients. My wife and I run a small business and sometimes clients can be a real pain in the behind, I used to sometimes sass back but after reading this life guide I’ve begun to sing a different tune, and the results speak for themselves, they are very positive. This book can be used as a life guide, whenever we run into issues dive into Carnegie’s book and you may just find what you’re looking for. I will definitely be recommending this and re reading in the future. Below are some of my favorite quotes. ""It is an old and true maxim that 'a drop of honey catches more flies than a gallon of gall.' So with men, if you would win a man to your cause, first convince him that you are his sincere friend.”-Abe Lincoln “All men have fears, but the brave put down their fears and go forward, sometimes to death, but always to victory” was the motto of the King’s Guard in Ancient Greece.  “You must develop a deep, driving desire to learn, a vigorous determination to increase your ability to deal with people” “Any fool can criticize, condemn, and complain — and most fools do.”“The deepest urge in human nature is the desire to be important … always make the other person feel important.” “Listening is one of the highest compliments we can pay anyone.”“There is only one way under the high heaven to get the best of an argument — and that is to avoid it. Avoid arguments as you would rattlesnakes and earthquakes.”“We are interested in others when they are interested in us.”“In our interpersonal relationships, we should never forget that all our associates are human begins and hunger for appreciation.”"
249,0671027034,http://goodreads.com/user/show/32557533-claire,1,"Overall I can see why some people value this book and go on to practice some of the ideas in their lives, whether personally or in business. There are some interesting examples and valuable thoughts, though I struggled to enjoy this read for a number of factors;- The writing itself wasn't particularly interesting or eloquent- The repetition was tiresome - whilst it was purposefully repeated, it made me feel bored and patronised- Not only were actual sentences repeated - the ideas and concepts in the book were all similar conveyed in a slightly different variant- Examples seem to form the main bulk of the content which made the book feel like a collection of anecdotesOn top of all of the above, I feel like anyone taking the advice in this book too seriously would end up being walked over; pleasing people, letting others take the credit, always being the bigger person, never complaining or criticising. As such, I feel like these ideas need to be taken with a large pinch of salt and maybe in this way one or two may become useful in small doses!"

As I was looking through my bookshelfs this afternoon, I found a very old copy of this classic. It must have come from my father's library as it is marked as a 77th printing - probably printed in the early 50's. I LOVE old books...The best tidbit to share from this book, is if you want people to like you, emulate a dog. Carnegie says: ""When you get within ten feet of him, he will begin to wag his tail. If you stop and pat him, he will almost jump out of his skin to show you how much he likes you. And you know that behind this show of affection on his part, there are no ulterior motives: he doesn't want to sell you any real estate, and he doesn't want to marry you."""

Basically, it argues that if you earnestly invest in other people, care about them in ways that few people do, you will have success throughout your life. As many others have already commented, the name of the book leads you to believe that it will be a load of sleaze. And indeed, the book's title did put me off it for quite a while. After all, this is a book about how to influence people. For the most part, I haven't found the part of the book where the sleaze comes out. One thing I am wondering about however is how the book will address dealing with horrible people: with the tyrants, emotion terrorists, or just plain whiners. More importantly--the first rule: not criticizing anyone. That seems like it would take quite a toll after a while. "

257,0671027034,http://goodreads.com/user/show/17442587-hannah,0,"Well, I thought a lot of things while reading this. I admit I wasn't too gung-ho about the book in the first place, and read it because it was assigned reading at work. I've heard about Carnegie plenty of times in the past and was pretty sure he wasn't the sort of author whose philosophies I'd give five stars to.However, I did try to read it objectively. Yes, he is a proponent of the ""social gospel"" of his time, but it also wasn't as bad as I thought it might be (I didn't end by throwing the book across the room. So far, Descartes remains alone in the dubious distinction of being lobbed at the further wall). I'll write my review in sections according to the structure of the book.Part one: Fundamental Techniques in Handling People1. Don't criticize, condemn, or complain.Point given: no one wants to be around a whiner. Sure, I agree with that.Application made: Lawbreakers, such as Al Capone and Two Gun Crowley, believed themselves to be good people at heart, even helpers of the community: ""people don't criticize themselves for anything, no matter how wrong it may be....Criticism is futile because it puts a person on the defensive and usually makes him strive to justify himself. Criticism is dangerous because it wounds a person's precious pride, hurts his sense of importance, and arouses resentment.""All right, wait a moment here. If my friends never voice any criticism, how would I know I'm wandering around with mud on my cheek? with a stain on my blouse? How am I to know that something is wrong? The last thing I wish to do is wander through life with the rest of the world afraid to let me know what I'm doing wrong. Constructive criticism is a good thing. As a music teacher, it is imperative that sometimes I get to say, ""No. Don't do it that way."" Why? Because certain positions can be harmful to the student's muscles and a hindrance to their progress. I compliment them on progress made and tell them how to make it better. It requires much less time and intellectual fishing than trying to influence them to deduct that the position may not be to their greatest advantage.2. Give honest and sincere appreciation.Point given: Everyone is glad to know they are valuable.Application: If you want people to do something for you, your best bet is to make them want to do it. Using an application of Sigmund Freud's and Dewey's theories that every man has ""the desire to be great"" or ""the desire to be important,"" Carnegie mentions the successes who have made themselves great--Lincoln and Dickens--and moves on to criminals. ""The average young criminal...is filled with ego...If you tell me how you get your feeling of importance, I'll tell you what you are. That determines your character,"" he finishes. Mr. Carnegie, I beg to differ. What puffs your chest out is not the sum total of who you are. That is only one symptom of the man as a whole. Are you trustworthy? Are you a friend to others? If you are either of those, or of any other things, and yet lack a real feeling of importance, it does not make you a nobody, as Carnegie more than implies. Finding your self-worth is not the only goal in life for a successful person.He continues the chapter by giving examples of people who have gone insane because of having unfulfilled dreams in life...well, nobody can quite say it for sure, of course, but this is his argument: ""...the other half of people who go insane apparently have nothing wrong with their brain cells...Why do these people go insane? [the doctor he spoke with said] Nobody knows for sure. But he did say that many people who go insane find in insanity a feeling of importance that they were unable to achieve in the world of reality."" His implication is clear that some people prefer to lose touch with reality than to lose touch with their dreams and their exalted view of themselves.What about flattery? We do get warned against flattery. ""Flattery is counterfeit, and like counterfeit money, it will eventually get you into trouble if you pass it to someone else...Flattery is telling the other person precisely what he thinks about himself."" But to give a person compliments in the hope of gaining one's own ends reeks of insincerity. The examples given show that a sloppy person will suddenly do a great job when given praise instead of critique. I'm sorry, but I've tried this. Contrary to Carnegie's opinion, people are not all going to do what you want if you convince them they are good people and they do a good job. All too many react with pleasure at the status quo and see absolutely no need to do better. So I will add that, yes, it's wonderful to appreciate others. But it is wrong and often cruel to them to make them think they are perfect when they are doing a sloppy job that may cause danger to others (such as breaking health laws or leaving messes in walkways.) Carnegie denies the implication that making someone want what you want by telling them how good they are is manipulation, but in most of the examples it slides dangerously close to that line.3. Arouse in the other person an eager want.Point given: People's acts are entirely driven by their wants.Application: To impose what we want, we have to convince others that they want what we want more than they want what they want...that, in fact, what we want is even better than what they wanted in the first place. While I'm all for positive inspiration, this message has a sordid underbelly.Carnegie believes that all actions have one root: desire. The only way to change a person's actions is to change their desires. He does not believe that people will gladly follow rules unless there is something in it for them. In the previous chapter, he posited that those appreciated will do a great job merely because someone's compliment makes them wish to do well. Yes, I do agree that continual criticism will sap a person's motivations, but praise all the time is not necessarily a motivator. According to Carnegie's philosophy, there are no people who are lazy for the joy of being lazy. Or, if there are such people, all they need is someone to come along and affirm them and present to them a good reason to get up and do a good job.One of the examples given is of a child who refused to eat his vegetables despite being scolded by his parents. He had an issue with a neighborhood bully, and the father decided to use the bully as the force behind his argument. ""When his father explained that the boy would be able to wallop the daylights out of the bigger kid someday if he would only eat the things his mother wanted him to eat--when his father promised him that--there was no longer any problem of dietetics."" I'm sorry, but no parent can ever make a promise like that, because there is no guarantee of its being fulfilled. The boy may have grown to 5'6"" and the bully to 6'5"" and no vegetables in the world could reverse the sizes. Then where would the father's promise be? He has broken a promise to his child that he had no right to make in the first place. The father's persuasion becomes a lie. The two pages of the child's story show that they gained mastery over the child by ""making him feel important."" Another child eats her cereal because by preparing it she ""achieved a feeling of importance; she had found in making the cereal an avenue of self-expression.""The danger of Carnegie's philosophy in this point is that one's self-esteem becomes the generator of their actions. If their self-esteem fails, apparently they do a horrible job and are uninterested in good ideas. Well, that doesn't bear out in real life. Some people who have damaged self-worth are hard workers, and some with excellent self-worth are sloppy and lazy. But Carnegie's chapter ends with a quote: ""William Winter once remarked that 'self-expression is the dominant necessity of human nature.'"" Well, if we are so busy fueling the self-expression of all those around us, where are we? We see a goal and coax others to want that goal, but ourselves are left behind in the dust of their ascent.Part Two. Six Ways to Make People Like You(well, I feel quarrelsome just reading that. If everyone likes you there's something wrong with your self-expression, because in being all things to all people there is no room left to be yourself.)1. Become genuinely interested in other people.All well and good, except he makes the cynical point ""People are not interested in you. They are not interested in me. They are interested in themselves--morning, noon, and after dinner."" So we are to figure out some way to become genuinely interested in others, to be silent when they talk, to encourage them always to express themselves around us.2. SmilePlease do!3. Remember that a person's name is to that person the sweetest and most important sound in any language.Helpful, but not the ""sweetest sound"" he claims. It's nice to remember names, but that honestly doesn't influence me much. I wonder if other people are more influenced by this, and I'm just some sort of anomaly? When I'm at work and someone comes through my checkout line, if it's a stranger I don't know, I'm not at all tempted to give them a bigger drink than they paid for because they say my name. Really, that's creepy...being nice to me doesn't entitle them to more of the company's food than they paid for, anyway. It isn't my food to give away.4. Be a good listener. Encourage others to talk about themselves.This one's easy...Other people's lives are just interesting. A side effect of being a hopeful novelist.5. Talk in terms of other people's interests.This creeps back towards flattery and worse. ""You want me to be your friend because I can do thus and so for you."" Isn't that just asking others to exploit your talents? I don't want friends who want me only on the basis of what I can do for them. When seeking a job, yes. But not when seeking friends.6. Make the other person feel important--and do it sincerely.This reminded me of an Andy Griffith show I saw recently on Netflix. Aunt Bee makes horrible pickles, but Andy and Barney are determined to not make her feel bad. After going to great and hilarious lengths of deception, they are left doomed to eat a double batch of bad pickles. They were sincere in their desire to please Aunt Bee because they could recognize she'd worked hard on those pickles. But it didn't rebound in their favor. They were insincere and deceptive in their effort to reward her for her work.Making others feel important isn't going to automatically result in a handout of exactly what you wanted. This action, done in order to gain a goal (as shown in the examples), is risky indeed, and oftentimes even deceptive.....out of time....more tomorrow and later on my blog...including ""Carnegie's book in light of Scripture."""
258,0671027034,http://goodreads.com/user/show/16996132-abeer-abdullah,2,"Working with a wide variety of people in my particular function in my company has left me seeking guidance on how to approach people, how to influence them, guide them and understand them. This is a great challenge for me for many reasons, for one thing I am over a decade younger than most people I am trying to influence, I am a 24 years old Arab girl who studied poetry who is trying to give council to and work with 40 year old Arab male engineers. Who, rightfully, may see it as ridiculous and be dismissive. It feels like a genuinely impossible task. Consequently, I am now trying to read as much about effective communication as possible, but it seems that a lot of the so called classics and best sellers are just incredibly shallow, and without true substance. This book tries to put forward the idea that empathy is at the core of winning friends and influencing people. As true as that is, it is not something revolutionary for us now in the early 21st century. Harvard Business Review's collection of books on various topics such as Emotional Intelligence and Communication for me have proved much more effective. They give detailed analysis, up to date studies, and real life examples. "
259,0671027034,http://goodreads.com/user/show/54266751-jennifer,4,"I really enjoyed this book. The advice is timeless and is as relevant today as it was eaight year's ago. I stumbled across How to Win Friends & Influence People while looking for something on change management. I wanted a book that explored the human component and not the process piece of change management.Dale Carnegie illustrates each lesson, or principle, by using both professional and personal examples. I love Carnegie’s writing style and use of words, which had a calming effect and transported me back in time. An informative and enjoyable read."
260,0671027034,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5789353-giselle,4,"Great advice, which is pretty much a given for any business person. There’s a lot of name dropping in almost every chapter. And he provides you with a ton of examples for each part. A quick and easy read if you’re looking at ways to understand people more."
261,0671027034,http://goodreads.com/user/show/88366321-jeffrey-egolf,0,I think I should wait for the book club meeting to post this review.
262,0671027034,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10471943-igor-ljubuncic,2,"So ... I am opposed to self-help books. I don't believe in self-help books. I think they are paradoxical in that people who read them expect a miraculous solution to an internal problem and those who don't read them probably don't need them in the first place. Moreover, most of these fall into a very typical template - written for the US audience and revolving around some well-proven formulas with a significant monetary incentive.The only reason I decided to try to read this book was because a valued colleague recommended it, as it has had a profound impact on his life. Disassociating his experience from the novel I set about reading, and soon I realized, it is impossible to not judge this book through the eyes of my colleague and the sum of his life's doings. Which is why the message that worked so successfully for him does not work for me at all. Because the way we have lived our lives and approach our problems are completely different, and so is the depth, scope, magnitude, and variety of our problems.I munched through three chapters before giving up. The material is repetitive, with one example after another rehashing the one-liner message summarized at the end of each chapter. Almost like whoever is reading needs convincing that what is being told is the way to do it. And perhaps it is, but a bullet-list would work equally well, if the reader is willing to embrace the message. So maybe the book is all about convincing people into trying to change their lifestyle rather than actually learning some helpful tips, if that's actually possible, on how to manage life situations.I like the concept, the ideas are noble - and valid - but the delivery mechanism completely fails me. I realize that I'm 100% not the intended audience, and that the message is designed to instill introspection, regret, remorse, enlightenment, and illumination, which I failed to grasp. Not because I'm cold-hearted, obstinate, stubborn, or opposed to change, simply because I do not need convincing 100x over that I should do XYZ. Be considerate to people and compliment them. Yes. Agreed. No need to repeat that on 10 pages of text with 27 examples. One is enough.What is missing for me is context. There isn't enough of it - so you know that people did something and that it worked for them, but not the WHY. And that's more important than actions, because anyone can be lucky, or look back and justify their successes by creating a template that fits the bill. Because let's face it, people don't write books on how to be successful BEFORE they become successful. Hindsight is camp.All in all, there's nothing wrong with the book. But it can be 99% shorter, the message can be summed up on one page, and most importantly, the book is there to reaffirm people's needs in doing things that they have already set about doing, or they are facing an existential crisis and grasping for straws of hope. In other words, if you're not one of the two, or you don't believe books can help you change, which, let's face it, they can't, unless you're already set on making that happen, and the fact you consider buying this book is the VERY step needed to change, then you will not enjoy it. Like hypnosis. It takes a willing patient. Otherwise, you can spend your time just being nice to people than reading how other people succeeded by doing things that worked for them, and you hope to be able to achieve one day, the same illusive way glamor and status are the coveted jewels of celebrities.How to win friends and influence people?Be nice. Listen to others. Try not to be a c**t. That's it.Now go back to your life and enjoy the passive-aggressive PC nonsense at your workplace :)Igor"
263,0671027034,http://goodreads.com/user/show/108599067-wout-biesheuvel,5,"The book is quite a nice read; short fun anecdotes based around some of the insights the writer is willing to share. I'd suggest taking his advice with a grain of salt but there certainly are things that I know that work, and that are great when applied. Some other things give me this weird feeling of 'fake superficiality' and it decribes a world where people can't disagree or be frank with eachother; this might be a cultural angle that hasn't been taken into account. A balance is certainly worth looking for sometimes as the 'rules' suggested are only looked at from the positive side; that seems a downside of this book.If I had to pick one 'rule' I really like it would be the simple, but oh so effective; ""Smile"". What bad can it cause? Overall, I'd still give this book 5 stars since even though its a little bit old, it's written in a great way, and let's be honest it's just a great positive book that hss some great insights and take aways to share about human relationships."
264,0671027034,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1042653-ashlie,5,"This is one of the most profound books to understand others behaviors and in teaching you skills to communicate effectively with others. A lot of the information is quite basic, but the examples and the message is quite profound. It has certainly made me stop and reevaluate my responses with others in the past few weeks when needing to work through difficult professional and personal situations. I think this book is a must read and will continue to be timeless classic book."
265,0671027034,http://goodreads.com/user/show/931082-arminius,4,"This book lays out a plan you can use to succeed in life.To make friends:Never criticize, show sincere appreciation, find out what others want and show them how to get it, become interested in them, smile at them, and know their name.To Influence:Praise and appreciate, ask questions instead of giving a direct order, give the other person a reputation to live up to, and make the other person happy about doing what you suggest. "
266,0671027034,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5610133-sologdin,1,"Douchey crap, overall. There should, that is, be no need for a text that argues one should actually listen to what others say or that sometimes criticism and complaints get on people's nerves.Other items, such as stating one's interlocutor's name with frequency, is just manifestly obsequious, and constantly smiling is plain oleaginous, a recipe for resting douchebag face."
267,0671027034,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7810515-una-tiers,5,This was a re-read. I'd forgotten it was about positive thinking and all the benefits it has.
268,0671027034,http://goodreads.com/user/show/13329837-rachel,5,"Everyone could benefit from reading this right now, when the world is more divided than ever.The main takeaway is to empathize with others and see things from their point of view.This is great, age-old advice for business and personal success. I’ve actually learned a lot of these techniques in my business classes. I admit I’m not the best at applying these principles, even though I’ve been familiar with them for a long time. This was an amazing refresher.Basically, you can’t create positive change in the world by attacking, criticizing or belittling others. Real change comes from finding empathy, compassion and common ground."
269,0671027034,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4992138-brittany,5,"This is truly and oldie but a goodie. It was written in the 1930s, but has been updated a few times and is still very readable.The title has more to mock in it than the rest of the book. It's not as corny or pedantic as that title makes it sound. Frankly, I think, ""How to Be a Decent Human Being in Ways You Know You Should Know About Already, but Don't"" would probably be better.I can see that if you truly take most of the advice in this book to heart, it will definitely have a positive influence on your life. I picked it up as a recommended reading for salespeople at work, but it goes way beyond that.The best part about the book is the fact that is mostly made up of fascinating anecdotes that Carnegie uses to illustrate the instructive points he's trying to make. How will talking about someone's kids help you make a sale? How will smiling at your wife over you cereal in the morning revolutionize your home life? You gotta read to find out.If you're like me, by the end of the book, you will have a whole list of people from your life who you wish you could force to read it."
270,0671027034,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9777942-joe,3,"Popular self-help books have the most misleading titles. Men are From Mars Women are from Venus, for example, promises a provocative thesis but proves a bland and repetitive read. By contrast, The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People enlightens the mind and tugs at the heart despite its dry label.And so it is with How to Win Friends and Influence People. The title suggests cloak-and-dagger tactics. 'Winning friends' implies competition; that if you don't win them someone else will! And 'influencing people' implies trickery; how to get them to do what's best for you, instead of what's best for themselves.Yet the content of the book proves warm and friendly. Tips include admitting fault when you've erred, showing sincere interest in other people and putting effort into learning their names. These ideas are supported by a series of heartwarming anecdotes from historical figures and ordinary people from Carnegie's day. The overall theme is that if you do right by others they'll do right by you.Toward the end, there's a suggestion or two that feel like psychological tricks. For example, there's a chapter on that old sales tactic of asking a lot of yes/no questions (Are you feeling well today? Have you used a product like ours before?) to get someone saying 'yes' so they'll be primed to say 'yes' once you start your sales-pitch. But these were exceptions to the rule and felt mild compared with what I was expecting.I have to wonder why the book wasn't named 'How to make friends and get along with people?' I guess the sneakier title helps attract competitive business types; roping them in with the promise of shady tactics before giving them flowers and sunshine. The title implies underhanded schemes but may be the most underhanded element of the book.Edited 5-21-2017"

I am friendlier and more influential now.I owe it all to Dale Carnegie, the failed actor from Missouri who discovered he had a knack for jazzing up people’s confidence. His foundational work, “How to Win Friends & Influence People,” blasted off in 1936, but for anyone who wants a pill-sized dose of encouragement, a “mini abridged edition” is being released this week to celebrate the book’s 80th year.You could call “How to Win Friends & Influence People” the grandfather of America’s self-help movement, except this grandfather is running circles around the rest of the industry, selling 300,000 copies last year.

I really appreciate the focus on kindness and positively, especially in avoiding letting appreciation become empty flattery. But like... at one point Carnegie randomly tells a “plain” acquaintance that she’s capable of greatness... and then sort of takes responsibility for changing her life? Because suddenly she was confident and into skin care and got married. I think men sometimes inflate how important a single compliment is to a woman.There is a lot of good information on how to use positive reinforcement and “make people want what you want” and a lot of great reminders for dealing with people tho!"
274,0671027034,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5875398-rebecca,3,"For a book to have been in print continuously for nearly 80 years, it must be doing something right. Many of the principles are still applicable, but Carnegie’s case studies struck me as hopelessly outdated as well as exclusively American (the Teapot Dome scandal?!). In teaching public speaking to thousands of businessmen, he developed pointed advice for how to get people to like you and do what you want. Examples: show genuine interest in others and draw out their stories, express sincere appreciation, and try to see things from the other person’s point of view. Although he insists this is not about trickery or flattery, I still sensed a hint of manipulation. A lot of what he says just seems like common sense, but he spells it out and puts it all together in a helpful, reader-friendly format. He also draws on anecdote and experience, much like contemporary self-help authors like Gretchen Rubin and Brené Brown."

276,0671027034,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1586355-chad-warner,4,"Despite its manipulative-sounding title, this book is about genuinely improving your social skills and winning people to your way of thinking. Although I generally agree with his principles, I think Carnegie makes following them sound too easy.Carnegie states that 15% of success is due to technical knowledge, and the other 85% is due to personality and leadership. He says that the #1 secret to success in dealing with people is having a sympathetic grasp of the other person’s point of view. He talks a lot about respecting and understanding other people, and quotes Ralph Waldo Emerson: ""Every man I meet is my superior in some way. In that, I learn of him.""Carnegie also talks a lot about praise; he says that praise is more effective than criticism for changing behavior and winning people over, so you should be “hearty in your approbation and lavish in your praise.”The book includes lessons from people like Jesus, Confucius, Buddha, Abraham Lincoln, Andrew Carnegie, Ben Franklin, John Rockefeller, Charles Schwab, and J.P. Morgan. Carnegie provides anecdotes of his own experiences, and those of the people who took his courses.I first read this book when co-workers suggested I improve my social skills, because I received many recommendations for this book. I re-read it because the lessons are so important and worthwhile.Below are the book's principles, along with my notes.Fundamental Techniques in Handling People1. Don't criticize, condemn, or complain.• Criticism is futile.2. Give honest and sincere appreciation.• Avoid flattery.3. Arouse in the other person an eager want.• Salespeople need to show how their products and services solve customers’ problems• Each party should gain; there must be mutual benefit.Six Ways to Make People Like You1.

Force yourself; feeling follows action.3. Remember that a man's Name is to him the sweetest and most important sound in any language.• To remember names, tie the name to a person’s features, use the person’s name in conversation, and write and memorize the name.4. Be a good listener. Encourage others to talk about themselves.• To be a good conversationalist, listen and pay attention.• To be interesting, be interested.5.

278,0671027034,http://goodreads.com/user/show/25883565-gator,4,"Dale Carnegie put together one heck of a book, I’ve already begun applying his techniques and advice to great success, with my wife, children and clients. My wife and I run a small business and sometimes clients can be a real pain in the behind, I used to sometimes sass back but after reading this life guide I’ve begun to sing a different tune, and the results speak for themselves, they are very positive. This book can be used as a life guide, whenever we run into issues dive into Carnegie’s book and you may just find what you’re looking for. I will definitely be recommending this and re reading in the future. Below are some of my favorite quotes. ""It is an old and true maxim that 'a drop of honey catches more flies than a gallon of gall.' So with men, if you would win a man to your cause, first convince him that you are his sincere friend.”-Abe Lincoln “All men have fears, but the brave put down their fears and go forward, sometimes to death, but always to victory” was the motto of the King’s Guard in Ancient Greece.  “You must develop a deep, driving desire to learn, a vigorous determination to increase your ability to deal with people” “Any fool can criticize, condemn, and complain — and most fools do.”“The deepest urge in human nature is the desire to be important … always make the other person feel important.” “Listening is one of the highest compliments we can pay anyone.”“There is only one way under the high heaven to get the best of an argument — and that is to avoid it. Avoid arguments as you would rattlesnakes and earthquakes.”“We are interested in others when they are interested in us.”“In our interpersonal relationships, we should never forget that all our associates are human begins and hunger for appreciation.”"

There are some interesting examples and valuable thoughts, though I struggled to enjoy this read for a number of factors;- The writing itself wasn't particularly interesting or eloquent- The repetition was tiresome - whilst it was purposefully repeated, it made me feel bored and patronised- Not only were actual sentences repeated - the ideas and concepts in the book were all similar conveyed in a slightly different variant- Examples seem to form the main bulk of the content which made the book feel like a collection of anecdotesOn top of all of the above, I feel like anyone taking the advice in this book too seriously would end up being walked over; pleasing people, letting others take the credit, always being the bigger person, never complaining or criticising. As such, I feel like these ideas need to be taken with a large pinch of salt and maybe in this way one or two may become useful in small doses!"

As I was looking through my bookshelfs this afternoon, I found a very old copy of this classic. It must have come from my father's library as it is marked as a 77th printing - probably printed in the early 50's. I LOVE old books...The best tidbit to share from this book, is if you want people to like you, emulate a dog. Carnegie says: ""When you get within ten feet of him, he will begin to wag his tail. If you stop and pat him, he will almost jump out of his skin to show you how much he likes you. And you know that behind this show of affection on his part, there are no ulterior motives: he doesn't want to sell you any real estate, and he doesn't want to marry you."""

The facts and stories presented in the book are awesome. Every chapter leads us to a better person. While reading this, after finishing every chapter I felt rejuvented and motivated.

Basically, it argues that if you earnestly invest in other people, care about them in ways that few people do, you will have success throughout your life. As many others have already commented, the name of the book leads you to believe that it will be a load of sleaze. And indeed, the book's title did put me off it for quite a while. After all, this is a book about how to influence people. For the most part, I haven't found the part of the book where the sleaze comes out. One thing I am wondering about however is how the book will address dealing with horrible people: with the tyrants, emotion terrorists, or just plain whiners. More importantly--the first rule: not criticizing anyone. That seems like it would take quite a toll after a while. "

287,0671027034,http://goodreads.com/user/show/17442587-hannah,0,"Well, I thought a lot of things while reading this. I admit I wasn't too gung-ho about the book in the first place, and read it because it was assigned reading at work. I've heard about Carnegie plenty of times in the past and was pretty sure he wasn't the sort of author whose philosophies I'd give five stars to.However, I did try to read it objectively. Yes, he is a proponent of the ""social gospel"" of his time, but it also wasn't as bad as I thought it might be (I didn't end by throwing the book across the room. So far, Descartes remains alone in the dubious distinction of being lobbed at the further wall). I'll write my review in sections according to the structure of the book.Part one: Fundamental Techniques in Handling People1. Don't criticize, condemn, or complain.Point given: no one wants to be around a whiner. Sure, I agree with that.Application made: Lawbreakers, such as Al Capone and Two Gun Crowley, believed themselves to be good people at heart, even helpers of the community: ""people don't criticize themselves for anything, no matter how wrong it may be....Criticism is futile because it puts a person on the defensive and usually makes him strive to justify himself. Criticism is dangerous because it wounds a person's precious pride, hurts his sense of importance, and arouses resentment.""All right, wait a moment here. If my friends never voice any criticism, how would I know I'm wandering around with mud on my cheek? with a stain on my blouse? How am I to know that something is wrong? The last thing I wish to do is wander through life with the rest of the world afraid to let me know what I'm doing wrong. Constructive criticism is a good thing. As a music teacher, it is imperative that sometimes I get to say, ""No. Don't do it that way."" Why? Because certain positions can be harmful to the student's muscles and a hindrance to their progress. I compliment them on progress made and tell them how to make it better. It requires much less time and intellectual fishing than trying to influence them to deduct that the position may not be to their greatest advantage.2. Give honest and sincere appreciation.Point given: Everyone is glad to know they are valuable.Application: If you want people to do something for you, your best bet is to make them want to do it. Using an application of Sigmund Freud's and Dewey's theories that every man has ""the desire to be great"" or ""the desire to be important,"" Carnegie mentions the successes who have made themselves great--Lincoln and Dickens--and moves on to criminals. ""The average young criminal...is filled with ego...If you tell me how you get your feeling of importance, I'll tell you what you are. That determines your character,"" he finishes. Mr. Carnegie, I beg to differ. What puffs your chest out is not the sum total of who you are. That is only one symptom of the man as a whole. Are you trustworthy? Are you a friend to others? If you are either of those, or of any other things, and yet lack a real feeling of importance, it does not make you a nobody, as Carnegie more than implies. Finding your self-worth is not the only goal in life for a successful person.He continues the chapter by giving examples of people who have gone insane because of having unfulfilled dreams in life...well, nobody can quite say it for sure, of course, but this is his argument: ""...the other half of people who go insane apparently have nothing wrong with their brain cells...Why do these people go insane? [the doctor he spoke with said] Nobody knows for sure. But he did say that many people who go insane find in insanity a feeling of importance that they were unable to achieve in the world of reality."" His implication is clear that some people prefer to lose touch with reality than to lose touch with their dreams and their exalted view of themselves.What about flattery? We do get warned against flattery. ""Flattery is counterfeit, and like counterfeit money, it will eventually get you into trouble if you pass it to someone else...Flattery is telling the other person precisely what he thinks about himself."" But to give a person compliments in the hope of gaining one's own ends reeks of insincerity. The examples given show that a sloppy person will suddenly do a great job when given praise instead of critique. I'm sorry, but I've tried this. Contrary to Carnegie's opinion, people are not all going to do what you want if you convince them they are good people and they do a good job. All too many react with pleasure at the status quo and see absolutely no need to do better. So I will add that, yes, it's wonderful to appreciate others. But it is wrong and often cruel to them to make them think they are perfect when they are doing a sloppy job that may cause danger to others (such as breaking health laws or leaving messes in walkways.) Carnegie denies the implication that making someone want what you want by telling them how good they are is manipulation, but in most of the examples it slides dangerously close to that line.3. Arouse in the other person an eager want.Point given: People's acts are entirely driven by their wants.Application: To impose what we want, we have to convince others that they want what we want more than they want what they want...that, in fact, what we want is even better than what they wanted in the first place. While I'm all for positive inspiration, this message has a sordid underbelly.Carnegie believes that all actions have one root: desire. The only way to change a person's actions is to change their desires. He does not believe that people will gladly follow rules unless there is something in it for them. In the previous chapter, he posited that those appreciated will do a great job merely because someone's compliment makes them wish to do well. Yes, I do agree that continual criticism will sap a person's motivations, but praise all the time is not necessarily a motivator. According to Carnegie's philosophy, there are no people who are lazy for the joy of being lazy. Or, if there are such people, all they need is someone to come along and affirm them and present to them a good reason to get up and do a good job.One of the examples given is of a child who refused to eat his vegetables despite being scolded by his parents. He had an issue with a neighborhood bully, and the father decided to use the bully as the force behind his argument. ""When his father explained that the boy would be able to wallop the daylights out of the bigger kid someday if he would only eat the things his mother wanted him to eat--when his father promised him that--there was no longer any problem of dietetics."" I'm sorry, but no parent can ever make a promise like that, because there is no guarantee of its being fulfilled. The boy may have grown to 5'6"" and the bully to 6'5"" and no vegetables in the world could reverse the sizes. Then where would the father's promise be? He has broken a promise to his child that he had no right to make in the first place. The father's persuasion becomes a lie. The two pages of the child's story show that they gained mastery over the child by ""making him feel important."" Another child eats her cereal because by preparing it she ""achieved a feeling of importance; she had found in making the cereal an avenue of self-expression.""The danger of Carnegie's philosophy in this point is that one's self-esteem becomes the generator of their actions. If their self-esteem fails, apparently they do a horrible job and are uninterested in good ideas. Well, that doesn't bear out in real life. Some people who have damaged self-worth are hard workers, and some with excellent self-worth are sloppy and lazy. But Carnegie's chapter ends with a quote: ""William Winter once remarked that 'self-expression is the dominant necessity of human nature.'"" Well, if we are so busy fueling the self-expression of all those around us, where are we? We see a goal and coax others to want that goal, but ourselves are left behind in the dust of their ascent.Part Two. Six Ways to Make People Like You(well, I feel quarrelsome just reading that. If everyone likes you there's something wrong with your self-expression, because in being all things to all people there is no room left to be yourself.)1. Become genuinely interested in other people.All well and good, except he makes the cynical point ""People are not interested in you. They are not interested in me. They are interested in themselves--morning, noon, and after dinner."" So we are to figure out some way to become genuinely interested in others, to be silent when they talk, to encourage them always to express themselves around us.2. SmilePlease do!3. Remember that a person's name is to that person the sweetest and most important sound in any language.Helpful, but not the ""sweetest sound"" he claims. It's nice to remember names, but that honestly doesn't influence me much. I wonder if other people are more influenced by this, and I'm just some sort of anomaly? When I'm at work and someone comes through my checkout line, if it's a stranger I don't know, I'm not at all tempted to give them a bigger drink than they paid for because they say my name. Really, that's creepy...being nice to me doesn't entitle them to more of the company's food than they paid for, anyway. It isn't my food to give away.4. Be a good listener. Encourage others to talk about themselves.This one's easy...Other people's lives are just interesting. A side effect of being a hopeful novelist.5. Talk in terms of other people's interests.This creeps back towards flattery and worse. ""You want me to be your friend because I can do thus and so for you."" Isn't that just asking others to exploit your talents? I don't want friends who want me only on the basis of what I can do for them. When seeking a job, yes. But not when seeking friends.6. Make the other person feel important--and do it sincerely.This reminded me of an Andy Griffith show I saw recently on Netflix. Aunt Bee makes horrible pickles, but Andy and Barney are determined to not make her feel bad. After going to great and hilarious lengths of deception, they are left doomed to eat a double batch of bad pickles. They were sincere in their desire to please Aunt Bee because they could recognize she'd worked hard on those pickles. But it didn't rebound in their favor. They were insincere and deceptive in their effort to reward her for her work.Making others feel important isn't going to automatically result in a handout of exactly what you wanted. This action, done in order to gain a goal (as shown in the examples), is risky indeed, and oftentimes even deceptive.....out of time....more tomorrow and later on my blog...including ""Carnegie's book in light of Scripture."""
288,0671027034,http://goodreads.com/user/show/16996132-abeer-abdullah,2,"Working with a wide variety of people in my particular function in my company has left me seeking guidance on how to approach people, how to influence them, guide them and understand them. This is a great challenge for me for many reasons, for one thing I am over a decade younger than most people I am trying to influence, I am a 24 years old Arab girl who studied poetry who is trying to give council to and work with 40 year old Arab male engineers. Who, rightfully, may see it as ridiculous and be dismissive. It feels like a genuinely impossible task. Consequently, I am now trying to read as much about effective communication as possible, but it seems that a lot of the so called classics and best sellers are just incredibly shallow, and without true substance. This book tries to put forward the idea that empathy is at the core of winning friends and influencing people. As true as that is, it is not something revolutionary for us now in the early 21st century. Harvard Business Review's collection of books on various topics such as Emotional Intelligence and Communication for me have proved much more effective. They give detailed analysis, up to date studies, and real life examples. "
289,0671027034,http://goodreads.com/user/show/54266751-jennifer,4,"I really enjoyed this book. The advice is timeless and is as relevant today as it was eaight year's ago. I stumbled across How to Win Friends & Influence People while looking for something on change management. I wanted a book that explored the human component and not the process piece of change management.Dale Carnegie illustrates each lesson, or principle, by using both professional and personal examples. I love Carnegie’s writing style and use of words, which had a calming effect and transported me back in time. An informative and enjoyable read."
290,0671027034,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5789353-giselle,4,"Great advice, which is pretty much a given for any business person. There’s a lot of name dropping in almost every chapter. And he provides you with a ton of examples for each part. A quick and easy read if you’re looking at ways to understand people more."
291,0671027034,http://goodreads.com/user/show/88366321-jeffrey-egolf,0,I think I should wait for the book club meeting to post this review.
292,0671027034,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10471943-igor-ljubuncic,2,"So ... I am opposed to self-help books. I don't believe in self-help books. I think they are paradoxical in that people who read them expect a miraculous solution to an internal problem and those who don't read them probably don't need them in the first place. Moreover, most of these fall into a very typical template - written for the US audience and revolving around some well-proven formulas with a significant monetary incentive.The only reason I decided to try to read this book was because a valued colleague recommended it, as it has had a profound impact on his life. Disassociating his experience from the novel I set about reading, and soon I realized, it is impossible to not judge this book through the eyes of my colleague and the sum of his life's doings. Which is why the message that worked so successfully for him does not work for me at all. Because the way we have lived our lives and approach our problems are completely different, and so is the depth, scope, magnitude, and variety of our problems.I munched through three chapters before giving up. The material is repetitive, with one example after another rehashing the one-liner message summarized at the end of each chapter. Almost like whoever is reading needs convincing that what is being told is the way to do it. And perhaps it is, but a bullet-list would work equally well, if the reader is willing to embrace the message. So maybe the book is all about convincing people into trying to change their lifestyle rather than actually learning some helpful tips, if that's actually possible, on how to manage life situations.I like the concept, the ideas are noble - and valid - but the delivery mechanism completely fails me. I realize that I'm 100% not the intended audience, and that the message is designed to instill introspection, regret, remorse, enlightenment, and illumination, which I failed to grasp. Not because I'm cold-hearted, obstinate, stubborn, or opposed to change, simply because I do not need convincing 100x over that I should do XYZ. Be considerate to people and compliment them. Yes. Agreed. No need to repeat that on 10 pages of text with 27 examples. One is enough.What is missing for me is context. There isn't enough of it - so you know that people did something and that it worked for them, but not the WHY. And that's more important than actions, because anyone can be lucky, or look back and justify their successes by creating a template that fits the bill. Because let's face it, people don't write books on how to be successful BEFORE they become successful. Hindsight is camp.All in all, there's nothing wrong with the book. But it can be 99% shorter, the message can be summed up on one page, and most importantly, the book is there to reaffirm people's needs in doing things that they have already set about doing, or they are facing an existential crisis and grasping for straws of hope. In other words, if you're not one of the two, or you don't believe books can help you change, which, let's face it, they can't, unless you're already set on making that happen, and the fact you consider buying this book is the VERY step needed to change, then you will not enjoy it. Like hypnosis. It takes a willing patient. Otherwise, you can spend your time just being nice to people than reading how other people succeeded by doing things that worked for them, and you hope to be able to achieve one day, the same illusive way glamor and status are the coveted jewels of celebrities.How to win friends and influence people?Be nice. Listen to others. Try not to be a c**t. That's it.Now go back to your life and enjoy the passive-aggressive PC nonsense at your workplace :)Igor"
293,0671027034,http://goodreads.com/user/show/108599067-wout-biesheuvel,5,"The book is quite a nice read; short fun anecdotes based around some of the insights the writer is willing to share. I'd suggest taking his advice with a grain of salt but there certainly are things that I know that work, and that are great when applied. Some other things give me this weird feeling of 'fake superficiality' and it decribes a world where people can't disagree or be frank with eachother; this might be a cultural angle that hasn't been taken into account. A balance is certainly worth looking for sometimes as the 'rules' suggested are only looked at from the positive side; that seems a downside of this book.If I had to pick one 'rule' I really like it would be the simple, but oh so effective; ""Smile"". What bad can it cause? Overall, I'd still give this book 5 stars since even though its a little bit old, it's written in a great way, and let's be honest it's just a great positive book that hss some great insights and take aways to share about human relationships."
294,0671027034,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1042653-ashlie,5,"This is one of the most profound books to understand others behaviors and in teaching you skills to communicate effectively with others. A lot of the information is quite basic, but the examples and the message is quite profound. It has certainly made me stop and reevaluate my responses with others in the past few weeks when needing to work through difficult professional and personal situations. I think this book is a must read and will continue to be timeless classic book."
295,0671027034,http://goodreads.com/user/show/931082-arminius,4,"This book lays out a plan you can use to succeed in life.To make friends:Never criticize, show sincere appreciation, find out what others want and show them how to get it, become interested in them, smile at them, and know their name.To Influence:Praise and appreciate, ask questions instead of giving a direct order, give the other person a reputation to live up to, and make the other person happy about doing what you suggest. "
296,0671027034,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5610133-sologdin,1,"Douchey crap, overall. There should, that is, be no need for a text that argues one should actually listen to what others say or that sometimes criticism and complaints get on people's nerves.Other items, such as stating one's interlocutor's name with frequency, is just manifestly obsequious, and constantly smiling is plain oleaginous, a recipe for resting douchebag face."
297,0671027034,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7810515-una-tiers,5,This was a re-read. I'd forgotten it was about positive thinking and all the benefits it has.
298,0671027034,http://goodreads.com/user/show/13329837-rachel,5,"Everyone could benefit from reading this right now, when the world is more divided than ever.The main takeaway is to empathize with others and see things from their point of view.This is great, age-old advice for business and personal success. I’ve actually learned a lot of these techniques in my business classes. I admit I’m not the best at applying these principles, even though I’ve been familiar with them for a long time. This was an amazing refresher.Basically, you can’t create positive change in the world by attacking, criticizing or belittling others. Real change comes from finding empathy, compassion and common ground."
299,0671027034,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4992138-brittany,5,"This is truly and oldie but a goodie. It was written in the 1930s, but has been updated a few times and is still very readable.The title has more to mock in it than the rest of the book. It's not as corny or pedantic as that title makes it sound. Frankly, I think, ""How to Be a Decent Human Being in Ways You Know You Should Know About Already, but Don't"" would probably be better.I can see that if you truly take most of the advice in this book to heart, it will definitely have a positive influence on your life. I picked it up as a recommended reading for salespeople at work, but it goes way beyond that.The best part about the book is the fact that is mostly made up of fascinating anecdotes that Carnegie uses to illustrate the instructive points he's trying to make. How will talking about someone's kids help you make a sale? How will smiling at your wife over you cereal in the morning revolutionize your home life? You gotta read to find out.If you're like me, by the end of the book, you will have a whole list of people from your life who you wish you could force to read it."
