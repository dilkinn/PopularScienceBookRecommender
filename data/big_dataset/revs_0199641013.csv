But I stuck with it and am glad to have done so because, even though I am not convinced he is correct, he does manage to present a plausible, general theory of how life began on earth, or for that matter how it begins anywhere in the universe.Pross marks out his territory by dividing the search for life's origin into two camps with different approaches. There is the historical approach, which attempts to determine the how, the actual events that may have transpired on prebiotic Earth 4 billion years ago, such as the famous Miller-Urey experiments. Pross dismisses these as needle-in-haystack efforts that have little chance of stumbling upon the correct answer given that very little is known about prebiotic conditions which could have varied widely in time and place.In contrast, the ahistorical approach, which Pross favors, attempts to answer the general question of why life would evolve from inanimate matter. From that point forward he begins to lay out his answer to the question. In doing so he covers familiar ground, for example the ongoing debate as to which came first metabolism or replication and the question of why chirality or 'handedness' exists in life's basic molecules.I won't spoil it for you by giving his answer here, but I will say that for me there was no great 'Aha!' moment. I appreciated the case that he built but in the end it did not seem to shed any great new light on the problem. He himself said that Darwin almost came up with the same answer 130 years ago.Although Pross dismisses the historical approach and its various camps—the ventists, the pondists, the RNA World, the Clay World, the Lipid World, etc., I found the assessment of the these efforts much more interesting as they were laid out in Robert Hazen's book Genesis: The Scientific Quest for Life's Origins."
1,0199641013,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6243880-gary-beauregard-bottomley,2,"The author offers nothing towards answering the title ""What is Life"" and offers nothing but the most simplistic presentation for addressing the subtitle ""How Chemistry Becomes Biology"".When he does address the title, he forces the presentation into his preferred world view of teleonomy (just a fancy way of saying animate objects are teleological and inanimate objects are not, whatever).He's going to equate maximum efficiency with DKS (dynamic kinetic systems) and explain that life arises from that process.I did get irritated at the author. He makes the statement along the lines ""to understand the what of life, one first needs to know the how it came about, and then take the particular to the general and then make the universal principals before proceeding"". I fault that formulation in order for understanding and explaining of nature. (It's a very Kantian formulation of science, and I saw it just as an excuse for the author to not address the title of the book).The author really added nothing new whatsoever to my understanding of what is life and where did it come from. There was nothing new or novel in this book. Books like this one are why I slowed down reading science books. They need to teach me something new, something I did not already know, and be so good that I want to re-listen to them again for their novel presentations and the new insights they showed me. This book did none of those things.I wasted my time with this book. I would recommend Hazen's Great Course Lecture, ""Origins of Life"", Wagner's ""Arrival of the Fittest"" which considers the topology of the possible maximum efficiency paths which ""What is Life"" tries to explain from time to time but not adequately, and I would recommend, Rutherford's ""Creations: How Science is Reinventing Life Itself"", a book which is not too simple and not too complex but explains the things presented in this book as they should have been (and regretfully which seems to have been completely ignored by the reading (and listening) public). "
2,0199641013,http://goodreads.com/user/show/30395222-joy-yan,5,"I read this book a year ago in the summer of my high school senior year, when I still wanted to major in neuroscience. It was like an unexpected treasure I found in the library. Now everything has changed but the book stayed amazing. It's scientific, but pretty easy to understand. Most importantly, the content is about the origin of life, the mysterious, unsolved matter which always interests me so much. The book offers an amazing insight about it. For the first time I thought I got more information than ""oh we still know nothing about where life came from"", and that is absolutely outrageous! Honestly I was so amazed by life and human brain, and that was why I wanted to study neuroscience; even now I have switched my major to math. Maybe it's because I thought life was so complicated that it's more for me to be amazed. It's like art. Besides, I love math more than I thought in high school."
3,0199641013,http://goodreads.com/user/show/223837-nicky,3,"I’m rather underwhelmed by this book. Though it is praised as “uncover[ing] the chemical roots of Darwinian theory, thereby opening a novel route connecting biology to chemistry and physics” (and by a Nobel prize winner, no less!), I think this route is far from novel. It’s always been obvious to me that biology is chemistry in living cells, that all the rules of chemistry derive from properties described by physics, and indeed that physics is based on mathematics and mathematics on logic. This just doesn’t seem revelatory to me — it’s apparent from the first time you understand that enzymes are simply manufactured catalysts and that RNA can replicate itself. And I understood that when I was doing my AS Level in biology, if not before, so that was 2007. This wasn’t published until 2012! So I can’t have unconsciously absorbed the conclusions of this book via somewhere else.As a survey of exactly how the subjects link up, it works relatively well. The writing is clear and the logic works, and if you didn’t connect the dots for yourself, it allows you to do so. It’s perhaps a little more specific than my 2007 understanding, referencing RNA experiments I hadn’t heard of, but the basic theory has always been apparent to me. I don’t understand how it is considered controversial or groundbreaking.Perhaps this is more surprising to scientists who have been stuck within their own segregated area, though. As an outsider whose contact with science was limited to New Scientist and popular science books from 2007 to 2014, perhaps my simpler view of things helped me to connect the dots, where an actual biologist just couldn’t accept that biology is simply chemistry when it seems so much more complex. It seems odd to me, but it’s all I can think of. And it’s not as though I’m a chemistry or physics superfan — I’m happy to stay on the level of biology!Originally reviewed for The Bibliophibian."
4,0199641013,http://goodreads.com/user/show/19030730-abi-ghifari,2,"At least once in our lifetime, we must be wondering why we live, what is our purpose in life, and why does life even begin in the first place? While there are no definitive answers to those questions, science can at least provide a glimpse of thoughts to answer what life is and how does the life begin. Addy Pross, a professor of organic chemistry at Ben-Gurion University, Israel, explores the answers to ‘what is life?’ that science has provided so far, which also becomes the title of this book. With an homage to a text with the same title by the famed quantum physicist Erwin Schrödinger, Pross focuses on answering the question on the chemistry point of view, which he explained as a “bridge between physics and biology”.The author begins the book by explaining the striking differences between living and non-living things despite the atoms that made them are the same. As nature tends to push the system towards chaos and disorder, not towards order, how can living things, which represent order and function, be formed from the same dead atoms and molecules as in the non-living? This book attempts to explain life from the view that biology composed of chemical molecules that obey physical laws. Pross highlights some of the ground-breaking chemical experiments that were trying to answer the origin of life, especially around the ‘RNA world’ hypothesis which readers may find it interesting. For example, Sol Spiegelman and Gerald Joyce separate experiments on molecular replication suggest that a string of RNA (ribonucleic acid, a molecule similar to DNA that regulates gene expression) may replicate itself in a test tube without the need of a complex system. Replicating RNAs may compete, mutate, adapt, and evolve, thus demonstrating Darwin’s evolutionary theory on a molecular level.Nevertheless, there are still many questions left unanswered. For instance, even if RNA is indeed the precursor of life, how does RNA form DNA and proteins, to establish the living system as we know today. There are also no suggestions on how RNA was formed in the first place. Also, how all those biological molecules form a compartment, which we later know as a cell, that is capable of maintaining dynamic stability as opposed to its disordered environment is left unexplained. Some descriptions to answer these questions may improve the book and appeal to more readers. A chapter in this book also extensively explains the philosophical views of life, particularly teleonomy and Aristotelian philosophy, which the reviewer found irrelevant in answering how chemistry becomes biology as the author proposed in the title. Some parts are also repetitive and contain excessive prose which may be illegible for general readers.What is life? is a suitable book for the lay audience and high school/university students who are interested in learning scientific evidence that attempt to elucidate the answers. However, some explanations require a basic understanding of scientific terminology and concepts. This book is a decent effort in enlightening the dark path of life’s origin to the broader society by integrating scientific concepts and evidence in physics, chemistry, and biology with some illustrations that clarify the text. Even though the book does not provide a clear answer, it is a good start for the readers who are eager to explore further the origin of life from a scientific perspective."
5,0199641013,http://goodreads.com/user/show/59682834-jerry-pogan,5,"I absolutely love reading stuff like this but, honestly, it completely overwhelms me. There is just an overload of information that I am unable to fully digest, but here's my take on what I think I learned. First, the title asks What is Life? but really what the book is saying is that we don't have an answer to that question yet and then explains why. So how did inanimate matter become alive? It is fairly certain that life began with self-replicating chemistry and progressed as mutations occurred during this process. Science is able to trace this process back through a continuous chain to what appears to be the original replicator but are unable to go beyond this. That is because replication needs biology to occur. So, whatever that event was, it appears that it must be extremely rare and probably almost impossible because if it weren't we should be able to trace life back to more than just one original source. However, I do see a paradox in this because of the fact that life appeared very quickly on Earth after it formed so it appears that life must actually form very easily. An explanation that occured to me is that the first life forms have been eating any newer ones as they appear but that explaination is completely based on my ignorance."
6,0199641013,http://goodreads.com/user/show/17525925-stephen,4,"My friend Manoj recently said, “In 5 billion years, an atom learned to talk.”This observation begs the question: How did the atom learn to talk? How did non-life become life?Pross sets out to answer this question and in so doing addresses many obstacles, the largest of which is Newton’s Second Law of Thermodynamics. If you’re unfamiliar with the Second Law of Thermodynamics, it states that ""In any cyclic process, the entropy will either increase or remain the same."" It is often expressed simply that ordered things tend towards chaotic over time and its inverse: Things that are chaotic will not tend towards order.Take your kitchen for example. Perhaps it is currently ordered: Every glass in the cupboard, every plate in its place. Over time, this ordered state (low entropy) will give way to more chaotic state (high entropy), where the plates have moved, cups shifted—and that’s even if your kids don’t move them around. Another way to think about the state of entropy in your kitchen is this: There are only a few ways that it can be set up in an orderly way, while there are an infinite number of ways it can be in a chaotic state. Thus, there is a really small chance of a low entropy ordered state.And yet life is like the clean kitchen: Ordered and arrived at from an earth of 5 billion years ago that was a bundle of happy chaotic atoms. What would motivate, drive, or otherwise suddenly bring order to these atoms, in defiance of the second law of thermodynamics, which is immutable in other contexts?Pross’s theory is that life is a natural consequence of the second law of thermodynamics. Remember that the second law of thermodynamics allows for low entropy ordered states, however improbable they may be. And what’s more, some of these low entropy ordered states may be highly persistent.Pross discusses the example of certain chemical replicating systems. RNA, for example, a nonliving complex chemical compound with an incredible property: It can create copies of itself. What’s more, in creating these copies, which it does at an alarming rate, it also creates RNA variants of itself. Some of those RNA variants are better at replicating than the original, and thus cause the original RNA copies to disappear over time, leaving the RNA variants as the stable form of RNA.What does RNA, this nonliving chemical do? Replicate, vary, compete, and stabilize. This chemical compound evolves.Evolution into something highly replicable and stable is thus a natural manifestation of chemistry. And from this it is Pross’s theory that one of the natural steps in chemistry is that nonliving chemicals can form replicable and stable chemicals that we call life."
7,0199641013,http://goodreads.com/user/show/16474414-mark,3,"If things did start as a tepid soup of various chemicals, what took place that led to non-living matter becoming alive, and ultimately to me typing ineffectual reviews on Goodreads? Pross' answer, while ultimately chemical, bridges the gap between chemistry and biology by exploring the development of chemical, replicative systems.While it takes a while to get into its stride, by the last third of the book I was hooked. The initial slow pace is partly because Pross takes a safe route and assumes an absolute minimum for background knowledge, even going so far as to describe the ins and outs of the scientific method. At times this helps to understand the limits of his following discussion on the origins of life, but mostly I found it a little patronising. When we get to the key part of the book we are made to understand the strengths and pit-falls of both the replicator-first and system-first models for the chemical origin of life, before exploring the new argument of the book in the shape of chemical systems. By the end of the book, as Pross expands the replication systems wider and wider, I felt very small and zen. Maybe the highlight for me was Pross' statement that while replication is a key aspect of life, ""to not replicate does not make you less alive, just a dead-end in a replicative system"". Cheers, Pross. Good to know."

9,0199641013,http://goodreads.com/user/show/26674095-gy,4,"The Story about the cloud where from dead things living things are made! - if I'd have to put it in brief, or much better: Story about things that tamper, interfere with the II. Law!(It's unlikely that some reader lacking basics of thermodynamics will jump on this book, but here is to test yourself: which law is going to kill us? The I or the II Law? If you have answer you may proceed, if no, I'd first take some lectures about these two laws!Adam and Eve vs. the Serpent! Since that dramatic moment when expelled from paradise, as per Genesis, when Eve opened our Pandora’s box (sounds funny, but I like to hammer on arousal with an oxymoron) our animal soul, our peace, our carefree happy-go-lucky way of life, our symmetry, our equilibrium was lost forever. We don't know who or what that Serpent was, but I'm rather seeing it/her/him as the moment, the strikingly most dramatic moment in entire human history when we ceased to exist as simple thoughtless, unconscious mammals, apes, animals, instead we became mindful, conscious self-aware living beings with potential to ask the most stressing two questions: who we are? What’s the purpose of our existence? We are like awakened from a long dream into this unknown dichotomous reality without any knowledge and memories, sentenced to search for origins, meaning and purpose. We are tormented for millennia with these unanswered questions originated from our self- awareness, and these are the scariest horror questions that have power to drive humans insane! We are restless to solve the secrets of biogenesis.  What Mr. Pross’s book is all about? I like to see the place where all the magic happens, where from the death molecules life molecules are formed, as a hazy magical cloud. Enrico Fermi would certainly say pointing into the middle: ""Here be Dragons!"" …and he would be right! We still struggle with this cloud. Mr. Pross book leads us right into the middle of that magic, into that cloud full of Dragons. Just to mention, there is another famous book with the title: ""What is Life?"". This one is written by Erwin Schrödinger. Schrödinger’s What is life is something amazing though some calling it booklet, little book - I can assure you that book is a brain killer! One must be relaxed and fit to encounter it properly! This ingenious physicist, the inventor of the famous quantum cat (Schrödinger’s Cat) made trial in defining what life is! The interesting fact is that we don’t have definition that would be acceptable to define life in its entire complexity and essence! Schrödinger’s is perhaps the best to fit claiming that life is something that resists entropy! Well, really close enough! The perfect starting point for the book I’m preparing this review: the stone-dead things that come alive and acting on way to violate the eternal tendency of the nature toward disorder, toward entropy! The only thing in the Universe, at least known for us, that tempers with the II law! It's like to be normal that stones rolls up on hill until reach the top without any influence..just by self!Mr. Pross leads us into the cloud of life creation with staggering precision. He will introduce the reader to some unusual aspects of observing the world of nonliving and living things and along that the relations and interactions between on most basic level. We'll find ourselves wondering over the cycles of transformations of non-living things into living and back! The author will show us the basic principles of our existence; he will introduce the teleonomic character of living our life. If this is unknown for the reader, she will be astonished with powerful imaging skills of Mr. Pross to present us the dichotomy of our reality, our interactions with seemingly two worlds that we have to learn to manage in order to make through. We’ll see that teleonomy is not just a privilege of humans and animal world, but living life by agenda is typical for all things that exhibit attributes of life! And that is the turning point back into the hazy cloud of creation, where from dead matter life is emerging somehow...someway!! And here we've arrived to the troublesome question: How?! how did a system capable of evolving come about in the first place? Darwinian theory is a biological theory and therefore deals with biological systems, whereas the origin of life problem is a chemical problem, and chemical problems are best solved with chemical (and physical) theories. Darwin himself explicitly avoided the origin of life question, recognizing that within the existing state of knowledge the question was premature. So the question of how the first microscopic complexity came into being remains problematic and highly contentious! Did a cellular precursor to that exquisitely complex miniature factory that is the living cell come together purely by chance, by the various bits and pieces randomly linking up in precisely the right manner?! We don't know, that's still mystery! Mr. Pross says: ""But, to draw on an analogy popularized by Fred Hoyle, the well-known astronomer, the likelihood of such an event would be similar to that of a whirlwind blowing through a junkyard and assembling a Boeing 747. Life’s organized complexity is strange, very strange. And how it came about is even stranger. ""For me, this part was the real journey, the greatest excitement, where all 3 crucial players, the physics, the chemistry and, the biology are together and a living, conscious human being built up from all those dead substances of the nature is trying to bridge them to explain the way of own existence, to explain the life! We are going to see the II law in action, we’ll having the bare basic chemistry on disposal to comprehend the principles that make possible to have chemistry at all, but all under the aegis of governing physics. The author will place us in the middle of that strange cloud where from inputs of multiply of dead molecules, somehow, someway a living self-replicated molecule will appear; the cloud where from dead matter a living being will emerge! From time to time I've found that setting exaggerated number of examples is slightly time consuming, however, his motivation to make the content comprehendible for the broadest audience is finally something very acceptable and valuable. After cleared up this with myself I was able to accept author’s way of unfolding the content. Clear, expository style! Scientific document reduced to level of broad audience. I'd certainly recommend for my kids some around high school years! Facts and knowledge this book hides in content are crucial for understanding the world we are living in. One of the best way to first time face with the term of death, and with life as well.I’m wishing to all readers exciting journey into the cloud of creation, and would like to say thank you to Mr. Pross! Great job, Sir!_______________________________Addy Pross took his B.Sc (Hons) and Ph.D degrees at the University of Sydney where he graduated in 1970. After postdoctoral work in London and Jerusalem he joined the Chemistry Department at Ben-Gurion University in 1973, where he is currently Professor of Chemistry. After working in the area of physical and theoretical organic chemistry for some 28 years he switched his field of interest to the chemistry-biology interface, and in particular to investigating the chemical roots of Darwinism and the Origin of Life question.

11,0199641013,http://goodreads.com/user/show/62878026-aravindakshan-narasimhan,4,"Learned a lot. Coming from non scientific background, the book gave me introduction to many scientific phenomenon and schools. Teleonomy, chirality, life's non equilibrium state in opposition to second law of thermodynamics, holism vs reductionism. The author makes the book and concepts as readable and understandable as possible. When explaining the difference between linear vs exponential he comes up with a famous legend- which I first read in a Indian context, here presented as a Chinese one (which is immaterial in any case) . ""If thatsounds too mathematical, let’s explain the difference by recountingthe classical legend of the Chinese emperor who was saved in battleby a peasant farmer. When the emperor asked the farmer how hecould reward him, the farmer took out a standard chess board andasked that he be rewarded with a quantity of rice, and that therequired quantity be established by a simple formula—placing asingle grain of rice on the ﬁrst square, two grains on the secondsquare,four on the third,and soon, right through to the 64th square.The request sounded absurdly modest and the emperor was sur-prised that the peasant would be happy with such a small reward.After all,how much rice could be needed?Half a sack,a wholesack?But the truth is that the amount of rice needed to comply with thepeasant’s request is spectacularly large. Mathematically the totalnumber of grains of rice placed on the board would be 264– 1. Thatworks out at close to 21019 grains—that's a lot of rice;more thancould be found in the emperor’s cellars, as well as in all the world’sChinese restaurants, and, in fact, more than exists anywhere on theentire planet. That quantity of rice, if it existed, would cover theentire earth’s surface to a depth of several centimetres""All this while explaining the difference between catalysis and autocatalysis progression difference (earlier following linear, while latter following exponential)But the last half of the book, when the author equates Darwin's evolution in 'his' system chemistry terms I felt he was extending it a bit too much, as well as I found it bit complex in places. So, on the whole my 4 stars would be because of some other reasons than the main purpose, the book sets out to take."
12,0199641013,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7231894-chris-branch,4,"If I'd read this book hoping to learn the actual sequence of events that led to the origin of life on Earth, I would have been disappointed. Luckily, I realize that if that kind of discovery had been made, I would have probably read about it already on a science blog somewhere. The Wikipedia article on abiogenesis, including all the various hypotheses that have been proposed, is long enough to almost qualify as a short book itself - so it's clear that there is no standard, generally agreed upon historical model.So I was curious to see what exactly this book would add to the discussion, and in that, I was not disappointed. Pross spends a surprisingly large portion of this fairly short volume presenting and then more or less dismissing what I would have considered promising lines of research into the origin of life. But all this pessimism was really just a setup for his refreshingly simple and perhaps unexpected conclusion, that abiogenesis is (okay, I suppose this is technically a SPOILER) really just evolution - natural selection applied originally to molecules (chemistry) before it applied to organisms (biology). Yes, this is science that shades a bit into philosophy, but it's philosophy that's backed up with solid concepts, just the specifics are unknown.It might have been nice if, after he'd shot down both the ""replication first"" and the ""metabolism first"" ideas, he'd come back to it later and proposed a concrete way that both might have come about together, since that would seem to have been the only option left! But that wasn't his purpose here; instead, he wanted to suggest that we can stop thinking of abiogenesis as something that required an as yet unknown process in order to occur; rather, it's just an extension of the survival of the fittest (most stable, in this case) from the world of biology down to the lower level world of chemistry. Pross does a fine job accomplishing this purpose, and no advanced scientific knowledge is required, so I can certainly recommend this concise book to anyone interested in the subject. "
13,0199641013,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3082950-tomislav,4,"I read this because it was book of the month on Goodreads.com's Science and Inquiry group, for January 2015. I had some concerns in the prologue and first chapter, because the author was emphasizing the seemingly unnatural nature of life, going so far as to refer to ""nature's design."" Design suggesting to me a designer. Then discussing teleonomy, the apparent purposefulness of life. Then referring to evolution as Darwinism, citing and critiquing original words by Charles Darwin. All in all, the book seemed to be navigating towards intelligent design. But that is not the case, this book is very much about abiogenesis, the natural origin of life. So what is life? Pross's definition is ""a self-sustaining kinetically stable dynamic reaction network derived from the replication reaction,"" and much of the book is in defining and justifying that terminology. My background in chemistry and biology is much less than in other sciences, so a lot of this was new to me. I would be one of those people who said biological life emerges out of the complexity of its constituent chemistry - but that is really just hand waving. In fact, it seems that complexity is the result of kinetically stable replicative chemical systems, rather than a cause.An accurate grounding in the second law of thermodynamics and in the principle of natural selection is needed. I studied this relatively small and dense text pretty closely, and all the reasoning seemed sound to me. But I am not really in a position to judge how conventional or innovative Pross's thinking might be to those engaged in the field. It extensively explores the conceptual gaps between chemistry and biology. Definitely a good springboard into deeper study."
14,0199641013,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1575042-antonia,5,"Wow, that was one good book!  What is life? And how did it emerge? How does inanimate matter become animate? Scientists on the whole do not dispute that it happened -- but cannot say how, or when or why. Pross studies replicative chemistry, work that started with Saul Spiegelman's work on RNA in the 60s. Here, he explains biology in chemical terms, but at the same time, shows how this chemical explanation fulfills what Darwin predicted 150 years ago.We normally think of abiogenesis and evolution as two distinct phases. But, he says, it's all one continuous process, from simple molecular systems to complex life. His argument bridges the gap between chemistry and biology. After reading this book, I couldn't help but think, how could it be otherwise? The bottom line seems to be this: The what, where, and when life began will continue to tantalize or torment us. But we can say how, or at least, we can have a model of how it began. Very clearly written. No particular expertise in chemistry or biology needed. Just an interest in the subject. I read it because I'd heard an interview with Pross and was fascinated."
15,0199641013,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6720671-bryan,3,"After spending the first few chapters outlining the major obstacles to developing a theory of abiogenesis, Pross then proceeds to lay out his proposed solution to the problem. I found his analysis of the intractable problems of abiogenesis to be insightful and spot on with what I know from my other reading in origin of life research. Then in the second half of the book he, almost too glibly, in my opinion, outlines his solution to the problem, which in a nutshell, is that life evolved from chemical networks of self-replicating systems. In order to make his theory even possibly plausible, he makes the assumption that life , for certain, arose from non-life by natural processes. He then proceeds to outline what he sees as the driving force of abiogenesis, dynamic kinetic stability (DKS).Like all theories of abiogenesis, this one also suffers from the same inherent problem, the needed ingredients to even get a system like he describes started is beyond statistical possibility. The only way Pross manages to maintain confidence in his theory, is the assumption that life DID arise by natural processes, thus his theory is the most likely way it happened."
16,0199641013,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2095464-andrew,5,"This dropped into my hands while I listened to the panspermia chatter surrounding the marvellous Rosetta/Philae mission to comet 67P last November. However, the book attempts to answer the 'how' rather than the 'whence life' question. Pross presents this in the principal of how abiogenesis occurs despite the constraints imposed on matter by the second law of thermodynamics. Pross argues simple chemical processes are the key to understanding how inert matter acquires the essential replicating and metabolizing properties that disclose living entities. His ideas merge with and incorporate Darwin's theory of evolution; so that we approach an ahistorical general law that explains life from its simple chemical origins to the complexification into all possible species. Pross accepts we may never know the primary organisms in the history of life on earth, but this idea like almost every sentence in this book is a wonderful discovery."
17,0199641013,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4629416-betsy,3,"This book was a bit difficult for me, since I have only high school science training. But it's an interesting topic so I stuck with it. And actually, I think the author did a pretty good job of making it intelligible for the layperson. I believe I understand his general theories. That biology is really just complex chemistry, which is just complex physics ... okay, I can buy that. That the biology of how life started can be better understood if we examine it in terms of chemical processes ... okay. A lot of what he does is redefinition in simpler terms, and it was helpful to me. I don't know how his theories hold up when reviewed by other scientists, but it doesn't matter that much to me. I feel like I understand the issues much better now."

Highly recommended if you're at least somewhat interested in the topic. If you have no background in natural sciences, the book might be a bit too advanced. I encourage readers to stick with it until the end."
19,0199641013,http://goodreads.com/user/show/21177142-roger,3,"I'd been looking forward to reading this book but then found it to be a little disappointing. Addy Pross is a chemist and his book seeks to show that biology (""life"") can be explained by chemistry. I'm also a chemist and to me it is self-evident that biology should be explainable by chemistry, in the same way that chemistry should be explainable by physics. At the same time, I'm mystified how life started and evolved at the chemical level. We know a tremendous amount about the chemical reactions that take place inside organisms yet we are no closer to understanding how it all started and, just as importantly, how it all hangs together and keeps going (after all, some of the reactions involved have been running non-stop for around 3.7 billion years). As Pross points out, non-living chemical systems seek to reach equilibrium by reducing free energy in accordance with the Second Law of Thermodynamics. On the other hand, living organisms exist far from equilibrium in a steady-state situation which requires organisms to continually take in energy (UV light, glucose, etc) so that every individual chemical reaction inside a cell still complies with the Second Law. It seems nigh on impossible to rationalise how pre-life molecules somehow transformed from an equilibrium-type existence to steady-state and I was hoping that the book would shed light on this.As well looking at the possible chemistry of abiogenesis (ie, how life originated from non-living matter), Pross also considers how chemistry might explain evolution from the Last Universal Common Ancestor (LUCA). Whereas other scientists have concentrated on how life may have started, Pross focuses on the driving forces that may have created life (which he calls the why). I feel this is a valid approach because, as he points out, conditions on the early earth would have varied considerably with time and location so if the aim is to recreate conditions on early earth to predict the chemistry what conditions does one choose? Even on earth today there are widespread differences in conditions, ranging from arid deserts to underwater vents to sub-zero regions to volcanoes, etc.In his opinion, which is shared by others, evolution began with ""inanimate"" molecules (RNA being the example he uses) that had the inherent ability to self-replicate through autocatalysis and, furthermore, not only evolving in the process (ie, changing their structure) but also competing for resources with other molecules that were sharing the same medium. This makes sense and Pross briefly summarises some RNA experiments that support these phenomena. However, given the importance of this in underpinning his subsequent arguments I felt more examples were needed. I didn't much enjoy Pross's style of writing. Some of what he said was fairly obvious yet here he seemed to labour his explanations to the point of exhaustion. In contrast, when he was on more speculative ground, to my mind he presented less evidence to bolster his arguments. This is no more so than when Pross introduces the term ""dynamic kinetic stability"" (which he abbreviates as DKS) as a measure of the stability of a population of organisms. Pross explains that DKS is relevant to situations that are in steady-state and he uses the River Thames as an example: the river doesn't alter much in appearance with time (so it is stable) but the water molecules passing any point are constantly changing (resulting in steady-state). His argument seems to be that the organism that can maintain steady-state the longest (ie, has the highest DKS) will come out on top from an evolutionary perspective. In fact, DKS is the centre pin of his book to the extent that he claims that ""survival of the fittest"" (the oft-quoted evolutionary expression) is equivalent to maximising DKS. From a search of Google, it seems to me that DKS is a term invented by Pross because all the top hits point to websites linked to him. I find that a little disconcerting because this is a strong indicator that the DKS concept is not widely accepted outside Pross's circle. Personally, I didn't find the idea well enough explained to pass judgement on its merits and Pross concedes that it's not a parameter that can be easily measured which must limit its predictive value. I was also left wondering whether DKS is an effect, rather than a cause: if the former then Pross is no closer to understanding the creation and evolution of life. In an early part of his book Pross discusses the relative pros and cons of reductionism and holism when applied to biology and he briefly touches on the topic of emergent properties. These are properties observed in complex systems that are not seen, or even predicted, when studying individual components of that system. It's a pity that he didn't pursue this line further because it must surely underpin many of the complexities of life and explain why the reductionism approach to researching life has provided a vast wealth of information yet has failed to define precisely what life is. By the end of the book I was in little doubt that this was the work of a scientist expounding his own, personal, DKS-oriented view on the creation and evolution of life. His theories may turn out to be right but at present I don't think they are widely shared. Therefore, this is not a good read for anyone interested in getting a general overview of the different theories in this field."

23,0199641013,http://goodreads.com/user/show/12118927-mike,2,"To me the central claim of the book just doesn't make sense - or correlate with basic facts of biological reality. The author claims that life ""began with replication"", but how can that possibly be, if every life we know of is enclosed in a membrane? How does one write a whole book on life, claiming that life ""is such"" i.e. replication, without even mentioning another ubiquitous condition of life: the phospholipid membrane? It boggles the imagination.What value this book can be said to have derives from the authors emphasis on RNA self-replication, where two strands of RNA mutually catalyze one another leading to large population. Now, this is an important insight to be added and integrated into any conversation about life: but it is not the only one! Another essential molecule relevant to the life process in all known living beings are proteins I.e. amino acids. Since proteins are actually the builders and building of the cell, nucleic acids cannot be given arbitrary superiority: amino acids matter as well. In other words, this book is overly reductionistic, and idealistic in thinking that RNA synthesis is THE beginning point, around which, of course, it will find a means to integrate a membrane, etc. This just-so story seems to apotheosize the RNA molecule into ""making life"". How else does one explain the singular focus on one molecular element of life i.e. nucleic acids, while ignoring the amino acids, phospholipids and co-factors, nevermind the background fact of water being the primary medium where all this chemistry is carried out - and still others would invoke the geometrical principle of symmetry. Indeed, Pross' RNA replicator could be said to be nothing more than a symmetry dynamic at the atomic level which 'settles' upon an RNA molecule because that molecule is geometrically/energetically coherent/stable in that particular setting. Apparently, it seems, context doesn't exist for Pross at the sub-molecular scale i.e. nucleic acids are granted a special 'individuality' that is denied to other molecules, let alone the geometrical facts at the emergent level i.e. the force of gravity on shape, social processes on feeling, etc"
24,0199641013,http://goodreads.com/user/show/101170669-james-miller,0,"Addy Pross, ""What is Life?"" (a criticism)My impression is that Pross proceeds in a reductionist way that fails to capture the dynamism of proto-life processes. His description of kinetic stability is not clearly explained. He sidesteps the question of thermodynamic stability, and for that I recommend Ilya Prigogine's book, ""The End of Certainty,"" which places thermodynamic stability squarely in the realm of probability. This approach is definitely a necessity if you want to posit self-organizing complex structures in a far-from equilibrium state. The statistical probability of the growth of entropy, experienced by any organized structure, cannot be overcome by a self-organized complex structure. It can only be staved off by utilizing energy in a constant battle against decay and dissolution.The development of energy metabolism within a complex structure is a sine qua non for persistent maintence of structure. Prigogine calls these hypothetical proto-life structures ""dissipative structures"" considering them from the standpoint of thermodynamic stability.Pross advocates the ""RNA world"" hypothesis. The problem is that RNA (or proto-RNA) self-replication, with or without catalysis, cannot natively contain information (codons). Codons themselves (genetic information) can only emerge as a result of a pre-existing stage of life (or proto-life). Without genetic information, repetitive RNA replication is lmeaningless -- it cannot produce complex structures. The RNA world hypothesis leads nowhere. Pross gives us some equations to demonstrate how self-organizing RNA-like formations can proliferate, replicate, and even undergo exponential growth. There is nothing wrong with this, but these cannot be seen as precursors of life. Precursors of life should be seen as dissipative structures which incorporate energy generation as an inherent feature of the ongoing structural process. For more on that hypothsis, I recommend Terrence Deacon's book, ""Incomplete Nature."" -- Jim Miller"
25,0199641013,http://goodreads.com/user/show/17056998-mark-moon,4,"Not a lot of technical details in this short book, but it still makes a good argument for its thesis: that biological evolution can and should be extended to the realm of chemistry via the emerging field of ""systems chemistry"", and that this is the best way to understand biology as a kind of chemistry - the replicative chemistry of autocatalytic reaction networks.While ordinary chemical systems tend towards stability in the form of thermodynamic equilibrium, so that they are most stable when they are least reactive, replicative chemical systems tend toward a kind of persistence called ""dynamic kinetic stability"" (DKS), which is measured by their ability to cause the existence of more instances of themselves in the future. Thus, autocatalytic replicative systems can become more stable in the sense of DKS by growing _more_ reactive (i.e. replicating faster). This splits chemistry in half, with some systems optimizing for the inertness of thermodynamic equilibrium, and others optimizing for DKS, which then subsumes the biological notion of ""fitness"", allowing for the extension of Darwinism to non-living systems."

So small as to be negligible, even if a tornado were to blow through enough junkyards to fill the whole Universe.""That pretty much sums up one of the greatest scientific mysteries, and the topic of this book: abiogenesis.There's not a lot of great reading material on the subject, especially for the lay person such as myself. In my view, this book offered a compelling explaination for abiogenesis that made a lot of sense to me in the context of evolution.

The book revolved around the general principles of abiogenesis or emergence of life from inanimate matter in the prebiotic Earth and heavily depended on extrapolating (or rather intrapolating) Darwinian evolution to account for the processes of abiogenesis. It also relied on uniting the dynamic replicative chemistry and systems chemistry with biology to drive its points home.I found few logical issues wanting in the arguments of the book, but probably the answers will be revealed elsewhere.The book is 200 pages long.My rating is 7/10 ☆☆☆◇"

41,0199641013,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6423134-bernie-gourley,4,"Dr. Pross’s book shares a title (but not a subtitle) with the seminal work by the renowned physicist Erwin Schrödinger from 1944. While Schrödinger addresses a wide range of topics on how life might be explained in terms of physics and chemistry, Pross’s focus is narrower. Pross asks—and proposes an answer for—the straightforward (but thorny) question of how abiogenesis could occur. Abiogenesis is life from the non-living. Darwin did an excellent job of explaining how we could get from single-celled organisms to the great complexity we see in our own bodies, but Darwin didn’t touch the question of how that very first ancestor became animated.The subtitle of this work, “How Chemistry Becomes Biology,” gives one insight into how Pross proceeds. There’ve been many ideas about how life came to be on planet Earth over the years. For a time, the idea of panspermia—life arriving from an extraterrestrial source—was popular. Of course, the most popular belief has been that there was a force of life (i.e. an “élan vital”) breathed into non-living matter by a, presumably, supernatural force / entity. While the awe-inspiring nature of life made this idea appealing / believable, it took a hit from the Urey-Miller experiments. Said experiment exposed the four materials believed to have been the most common in our pre-biologic atmosphere (hydrogen, ammonia, methane, and water vapor) to lightning, and the result included a range of organic materials—including amino acids--the building blocks of… well, us, among the other life forms of the planet. Of course, Urey-Miller didn’t make abiogenesis a foregone conclusion, but the production of ever more complex self-replicating molecules under laboratory conditions has made it easier to digest the notion that life developed without any intelligent or supernatural push. While Pross’s ideas are at the stage of hypothesis, he develops a compelling explanation that revolves around the idea of dynamic kinetic stability. “Dynamic Kinetic Stability” is a mouthful, and so it’s necessary to break it down. The best place to start is with the “stability” part. This is because the biggest problem for an abiogenetical theory of life is the Second Law of Thermodynamics. The Second Law tells us that entropy increases. There are many ways of restating this, such as that chemical reactions move to states that are of lower free energy. However, the most intuitive way is to say that a beer mugs break but do not spontaneously pop into existence. So if everything is getting simpler by deteriorating, breaking, and decomposing, how does one get / maintain a stable state of complexity? First and foremost, the answer involves adding a lot of energy and resources, but there’s more to it than that--as the author explains. “Dynamic” can also be explained in complex terms, but it’s most easily thought of as being like a river in that the river’s existence is stable, but it’s always a different river—ever changing water molecules arranged differently. (Critically, our bodies are the same way. Except for neurons, our cells are constantly being replaced.) The term “kinetic” speaks to how said replacement takes place; replication must be fast and decay slow. The appeal of the ideas put forth by Pross is that they’re conceptually consistent with Darwinian Evolution. That is, an entirely new set of principles isn’t necessary to make sense of the origins of life. Pross argues that the self-replicating molecules that can most effectively put resources to use succeed in doing so, and—in the process--they drive others into extinction. I found this book interesting and readable. The author uses good analogies to make his points (which often deal in complex matter) as clearly as possible. I can’t disagree with the other reviewers who’ve pointed out that the book is a bit repetitive and drags out a relatively simple statement of the argument. It’s not so egregious that I could say that it’s necessarily the result of a desire to pad the book out to a length necessary to sell in hard-copy form. (But it might have been.) The understanding of this topic is in its infancy, but that doesn’t mean this book isn’t a valuable contribution to popular understanding of abiogenesis.I’d recommend this book for anyone interested in reflecting on from whence we came in a fashion that is open-minded to explanations that eschew the supernatural.

42,0199641013,http://goodreads.com/user/show/17001694-stevedutch,3,"In 1944 Erwin Schrodinger published a little book with the title, ‘What is Life?’ Though, obviously not the first to pose this question, it is purported to have provided at least part of the inspiration to those, such as Watson and Crick, who would later go some way to answering it. Addy Pross, though using the same title, adds the sub-title, ‘How Chemistry Becomes Biology’ and this is quite odd as he spends most of this very slim book attempting to persuade the reader of exactly the opposite; i.e. that biology is simply a sub set of chemistry, or at least its natural extension. His justification for this curious and, I imagine irritating – at least to biologists, strangely naïve claim is his depiction of the transformation from non-living to living matter as a two stage process the first of which, the abiological phase, which is governed, principally, according to the established laws of chemistry, results from the autocatalytic replication of organic molecules such as RNA resulting in replicating networks or primitive forms of embryonic proto-life. The second, biological, phase is governed by the ‘rules’ of evolution as elucidated by Darwin leading to an increase in organic complexity and the biodiversity we see today. Furthermore, he suggests the very same evolutionary rules that underpin the existence and survival of all living things also governed the ‘persistence’ of these early organic molecules, which were ‘selected for’ according to their ‘fitness’ as replicators with fitness being determined largely by their relative dynamic kinetic stabilities (DKS): basically, those that could replicate the quickest and thus were more kinetically stable persisted longer, replicated more often and, as a result of mutations, gave rise to chemical diversity and increasingly more complex molecules the interactions of which produced the kind of ‘emergent properties’ postulated as being, at east potentially, characteristic of primitive forms of proto-life. In order to convince the reader of the plausibility of his hypothesis he provides, early on, a brief explanation of the philosophical basis of the ‘scientific method’; i.e. induction, and then proceeds, in a kind of ‘sleight of hand’ way, to outline his argument on the basis of this underlying assumed ‘inductive’ authority.The book does revisit interesting questions and posits some potentially intriguing ways in which these might be answered. However, in no way, does it get anywhere near answering the basic question posed by its title and it would have benefitted hugely if its author had been a little more ‘up-front’ about this. Finally, those readers who do not have, at least, some acquaintance with science and its often abstruse terminology, might find the book, though short in length, a little heavy going."

When I probed deeper in to what was meant by this, I found that he saw my acceptance of scientific facts as me lacking the ability to challenge an idea.I thought about this for a while and dispute his perception of this because facts are facts. And facts determined using the scientific method are solid in my world. Damn us rational people.What I think he thought was that I accepted scientific philosophy and hypothesis as facts when they were not yet proven. That isn't something I do. To prove that to myself, I choose a few books and have started reading the more interesting ideas in current scientific thinking.This book is about Systems Chemistry which I hoped would help me extend my Systems Thinking views as well. Unfortunately, it did not.Firstly, I should state that I haven't touched the wet sciences (Chem and Biology) since final year high school and my science is the most theoretical it gets in computer science and discrete maths. Maybe that meant I was lacking the basic knowledge required to call bullshit on this book or not.The book is actually quite good and encourages you to think about micro systems in a macro systems fashion. In this case, the author tries to think about the essence of life in a chemical way using biological concepts like Darwin's Theory of Evolution.The problem I had with this book is that the first half is spent on ideas like Teleonomy and on discussions that seemed to be heading towards Intelligent Design. Still, I continued.The second problem I had with it is that if you look for patterns you will find them but that doesn't mean they are confirmation of your theory. Scientific method will make it fact. THEN I will buy in more.What the final half of the book did do was try to extrapolate out from biological fact to philosophise on what is the clinching factor that brought molecules together to attain a spark of life. It isn't about god and thank the flying spaghetti monster for that.As a book, it is easy to read although it does maintain a condescending overtone. You need at least high school biology, chemistry and physics to start this book. A critical and open thinker will enjoy this.3 RNA strands out of 5.Should I read this?

When we take these two frameworks and put them together, there is a gap that glares back at us which we, to this day, have not understood how to bridge. That is, how did simple life arise from the chemicals and environments on the early earth? How could atoms and molecules form tremendously complex units of organization like the bacterial cell when systems spontaneously tend toward disorder as prescribed by the second law of thermodynamics?This is the precise question Dr. Pross addresses in his book. Much of the book establishes how life is stupendously complex and therefore its formation from non-life is such a difficult puzzle to solve. He introduces basic concepts in biology and chemistry such as teleonomy and chemical stability. The first few chapters can seem like a lecture, but they are completely justified for two reasons.One, Dr. Pross does an excellent job at explaining the ideas of chemistry and biology essential to the discussion in an understandable manner. This book does not read like a textbook; Dr. Pross gives it character and personality with his adept writing. Secondly, the science he explains is essential to understand at its most basic level in order to understand his proposed solution to the question in the title of his book. He describes how systems chemistry, a new branch of chemistry that involves the study of replicating networks of molecules, can offer explanations as to the origin of life. His approach is not only elegant, but also entirely consistent with the laws of physics as we understand them today.Truly, this is a must read for anyone interested in the question in its title.

All the good stuff is in the last couple of chapters - the rest are a very slow way to get there. I wish it was written by a better writer and with more passion toward the field itself, not just laying out ideas that could have fit into an article.I am not sure who the target audience for the book is. It explains the Second Law of Thermodynamics over and over, but at the same time assumes that the reader already knows the difference between RNA and DNA. I have to admit, I keep the science books to a very high standard of the ""Selfish Gene"" by Richard Dawkins. If the author intended to write for general audience, he should have followed a similar approach to Dawkins'- give a good in-depth overview of the field and then present his own ideas. This is kind of what this book attempts to do, but - see my comments above - doesn't actually achieve. I got the author's idea, but the worlds of the molecular chemistry and molecular biology are still a big mystery to me. As for the central idea of the book, it is very compelling and intriguing. I'll be following the science news more closely on the ""origin of life"" topic, that's for sure. Unfortunately, I could not find any in-depth critique of the book online and I know very little myself about this area. I can't say whether it's plausible or not, but does sound like it, although leaves a lot of open questions (my favorite was ""why did this chemical reaction happened just once in billion years? why does all life have a single origin? from his explanation it looks like there should be a forest of ""lives"", not a single tree). So the only option for us, non-scientists, is to wait and see how these ideas will play out.Update: I found and read Nick Lane's book ""The Vital Question"" on the same subject and apparently there is a lot of research done already and much more info available.

Much of the book is therefore a review of the current state of our scientific knowledge; a solid review, I think, and one that I usually enjoyed (although it sometimes verges on long-winded).There are interesting ideas that I was not familiar with: dynamic kinetic stability, a concept that Pross introduces to understand what life is moving towards maximizing is intriguing, but it's clear that Pross has no way to quantifying this parameter, and thus I think it fails to provide any truly novel explanatory power that can't be found through previous work. If you don't work in the life sciences, however, you may not of thought too much about this stuff before, in which there will be much to enjoy and ponder here.This isn't Deepark Chopra; this isn't a book about finding life's purpose. Of course, any book at that is discussing the origins and definitions of life will find itself intersecting with philosophy, and Pross can't deny himself the opportunity for small digressions. Much (most) of the subject matter deals with chemical matters, so be prepared for that, though Pross introduces it all nicely. "

From high school on I had been disturbed by entropy and the Second Law of Thermodynamics. Pross at least articulated a plausible and likely theory on how life is a kinetically stable system that operates within the Second Law of Thermodynamics. The second insight that made this book worthwhile for me is the exponential reaction of replication in chemistry is essentially the quirk that forces the inanimate into the animate. Subsequently, the study of systems chemistry shows how natural selection operates even on a chemical scale -- and off we go into biology. Replication and consumption are key elements of life and what is better than replicating and consuming?On intriguing philosophical point that is slightly raised in the book is that our life and all life in general is actually not based on the individual, but the group/system which gives rise to life. The replication is where the meaning of life lies -- Dawkin's Selfish Gene or Henry Miller's Land of Fuck -- replication is the metaphysical clue to both morality, altruism and sex, but I'm just musing on the importance of replicating within a system as a fundamental key to life itself. And from an existential view, one quote from the book -- ""'eternal life' is an oxymoron"". Life is about maintaining a dynamic kinetic system, which means every living thing is in a state of continual replication and by necessity, replacement. True eternal life would be in keeping the replication system that is life in motion, the Second Law be damned. The big questions for science -- life and consciousness -- both seem to be emergent properties out of complex systems. Diving into the complexity is always a fun ride. "

The book explores the question purely from a scientific viewpoint with a aim to bridge the gap between biology, or to be specific, systems biology, and systems chemistry.In a very Richard Dawkin-ish way, Pross, breaks down all the scientific puzzles with relation to what makes life different and what attributes of it actually contribute to saying, ""this is alive"". The book delves into various theories over years and proposes a new one of its own - a way to think about both sciences - biology and chemistry as one. Pross provides ample arguments to sustain the case and even convert most (non-scientifically gifted) people into accepting the possible validity of his arguments.It is definitely a new way to think about life and contemplate about it in a way that challenges many philosophical and theological beliefs (which is a good thing).

The book treats some very interesting questions I had never thought of, like just what is the difference between life and something that is not alive? How might non-life have become or given rise to something living? This is definitely a science book and not a philosophical one. It is intended for a general audience but a pretty sophisticated one and is rather technical. That led to my mild disappointment with it. I wish he had defined or explained just a bit more. For example, he mentions horizontal gene transfer (HGT) in several places. This is transfer of genetic material to some organism other than one of your offspring. Fascinating, I thought! When does this happen and how? He never says.The book is still worth reading, though, if you are interested in the kinds of questions it asks."

Many of these books omit the origin of life. This book tries to bridge chemistry and biology via systems chemistry to obtain a coherent theory of life. Though technical details are somewhat lacking, the author is able to bring his point across quite lucidly. He presents a framework in which chemical and biological evolution are treated as the same through the term dynamic kinetic stability. This reminds me of the construction theory, another scientific theory for the origin of patterns and life, though this book is much better at representing its ideas. A short and enjoyable read with a couple of interesting ideas. "

It is a process that maximizes dynamic kinetic stability such that complex systems can persist without violating the Second Law of Thermodynamics. Complexification, which is network formation, can oftentimes confer more dynamic kinetic stability on systems. So the existence of life that ostensibly is teleonomic and organized is not mysterious. What is mysterious is that our universe allows conditions that are conducive to life. Surely there is a God! "

71,0199641013,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6423134-bernie-gourley,4,"Dr. Pross’s book shares a title (but not a subtitle) with the seminal work by the renowned physicist Erwin Schrödinger from 1944. While Schrödinger addresses a wide range of topics on how life might be explained in terms of physics and chemistry, Pross’s focus is narrower. Pross asks—and proposes an answer for—the straightforward (but thorny) question of how abiogenesis could occur. Abiogenesis is life from the non-living. Darwin did an excellent job of explaining how we could get from single-celled organisms to the great complexity we see in our own bodies, but Darwin didn’t touch the question of how that very first ancestor became animated.The subtitle of this work, “How Chemistry Becomes Biology,” gives one insight into how Pross proceeds. There’ve been many ideas about how life came to be on planet Earth over the years. For a time, the idea of panspermia—life arriving from an extraterrestrial source—was popular. Of course, the most popular belief has been that there was a force of life (i.e. an “élan vital”) breathed into non-living matter by a, presumably, supernatural force / entity. While the awe-inspiring nature of life made this idea appealing / believable, it took a hit from the Urey-Miller experiments. Said experiment exposed the four materials believed to have been the most common in our pre-biologic atmosphere (hydrogen, ammonia, methane, and water vapor) to lightning, and the result included a range of organic materials—including amino acids--the building blocks of… well, us, among the other life forms of the planet. Of course, Urey-Miller didn’t make abiogenesis a foregone conclusion, but the production of ever more complex self-replicating molecules under laboratory conditions has made it easier to digest the notion that life developed without any intelligent or supernatural push. While Pross’s ideas are at the stage of hypothesis, he develops a compelling explanation that revolves around the idea of dynamic kinetic stability. “Dynamic Kinetic Stability” is a mouthful, and so it’s necessary to break it down. The best place to start is with the “stability” part. This is because the biggest problem for an abiogenetical theory of life is the Second Law of Thermodynamics. The Second Law tells us that entropy increases. There are many ways of restating this, such as that chemical reactions move to states that are of lower free energy. However, the most intuitive way is to say that a beer mugs break but do not spontaneously pop into existence. So if everything is getting simpler by deteriorating, breaking, and decomposing, how does one get / maintain a stable state of complexity? First and foremost, the answer involves adding a lot of energy and resources, but there’s more to it than that--as the author explains. “Dynamic” can also be explained in complex terms, but it’s most easily thought of as being like a river in that the river’s existence is stable, but it’s always a different river—ever changing water molecules arranged differently. (Critically, our bodies are the same way. Except for neurons, our cells are constantly being replaced.) The term “kinetic” speaks to how said replacement takes place; replication must be fast and decay slow. The appeal of the ideas put forth by Pross is that they’re conceptually consistent with Darwinian Evolution. That is, an entirely new set of principles isn’t necessary to make sense of the origins of life. Pross argues that the self-replicating molecules that can most effectively put resources to use succeed in doing so, and—in the process--they drive others into extinction. I found this book interesting and readable. The author uses good analogies to make his points (which often deal in complex matter) as clearly as possible. I can’t disagree with the other reviewers who’ve pointed out that the book is a bit repetitive and drags out a relatively simple statement of the argument. It’s not so egregious that I could say that it’s necessarily the result of a desire to pad the book out to a length necessary to sell in hard-copy form. (But it might have been.) The understanding of this topic is in its infancy, but that doesn’t mean this book isn’t a valuable contribution to popular understanding of abiogenesis.I’d recommend this book for anyone interested in reflecting on from whence we came in a fashion that is open-minded to explanations that eschew the supernatural. "
72,0199641013,http://goodreads.com/user/show/17001694-stevedutch,3,"In 1944 Erwin Schrodinger published a little book with the title, ‘What is Life?’ Though, obviously not the first to pose this question, it is purported to have provided at least part of the inspiration to those, such as Watson and Crick, who would later go some way to answering it. Addy Pross, though using the same title, adds the sub-title, ‘How Chemistry Becomes Biology’ and this is quite odd as he spends most of this very slim book attempting to persuade the reader of exactly the opposite; i.e. that biology is simply a sub set of chemistry, or at least its natural extension. His justification for this curious and, I imagine irritating – at least to biologists, strangely naïve claim is his depiction of the transformation from non-living to living matter as a two stage process the first of which, the abiological phase, which is governed, principally, according to the established laws of chemistry, results from the autocatalytic replication of organic molecules such as RNA resulting in replicating networks or primitive forms of embryonic proto-life. The second, biological, phase is governed by the ‘rules’ of evolution as elucidated by Darwin leading to an increase in organic complexity and the biodiversity we see today. Furthermore, he suggests the very same evolutionary rules that underpin the existence and survival of all living things also governed the ‘persistence’ of these early organic molecules, which were ‘selected for’ according to their ‘fitness’ as replicators with fitness being determined largely by their relative dynamic kinetic stabilities (DKS): basically, those that could replicate the quickest and thus were more kinetically stable persisted longer, replicated more often and, as a result of mutations, gave rise to chemical diversity and increasingly more complex molecules the interactions of which produced the kind of ‘emergent properties’ postulated as being, at east potentially, characteristic of primitive forms of proto-life. In order to convince the reader of the plausibility of his hypothesis he provides, early on, a brief explanation of the philosophical basis of the ‘scientific method’; i.e. induction, and then proceeds, in a kind of ‘sleight of hand’ way, to outline his argument on the basis of this underlying assumed ‘inductive’ authority.The book does revisit interesting questions and posits some potentially intriguing ways in which these might be answered. However, in no way, does it get anywhere near answering the basic question posed by its title and it would have benefitted hugely if its author had been a little more ‘up-front’ about this. Finally, those readers who do not have, at least, some acquaintance with science and its often abstruse terminology, might find the book, though short in length, a little heavy going."

How Chemistry Becomes Biology by Addy Pross.Someone recently called my understanding of science unsophisticated. When I probed deeper in to what was meant by this, I found that he saw my acceptance of scientific facts as me lacking the ability to challenge an idea.I thought about this for a while and dispute his perception of this because facts are facts. And facts determined using the scientific method are solid in my world. Damn us rational people.What I think he thought was that I accepted scientific philosophy and hypothesis as facts when they were not yet proven. That isn't something I do. To prove that to myself, I choose a few books and have started reading the more interesting ideas in current scientific thinking.This book is about Systems Chemistry which I hoped would help me extend my Systems Thinking views as well. Unfortunately, it did not.Firstly, I should state that I haven't touched the wet sciences (Chem and Biology) since final year high school and my science is the most theoretical it gets in computer science and discrete maths. Maybe that meant I was lacking the basic knowledge required to call bullshit on this book or not.The book is actually quite good and encourages you to think about micro systems in a macro systems fashion. In this case, the author tries to think about the essence of life in a chemical way using biological concepts like Darwin's Theory of Evolution.The problem I had with this book is that the first half is spent on ideas like Teleonomy and on discussions that seemed to be heading towards Intelligent Design. Still, I continued.The second problem I had with it is that if you look for patterns you will find them but that doesn't mean they are confirmation of your theory. Scientific method will make it fact. THEN I will buy in more.What the final half of the book did do was try to extrapolate out from biological fact to philosophise on what is the clinching factor that brought molecules together to attain a spark of life. It isn't about god and thank the flying spaghetti monster for that.As a book, it is easy to read although it does maintain a condescending overtone. You need at least high school biology, chemistry and physics to start this book. A critical and open thinker will enjoy this.3 RNA strands out of 5.Should I read this? Only if you care about thinking about thinking about science. Yes, I meant both ""think about""s.What did I learn? My understanding of science is not unsophisticated. In fact, I'm pretty well rounded but I do need to read more philosophical thought in general."

75,0199641013,http://goodreads.com/user/show/21134714-aiman-faruqi,5,"Physicists over the past hundred years have done a remarkable job in explaining the origin of the universe—from a singularity 13.7 billion years ago to the formation of stars, galaxies, planets, and the elements on the periodic table.Biologists over the past 150 years have done a similar remarkable job in describing how the complexity of life we see on earth today arose from the simple beginnings of a bacterial cell. When we take these two frameworks and put them together, there is a gap that glares back at us which we, to this day, have not understood how to bridge. That is, how did simple life arise from the chemicals and environments on the early earth? How could atoms and molecules form tremendously complex units of organization like the bacterial cell when systems spontaneously tend toward disorder as prescribed by the second law of thermodynamics?This is the precise question Dr. Pross addresses in his book. Much of the book establishes how life is stupendously complex and therefore its formation from non-life is such a difficult puzzle to solve. He introduces basic concepts in biology and chemistry such as teleonomy and chemical stability. The first few chapters can seem like a lecture, but they are completely justified for two reasons.One, Dr. Pross does an excellent job at explaining the ideas of chemistry and biology essential to the discussion in an understandable manner. This book does not read like a textbook; Dr. Pross gives it character and personality with his adept writing. Secondly, the science he explains is essential to understand at its most basic level in order to understand his proposed solution to the question in the title of his book. He describes how systems chemistry, a new branch of chemistry that involves the study of replicating networks of molecules, can offer explanations as to the origin of life. His approach is not only elegant, but also entirely consistent with the laws of physics as we understand them today.Truly, this is a must read for anyone interested in the question in its title. Excellent book. "

All the good stuff is in the last couple of chapters - the rest are a very slow way to get there. I wish it was written by a better writer and with more passion toward the field itself, not just laying out ideas that could have fit into an article.I am not sure who the target audience for the book is. It explains the Second Law of Thermodynamics over and over, but at the same time assumes that the reader already knows the difference between RNA and DNA. I have to admit, I keep the science books to a very high standard of the ""Selfish Gene"" by Richard Dawkins. If the author intended to write for general audience, he should have followed a similar approach to Dawkins'- give a good in-depth overview of the field and then present his own ideas. This is kind of what this book attempts to do, but - see my comments above - doesn't actually achieve. I got the author's idea, but the worlds of the molecular chemistry and molecular biology are still a big mystery to me. As for the central idea of the book, it is very compelling and intriguing. I'll be following the science news more closely on the ""origin of life"" topic, that's for sure. Unfortunately, I could not find any in-depth critique of the book online and I know very little myself about this area. I can't say whether it's plausible or not, but does sound like it, although leaves a lot of open questions (my favorite was ""why did this chemical reaction happened just once in billion years? why does all life have a single origin? from his explanation it looks like there should be a forest of ""lives"", not a single tree). So the only option for us, non-scientists, is to wait and see how these ideas will play out.Update: I found and read Nick Lane's book ""The Vital Question"" on the same subject and apparently there is a lot of research done already and much more info available.

Though technical details are somewhat lacking, the author is able to bring his point across quite lucidly. He presents a framework in which chemical and biological evolution are treated as the same through the term dynamic kinetic stability. This reminds me of the construction theory, another scientific theory for the origin of patterns and life, though this book is much better at representing its ideas. A short and enjoyable read with a couple of interesting ideas. "

101,0199641013,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6423134-bernie-gourley,4,"Dr. Pross’s book shares a title (but not a subtitle) with the seminal work by the renowned physicist Erwin Schrödinger from 1944. While Schrödinger addresses a wide range of topics on how life might be explained in terms of physics and chemistry, Pross’s focus is narrower. Pross asks—and proposes an answer for—the straightforward (but thorny) question of how abiogenesis could occur. Abiogenesis is life from the non-living. Darwin did an excellent job of explaining how we could get from single-celled organisms to the great complexity we see in our own bodies, but Darwin didn’t touch the question of how that very first ancestor became animated.The subtitle of this work, “How Chemistry Becomes Biology,” gives one insight into how Pross proceeds. There’ve been many ideas about how life came to be on planet Earth over the years. For a time, the idea of panspermia—life arriving from an extraterrestrial source—was popular. Of course, the most popular belief has been that there was a force of life (i.e. an “élan vital”) breathed into non-living matter by a, presumably, supernatural force / entity. While the awe-inspiring nature of life made this idea appealing / believable, it took a hit from the Urey-Miller experiments. Said experiment exposed the four materials believed to have been the most common in our pre-biologic atmosphere (hydrogen, ammonia, methane, and water vapor) to lightning, and the result included a range of organic materials—including amino acids--the building blocks of… well, us, among the other life forms of the planet. Of course, Urey-Miller didn’t make abiogenesis a foregone conclusion, but the production of ever more complex self-replicating molecules under laboratory conditions has made it easier to digest the notion that life developed without any intelligent or supernatural push. While Pross’s ideas are at the stage of hypothesis, he develops a compelling explanation that revolves around the idea of dynamic kinetic stability. “Dynamic Kinetic Stability” is a mouthful, and so it’s necessary to break it down. The best place to start is with the “stability” part. This is because the biggest problem for an abiogenetical theory of life is the Second Law of Thermodynamics. The Second Law tells us that entropy increases. There are many ways of restating this, such as that chemical reactions move to states that are of lower free energy. However, the most intuitive way is to say that a beer mugs break but do not spontaneously pop into existence. So if everything is getting simpler by deteriorating, breaking, and decomposing, how does one get / maintain a stable state of complexity? First and foremost, the answer involves adding a lot of energy and resources, but there’s more to it than that--as the author explains. “Dynamic” can also be explained in complex terms, but it’s most easily thought of as being like a river in that the river’s existence is stable, but it’s always a different river—ever changing water molecules arranged differently. (Critically, our bodies are the same way. Except for neurons, our cells are constantly being replaced.) The term “kinetic” speaks to how said replacement takes place; replication must be fast and decay slow. The appeal of the ideas put forth by Pross is that they’re conceptually consistent with Darwinian Evolution. That is, an entirely new set of principles isn’t necessary to make sense of the origins of life. Pross argues that the self-replicating molecules that can most effectively put resources to use succeed in doing so, and—in the process--they drive others into extinction. I found this book interesting and readable. The author uses good analogies to make his points (which often deal in complex matter) as clearly as possible. I can’t disagree with the other reviewers who’ve pointed out that the book is a bit repetitive and drags out a relatively simple statement of the argument. It’s not so egregious that I could say that it’s necessarily the result of a desire to pad the book out to a length necessary to sell in hard-copy form. (But it might have been.) The understanding of this topic is in its infancy, but that doesn’t mean this book isn’t a valuable contribution to popular understanding of abiogenesis.I’d recommend this book for anyone interested in reflecting on from whence we came in a fashion that is open-minded to explanations that eschew the supernatural. "
102,0199641013,http://goodreads.com/user/show/17001694-stevedutch,3,"In 1944 Erwin Schrodinger published a little book with the title, ‘What is Life?’ Though, obviously not the first to pose this question, it is purported to have provided at least part of the inspiration to those, such as Watson and Crick, who would later go some way to answering it. Addy Pross, though using the same title, adds the sub-title, ‘How Chemistry Becomes Biology’ and this is quite odd as he spends most of this very slim book attempting to persuade the reader of exactly the opposite; i.e. that biology is simply a sub set of chemistry, or at least its natural extension. His justification for this curious and, I imagine irritating – at least to biologists, strangely naïve claim is his depiction of the transformation from non-living to living matter as a two stage process the first of which, the abiological phase, which is governed, principally, according to the established laws of chemistry, results from the autocatalytic replication of organic molecules such as RNA resulting in replicating networks or primitive forms of embryonic proto-life. The second, biological, phase is governed by the ‘rules’ of evolution as elucidated by Darwin leading to an increase in organic complexity and the biodiversity we see today. Furthermore, he suggests the very same evolutionary rules that underpin the existence and survival of all living things also governed the ‘persistence’ of these early organic molecules, which were ‘selected for’ according to their ‘fitness’ as replicators with fitness being determined largely by their relative dynamic kinetic stabilities (DKS): basically, those that could replicate the quickest and thus were more kinetically stable persisted longer, replicated more often and, as a result of mutations, gave rise to chemical diversity and increasingly more complex molecules the interactions of which produced the kind of ‘emergent properties’ postulated as being, at east potentially, characteristic of primitive forms of proto-life. In order to convince the reader of the plausibility of his hypothesis he provides, early on, a brief explanation of the philosophical basis of the ‘scientific method’; i.e. induction, and then proceeds, in a kind of ‘sleight of hand’ way, to outline his argument on the basis of this underlying assumed ‘inductive’ authority.The book does revisit interesting questions and posits some potentially intriguing ways in which these might be answered. However, in no way, does it get anywhere near answering the basic question posed by its title and it would have benefitted hugely if its author had been a little more ‘up-front’ about this. Finally, those readers who do not have, at least, some acquaintance with science and its often abstruse terminology, might find the book, though short in length, a little heavy going."

How Chemistry Becomes Biology by Addy Pross.Someone recently called my understanding of science unsophisticated. When I probed deeper in to what was meant by this, I found that he saw my acceptance of scientific facts as me lacking the ability to challenge an idea.I thought about this for a while and dispute his perception of this because facts are facts. And facts determined using the scientific method are solid in my world. Damn us rational people.What I think he thought was that I accepted scientific philosophy and hypothesis as facts when they were not yet proven. That isn't something I do. To prove that to myself, I choose a few books and have started reading the more interesting ideas in current scientific thinking.This book is about Systems Chemistry which I hoped would help me extend my Systems Thinking views as well. Unfortunately, it did not.Firstly, I should state that I haven't touched the wet sciences (Chem and Biology) since final year high school and my science is the most theoretical it gets in computer science and discrete maths. Maybe that meant I was lacking the basic knowledge required to call bullshit on this book or not.The book is actually quite good and encourages you to think about micro systems in a macro systems fashion. In this case, the author tries to think about the essence of life in a chemical way using biological concepts like Darwin's Theory of Evolution.The problem I had with this book is that the first half is spent on ideas like Teleonomy and on discussions that seemed to be heading towards Intelligent Design. Still, I continued.The second problem I had with it is that if you look for patterns you will find them but that doesn't mean they are confirmation of your theory. Scientific method will make it fact. THEN I will buy in more.What the final half of the book did do was try to extrapolate out from biological fact to philosophise on what is the clinching factor that brought molecules together to attain a spark of life. It isn't about god and thank the flying spaghetti monster for that.As a book, it is easy to read although it does maintain a condescending overtone. You need at least high school biology, chemistry and physics to start this book. A critical and open thinker will enjoy this.3 RNA strands out of 5.Should I read this? Only if you care about thinking about thinking about science. Yes, I meant both ""think about""s.What did I learn? My understanding of science is not unsophisticated. In fact, I'm pretty well rounded but I do need to read more philosophical thought in general."

105,0199641013,http://goodreads.com/user/show/21134714-aiman-faruqi,5,"Physicists over the past hundred years have done a remarkable job in explaining the origin of the universe—from a singularity 13.7 billion years ago to the formation of stars, galaxies, planets, and the elements on the periodic table.Biologists over the past 150 years have done a similar remarkable job in describing how the complexity of life we see on earth today arose from the simple beginnings of a bacterial cell. When we take these two frameworks and put them together, there is a gap that glares back at us which we, to this day, have not understood how to bridge. That is, how did simple life arise from the chemicals and environments on the early earth? How could atoms and molecules form tremendously complex units of organization like the bacterial cell when systems spontaneously tend toward disorder as prescribed by the second law of thermodynamics?This is the precise question Dr. Pross addresses in his book. Much of the book establishes how life is stupendously complex and therefore its formation from non-life is such a difficult puzzle to solve. He introduces basic concepts in biology and chemistry such as teleonomy and chemical stability. The first few chapters can seem like a lecture, but they are completely justified for two reasons.One, Dr. Pross does an excellent job at explaining the ideas of chemistry and biology essential to the discussion in an understandable manner. This book does not read like a textbook; Dr. Pross gives it character and personality with his adept writing. Secondly, the science he explains is essential to understand at its most basic level in order to understand his proposed solution to the question in the title of his book. He describes how systems chemistry, a new branch of chemistry that involves the study of replicating networks of molecules, can offer explanations as to the origin of life. His approach is not only elegant, but also entirely consistent with the laws of physics as we understand them today.Truly, this is a must read for anyone interested in the question in its title. Excellent book. "
106,0199641013,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1038866-alexandra,2,"The concepts and ideas in the book are of the 5 star quality, but the book itself is not that good. All the good stuff is in the last couple of chapters - the rest are a very slow way to get there. I wish it was written by a better writer and with more passion toward the field itself, not just laying out ideas that could have fit into an article.I am not sure who the target audience for the book is. It explains the Second Law of Thermodynamics over and over, but at the same time assumes that the reader already knows the difference between RNA and DNA. I have to admit, I keep the science books to a very high standard of the ""Selfish Gene"" by Richard Dawkins. If the author intended to write for general audience, he should have followed a similar approach to Dawkins'- give a good in-depth overview of the field and then present his own ideas. This is kind of what this book attempts to do, but - see my comments above - doesn't actually achieve. I got the author's idea, but the worlds of the molecular chemistry and molecular biology are still a big mystery to me. As for the central idea of the book, it is very compelling and intriguing. I'll be following the science news more closely on the ""origin of life"" topic, that's for sure. Unfortunately, I could not find any in-depth critique of the book online and I know very little myself about this area. I can't say whether it's plausible or not, but does sound like it, although leaves a lot of open questions (my favorite was ""why did this chemical reaction happened just once in billion years? why does all life have a single origin? from his explanation it looks like there should be a forest of ""lives"", not a single tree). So the only option for us, non-scientists, is to wait and see how these ideas will play out.Update: I found and read Nick Lane's book ""The Vital Question"" on the same subject and apparently there is a lot of research done already and much more info available. So I am lowering this to just two stars."
107,0199641013,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10646107-rob,4,"Addy Pross is a Professor Emeritus at Ben-Gurion University in Israel. ""What is Life?"" that aspires to grand principles (just look at the title) but in the end is grounded in terms of actual content. The author's main goal is the directly connect the chemical ideas of abiogenesis (the beginning of life) with the biological ideas of evolution. I find the ideas very thought-provoking but perhaps not living up to its title: in that sense my biggest misgivings of this book really have to do with the way in which the title and introduction misrepresent the actual material.Pross gives a brief but fair (to my practicing molecular biologist but non-specialist in this field eyes) summary of current state of our understanding of abiogenesis, and also broadly touches a number of different areas of biology. Much of the book is therefore a review of the current state of our scientific knowledge; a solid review, I think, and one that I usually enjoyed (although it sometimes verges on long-winded).There are interesting ideas that I was not familiar with: dynamic kinetic stability, a concept that Pross introduces to understand what life is moving towards maximizing is intriguing, but it's clear that Pross has no way to quantifying this parameter, and thus I think it fails to provide any truly novel explanatory power that can't be found through previous work. If you don't work in the life sciences, however, you may not of thought too much about this stuff before, in which there will be much to enjoy and ponder here.This isn't Deepark Chopra; this isn't a book about finding life's purpose. Of course, any book at that is discussing the origins and definitions of life will find itself intersecting with philosophy, and Pross can't deny himself the opportunity for small digressions. Much (most) of the subject matter deals with chemical matters, so be prepared for that, though Pross introduces it all nicely. "
108,0199641013,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1054712-kent-winward,4,"Trying to piece together a way to look at the world that seems to fit is a constant process. From high school on I had been disturbed by entropy and the Second Law of Thermodynamics. Pross at least articulated a plausible and likely theory on how life is a kinetically stable system that operates within the Second Law of Thermodynamics. The second insight that made this book worthwhile for me is the exponential reaction of replication in chemistry is essentially the quirk that forces the inanimate into the animate. Subsequently, the study of systems chemistry shows how natural selection operates even on a chemical scale -- and off we go into biology. Replication and consumption are key elements of life and what is better than replicating and consuming?On intriguing philosophical point that is slightly raised in the book is that our life and all life in general is actually not based on the individual, but the group/system which gives rise to life. The replication is where the meaning of life lies -- Dawkin's Selfish Gene or Henry Miller's Land of Fuck -- replication is the metaphysical clue to both morality, altruism and sex, but I'm just musing on the importance of replicating within a system as a fundamental key to life itself. And from an existential view, one quote from the book -- ""'eternal life' is an oxymoron"". Life is about maintaining a dynamic kinetic system, which means every living thing is in a state of continual replication and by necessity, replacement. True eternal life would be in keeping the replication system that is life in motion, the Second Law be damned. The big questions for science -- life and consciousness -- both seem to be emergent properties out of complex systems. Diving into the complexity is always a fun ride. "

131,0199641013,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6423134-bernie-gourley,4,"Dr. Pross’s book shares a title (but not a subtitle) with the seminal work by the renowned physicist Erwin Schrödinger from 1944. While Schrödinger addresses a wide range of topics on how life might be explained in terms of physics and chemistry, Pross’s focus is narrower. Pross asks—and proposes an answer for—the straightforward (but thorny) question of how abiogenesis could occur. Abiogenesis is life from the non-living. Darwin did an excellent job of explaining how we could get from single-celled organisms to the great complexity we see in our own bodies, but Darwin didn’t touch the question of how that very first ancestor became animated.The subtitle of this work, “How Chemistry Becomes Biology,” gives one insight into how Pross proceeds. There’ve been many ideas about how life came to be on planet Earth over the years. For a time, the idea of panspermia—life arriving from an extraterrestrial source—was popular. Of course, the most popular belief has been that there was a force of life (i.e. an “élan vital”) breathed into non-living matter by a, presumably, supernatural force / entity. While the awe-inspiring nature of life made this idea appealing / believable, it took a hit from the Urey-Miller experiments. Said experiment exposed the four materials believed to have been the most common in our pre-biologic atmosphere (hydrogen, ammonia, methane, and water vapor) to lightning, and the result included a range of organic materials—including amino acids--the building blocks of… well, us, among the other life forms of the planet. Of course, Urey-Miller didn’t make abiogenesis a foregone conclusion, but the production of ever more complex self-replicating molecules under laboratory conditions has made it easier to digest the notion that life developed without any intelligent or supernatural push. While Pross’s ideas are at the stage of hypothesis, he develops a compelling explanation that revolves around the idea of dynamic kinetic stability. “Dynamic Kinetic Stability” is a mouthful, and so it’s necessary to break it down. The best place to start is with the “stability” part. This is because the biggest problem for an abiogenetical theory of life is the Second Law of Thermodynamics. The Second Law tells us that entropy increases. There are many ways of restating this, such as that chemical reactions move to states that are of lower free energy. However, the most intuitive way is to say that a beer mugs break but do not spontaneously pop into existence. So if everything is getting simpler by deteriorating, breaking, and decomposing, how does one get / maintain a stable state of complexity? First and foremost, the answer involves adding a lot of energy and resources, but there’s more to it than that--as the author explains. “Dynamic” can also be explained in complex terms, but it’s most easily thought of as being like a river in that the river’s existence is stable, but it’s always a different river—ever changing water molecules arranged differently. (Critically, our bodies are the same way. Except for neurons, our cells are constantly being replaced.) The term “kinetic” speaks to how said replacement takes place; replication must be fast and decay slow. The appeal of the ideas put forth by Pross is that they’re conceptually consistent with Darwinian Evolution. That is, an entirely new set of principles isn’t necessary to make sense of the origins of life. Pross argues that the self-replicating molecules that can most effectively put resources to use succeed in doing so, and—in the process--they drive others into extinction. I found this book interesting and readable. The author uses good analogies to make his points (which often deal in complex matter) as clearly as possible. I can’t disagree with the other reviewers who’ve pointed out that the book is a bit repetitive and drags out a relatively simple statement of the argument. It’s not so egregious that I could say that it’s necessarily the result of a desire to pad the book out to a length necessary to sell in hard-copy form. (But it might have been.) The understanding of this topic is in its infancy, but that doesn’t mean this book isn’t a valuable contribution to popular understanding of abiogenesis.I’d recommend this book for anyone interested in reflecting on from whence we came in a fashion that is open-minded to explanations that eschew the supernatural. "
132,0199641013,http://goodreads.com/user/show/17001694-stevedutch,3,"In 1944 Erwin Schrodinger published a little book with the title, ‘What is Life?’ Though, obviously not the first to pose this question, it is purported to have provided at least part of the inspiration to those, such as Watson and Crick, who would later go some way to answering it. Addy Pross, though using the same title, adds the sub-title, ‘How Chemistry Becomes Biology’ and this is quite odd as he spends most of this very slim book attempting to persuade the reader of exactly the opposite; i.e. that biology is simply a sub set of chemistry, or at least its natural extension. His justification for this curious and, I imagine irritating – at least to biologists, strangely naïve claim is his depiction of the transformation from non-living to living matter as a two stage process the first of which, the abiological phase, which is governed, principally, according to the established laws of chemistry, results from the autocatalytic replication of organic molecules such as RNA resulting in replicating networks or primitive forms of embryonic proto-life. The second, biological, phase is governed by the ‘rules’ of evolution as elucidated by Darwin leading to an increase in organic complexity and the biodiversity we see today. Furthermore, he suggests the very same evolutionary rules that underpin the existence and survival of all living things also governed the ‘persistence’ of these early organic molecules, which were ‘selected for’ according to their ‘fitness’ as replicators with fitness being determined largely by their relative dynamic kinetic stabilities (DKS): basically, those that could replicate the quickest and thus were more kinetically stable persisted longer, replicated more often and, as a result of mutations, gave rise to chemical diversity and increasingly more complex molecules the interactions of which produced the kind of ‘emergent properties’ postulated as being, at east potentially, characteristic of primitive forms of proto-life. In order to convince the reader of the plausibility of his hypothesis he provides, early on, a brief explanation of the philosophical basis of the ‘scientific method’; i.e. induction, and then proceeds, in a kind of ‘sleight of hand’ way, to outline his argument on the basis of this underlying assumed ‘inductive’ authority.The book does revisit interesting questions and posits some potentially intriguing ways in which these might be answered. However, in no way, does it get anywhere near answering the basic question posed by its title and it would have benefitted hugely if its author had been a little more ‘up-front’ about this. Finally, those readers who do not have, at least, some acquaintance with science and its often abstruse terminology, might find the book, though short in length, a little heavy going."
133,0199641013,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1147398-damana-madden,3,"Book 39 of 2015 is What is Life? How Chemistry Becomes Biology by Addy Pross.Someone recently called my understanding of science unsophisticated. When I probed deeper in to what was meant by this, I found that he saw my acceptance of scientific facts as me lacking the ability to challenge an idea.I thought about this for a while and dispute his perception of this because facts are facts. And facts determined using the scientific method are solid in my world. Damn us rational people.What I think he thought was that I accepted scientific philosophy and hypothesis as facts when they were not yet proven. That isn't something I do. To prove that to myself, I choose a few books and have started reading the more interesting ideas in current scientific thinking.This book is about Systems Chemistry which I hoped would help me extend my Systems Thinking views as well. Unfortunately, it did not.Firstly, I should state that I haven't touched the wet sciences (Chem and Biology) since final year high school and my science is the most theoretical it gets in computer science and discrete maths. Maybe that meant I was lacking the basic knowledge required to call bullshit on this book or not.The book is actually quite good and encourages you to think about micro systems in a macro systems fashion. In this case, the author tries to think about the essence of life in a chemical way using biological concepts like Darwin's Theory of Evolution.The problem I had with this book is that the first half is spent on ideas like Teleonomy and on discussions that seemed to be heading towards Intelligent Design. Still, I continued.The second problem I had with it is that if you look for patterns you will find them but that doesn't mean they are confirmation of your theory. Scientific method will make it fact. THEN I will buy in more.What the final half of the book did do was try to extrapolate out from biological fact to philosophise on what is the clinching factor that brought molecules together to attain a spark of life. It isn't about god and thank the flying spaghetti monster for that.As a book, it is easy to read although it does maintain a condescending overtone. You need at least high school biology, chemistry and physics to start this book. A critical and open thinker will enjoy this.3 RNA strands out of 5.Should I read this? Only if you care about thinking about thinking about science. Yes, I meant both ""think about""s.What did I learn? My understanding of science is not unsophisticated. In fact, I'm pretty well rounded but I do need to read more philosophical thought in general."

135,0199641013,http://goodreads.com/user/show/21134714-aiman-faruqi,5,"Physicists over the past hundred years have done a remarkable job in explaining the origin of the universe—from a singularity 13.7 billion years ago to the formation of stars, galaxies, planets, and the elements on the periodic table.Biologists over the past 150 years have done a similar remarkable job in describing how the complexity of life we see on earth today arose from the simple beginnings of a bacterial cell. When we take these two frameworks and put them together, there is a gap that glares back at us which we, to this day, have not understood how to bridge. That is, how did simple life arise from the chemicals and environments on the early earth? How could atoms and molecules form tremendously complex units of organization like the bacterial cell when systems spontaneously tend toward disorder as prescribed by the second law of thermodynamics?This is the precise question Dr. Pross addresses in his book. Much of the book establishes how life is stupendously complex and therefore its formation from non-life is such a difficult puzzle to solve. He introduces basic concepts in biology and chemistry such as teleonomy and chemical stability. The first few chapters can seem like a lecture, but they are completely justified for two reasons.One, Dr. Pross does an excellent job at explaining the ideas of chemistry and biology essential to the discussion in an understandable manner. This book does not read like a textbook; Dr. Pross gives it character and personality with his adept writing. Secondly, the science he explains is essential to understand at its most basic level in order to understand his proposed solution to the question in the title of his book. He describes how systems chemistry, a new branch of chemistry that involves the study of replicating networks of molecules, can offer explanations as to the origin of life. His approach is not only elegant, but also entirely consistent with the laws of physics as we understand them today.Truly, this is a must read for anyone interested in the question in its title. Excellent book. "
136,0199641013,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1038866-alexandra,2,"The concepts and ideas in the book are of the 5 star quality, but the book itself is not that good. All the good stuff is in the last couple of chapters - the rest are a very slow way to get there. I wish it was written by a better writer and with more passion toward the field itself, not just laying out ideas that could have fit into an article.I am not sure who the target audience for the book is. It explains the Second Law of Thermodynamics over and over, but at the same time assumes that the reader already knows the difference between RNA and DNA. I have to admit, I keep the science books to a very high standard of the ""Selfish Gene"" by Richard Dawkins. If the author intended to write for general audience, he should have followed a similar approach to Dawkins'- give a good in-depth overview of the field and then present his own ideas. This is kind of what this book attempts to do, but - see my comments above - doesn't actually achieve. I got the author's idea, but the worlds of the molecular chemistry and molecular biology are still a big mystery to me. As for the central idea of the book, it is very compelling and intriguing. I'll be following the science news more closely on the ""origin of life"" topic, that's for sure. Unfortunately, I could not find any in-depth critique of the book online and I know very little myself about this area. I can't say whether it's plausible or not, but does sound like it, although leaves a lot of open questions (my favorite was ""why did this chemical reaction happened just once in billion years? why does all life have a single origin? from his explanation it looks like there should be a forest of ""lives"", not a single tree). So the only option for us, non-scientists, is to wait and see how these ideas will play out.Update: I found and read Nick Lane's book ""The Vital Question"" on the same subject and apparently there is a lot of research done already and much more info available. So I am lowering this to just two stars."
137,0199641013,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10646107-rob,4,"Addy Pross is a Professor Emeritus at Ben-Gurion University in Israel. ""What is Life?"" that aspires to grand principles (just look at the title) but in the end is grounded in terms of actual content. The author's main goal is the directly connect the chemical ideas of abiogenesis (the beginning of life) with the biological ideas of evolution. I find the ideas very thought-provoking but perhaps not living up to its title: in that sense my biggest misgivings of this book really have to do with the way in which the title and introduction misrepresent the actual material.Pross gives a brief but fair (to my practicing molecular biologist but non-specialist in this field eyes) summary of current state of our understanding of abiogenesis, and also broadly touches a number of different areas of biology. Much of the book is therefore a review of the current state of our scientific knowledge; a solid review, I think, and one that I usually enjoyed (although it sometimes verges on long-winded).There are interesting ideas that I was not familiar with: dynamic kinetic stability, a concept that Pross introduces to understand what life is moving towards maximizing is intriguing, but it's clear that Pross has no way to quantifying this parameter, and thus I think it fails to provide any truly novel explanatory power that can't be found through previous work. If you don't work in the life sciences, however, you may not of thought too much about this stuff before, in which there will be much to enjoy and ponder here.This isn't Deepark Chopra; this isn't a book about finding life's purpose. Of course, any book at that is discussing the origins and definitions of life will find itself intersecting with philosophy, and Pross can't deny himself the opportunity for small digressions. Much (most) of the subject matter deals with chemical matters, so be prepared for that, though Pross introduces it all nicely. "
138,0199641013,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1054712-kent-winward,4,"Trying to piece together a way to look at the world that seems to fit is a constant process. From high school on I had been disturbed by entropy and the Second Law of Thermodynamics. Pross at least articulated a plausible and likely theory on how life is a kinetically stable system that operates within the Second Law of Thermodynamics. The second insight that made this book worthwhile for me is the exponential reaction of replication in chemistry is essentially the quirk that forces the inanimate into the animate. Subsequently, the study of systems chemistry shows how natural selection operates even on a chemical scale -- and off we go into biology. Replication and consumption are key elements of life and what is better than replicating and consuming?On intriguing philosophical point that is slightly raised in the book is that our life and all life in general is actually not based on the individual, but the group/system which gives rise to life. The replication is where the meaning of life lies -- Dawkin's Selfish Gene or Henry Miller's Land of Fuck -- replication is the metaphysical clue to both morality, altruism and sex, but I'm just musing on the importance of replicating within a system as a fundamental key to life itself. And from an existential view, one quote from the book -- ""'eternal life' is an oxymoron"". Life is about maintaining a dynamic kinetic system, which means every living thing is in a state of continual replication and by necessity, replacement. True eternal life would be in keeping the replication system that is life in motion, the Second Law be damned. The big questions for science -- life and consciousness -- both seem to be emergent properties out of complex systems. Diving into the complexity is always a fun ride. "

The author states that biological evolution is a broader form of the same process happening at a chemical level. He goes on to describe the biological process in chemical terms. The author shows how life does not violate the second law of thermodynamics. The book builds up to its substance over most of it's length and concludes in the last couple of chapters. A short read which can be completed in a day. While it does give a fresh perspective to the subject, not the most eloquent or evocative of books. Gives a very general, 'process' view of life and robs the whole emergence 'process' of much charm. If you have a good imagination prepare to use it since the book is not replete with a whole lot of real world examples. Nevertheless for people interested in the subject of life origins, this is a good book to read and offers a fresh perspective to how life came to be. Don't let this be your first book on the life origin subject if that fascinates you. "

The book explores the question purely from a scientific viewpoint with a aim to bridge the gap between biology, or to be specific, systems biology, and systems chemistry.In a very Richard Dawkin-ish way, Pross, breaks down all the scientific puzzles with relation to what makes life different and what attributes of it actually contribute to saying, ""this is alive"". The book delves into various theories over years and proposes a new one of its own - a way to think about both sciences - biology and chemistry as one. Pross provides ample arguments to sustain the case and even convert most (non-scientifically gifted) people into accepting the possible validity of his arguments.It is definitely a new way to think about life and contemplate about it in a way that challenges many philosophical and theological beliefs (which is a good thing).

How might non-life have become or given rise to something living? This is definitely a science book and not a philosophical one. It is intended for a general audience but a pretty sophisticated one and is rather technical. That led to my mild disappointment with it. I wish he had defined or explained just a bit more. For example, he mentions horizontal gene transfer (HGT) in several places. This is transfer of genetic material to some organism other than one of your offspring. Fascinating, I thought!

161,0199641013,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6423134-bernie-gourley,4,"Dr. Pross’s book shares a title (but not a subtitle) with the seminal work by the renowned physicist Erwin Schrödinger from 1944. While Schrödinger addresses a wide range of topics on how life might be explained in terms of physics and chemistry, Pross’s focus is narrower. Pross asks—and proposes an answer for—the straightforward (but thorny) question of how abiogenesis could occur. Abiogenesis is life from the non-living. Darwin did an excellent job of explaining how we could get from single-celled organisms to the great complexity we see in our own bodies, but Darwin didn’t touch the question of how that very first ancestor became animated.The subtitle of this work, “How Chemistry Becomes Biology,” gives one insight into how Pross proceeds. There’ve been many ideas about how life came to be on planet Earth over the years. For a time, the idea of panspermia—life arriving from an extraterrestrial source—was popular. Of course, the most popular belief has been that there was a force of life (i.e. an “élan vital”) breathed into non-living matter by a, presumably, supernatural force / entity. While the awe-inspiring nature of life made this idea appealing / believable, it took a hit from the Urey-Miller experiments. Said experiment exposed the four materials believed to have been the most common in our pre-biologic atmosphere (hydrogen, ammonia, methane, and water vapor) to lightning, and the result included a range of organic materials—including amino acids--the building blocks of… well, us, among the other life forms of the planet. Of course, Urey-Miller didn’t make abiogenesis a foregone conclusion, but the production of ever more complex self-replicating molecules under laboratory conditions has made it easier to digest the notion that life developed without any intelligent or supernatural push. While Pross’s ideas are at the stage of hypothesis, he develops a compelling explanation that revolves around the idea of dynamic kinetic stability. “Dynamic Kinetic Stability” is a mouthful, and so it’s necessary to break it down. The best place to start is with the “stability” part. This is because the biggest problem for an abiogenetical theory of life is the Second Law of Thermodynamics. The Second Law tells us that entropy increases. There are many ways of restating this, such as that chemical reactions move to states that are of lower free energy. However, the most intuitive way is to say that a beer mugs break but do not spontaneously pop into existence. So if everything is getting simpler by deteriorating, breaking, and decomposing, how does one get / maintain a stable state of complexity? First and foremost, the answer involves adding a lot of energy and resources, but there’s more to it than that--as the author explains. “Dynamic” can also be explained in complex terms, but it’s most easily thought of as being like a river in that the river’s existence is stable, but it’s always a different river—ever changing water molecules arranged differently. (Critically, our bodies are the same way. Except for neurons, our cells are constantly being replaced.) The term “kinetic” speaks to how said replacement takes place; replication must be fast and decay slow. The appeal of the ideas put forth by Pross is that they’re conceptually consistent with Darwinian Evolution. That is, an entirely new set of principles isn’t necessary to make sense of the origins of life. Pross argues that the self-replicating molecules that can most effectively put resources to use succeed in doing so, and—in the process--they drive others into extinction. I found this book interesting and readable. The author uses good analogies to make his points (which often deal in complex matter) as clearly as possible. I can’t disagree with the other reviewers who’ve pointed out that the book is a bit repetitive and drags out a relatively simple statement of the argument. It’s not so egregious that I could say that it’s necessarily the result of a desire to pad the book out to a length necessary to sell in hard-copy form. (But it might have been.) The understanding of this topic is in its infancy, but that doesn’t mean this book isn’t a valuable contribution to popular understanding of abiogenesis.I’d recommend this book for anyone interested in reflecting on from whence we came in a fashion that is open-minded to explanations that eschew the supernatural. "
162,0199641013,http://goodreads.com/user/show/17001694-stevedutch,3,"In 1944 Erwin Schrodinger published a little book with the title, ‘What is Life?’ Though, obviously not the first to pose this question, it is purported to have provided at least part of the inspiration to those, such as Watson and Crick, who would later go some way to answering it. Addy Pross, though using the same title, adds the sub-title, ‘How Chemistry Becomes Biology’ and this is quite odd as he spends most of this very slim book attempting to persuade the reader of exactly the opposite; i.e. that biology is simply a sub set of chemistry, or at least its natural extension. His justification for this curious and, I imagine irritating – at least to biologists, strangely naïve claim is his depiction of the transformation from non-living to living matter as a two stage process the first of which, the abiological phase, which is governed, principally, according to the established laws of chemistry, results from the autocatalytic replication of organic molecules such as RNA resulting in replicating networks or primitive forms of embryonic proto-life. The second, biological, phase is governed by the ‘rules’ of evolution as elucidated by Darwin leading to an increase in organic complexity and the biodiversity we see today. Furthermore, he suggests the very same evolutionary rules that underpin the existence and survival of all living things also governed the ‘persistence’ of these early organic molecules, which were ‘selected for’ according to their ‘fitness’ as replicators with fitness being determined largely by their relative dynamic kinetic stabilities (DKS): basically, those that could replicate the quickest and thus were more kinetically stable persisted longer, replicated more often and, as a result of mutations, gave rise to chemical diversity and increasingly more complex molecules the interactions of which produced the kind of ‘emergent properties’ postulated as being, at east potentially, characteristic of primitive forms of proto-life. In order to convince the reader of the plausibility of his hypothesis he provides, early on, a brief explanation of the philosophical basis of the ‘scientific method’; i.e. induction, and then proceeds, in a kind of ‘sleight of hand’ way, to outline his argument on the basis of this underlying assumed ‘inductive’ authority.The book does revisit interesting questions and posits some potentially intriguing ways in which these might be answered. However, in no way, does it get anywhere near answering the basic question posed by its title and it would have benefitted hugely if its author had been a little more ‘up-front’ about this. Finally, those readers who do not have, at least, some acquaintance with science and its often abstruse terminology, might find the book, though short in length, a little heavy going."
163,0199641013,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1147398-damana-madden,3,"Book 39 of 2015 is What is Life? How Chemistry Becomes Biology by Addy Pross.Someone recently called my understanding of science unsophisticated. When I probed deeper in to what was meant by this, I found that he saw my acceptance of scientific facts as me lacking the ability to challenge an idea.I thought about this for a while and dispute his perception of this because facts are facts. And facts determined using the scientific method are solid in my world. Damn us rational people.What I think he thought was that I accepted scientific philosophy and hypothesis as facts when they were not yet proven. That isn't something I do. To prove that to myself, I choose a few books and have started reading the more interesting ideas in current scientific thinking.This book is about Systems Chemistry which I hoped would help me extend my Systems Thinking views as well. Unfortunately, it did not.Firstly, I should state that I haven't touched the wet sciences (Chem and Biology) since final year high school and my science is the most theoretical it gets in computer science and discrete maths. Maybe that meant I was lacking the basic knowledge required to call bullshit on this book or not.The book is actually quite good and encourages you to think about micro systems in a macro systems fashion. In this case, the author tries to think about the essence of life in a chemical way using biological concepts like Darwin's Theory of Evolution.The problem I had with this book is that the first half is spent on ideas like Teleonomy and on discussions that seemed to be heading towards Intelligent Design. Still, I continued.The second problem I had with it is that if you look for patterns you will find them but that doesn't mean they are confirmation of your theory. Scientific method will make it fact. THEN I will buy in more.What the final half of the book did do was try to extrapolate out from biological fact to philosophise on what is the clinching factor that brought molecules together to attain a spark of life. It isn't about god and thank the flying spaghetti monster for that.As a book, it is easy to read although it does maintain a condescending overtone. You need at least high school biology, chemistry and physics to start this book. A critical and open thinker will enjoy this.3 RNA strands out of 5.Should I read this? Only if you care about thinking about thinking about science. Yes, I meant both ""think about""s.What did I learn? My understanding of science is not unsophisticated. In fact, I'm pretty well rounded but I do need to read more philosophical thought in general."

165,0199641013,http://goodreads.com/user/show/21134714-aiman-faruqi,5,"Physicists over the past hundred years have done a remarkable job in explaining the origin of the universe—from a singularity 13.7 billion years ago to the formation of stars, galaxies, planets, and the elements on the periodic table.Biologists over the past 150 years have done a similar remarkable job in describing how the complexity of life we see on earth today arose from the simple beginnings of a bacterial cell. When we take these two frameworks and put them together, there is a gap that glares back at us which we, to this day, have not understood how to bridge. That is, how did simple life arise from the chemicals and environments on the early earth? How could atoms and molecules form tremendously complex units of organization like the bacterial cell when systems spontaneously tend toward disorder as prescribed by the second law of thermodynamics?This is the precise question Dr. Pross addresses in his book. Much of the book establishes how life is stupendously complex and therefore its formation from non-life is such a difficult puzzle to solve. He introduces basic concepts in biology and chemistry such as teleonomy and chemical stability. The first few chapters can seem like a lecture, but they are completely justified for two reasons.One, Dr. Pross does an excellent job at explaining the ideas of chemistry and biology essential to the discussion in an understandable manner. This book does not read like a textbook; Dr. Pross gives it character and personality with his adept writing. Secondly, the science he explains is essential to understand at its most basic level in order to understand his proposed solution to the question in the title of his book. He describes how systems chemistry, a new branch of chemistry that involves the study of replicating networks of molecules, can offer explanations as to the origin of life. His approach is not only elegant, but also entirely consistent with the laws of physics as we understand them today.Truly, this is a must read for anyone interested in the question in its title. Excellent book. "
166,0199641013,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1038866-alexandra,2,"The concepts and ideas in the book are of the 5 star quality, but the book itself is not that good. All the good stuff is in the last couple of chapters - the rest are a very slow way to get there. I wish it was written by a better writer and with more passion toward the field itself, not just laying out ideas that could have fit into an article.I am not sure who the target audience for the book is. It explains the Second Law of Thermodynamics over and over, but at the same time assumes that the reader already knows the difference between RNA and DNA. I have to admit, I keep the science books to a very high standard of the ""Selfish Gene"" by Richard Dawkins. If the author intended to write for general audience, he should have followed a similar approach to Dawkins'- give a good in-depth overview of the field and then present his own ideas. This is kind of what this book attempts to do, but - see my comments above - doesn't actually achieve. I got the author's idea, but the worlds of the molecular chemistry and molecular biology are still a big mystery to me. As for the central idea of the book, it is very compelling and intriguing. I'll be following the science news more closely on the ""origin of life"" topic, that's for sure. Unfortunately, I could not find any in-depth critique of the book online and I know very little myself about this area. I can't say whether it's plausible or not, but does sound like it, although leaves a lot of open questions (my favorite was ""why did this chemical reaction happened just once in billion years? why does all life have a single origin? from his explanation it looks like there should be a forest of ""lives"", not a single tree). So the only option for us, non-scientists, is to wait and see how these ideas will play out.Update: I found and read Nick Lane's book ""The Vital Question"" on the same subject and apparently there is a lot of research done already and much more info available. So I am lowering this to just two stars."
167,0199641013,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10646107-rob,4,"Addy Pross is a Professor Emeritus at Ben-Gurion University in Israel. ""What is Life?"" that aspires to grand principles (just look at the title) but in the end is grounded in terms of actual content. The author's main goal is the directly connect the chemical ideas of abiogenesis (the beginning of life) with the biological ideas of evolution. I find the ideas very thought-provoking but perhaps not living up to its title: in that sense my biggest misgivings of this book really have to do with the way in which the title and introduction misrepresent the actual material.Pross gives a brief but fair (to my practicing molecular biologist but non-specialist in this field eyes) summary of current state of our understanding of abiogenesis, and also broadly touches a number of different areas of biology. Much of the book is therefore a review of the current state of our scientific knowledge; a solid review, I think, and one that I usually enjoyed (although it sometimes verges on long-winded).There are interesting ideas that I was not familiar with: dynamic kinetic stability, a concept that Pross introduces to understand what life is moving towards maximizing is intriguing, but it's clear that Pross has no way to quantifying this parameter, and thus I think it fails to provide any truly novel explanatory power that can't be found through previous work. If you don't work in the life sciences, however, you may not of thought too much about this stuff before, in which there will be much to enjoy and ponder here.This isn't Deepark Chopra; this isn't a book about finding life's purpose. Of course, any book at that is discussing the origins and definitions of life will find itself intersecting with philosophy, and Pross can't deny himself the opportunity for small digressions. Much (most) of the subject matter deals with chemical matters, so be prepared for that, though Pross introduces it all nicely. "
168,0199641013,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1054712-kent-winward,4,"Trying to piece together a way to look at the world that seems to fit is a constant process. From high school on I had been disturbed by entropy and the Second Law of Thermodynamics. Pross at least articulated a plausible and likely theory on how life is a kinetically stable system that operates within the Second Law of Thermodynamics. The second insight that made this book worthwhile for me is the exponential reaction of replication in chemistry is essentially the quirk that forces the inanimate into the animate. Subsequently, the study of systems chemistry shows how natural selection operates even on a chemical scale -- and off we go into biology. Replication and consumption are key elements of life and what is better than replicating and consuming?On intriguing philosophical point that is slightly raised in the book is that our life and all life in general is actually not based on the individual, but the group/system which gives rise to life. The replication is where the meaning of life lies -- Dawkin's Selfish Gene or Henry Miller's Land of Fuck -- replication is the metaphysical clue to both morality, altruism and sex, but I'm just musing on the importance of replicating within a system as a fundamental key to life itself. And from an existential view, one quote from the book -- ""'eternal life' is an oxymoron"". Life is about maintaining a dynamic kinetic system, which means every living thing is in a state of continual replication and by necessity, replacement. True eternal life would be in keeping the replication system that is life in motion, the Second Law be damned. The big questions for science -- life and consciousness -- both seem to be emergent properties out of complex systems. Diving into the complexity is always a fun ride. "

The author states that biological evolution is a broader form of the same process happening at a chemical level. He goes on to describe the biological process in chemical terms. The author shows how life does not violate the second law of thermodynamics. The book builds up to its substance over most of it's length and concludes in the last couple of chapters. A short read which can be completed in a day. While it does give a fresh perspective to the subject, not the most eloquent or evocative of books. Gives a very general, 'process' view of life and robs the whole emergence 'process' of much charm. If you have a good imagination prepare to use it since the book is not replete with a whole lot of real world examples. Nevertheless for people interested in the subject of life origins, this is a good book to read and offers a fresh perspective to how life came to be. Don't let this be your first book on the life origin subject if that fascinates you. "

The book explores the question purely from a scientific viewpoint with a aim to bridge the gap between biology, or to be specific, systems biology, and systems chemistry.In a very Richard Dawkin-ish way, Pross, breaks down all the scientific puzzles with relation to what makes life different and what attributes of it actually contribute to saying, ""this is alive"". The book delves into various theories over years and proposes a new one of its own - a way to think about both sciences - biology and chemistry as one. Pross provides ample arguments to sustain the case and even convert most (non-scientifically gifted) people into accepting the possible validity of his arguments.It is definitely a new way to think about life and contemplate about it in a way that challenges many philosophical and theological beliefs (which is a good thing). Only cautionary note is that the book introduces readers to a various aspects of sciences that can be a little overwhelming to a casual reader."

The book treats some very interesting questions I had never thought of, like just what is the difference between life and something that is not alive? How might non-life have become or given rise to something living? This is definitely a science book and not a philosophical one. It is intended for a general audience but a pretty sophisticated one and is rather technical. That led to my mild disappointment with it. I wish he had defined or explained just a bit more. For example, he mentions horizontal gene transfer (HGT) in several places. This is transfer of genetic material to some organism other than one of your offspring. Fascinating, I thought! When does this happen and how? He never says.The book is still worth reading, though, if you are interested in the kinds of questions it asks."

Many of these books omit the origin of life. This book tries to bridge chemistry and biology via systems chemistry to obtain a coherent theory of life. Though technical details are somewhat lacking, the author is able to bring his point across quite lucidly. He presents a framework in which chemical and biological evolution are treated as the same through the term dynamic kinetic stability. This reminds me of the construction theory, another scientific theory for the origin of patterns and life, though this book is much better at representing its ideas. A short and enjoyable read with a couple of interesting ideas. "

191,0199641013,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6423134-bernie-gourley,4,"Dr. Pross’s book shares a title (but not a subtitle) with the seminal work by the renowned physicist Erwin Schrödinger from 1944. While Schrödinger addresses a wide range of topics on how life might be explained in terms of physics and chemistry, Pross’s focus is narrower. Pross asks—and proposes an answer for—the straightforward (but thorny) question of how abiogenesis could occur. Abiogenesis is life from the non-living. Darwin did an excellent job of explaining how we could get from single-celled organisms to the great complexity we see in our own bodies, but Darwin didn’t touch the question of how that very first ancestor became animated.The subtitle of this work, “How Chemistry Becomes Biology,” gives one insight into how Pross proceeds. There’ve been many ideas about how life came to be on planet Earth over the years. For a time, the idea of panspermia—life arriving from an extraterrestrial source—was popular. Of course, the most popular belief has been that there was a force of life (i.e. an “élan vital”) breathed into non-living matter by a, presumably, supernatural force / entity. While the awe-inspiring nature of life made this idea appealing / believable, it took a hit from the Urey-Miller experiments. Said experiment exposed the four materials believed to have been the most common in our pre-biologic atmosphere (hydrogen, ammonia, methane, and water vapor) to lightning, and the result included a range of organic materials—including amino acids--the building blocks of… well, us, among the other life forms of the planet. Of course, Urey-Miller didn’t make abiogenesis a foregone conclusion, but the production of ever more complex self-replicating molecules under laboratory conditions has made it easier to digest the notion that life developed without any intelligent or supernatural push. While Pross’s ideas are at the stage of hypothesis, he develops a compelling explanation that revolves around the idea of dynamic kinetic stability. “Dynamic Kinetic Stability” is a mouthful, and so it’s necessary to break it down. The best place to start is with the “stability” part. This is because the biggest problem for an abiogenetical theory of life is the Second Law of Thermodynamics. The Second Law tells us that entropy increases. There are many ways of restating this, such as that chemical reactions move to states that are of lower free energy. However, the most intuitive way is to say that a beer mugs break but do not spontaneously pop into existence. So if everything is getting simpler by deteriorating, breaking, and decomposing, how does one get / maintain a stable state of complexity? First and foremost, the answer involves adding a lot of energy and resources, but there’s more to it than that--as the author explains. “Dynamic” can also be explained in complex terms, but it’s most easily thought of as being like a river in that the river’s existence is stable, but it’s always a different river—ever changing water molecules arranged differently. (Critically, our bodies are the same way. Except for neurons, our cells are constantly being replaced.) The term “kinetic” speaks to how said replacement takes place; replication must be fast and decay slow. The appeal of the ideas put forth by Pross is that they’re conceptually consistent with Darwinian Evolution. That is, an entirely new set of principles isn’t necessary to make sense of the origins of life. Pross argues that the self-replicating molecules that can most effectively put resources to use succeed in doing so, and—in the process--they drive others into extinction. I found this book interesting and readable. The author uses good analogies to make his points (which often deal in complex matter) as clearly as possible. I can’t disagree with the other reviewers who’ve pointed out that the book is a bit repetitive and drags out a relatively simple statement of the argument. It’s not so egregious that I could say that it’s necessarily the result of a desire to pad the book out to a length necessary to sell in hard-copy form. (But it might have been.) The understanding of this topic is in its infancy, but that doesn’t mean this book isn’t a valuable contribution to popular understanding of abiogenesis.I’d recommend this book for anyone interested in reflecting on from whence we came in a fashion that is open-minded to explanations that eschew the supernatural. "
192,0199641013,http://goodreads.com/user/show/17001694-stevedutch,3,"In 1944 Erwin Schrodinger published a little book with the title, ‘What is Life?’ Though, obviously not the first to pose this question, it is purported to have provided at least part of the inspiration to those, such as Watson and Crick, who would later go some way to answering it. Addy Pross, though using the same title, adds the sub-title, ‘How Chemistry Becomes Biology’ and this is quite odd as he spends most of this very slim book attempting to persuade the reader of exactly the opposite; i.e. that biology is simply a sub set of chemistry, or at least its natural extension. His justification for this curious and, I imagine irritating – at least to biologists, strangely naïve claim is his depiction of the transformation from non-living to living matter as a two stage process the first of which, the abiological phase, which is governed, principally, according to the established laws of chemistry, results from the autocatalytic replication of organic molecules such as RNA resulting in replicating networks or primitive forms of embryonic proto-life. The second, biological, phase is governed by the ‘rules’ of evolution as elucidated by Darwin leading to an increase in organic complexity and the biodiversity we see today. Furthermore, he suggests the very same evolutionary rules that underpin the existence and survival of all living things also governed the ‘persistence’ of these early organic molecules, which were ‘selected for’ according to their ‘fitness’ as replicators with fitness being determined largely by their relative dynamic kinetic stabilities (DKS): basically, those that could replicate the quickest and thus were more kinetically stable persisted longer, replicated more often and, as a result of mutations, gave rise to chemical diversity and increasingly more complex molecules the interactions of which produced the kind of ‘emergent properties’ postulated as being, at east potentially, characteristic of primitive forms of proto-life. In order to convince the reader of the plausibility of his hypothesis he provides, early on, a brief explanation of the philosophical basis of the ‘scientific method’; i.e. induction, and then proceeds, in a kind of ‘sleight of hand’ way, to outline his argument on the basis of this underlying assumed ‘inductive’ authority.The book does revisit interesting questions and posits some potentially intriguing ways in which these might be answered. However, in no way, does it get anywhere near answering the basic question posed by its title and it would have benefitted hugely if its author had been a little more ‘up-front’ about this. Finally, those readers who do not have, at least, some acquaintance with science and its often abstruse terminology, might find the book, though short in length, a little heavy going."
193,0199641013,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1147398-damana-madden,3,"Book 39 of 2015 is What is Life? How Chemistry Becomes Biology by Addy Pross.Someone recently called my understanding of science unsophisticated. When I probed deeper in to what was meant by this, I found that he saw my acceptance of scientific facts as me lacking the ability to challenge an idea.I thought about this for a while and dispute his perception of this because facts are facts. And facts determined using the scientific method are solid in my world. Damn us rational people.What I think he thought was that I accepted scientific philosophy and hypothesis as facts when they were not yet proven. That isn't something I do. To prove that to myself, I choose a few books and have started reading the more interesting ideas in current scientific thinking.This book is about Systems Chemistry which I hoped would help me extend my Systems Thinking views as well. Unfortunately, it did not.Firstly, I should state that I haven't touched the wet sciences (Chem and Biology) since final year high school and my science is the most theoretical it gets in computer science and discrete maths. Maybe that meant I was lacking the basic knowledge required to call bullshit on this book or not.The book is actually quite good and encourages you to think about micro systems in a macro systems fashion. In this case, the author tries to think about the essence of life in a chemical way using biological concepts like Darwin's Theory of Evolution.The problem I had with this book is that the first half is spent on ideas like Teleonomy and on discussions that seemed to be heading towards Intelligent Design. Still, I continued.The second problem I had with it is that if you look for patterns you will find them but that doesn't mean they are confirmation of your theory. Scientific method will make it fact. THEN I will buy in more.What the final half of the book did do was try to extrapolate out from biological fact to philosophise on what is the clinching factor that brought molecules together to attain a spark of life. It isn't about god and thank the flying spaghetti monster for that.As a book, it is easy to read although it does maintain a condescending overtone. You need at least high school biology, chemistry and physics to start this book. A critical and open thinker will enjoy this.3 RNA strands out of 5.Should I read this? Only if you care about thinking about thinking about science. Yes, I meant both ""think about""s.What did I learn? My understanding of science is not unsophisticated. In fact, I'm pretty well rounded but I do need to read more philosophical thought in general."

195,0199641013,http://goodreads.com/user/show/21134714-aiman-faruqi,5,"Physicists over the past hundred years have done a remarkable job in explaining the origin of the universe—from a singularity 13.7 billion years ago to the formation of stars, galaxies, planets, and the elements on the periodic table.Biologists over the past 150 years have done a similar remarkable job in describing how the complexity of life we see on earth today arose from the simple beginnings of a bacterial cell. When we take these two frameworks and put them together, there is a gap that glares back at us which we, to this day, have not understood how to bridge. That is, how did simple life arise from the chemicals and environments on the early earth? How could atoms and molecules form tremendously complex units of organization like the bacterial cell when systems spontaneously tend toward disorder as prescribed by the second law of thermodynamics?This is the precise question Dr. Pross addresses in his book. Much of the book establishes how life is stupendously complex and therefore its formation from non-life is such a difficult puzzle to solve. He introduces basic concepts in biology and chemistry such as teleonomy and chemical stability. The first few chapters can seem like a lecture, but they are completely justified for two reasons.One, Dr. Pross does an excellent job at explaining the ideas of chemistry and biology essential to the discussion in an understandable manner. This book does not read like a textbook; Dr. Pross gives it character and personality with his adept writing. Secondly, the science he explains is essential to understand at its most basic level in order to understand his proposed solution to the question in the title of his book. He describes how systems chemistry, a new branch of chemistry that involves the study of replicating networks of molecules, can offer explanations as to the origin of life. His approach is not only elegant, but also entirely consistent with the laws of physics as we understand them today.Truly, this is a must read for anyone interested in the question in its title. Excellent book. "
196,0199641013,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1038866-alexandra,2,"The concepts and ideas in the book are of the 5 star quality, but the book itself is not that good. All the good stuff is in the last couple of chapters - the rest are a very slow way to get there. I wish it was written by a better writer and with more passion toward the field itself, not just laying out ideas that could have fit into an article.I am not sure who the target audience for the book is. It explains the Second Law of Thermodynamics over and over, but at the same time assumes that the reader already knows the difference between RNA and DNA. I have to admit, I keep the science books to a very high standard of the ""Selfish Gene"" by Richard Dawkins. If the author intended to write for general audience, he should have followed a similar approach to Dawkins'- give a good in-depth overview of the field and then present his own ideas. This is kind of what this book attempts to do, but - see my comments above - doesn't actually achieve. I got the author's idea, but the worlds of the molecular chemistry and molecular biology are still a big mystery to me. As for the central idea of the book, it is very compelling and intriguing. I'll be following the science news more closely on the ""origin of life"" topic, that's for sure. Unfortunately, I could not find any in-depth critique of the book online and I know very little myself about this area. I can't say whether it's plausible or not, but does sound like it, although leaves a lot of open questions (my favorite was ""why did this chemical reaction happened just once in billion years? why does all life have a single origin? from his explanation it looks like there should be a forest of ""lives"", not a single tree). So the only option for us, non-scientists, is to wait and see how these ideas will play out.Update: I found and read Nick Lane's book ""The Vital Question"" on the same subject and apparently there is a lot of research done already and much more info available. So I am lowering this to just two stars."
197,0199641013,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10646107-rob,4,"Addy Pross is a Professor Emeritus at Ben-Gurion University in Israel. ""What is Life?"" that aspires to grand principles (just look at the title) but in the end is grounded in terms of actual content. The author's main goal is the directly connect the chemical ideas of abiogenesis (the beginning of life) with the biological ideas of evolution. I find the ideas very thought-provoking but perhaps not living up to its title: in that sense my biggest misgivings of this book really have to do with the way in which the title and introduction misrepresent the actual material.Pross gives a brief but fair (to my practicing molecular biologist but non-specialist in this field eyes) summary of current state of our understanding of abiogenesis, and also broadly touches a number of different areas of biology. Much of the book is therefore a review of the current state of our scientific knowledge; a solid review, I think, and one that I usually enjoyed (although it sometimes verges on long-winded).There are interesting ideas that I was not familiar with: dynamic kinetic stability, a concept that Pross introduces to understand what life is moving towards maximizing is intriguing, but it's clear that Pross has no way to quantifying this parameter, and thus I think it fails to provide any truly novel explanatory power that can't be found through previous work. If you don't work in the life sciences, however, you may not of thought too much about this stuff before, in which there will be much to enjoy and ponder here.This isn't Deepark Chopra; this isn't a book about finding life's purpose. Of course, any book at that is discussing the origins and definitions of life will find itself intersecting with philosophy, and Pross can't deny himself the opportunity for small digressions. Much (most) of the subject matter deals with chemical matters, so be prepared for that, though Pross introduces it all nicely. "
198,0199641013,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1054712-kent-winward,4,"Trying to piece together a way to look at the world that seems to fit is a constant process. From high school on I had been disturbed by entropy and the Second Law of Thermodynamics. Pross at least articulated a plausible and likely theory on how life is a kinetically stable system that operates within the Second Law of Thermodynamics. The second insight that made this book worthwhile for me is the exponential reaction of replication in chemistry is essentially the quirk that forces the inanimate into the animate. Subsequently, the study of systems chemistry shows how natural selection operates even on a chemical scale -- and off we go into biology. Replication and consumption are key elements of life and what is better than replicating and consuming?On intriguing philosophical point that is slightly raised in the book is that our life and all life in general is actually not based on the individual, but the group/system which gives rise to life. The replication is where the meaning of life lies -- Dawkin's Selfish Gene or Henry Miller's Land of Fuck -- replication is the metaphysical clue to both morality, altruism and sex, but I'm just musing on the importance of replicating within a system as a fundamental key to life itself. And from an existential view, one quote from the book -- ""'eternal life' is an oxymoron"". Life is about maintaining a dynamic kinetic system, which means every living thing is in a state of continual replication and by necessity, replacement. True eternal life would be in keeping the replication system that is life in motion, the Second Law be damned. The big questions for science -- life and consciousness -- both seem to be emergent properties out of complex systems. Diving into the complexity is always a fun ride. "

The author states that biological evolution is a broader form of the same process happening at a chemical level. He goes on to describe the biological process in chemical terms. The author shows how life does not violate the second law of thermodynamics. The book builds up to its substance over most of it's length and concludes in the last couple of chapters. A short read which can be completed in a day. While it does give a fresh perspective to the subject, not the most eloquent or evocative of books. Gives a very general, 'process' view of life and robs the whole emergence 'process' of much charm. If you have a good imagination prepare to use it since the book is not replete with a whole lot of real world examples. Nevertheless for people interested in the subject of life origins, this is a good book to read and offers a fresh perspective to how life came to be. Don't let this be your first book on the life origin subject if that fascinates you. "

The book explores the question purely from a scientific viewpoint with a aim to bridge the gap between biology, or to be specific, systems biology, and systems chemistry.In a very Richard Dawkin-ish way, Pross, breaks down all the scientific puzzles with relation to what makes life different and what attributes of it actually contribute to saying, ""this is alive"". The book delves into various theories over years and proposes a new one of its own - a way to think about both sciences - biology and chemistry as one. Pross provides ample arguments to sustain the case and even convert most (non-scientifically gifted) people into accepting the possible validity of his arguments.It is definitely a new way to think about life and contemplate about it in a way that challenges many philosophical and theological beliefs (which is a good thing). Only cautionary note is that the book introduces readers to a various aspects of sciences that can be a little overwhelming to a casual reader."

The book treats some very interesting questions I had never thought of, like just what is the difference between life and something that is not alive? How might non-life have become or given rise to something living? This is definitely a science book and not a philosophical one. It is intended for a general audience but a pretty sophisticated one and is rather technical. That led to my mild disappointment with it. I wish he had defined or explained just a bit more. For example, he mentions horizontal gene transfer (HGT) in several places. This is transfer of genetic material to some organism other than one of your offspring. Fascinating, I thought! When does this happen and how? He never says.The book is still worth reading, though, if you are interested in the kinds of questions it asks."

Many of these books omit the origin of life. This book tries to bridge chemistry and biology via systems chemistry to obtain a coherent theory of life. Though technical details are somewhat lacking, the author is able to bring his point across quite lucidly. He presents a framework in which chemical and biological evolution are treated as the same through the term dynamic kinetic stability. This reminds me of the construction theory, another scientific theory for the origin of patterns and life, though this book is much better at representing its ideas. A short and enjoyable read with a couple of interesting ideas. "

It is a process that maximizes dynamic kinetic stability such that complex systems can persist without violating the Second Law of Thermodynamics. Complexification, which is network formation, can oftentimes confer more dynamic kinetic stability on systems. So the existence of life that ostensibly is teleonomic and organized is not mysterious. What is mysterious is that our universe allows conditions that are conducive to life. Surely there is a God! "

This book is trying to answer that question as well as it can. A good look at the basic things we know and have reproduced, and the things we can't ever reproduce and only have to guess. The book is about the definition of life, when chemistry becomes life and how it could happen. The normal entropy argument from creationists is destroyed and the book tells good stories while educating us with all of this.

So if everything is getting simpler by deteriorating, breaking, and decomposing, how does one get / maintain a stable state of complexity? First and foremost, the answer involves adding a lot of energy and resources, but there’s more to it than that--as the author explains. “Dynamic” can also be explained in complex terms, but it’s most easily thought of as being like a river in that the river’s existence is stable, but it’s always a different river—ever changing water molecules arranged differently. (Critically, our bodies are the same way. Except for neurons, our cells are constantly being replaced.) The term “kinetic” speaks to how said replacement takes place; replication must be fast and decay slow. The appeal of the ideas put forth by Pross is that they’re conceptually consistent with Darwinian Evolution. That is, an entirely new set of principles isn’t necessary to make sense of the origins of life. Pross argues that the self-replicating molecules that can most effectively put resources to use succeed in doing so, and—in the process--they drive others into extinction. I found this book interesting and readable. The author uses good analogies to make his points (which often deal in complex matter) as clearly as possible. I can’t disagree with the other reviewers who’ve pointed out that the book is a bit repetitive and drags out a relatively simple statement of the argument. It’s not so egregious that I could say that it’s necessarily the result of a desire to pad the book out to a length necessary to sell in hard-copy form. (But it might have been.) The understanding of this topic is in its infancy, but that doesn’t mean this book isn’t a valuable contribution to popular understanding of abiogenesis.I’d recommend this book for anyone interested in reflecting on from whence we came in a fashion that is open-minded to explanations that eschew the supernatural.

Addy Pross, though using the same title, adds the sub-title, ‘How Chemistry Becomes Biology’ and this is quite odd as he spends most of this very slim book attempting to persuade the reader of exactly the opposite; i.e. that biology is simply a sub set of chemistry, or at least its natural extension. His justification for this curious and, I imagine irritating – at least to biologists, strangely naïve claim is his depiction of the transformation from non-living to living matter as a two stage process the first of which, the abiological phase, which is governed, principally, according to the established laws of chemistry, results from the autocatalytic replication of organic molecules such as RNA resulting in replicating networks or primitive forms of embryonic proto-life. The second, biological, phase is governed by the ‘rules’ of evolution as elucidated by Darwin leading to an increase in organic complexity and the biodiversity we see today. Furthermore, he suggests the very same evolutionary rules that underpin the existence and survival of all living things also governed the ‘persistence’ of these early organic molecules, which were ‘selected for’ according to their ‘fitness’ as replicators with fitness being determined largely by their relative dynamic kinetic stabilities (DKS): basically, those that could replicate the quickest and thus were more kinetically stable persisted longer, replicated more often and, as a result of mutations, gave rise to chemical diversity and increasingly more complex molecules the interactions of which produced the kind of ‘emergent properties’ postulated as being, at east potentially, characteristic of primitive forms of proto-life. In order to convince the reader of the plausibility of his hypothesis he provides, early on, a brief explanation of the philosophical basis of the ‘scientific method’; i.e. induction, and then proceeds, in a kind of ‘sleight of hand’ way, to outline his argument on the basis of this underlying assumed ‘inductive’ authority.The book does revisit interesting questions and posits some potentially intriguing ways in which these might be answered. However, in no way, does it get anywhere near answering the basic question posed by its title and it would have benefitted hugely if its author had been a little more ‘up-front’ about this. Finally, those readers who do not have, at least, some acquaintance with science and its often abstruse terminology, might find the book, though short in length, a little heavy going."

How Chemistry Becomes Biology by Addy Pross.Someone recently called my understanding of science unsophisticated. When I probed deeper in to what was meant by this, I found that he saw my acceptance of scientific facts as me lacking the ability to challenge an idea.I thought about this for a while and dispute his perception of this because facts are facts. And facts determined using the scientific method are solid in my world. Damn us rational people.What I think he thought was that I accepted scientific philosophy and hypothesis as facts when they were not yet proven. That isn't something I do. To prove that to myself, I choose a few books and have started reading the more interesting ideas in current scientific thinking.This book is about Systems Chemistry which I hoped would help me extend my Systems Thinking views as well. Unfortunately, it did not.Firstly, I should state that I haven't touched the wet sciences (Chem and Biology) since final year high school and my science is the most theoretical it gets in computer science and discrete maths. Maybe that meant I was lacking the basic knowledge required to call bullshit on this book or not.The book is actually quite good and encourages you to think about micro systems in a macro systems fashion. In this case, the author tries to think about the essence of life in a chemical way using biological concepts like Darwin's Theory of Evolution.The problem I had with this book is that the first half is spent on ideas like Teleonomy and on discussions that seemed to be heading towards Intelligent Design. Still, I continued.The second problem I had with it is that if you look for patterns you will find them but that doesn't mean they are confirmation of your theory. Scientific method will make it fact. THEN I will buy in more.What the final half of the book did do was try to extrapolate out from biological fact to philosophise on what is the clinching factor that brought molecules together to attain a spark of life. It isn't about god and thank the flying spaghetti monster for that.As a book, it is easy to read although it does maintain a condescending overtone. You need at least high school biology, chemistry and physics to start this book. A critical and open thinker will enjoy this.3 RNA strands out of 5.Should I read this? Only if you care about thinking about thinking about science. Yes, I meant both ""think about""s.What did I learn? My understanding of science is not unsophisticated. In fact, I'm pretty well rounded but I do need to read more philosophical thought in general."

225,0199641013,http://goodreads.com/user/show/21134714-aiman-faruqi,5,"Physicists over the past hundred years have done a remarkable job in explaining the origin of the universe—from a singularity 13.7 billion years ago to the formation of stars, galaxies, planets, and the elements on the periodic table.Biologists over the past 150 years have done a similar remarkable job in describing how the complexity of life we see on earth today arose from the simple beginnings of a bacterial cell. When we take these two frameworks and put them together, there is a gap that glares back at us which we, to this day, have not understood how to bridge. That is, how did simple life arise from the chemicals and environments on the early earth? How could atoms and molecules form tremendously complex units of organization like the bacterial cell when systems spontaneously tend toward disorder as prescribed by the second law of thermodynamics?This is the precise question Dr. Pross addresses in his book. Much of the book establishes how life is stupendously complex and therefore its formation from non-life is such a difficult puzzle to solve. He introduces basic concepts in biology and chemistry such as teleonomy and chemical stability. The first few chapters can seem like a lecture, but they are completely justified for two reasons.One, Dr. Pross does an excellent job at explaining the ideas of chemistry and biology essential to the discussion in an understandable manner. This book does not read like a textbook; Dr. Pross gives it character and personality with his adept writing. Secondly, the science he explains is essential to understand at its most basic level in order to understand his proposed solution to the question in the title of his book. He describes how systems chemistry, a new branch of chemistry that involves the study of replicating networks of molecules, can offer explanations as to the origin of life. His approach is not only elegant, but also entirely consistent with the laws of physics as we understand them today.Truly, this is a must read for anyone interested in the question in its title. Excellent book. "
226,0199641013,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1038866-alexandra,2,"The concepts and ideas in the book are of the 5 star quality, but the book itself is not that good. All the good stuff is in the last couple of chapters - the rest are a very slow way to get there. I wish it was written by a better writer and with more passion toward the field itself, not just laying out ideas that could have fit into an article.I am not sure who the target audience for the book is. It explains the Second Law of Thermodynamics over and over, but at the same time assumes that the reader already knows the difference between RNA and DNA. I have to admit, I keep the science books to a very high standard of the ""Selfish Gene"" by Richard Dawkins. If the author intended to write for general audience, he should have followed a similar approach to Dawkins'- give a good in-depth overview of the field and then present his own ideas. This is kind of what this book attempts to do, but - see my comments above - doesn't actually achieve. I got the author's idea, but the worlds of the molecular chemistry and molecular biology are still a big mystery to me. As for the central idea of the book, it is very compelling and intriguing. I'll be following the science news more closely on the ""origin of life"" topic, that's for sure. Unfortunately, I could not find any in-depth critique of the book online and I know very little myself about this area. I can't say whether it's plausible or not, but does sound like it, although leaves a lot of open questions (my favorite was ""why did this chemical reaction happened just once in billion years? why does all life have a single origin? from his explanation it looks like there should be a forest of ""lives"", not a single tree). So the only option for us, non-scientists, is to wait and see how these ideas will play out.Update: I found and read Nick Lane's book ""The Vital Question"" on the same subject and apparently there is a lot of research done already and much more info available. So I am lowering this to just two stars."
227,0199641013,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10646107-rob,4,"Addy Pross is a Professor Emeritus at Ben-Gurion University in Israel. ""What is Life?"" that aspires to grand principles (just look at the title) but in the end is grounded in terms of actual content. The author's main goal is the directly connect the chemical ideas of abiogenesis (the beginning of life) with the biological ideas of evolution. I find the ideas very thought-provoking but perhaps not living up to its title: in that sense my biggest misgivings of this book really have to do with the way in which the title and introduction misrepresent the actual material.Pross gives a brief but fair (to my practicing molecular biologist but non-specialist in this field eyes) summary of current state of our understanding of abiogenesis, and also broadly touches a number of different areas of biology. Much of the book is therefore a review of the current state of our scientific knowledge; a solid review, I think, and one that I usually enjoyed (although it sometimes verges on long-winded).There are interesting ideas that I was not familiar with: dynamic kinetic stability, a concept that Pross introduces to understand what life is moving towards maximizing is intriguing, but it's clear that Pross has no way to quantifying this parameter, and thus I think it fails to provide any truly novel explanatory power that can't be found through previous work. If you don't work in the life sciences, however, you may not of thought too much about this stuff before, in which there will be much to enjoy and ponder here.This isn't Deepark Chopra; this isn't a book about finding life's purpose. Of course, any book at that is discussing the origins and definitions of life will find itself intersecting with philosophy, and Pross can't deny himself the opportunity for small digressions. Much (most) of the subject matter deals with chemical matters, so be prepared for that, though Pross introduces it all nicely. "
228,0199641013,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1054712-kent-winward,4,"Trying to piece together a way to look at the world that seems to fit is a constant process. From high school on I had been disturbed by entropy and the Second Law of Thermodynamics. Pross at least articulated a plausible and likely theory on how life is a kinetically stable system that operates within the Second Law of Thermodynamics. The second insight that made this book worthwhile for me is the exponential reaction of replication in chemistry is essentially the quirk that forces the inanimate into the animate. Subsequently, the study of systems chemistry shows how natural selection operates even on a chemical scale -- and off we go into biology. Replication and consumption are key elements of life and what is better than replicating and consuming?On intriguing philosophical point that is slightly raised in the book is that our life and all life in general is actually not based on the individual, but the group/system which gives rise to life. The replication is where the meaning of life lies -- Dawkin's Selfish Gene or Henry Miller's Land of Fuck -- replication is the metaphysical clue to both morality, altruism and sex, but I'm just musing on the importance of replicating within a system as a fundamental key to life itself. And from an existential view, one quote from the book -- ""'eternal life' is an oxymoron"". Life is about maintaining a dynamic kinetic system, which means every living thing is in a state of continual replication and by necessity, replacement. True eternal life would be in keeping the replication system that is life in motion, the Second Law be damned. The big questions for science -- life and consciousness -- both seem to be emergent properties out of complex systems. Diving into the complexity is always a fun ride. "

The author shows how life does not violate the second law of thermodynamics. The book builds up to its substance over most of it's length and concludes in the last couple of chapters. A short read which can be completed in a day. While it does give a fresh perspective to the subject, not the most eloquent or evocative of books. Gives a very general, 'process' view of life and robs the whole emergence 'process' of much charm. If you have a good imagination prepare to use it since the book is not replete with a whole lot of real world examples. Nevertheless for people interested in the subject of life origins, this is a good book to read and offers a fresh perspective to how life came to be.

The book explores the question purely from a scientific viewpoint with a aim to bridge the gap between biology, or to be specific, systems biology, and systems chemistry.In a very Richard Dawkin-ish way, Pross, breaks down all the scientific puzzles with relation to what makes life different and what attributes of it actually contribute to saying, ""this is alive"". The book delves into various theories over years and proposes a new one of its own - a way to think about both sciences - biology and chemistry as one. Pross provides ample arguments to sustain the case and even convert most (non-scientifically gifted) people into accepting the possible validity of his arguments.It is definitely a new way to think about life and contemplate about it in a way that challenges many philosophical and theological beliefs (which is a good thing).

The book treats some very interesting questions I had never thought of, like just what is the difference between life and something that is not alive? How might non-life have become or given rise to something living? This is definitely a science book and not a philosophical one. It is intended for a general audience but a pretty sophisticated one and is rather technical. That led to my mild disappointment with it. I wish he had defined or explained just a bit more. For example, he mentions horizontal gene transfer (HGT) in several places. This is transfer of genetic material to some organism other than one of your offspring. Fascinating, I thought! When does this happen and how? He never says.The book is still worth reading, though, if you are interested in the kinds of questions it asks."

He presents a framework in which chemical and biological evolution are treated as the same through the term dynamic kinetic stability. This reminds me of the construction theory, another scientific theory for the origin of patterns and life, though this book is much better at representing its ideas.

251,0199641013,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6423134-bernie-gourley,4,"Dr. Pross’s book shares a title (but not a subtitle) with the seminal work by the renowned physicist Erwin Schrödinger from 1944. While Schrödinger addresses a wide range of topics on how life might be explained in terms of physics and chemistry, Pross’s focus is narrower. Pross asks—and proposes an answer for—the straightforward (but thorny) question of how abiogenesis could occur. Abiogenesis is life from the non-living. Darwin did an excellent job of explaining how we could get from single-celled organisms to the great complexity we see in our own bodies, but Darwin didn’t touch the question of how that very first ancestor became animated.The subtitle of this work, “How Chemistry Becomes Biology,” gives one insight into how Pross proceeds. There’ve been many ideas about how life came to be on planet Earth over the years. For a time, the idea of panspermia—life arriving from an extraterrestrial source—was popular. Of course, the most popular belief has been that there was a force of life (i.e. an “élan vital”) breathed into non-living matter by a, presumably, supernatural force / entity. While the awe-inspiring nature of life made this idea appealing / believable, it took a hit from the Urey-Miller experiments. Said experiment exposed the four materials believed to have been the most common in our pre-biologic atmosphere (hydrogen, ammonia, methane, and water vapor) to lightning, and the result included a range of organic materials—including amino acids--the building blocks of… well, us, among the other life forms of the planet. Of course, Urey-Miller didn’t make abiogenesis a foregone conclusion, but the production of ever more complex self-replicating molecules under laboratory conditions has made it easier to digest the notion that life developed without any intelligent or supernatural push. While Pross’s ideas are at the stage of hypothesis, he develops a compelling explanation that revolves around the idea of dynamic kinetic stability. “Dynamic Kinetic Stability” is a mouthful, and so it’s necessary to break it down. The best place to start is with the “stability” part. This is because the biggest problem for an abiogenetical theory of life is the Second Law of Thermodynamics. The Second Law tells us that entropy increases. There are many ways of restating this, such as that chemical reactions move to states that are of lower free energy. However, the most intuitive way is to say that a beer mugs break but do not spontaneously pop into existence. So if everything is getting simpler by deteriorating, breaking, and decomposing, how does one get / maintain a stable state of complexity? First and foremost, the answer involves adding a lot of energy and resources, but there’s more to it than that--as the author explains. “Dynamic” can also be explained in complex terms, but it’s most easily thought of as being like a river in that the river’s existence is stable, but it’s always a different river—ever changing water molecules arranged differently. (Critically, our bodies are the same way. Except for neurons, our cells are constantly being replaced.) The term “kinetic” speaks to how said replacement takes place; replication must be fast and decay slow. The appeal of the ideas put forth by Pross is that they’re conceptually consistent with Darwinian Evolution. That is, an entirely new set of principles isn’t necessary to make sense of the origins of life. Pross argues that the self-replicating molecules that can most effectively put resources to use succeed in doing so, and—in the process--they drive others into extinction. I found this book interesting and readable. The author uses good analogies to make his points (which often deal in complex matter) as clearly as possible. I can’t disagree with the other reviewers who’ve pointed out that the book is a bit repetitive and drags out a relatively simple statement of the argument. It’s not so egregious that I could say that it’s necessarily the result of a desire to pad the book out to a length necessary to sell in hard-copy form. (But it might have been.) The understanding of this topic is in its infancy, but that doesn’t mean this book isn’t a valuable contribution to popular understanding of abiogenesis.I’d recommend this book for anyone interested in reflecting on from whence we came in a fashion that is open-minded to explanations that eschew the supernatural.

The second, biological, phase is governed by the ‘rules’ of evolution as elucidated by Darwin leading to an increase in organic complexity and the biodiversity we see today. Furthermore, he suggests the very same evolutionary rules that underpin the existence and survival of all living things also governed the ‘persistence’ of these early organic molecules, which were ‘selected for’ according to their ‘fitness’ as replicators with fitness being determined largely by their relative dynamic kinetic stabilities (DKS): basically, those that could replicate the quickest and thus were more kinetically stable persisted longer, replicated more often and, as a result of mutations, gave rise to chemical diversity and increasingly more complex molecules the interactions of which produced the kind of ‘emergent properties’ postulated as being, at east potentially, characteristic of primitive forms of proto-life. In order to convince the reader of the plausibility of his hypothesis he provides, early on, a brief explanation of the philosophical basis of the ‘scientific method’; i.e. induction, and then proceeds, in a kind of ‘sleight of hand’ way, to outline his argument on the basis of this underlying assumed ‘inductive’ authority.The book does revisit interesting questions and posits some potentially intriguing ways in which these might be answered. However, in no way, does it get anywhere near answering the basic question posed by its title and it would have benefitted hugely if its author had been a little more ‘up-front’ about this. Finally, those readers who do not have, at least, some acquaintance with science and its often abstruse terminology, might find the book, though short in length, a little heavy going."

How Chemistry Becomes Biology by Addy Pross.Someone recently called my understanding of science unsophisticated. When I probed deeper in to what was meant by this, I found that he saw my acceptance of scientific facts as me lacking the ability to challenge an idea.I thought about this for a while and dispute his perception of this because facts are facts. And facts determined using the scientific method are solid in my world. Damn us rational people.What I think he thought was that I accepted scientific philosophy and hypothesis as facts when they were not yet proven. That isn't something I do. To prove that to myself, I choose a few books and have started reading the more interesting ideas in current scientific thinking.This book is about Systems Chemistry which I hoped would help me extend my Systems Thinking views as well.

Maybe that meant I was lacking the basic knowledge required to call bullshit on this book or not.The book is actually quite good and encourages you to think about micro systems in a macro systems fashion. In this case, the author tries to think about the essence of life in a chemical way using biological concepts like Darwin's Theory of Evolution.The problem I had with this book is that the first half is spent on ideas like Teleonomy and on discussions that seemed to be heading towards Intelligent Design. Still, I continued.The second problem I had with it is that if you look for patterns you will find them but that doesn't mean they are confirmation of your theory. Scientific method will make it fact. THEN I will buy in more.What the final half of the book did do was try to extrapolate out from biological fact to philosophise on what is the clinching factor that brought molecules together to attain a spark of life. It isn't about god and thank the flying spaghetti monster for that.As a book, it is easy to read although it does maintain a condescending overtone. You need at least high school biology, chemistry and physics to start this book. A critical and open thinker will enjoy this.3 RNA strands out of 5.Should I read this?

255,0199641013,http://goodreads.com/user/show/21134714-aiman-faruqi,5,"Physicists over the past hundred years have done a remarkable job in explaining the origin of the universe—from a singularity 13.7 billion years ago to the formation of stars, galaxies, planets, and the elements on the periodic table.Biologists over the past 150 years have done a similar remarkable job in describing how the complexity of life we see on earth today arose from the simple beginnings of a bacterial cell. When we take these two frameworks and put them together, there is a gap that glares back at us which we, to this day, have not understood how to bridge. That is, how did simple life arise from the chemicals and environments on the early earth? How could atoms and molecules form tremendously complex units of organization like the bacterial cell when systems spontaneously tend toward disorder as prescribed by the second law of thermodynamics?This is the precise question Dr. Pross addresses in his book. Much of the book establishes how life is stupendously complex and therefore its formation from non-life is such a difficult puzzle to solve. He introduces basic concepts in biology and chemistry such as teleonomy and chemical stability. The first few chapters can seem like a lecture, but they are completely justified for two reasons.One, Dr. Pross does an excellent job at explaining the ideas of chemistry and biology essential to the discussion in an understandable manner. This book does not read like a textbook; Dr. Pross gives it character and personality with his adept writing. Secondly, the science he explains is essential to understand at its most basic level in order to understand his proposed solution to the question in the title of his book. He describes how systems chemistry, a new branch of chemistry that involves the study of replicating networks of molecules, can offer explanations as to the origin of life. His approach is not only elegant, but also entirely consistent with the laws of physics as we understand them today.Truly, this is a must read for anyone interested in the question in its title. Excellent book. "
256,0199641013,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1038866-alexandra,2,"The concepts and ideas in the book are of the 5 star quality, but the book itself is not that good. All the good stuff is in the last couple of chapters - the rest are a very slow way to get there. I wish it was written by a better writer and with more passion toward the field itself, not just laying out ideas that could have fit into an article.I am not sure who the target audience for the book is. It explains the Second Law of Thermodynamics over and over, but at the same time assumes that the reader already knows the difference between RNA and DNA. I have to admit, I keep the science books to a very high standard of the ""Selfish Gene"" by Richard Dawkins. If the author intended to write for general audience, he should have followed a similar approach to Dawkins'- give a good in-depth overview of the field and then present his own ideas. This is kind of what this book attempts to do, but - see my comments above - doesn't actually achieve. I got the author's idea, but the worlds of the molecular chemistry and molecular biology are still a big mystery to me. As for the central idea of the book, it is very compelling and intriguing. I'll be following the science news more closely on the ""origin of life"" topic, that's for sure. Unfortunately, I could not find any in-depth critique of the book online and I know very little myself about this area. I can't say whether it's plausible or not, but does sound like it, although leaves a lot of open questions (my favorite was ""why did this chemical reaction happened just once in billion years? why does all life have a single origin? from his explanation it looks like there should be a forest of ""lives"", not a single tree). So the only option for us, non-scientists, is to wait and see how these ideas will play out.Update: I found and read Nick Lane's book ""The Vital Question"" on the same subject and apparently there is a lot of research done already and much more info available. So I am lowering this to just two stars."
257,0199641013,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10646107-rob,4,"Addy Pross is a Professor Emeritus at Ben-Gurion University in Israel. ""What is Life?"" that aspires to grand principles (just look at the title) but in the end is grounded in terms of actual content. The author's main goal is the directly connect the chemical ideas of abiogenesis (the beginning of life) with the biological ideas of evolution. I find the ideas very thought-provoking but perhaps not living up to its title: in that sense my biggest misgivings of this book really have to do with the way in which the title and introduction misrepresent the actual material.Pross gives a brief but fair (to my practicing molecular biologist but non-specialist in this field eyes) summary of current state of our understanding of abiogenesis, and also broadly touches a number of different areas of biology. Much of the book is therefore a review of the current state of our scientific knowledge; a solid review, I think, and one that I usually enjoyed (although it sometimes verges on long-winded).There are interesting ideas that I was not familiar with: dynamic kinetic stability, a concept that Pross introduces to understand what life is moving towards maximizing is intriguing, but it's clear that Pross has no way to quantifying this parameter, and thus I think it fails to provide any truly novel explanatory power that can't be found through previous work. If you don't work in the life sciences, however, you may not of thought too much about this stuff before, in which there will be much to enjoy and ponder here.This isn't Deepark Chopra; this isn't a book about finding life's purpose. Of course, any book at that is discussing the origins and definitions of life will find itself intersecting with philosophy, and Pross can't deny himself the opportunity for small digressions. Much (most) of the subject matter deals with chemical matters, so be prepared for that, though Pross introduces it all nicely. "
258,0199641013,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1054712-kent-winward,4,"Trying to piece together a way to look at the world that seems to fit is a constant process. From high school on I had been disturbed by entropy and the Second Law of Thermodynamics. Pross at least articulated a plausible and likely theory on how life is a kinetically stable system that operates within the Second Law of Thermodynamics. The second insight that made this book worthwhile for me is the exponential reaction of replication in chemistry is essentially the quirk that forces the inanimate into the animate. Subsequently, the study of systems chemistry shows how natural selection operates even on a chemical scale -- and off we go into biology. Replication and consumption are key elements of life and what is better than replicating and consuming?On intriguing philosophical point that is slightly raised in the book is that our life and all life in general is actually not based on the individual, but the group/system which gives rise to life. The replication is where the meaning of life lies -- Dawkin's Selfish Gene or Henry Miller's Land of Fuck -- replication is the metaphysical clue to both morality, altruism and sex, but I'm just musing on the importance of replicating within a system as a fundamental key to life itself. And from an existential view, one quote from the book -- ""'eternal life' is an oxymoron"". Life is about maintaining a dynamic kinetic system, which means every living thing is in a state of continual replication and by necessity, replacement. True eternal life would be in keeping the replication system that is life in motion, the Second Law be damned. The big questions for science -- life and consciousness -- both seem to be emergent properties out of complex systems. Diving into the complexity is always a fun ride. "

The author shows how life does not violate the second law of thermodynamics. The book builds up to its substance over most of it's length and concludes in the last couple of chapters. A short read which can be completed in a day. While it does give a fresh perspective to the subject, not the most eloquent or evocative of books. Gives a very general, 'process' view of life and robs the whole emergence 'process' of much charm. If you have a good imagination prepare to use it since the book is not replete with a whole lot of real world examples. Nevertheless for people interested in the subject of life origins, this is a good book to read and offers a fresh perspective to how life came to be.

The book explores the question purely from a scientific viewpoint with a aim to bridge the gap between biology, or to be specific, systems biology, and systems chemistry.In a very Richard Dawkin-ish way, Pross, breaks down all the scientific puzzles with relation to what makes life different and what attributes of it actually contribute to saying, ""this is alive"". The book delves into various theories over years and proposes a new one of its own - a way to think about both sciences - biology and chemistry as one. Pross provides ample arguments to sustain the case and even convert most (non-scientifically gifted) people into accepting the possible validity of his arguments.It is definitely a new way to think about life and contemplate about it in a way that challenges many philosophical and theological beliefs (which is a good thing).

The book treats some very interesting questions I had never thought of, like just what is the difference between life and something that is not alive? How might non-life have become or given rise to something living? This is definitely a science book and not a philosophical one. It is intended for a general audience but a pretty sophisticated one and is rather technical. That led to my mild disappointment with it. I wish he had defined or explained just a bit more. For example, he mentions horizontal gene transfer (HGT) in several places. This is transfer of genetic material to some organism other than one of your offspring. Fascinating, I thought! When does this happen and how? He never says.The book is still worth reading, though, if you are interested in the kinds of questions it asks."

Many of these books omit the origin of life. This book tries to bridge chemistry and biology via systems chemistry to obtain a coherent theory of life. Though technical details are somewhat lacking, the author is able to bring his point across quite lucidly. He presents a framework in which chemical and biological evolution are treated as the same through the term dynamic kinetic stability. This reminds me of the construction theory, another scientific theory for the origin of patterns and life, though this book is much better at representing its ideas. A short and enjoyable read with a couple of interesting ideas. "

It is a process that maximizes dynamic kinetic stability such that complex systems can persist without violating the Second Law of Thermodynamics. Complexification, which is network formation, can oftentimes confer more dynamic kinetic stability on systems. So the existence of life that ostensibly is teleonomic and organized is not mysterious. What is mysterious is that our universe allows conditions that are conducive to life. Surely there is a God! "

281,0199641013,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6423134-bernie-gourley,4,"Dr. Pross’s book shares a title (but not a subtitle) with the seminal work by the renowned physicist Erwin Schrödinger from 1944. While Schrödinger addresses a wide range of topics on how life might be explained in terms of physics and chemistry, Pross’s focus is narrower. Pross asks—and proposes an answer for—the straightforward (but thorny) question of how abiogenesis could occur. Abiogenesis is life from the non-living. Darwin did an excellent job of explaining how we could get from single-celled organisms to the great complexity we see in our own bodies, but Darwin didn’t touch the question of how that very first ancestor became animated.The subtitle of this work, “How Chemistry Becomes Biology,” gives one insight into how Pross proceeds. There’ve been many ideas about how life came to be on planet Earth over the years. For a time, the idea of panspermia—life arriving from an extraterrestrial source—was popular. Of course, the most popular belief has been that there was a force of life (i.e. an “élan vital”) breathed into non-living matter by a, presumably, supernatural force / entity. While the awe-inspiring nature of life made this idea appealing / believable, it took a hit from the Urey-Miller experiments. Said experiment exposed the four materials believed to have been the most common in our pre-biologic atmosphere (hydrogen, ammonia, methane, and water vapor) to lightning, and the result included a range of organic materials—including amino acids--the building blocks of… well, us, among the other life forms of the planet. Of course, Urey-Miller didn’t make abiogenesis a foregone conclusion, but the production of ever more complex self-replicating molecules under laboratory conditions has made it easier to digest the notion that life developed without any intelligent or supernatural push. While Pross’s ideas are at the stage of hypothesis, he develops a compelling explanation that revolves around the idea of dynamic kinetic stability. “Dynamic Kinetic Stability” is a mouthful, and so it’s necessary to break it down. The best place to start is with the “stability” part. This is because the biggest problem for an abiogenetical theory of life is the Second Law of Thermodynamics. The Second Law tells us that entropy increases. There are many ways of restating this, such as that chemical reactions move to states that are of lower free energy. However, the most intuitive way is to say that a beer mugs break but do not spontaneously pop into existence. So if everything is getting simpler by deteriorating, breaking, and decomposing, how does one get / maintain a stable state of complexity? First and foremost, the answer involves adding a lot of energy and resources, but there’s more to it than that--as the author explains. “Dynamic” can also be explained in complex terms, but it’s most easily thought of as being like a river in that the river’s existence is stable, but it’s always a different river—ever changing water molecules arranged differently. (Critically, our bodies are the same way. Except for neurons, our cells are constantly being replaced.) The term “kinetic” speaks to how said replacement takes place; replication must be fast and decay slow. The appeal of the ideas put forth by Pross is that they’re conceptually consistent with Darwinian Evolution. That is, an entirely new set of principles isn’t necessary to make sense of the origins of life. Pross argues that the self-replicating molecules that can most effectively put resources to use succeed in doing so, and—in the process--they drive others into extinction. I found this book interesting and readable. The author uses good analogies to make his points (which often deal in complex matter) as clearly as possible. I can’t disagree with the other reviewers who’ve pointed out that the book is a bit repetitive and drags out a relatively simple statement of the argument. It’s not so egregious that I could say that it’s necessarily the result of a desire to pad the book out to a length necessary to sell in hard-copy form. (But it might have been.) The understanding of this topic is in its infancy, but that doesn’t mean this book isn’t a valuable contribution to popular understanding of abiogenesis.I’d recommend this book for anyone interested in reflecting on from whence we came in a fashion that is open-minded to explanations that eschew the supernatural. "
282,0199641013,http://goodreads.com/user/show/17001694-stevedutch,3,"In 1944 Erwin Schrodinger published a little book with the title, ‘What is Life?’ Though, obviously not the first to pose this question, it is purported to have provided at least part of the inspiration to those, such as Watson and Crick, who would later go some way to answering it. Addy Pross, though using the same title, adds the sub-title, ‘How Chemistry Becomes Biology’ and this is quite odd as he spends most of this very slim book attempting to persuade the reader of exactly the opposite; i.e. that biology is simply a sub set of chemistry, or at least its natural extension. His justification for this curious and, I imagine irritating – at least to biologists, strangely naïve claim is his depiction of the transformation from non-living to living matter as a two stage process the first of which, the abiological phase, which is governed, principally, according to the established laws of chemistry, results from the autocatalytic replication of organic molecules such as RNA resulting in replicating networks or primitive forms of embryonic proto-life. The second, biological, phase is governed by the ‘rules’ of evolution as elucidated by Darwin leading to an increase in organic complexity and the biodiversity we see today. Furthermore, he suggests the very same evolutionary rules that underpin the existence and survival of all living things also governed the ‘persistence’ of these early organic molecules, which were ‘selected for’ according to their ‘fitness’ as replicators with fitness being determined largely by their relative dynamic kinetic stabilities (DKS): basically, those that could replicate the quickest and thus were more kinetically stable persisted longer, replicated more often and, as a result of mutations, gave rise to chemical diversity and increasingly more complex molecules the interactions of which produced the kind of ‘emergent properties’ postulated as being, at east potentially, characteristic of primitive forms of proto-life. In order to convince the reader of the plausibility of his hypothesis he provides, early on, a brief explanation of the philosophical basis of the ‘scientific method’; i.e. induction, and then proceeds, in a kind of ‘sleight of hand’ way, to outline his argument on the basis of this underlying assumed ‘inductive’ authority.The book does revisit interesting questions and posits some potentially intriguing ways in which these might be answered. However, in no way, does it get anywhere near answering the basic question posed by its title and it would have benefitted hugely if its author had been a little more ‘up-front’ about this. Finally, those readers who do not have, at least, some acquaintance with science and its often abstruse terminology, might find the book, though short in length, a little heavy going."

285,0199641013,http://goodreads.com/user/show/21134714-aiman-faruqi,5,"Physicists over the past hundred years have done a remarkable job in explaining the origin of the universe—from a singularity 13.7 billion years ago to the formation of stars, galaxies, planets, and the elements on the periodic table.Biologists over the past 150 years have done a similar remarkable job in describing how the complexity of life we see on earth today arose from the simple beginnings of a bacterial cell. When we take these two frameworks and put them together, there is a gap that glares back at us which we, to this day, have not understood how to bridge. That is, how did simple life arise from the chemicals and environments on the early earth? How could atoms and molecules form tremendously complex units of organization like the bacterial cell when systems spontaneously tend toward disorder as prescribed by the second law of thermodynamics?This is the precise question Dr. Pross addresses in his book. Much of the book establishes how life is stupendously complex and therefore its formation from non-life is such a difficult puzzle to solve. He introduces basic concepts in biology and chemistry such as teleonomy and chemical stability. The first few chapters can seem like a lecture, but they are completely justified for two reasons.One, Dr. Pross does an excellent job at explaining the ideas of chemistry and biology essential to the discussion in an understandable manner. This book does not read like a textbook; Dr. Pross gives it character and personality with his adept writing. Secondly, the science he explains is essential to understand at its most basic level in order to understand his proposed solution to the question in the title of his book. He describes how systems chemistry, a new branch of chemistry that involves the study of replicating networks of molecules, can offer explanations as to the origin of life. His approach is not only elegant, but also entirely consistent with the laws of physics as we understand them today.Truly, this is a must read for anyone interested in the question in its title. Excellent book. "
286,0199641013,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1038866-alexandra,2,"The concepts and ideas in the book are of the 5 star quality, but the book itself is not that good. All the good stuff is in the last couple of chapters - the rest are a very slow way to get there. I wish it was written by a better writer and with more passion toward the field itself, not just laying out ideas that could have fit into an article.I am not sure who the target audience for the book is. It explains the Second Law of Thermodynamics over and over, but at the same time assumes that the reader already knows the difference between RNA and DNA. I have to admit, I keep the science books to a very high standard of the ""Selfish Gene"" by Richard Dawkins. If the author intended to write for general audience, he should have followed a similar approach to Dawkins'- give a good in-depth overview of the field and then present his own ideas. This is kind of what this book attempts to do, but - see my comments above - doesn't actually achieve. I got the author's idea, but the worlds of the molecular chemistry and molecular biology are still a big mystery to me. As for the central idea of the book, it is very compelling and intriguing. I'll be following the science news more closely on the ""origin of life"" topic, that's for sure. Unfortunately, I could not find any in-depth critique of the book online and I know very little myself about this area. I can't say whether it's plausible or not, but does sound like it, although leaves a lot of open questions (my favorite was ""why did this chemical reaction happened just once in billion years? why does all life have a single origin? from his explanation it looks like there should be a forest of ""lives"", not a single tree). So the only option for us, non-scientists, is to wait and see how these ideas will play out.Update: I found and read Nick Lane's book ""The Vital Question"" on the same subject and apparently there is a lot of research done already and much more info available. So I am lowering this to just two stars."
287,0199641013,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10646107-rob,4,"Addy Pross is a Professor Emeritus at Ben-Gurion University in Israel. ""What is Life?"" that aspires to grand principles (just look at the title) but in the end is grounded in terms of actual content. The author's main goal is the directly connect the chemical ideas of abiogenesis (the beginning of life) with the biological ideas of evolution. I find the ideas very thought-provoking but perhaps not living up to its title: in that sense my biggest misgivings of this book really have to do with the way in which the title and introduction misrepresent the actual material.Pross gives a brief but fair (to my practicing molecular biologist but non-specialist in this field eyes) summary of current state of our understanding of abiogenesis, and also broadly touches a number of different areas of biology. Much of the book is therefore a review of the current state of our scientific knowledge; a solid review, I think, and one that I usually enjoyed (although it sometimes verges on long-winded).There are interesting ideas that I was not familiar with: dynamic kinetic stability, a concept that Pross introduces to understand what life is moving towards maximizing is intriguing, but it's clear that Pross has no way to quantifying this parameter, and thus I think it fails to provide any truly novel explanatory power that can't be found through previous work. If you don't work in the life sciences, however, you may not of thought too much about this stuff before, in which there will be much to enjoy and ponder here.This isn't Deepark Chopra; this isn't a book about finding life's purpose. Of course, any book at that is discussing the origins and definitions of life will find itself intersecting with philosophy, and Pross can't deny himself the opportunity for small digressions. Much (most) of the subject matter deals with chemical matters, so be prepared for that, though Pross introduces it all nicely. "
288,0199641013,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1054712-kent-winward,4,"Trying to piece together a way to look at the world that seems to fit is a constant process. From high school on I had been disturbed by entropy and the Second Law of Thermodynamics. Pross at least articulated a plausible and likely theory on how life is a kinetically stable system that operates within the Second Law of Thermodynamics. The second insight that made this book worthwhile for me is the exponential reaction of replication in chemistry is essentially the quirk that forces the inanimate into the animate. Subsequently, the study of systems chemistry shows how natural selection operates even on a chemical scale -- and off we go into biology. Replication and consumption are key elements of life and what is better than replicating and consuming?On intriguing philosophical point that is slightly raised in the book is that our life and all life in general is actually not based on the individual, but the group/system which gives rise to life. The replication is where the meaning of life lies -- Dawkin's Selfish Gene or Henry Miller's Land of Fuck -- replication is the metaphysical clue to both morality, altruism and sex, but I'm just musing on the importance of replicating within a system as a fundamental key to life itself. And from an existential view, one quote from the book -- ""'eternal life' is an oxymoron"". Life is about maintaining a dynamic kinetic system, which means every living thing is in a state of continual replication and by necessity, replacement. True eternal life would be in keeping the replication system that is life in motion, the Second Law be damned. The big questions for science -- life and consciousness -- both seem to be emergent properties out of complex systems. Diving into the complexity is always a fun ride. "

The author states that biological evolution is a broader form of the same process happening at a chemical level. He goes on to describe the biological process in chemical terms. The author shows how life does not violate the second law of thermodynamics. The book builds up to its substance over most of it's length and concludes in the last couple of chapters. A short read which can be completed in a day. While it does give a fresh perspective to the subject, not the most eloquent or evocative of books. Gives a very general, 'process' view of life and robs the whole emergence 'process' of much charm. If you have a good imagination prepare to use it since the book is not replete with a whole lot of real world examples. Nevertheless for people interested in the subject of life origins, this is a good book to read and offers a fresh perspective to how life came to be. Don't let this be your first book on the life origin subject if that fascinates you. "
290,0199641013,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10797234-ravi-warrier,4,"If one reads this book with an expectation to get answers of a more existential, philosophical nature then one is going to be highly disappointed. The book explores the question purely from a scientific viewpoint with a aim to bridge the gap between biology, or to be specific, systems biology, and systems chemistry.In a very Richard Dawkin-ish way, Pross, breaks down all the scientific puzzles with relation to what makes life different and what attributes of it actually contribute to saying, ""this is alive"". The book delves into various theories over years and proposes a new one of its own - a way to think about both sciences - biology and chemistry as one. Pross provides ample arguments to sustain the case and even convert most (non-scientifically gifted) people into accepting the possible validity of his arguments.It is definitely a new way to think about life and contemplate about it in a way that challenges many philosophical and theological beliefs (which is a good thing). Only cautionary note is that the book introduces readers to a various aspects of sciences that can be a little overwhelming to a casual reader."

The book treats some very interesting questions I had never thought of, like just what is the difference between life and something that is not alive? How might non-life have become or given rise to something living? This is definitely a science book and not a philosophical one. It is intended for a general audience but a pretty sophisticated one and is rather technical. That led to my mild disappointment with it. I wish he had defined or explained just a bit more. For example, he mentions horizontal gene transfer (HGT) in several places. This is transfer of genetic material to some organism other than one of your offspring. Fascinating, I thought! When does this happen and how? He never says.The book is still worth reading, though, if you are interested in the kinds of questions it asks."
293,0199641013,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4249244-michiel,4,"Countless excellent books on evolution have described how life could adapt and become more complex based on Darlings natural selection. Many of these books omit the origin of life. This book tries to bridge chemistry and biology via systems chemistry to obtain a coherent theory of life. Though technical details are somewhat lacking, the author is able to bring his point across quite lucidly. He presents a framework in which chemical and biological evolution are treated as the same through the term dynamic kinetic stability. This reminds me of the construction theory, another scientific theory for the origin of patterns and life, though this book is much better at representing its ideas. A short and enjoyable read with a couple of interesting ideas. "
294,0199641013,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3190260-melanie,3,"This... was actually a surprising book. I was expecting to be awfully bored by a lot of information I did not understand, but instead I got an interesting refreshment of Chemistry and Biology concepts. Nothing particularly mindblowing (except for the examples that included pandas. Those were awesome), but the language used throughout this book was very easy to be understood and the author did a really nice job dosing the amount examples we can find in our daily life. I actually paid more attention to this audiobook than several other fiction ones that I've been listening lately.So, if you're interested in Chemistry and Biology made easy for people who don't study or work on these areas, this might be an interesting option!"
295,0199641013,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1230803-shane,3,"How chemistry becomes biology is perhaps better explained than ""what is life?"" is answered. But I think the explanation is supposed to be the answer.How chemistry becomes biology is a fascinating discussion where the author provides a series of definitions and simple analogies to increase understanding of the definitions. He sprinkles the definitions with scientific breakthroughs that led to the need for new vocabulary and new or better definitions of already familiar terms.Very well written, accessible to anyone even with very limited scientific background. "
296,0199641013,http://goodreads.com/user/show/36297846-wing,5,"This is an amazingly profound little book. In short, life is a process and not a ""thing"". It is a process that maximizes dynamic kinetic stability such that complex systems can persist without violating the Second Law of Thermodynamics. Complexification, which is network formation, can oftentimes confer more dynamic kinetic stability on systems. So the existence of life that ostensibly is teleonomic and organized is not mysterious. What is mysterious is that our universe allows conditions that are conducive to life. Surely there is a God! "
297,0199641013,http://goodreads.com/user/show/33863479-mikko-muilu,5,"One of the hardest questions a biologist gets is ""How did life start from dead planet"". This book is trying to answer that question as well as it can. A good look at the basic things we know and have reproduced, and the things we can't ever reproduce and only have to guess. The book is about the definition of life, when chemistry becomes life and how it could happen. The normal entropy argument from creationists is destroyed and the book tells good stories while educating us with all of this. Highly recommended, even if you'd be familiar with the evolution part of biology."
298,0199641013,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2531665-charlene,2,"I love that Pross tried to take up Schrödinger's ""What is Life"" challenge, and I also really like that he attempted to extend our definition of life. Both of those things are necessary if we want to update our theory of evolution. I don't necessarily think he found the answer, but he made some interesting arguments and asked important questions. "
299,0199641013,http://goodreads.com/user/show/12740958-don-mass,5,I love reading the reviews of individuals who only got a few chapters in and let their faith prevent them from going any farther. It's a good read and had some interesting ideas. What is life? We don't know how it started but we do know what it is. To say this book doesn't answer what 'is' life as it can't explain how it started simply shows you did not finish the book.
