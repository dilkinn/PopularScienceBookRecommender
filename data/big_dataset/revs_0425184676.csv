0,0425184676,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2540655-roger,5,"A very accessible, non-fiction telling of the epic journey and transmutation of the collective human intellect through the ages. The book guides us through the labyrinth of dead ends and discoveries from Thales of Miletus in ancient Greece, through Mendeleyev of mid 19th century Czarist Russia that precipitated the identification and classification of the known elements. Though this may sound boring - it is not.Strathern illuminates all of the major characters, their lives, and their intellectual entanglements in myth, religious dogma, superstition, and the specially persistent influences of alchemy that took chemistry millennia to shed like an emergent butterfly from its chrysalis. The title of this book is misleading, if from it you assume the book is primarily about Mendeleyev - far from it. In this book of just under 300 pages, only the prologue and last 32 pages concern him. This, however, does not detract from the amazing story behind the distillation of modern chemistry out of the quagmire of beliefs and false starts - era after era - finally culminating in Mendeleyev's periodic table of the elements and the birth of modern chemistry. Strathern conjures up from the dusty past, and richly fleshes out for us, the long line of extraordinary characters, their lives, influences, and contributions that eventually produced modern chemistry that has so profoundly shaped the modern world.Very much worth reading."
1,0425184676,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9387204-jonathan-widell,5,"This is a very good book. It not only made me understand the shift from alchemy to chemistry, the search for elements and the more or less bizarre people involved in both but also what is the trouble with most popularized accounts that claim to be about the history of science. Strathern is both a historian and a scientist. Most other authors are only half historians and half scientists, at least when they set out to write their books which turn out to be more or less sloppy products. Strathern is anything but sloppy. He injects something to his account that is rarely seen these days: wisdom. He is able to situate himself in a person's life in its historical context without making a fuss about it. That approach results in delightful and insightful passages as this: ""Fortunately [Mendeleyev's] wife proved an imaginative and resourceful woman. She wisely chose to spend her time on the estate at Tver, except when her husband arrived there from St Petersburg, when she and the children would depart from the Mendeleyev town residence. In this way the marriage managed to survive, without the cohabitation which is the ruin of so many relationships.""Now that Imitation Game about Alan Turing is still in the theatres, the reader appreciates all the more what singular characters it takes to make significant advances in science or any other human endeavour for that matter. The French chemists Lavoisier was the only one that Strathern portrayed as normal but he makes much of the fact that that did not spare Lavoisier from the guillotine. Ironically, the judge sent him to his death by saying that the revolution does not need scientists. "
2,0425184676,http://goodreads.com/user/show/457745-emily-lakdawalla,1,"I really hated this book. The author has nothing but contempt for the philosophers and thinkers who predated the development of Modern Science, variously describing them as mystics, in error, misguided, or even tricksters or charlatans. Surely some of them were, but most of them were people of their time, striving to understand their world to the best of their ability, their ability being blunted by whatever prejudices they grew up with, which is no different than scientists are today. Strathern points and laughs about how wrong they were, how far from the true path of objectively true scientific thought. I'm a scientist and I value the scientific method but I'd argue that even today the method only gives us simplistic glimpses of the truth and I know better than to mock the people who came before me."
3,0425184676,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1103001-abigail-hilton,3,"This is a history of chemistry, loosely organized around Mendeleyev's discovery that the elements can be understood as a periodic table. After a brief, tantalizing look at Mendeleyev and the challenge he faced, the author leaps off into a scatter-shot history of chemistry, where he spends the bulk of his text. I would have much preferred an actual focus on Mendeleyev, who was a fascinating person. Strathern's chemical history is uneven. Some parts are thorough and interesting - particularly the Arabs and Paracelsus. However, it is unclear why Strathern chooses to linger over some personalities, while he zooms through dozens of others so rapidly that their names and achievements blur together. In addition, he has a curious attitude towards the superstitions held by many early scientists. He imparts the news that Renaissance chemists held mystical beliefs as though this were horrifying or strange. It is neither. It was the flavor of the age. I can hear the chatty, dry, witty tone he's shooting for, but he often misses. For the kind of book this is trying to be, pick up Bill Bryson's _A Brief History of Nearly Everything_. "
4,0425184676,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5828593-bethany,1,"I expected this book to be primarily about Mendeleyev but 2/3 of the book is a thorough history of the development of the scientific method in Europe. It would be a good history, but the author irksomely takes an interest in the gossip on each famous scientist. After dutifully describing each's accomplishment, as a history of science requires you to do, the author delves into some personal tabloid factoid about the scientist, usually about their sexuality or their poor familial relations! I'm reading this book to learn about science: I didn't want to know about the sex lives of famous scientists. Besides too frequently delving into unrelated gossip, the author too often (for a nonfiction work) inserts his own negative views on the motivations of each scientist. Among his negative opinions, he often puts down their religion as ""ignorance"", which gives the author himself an unlikable air of pomposity and judgmentalism."
5,0425184676,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5860991-james-webster,1,"An appalling work in the very worst (and very out-of-date) style of History of Science. Contemptuous, in that triumphalist, ""aren't we a lot cleverer than our ancestors?"" way of anything that doesn't seem to contribute to Chemistry as we know it today, this isn't historical (in the sense of understanding the past on its terms) in any real sense. There are much better works on mankind's relationship with ""the elements""."
6,0425184676,http://goodreads.com/user/show/109535466-mike-parkes,3,"I was looking for a good survey of the history of chemistry, and this is definitely not it. The first two chapter on the Greeks (the four elements, beginnings of atomic theory) and the Egyptians (beginnings of alchemy) are an OK start, but the book then takes a serious wrong turn, into meanderings on the historical development of the philosophical underpinnings of the scientific method. For more than 1/3 of the book, there is almost no chemistry at all, but pages and pages of biographical details of random folks who contributed little or nothing to chemistry (Nicholas of Cusa, I’m looking at you).The second half of the book, beginning with Van Helmont’s experiments with gases in the 1500s, is a much better historical summary of chemistry up to Mendeleyev’s theoretical breakthrough of the Periodic Table, although it still suffers from a predilection to spend more time on the biographies of the scientists than on the practical and experimental details of the chemistry they performed. That’s a weakness of the book as a whole. Chemistry is the science of matter, but this book doesn’t let you feel the materiality, physicality, and dangers of chemical experimentation. What were those alchemists actually up to in their smoky dens? You won’t find out from this book."
7,0425184676,http://goodreads.com/user/show/84826805-aiman-adlawan,5,"A wonderful story about Mendeleyev's Discovery of The Periodic Table. When I was in highschool, I used to ask how the periodic table was made, invented or discovered. This books really answered everything. Though it was not really a one man invention, Mendeleyev puzzled all the pieces of previously discovered elements and brought them together - to answer old question 'What is the most basic element of nature?' was it water? Earth? Air? Fire? The discovery of the periodic table lays out the basic material composition of the universe and this has done a tremendous impact to the development of modern science. Very wonderful story.The books was supposed to be about Mendeleyev's Life. But it only talked about him at the first and last chapter. Everything in between were all about the characters and some significant persons who had contributed on the development of chemistry. This I thought was essential to understanding how those contributions helped Mendeleyev assembled the elements in one table."
8,0425184676,http://goodreads.com/user/show/12366637-forrest,4,"I expected the book to be more about Mendelev, but he only appears in the preface and at the very end. Instead, the vast majority of the book is a history of what was to become chemistry, from the ancient Egyptians concerned with mummification up until the discovery of the Periodic Table.I've read critiques of this book complaining that it gives the false impression that science proceeds in a straight line by omitting a lot of context around the historic episodes he presents, but I didn't take it that way at all. It's clearly written with the benefit of hindsight and is selecting the stories in light of what would later prove to be important, even though that direction was unknown at the time. As long as you understand that, you won't see an ""arrow of scientific progress"" illusion in the text at all.I still need to find a book which will tell me more about Mendeleyev, but this was a great read."
9,0425184676,http://goodreads.com/user/show/478620-beth,4,"This was a very readable history of chemistry, focusing on the people who made the greatest advances, including philosophers and experimentalists. The writing was a bit awkward, sometimes a word was used multiple times in close proximity and I detected a couple of minor errors. The book starts and ends with the story of Dmitri Mendeleev's arrangement of the known elements to form the original periodic table. It would have Ben interesting to add an epilogue about the ways that the periodic table has influenced science and popular culture since Mendeleev, but only physic's Eightfold Way was mentioned."
10,0425184676,http://goodreads.com/user/show/97551411-sarah,4,"Strathern chronicles the history of the development of modern chemistry for the general audience, covering important figures and discoveries that deserve more attention than we tend to give them in history and science classes (almost none). Beginning with the origins of alchemy, Strathern brings us through the evolution of science right up to Mendeleev's discovery of the periodic table, along the way emphasizing and acknowledging how the many mistakes and false theories we've held throughout time have simultaneously hindered and also paved the way for future discovery. One of the few books about chemistry I've read for the general audience that does it justice."
11,0425184676,http://goodreads.com/user/show/17912201-franz,4,"I quite liked the book even though it wasn't what I expected - namely a biography of Mendeleyev. Rather, it is a history of science with a focus on chemistry. It starts with the Greek philosophers, spends a lot of time on alchemy and explores the impact of the Renaissance before moving on to 'modern times'. It ends with Mendeleyev - meaning the book doesn't talk about the development of the last 100 years or so.In a way, this book is a series of mini-biographies, some of people I had never heard of. This is not a book that explains chemistry beyond a minimum. However, since I do like to read and learn about people, I got a lot out of this book - including a mini-biography of Mendeleyev."
12,0425184676,http://goodreads.com/user/show/53393109-harvey-jones,4,"I contrast to some of the other reviews, I really enjoyed this book. it is a journey from alchemy to the 19th century view on Chemistry ending with Mendeleyev and his periodic table of the elements .My view is that it has a good pace and is quite an easy read. The book lists all the major contributors to the journey and I plan to read more on the subject as it is quite fascinating."
13,0425184676,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5785753-pam,2,"Many times it is difficult to decide how to rate a book. In this case I have decided this book is dry and boring as my husband, who has a great tolerance for science and history tomes, has been trying to read it for nearly a week and he falls asleep within 15 minutes."
14,0425184676,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6861576-joanne,4,"Very enjoyable! There are lots of funny anecdotes about chemists throughout history, which makes reading about the history of chemistry much easier for someone like me who knows very little about the subject.

15,0425184676,http://goodreads.com/user/show/32724324-derek-henderson,3,"Mendeleyev himself gets fairly short shrift, and Strathern at times seems more interested in the lives of his protagonists than their contributions to chemistry.

19,0425184676,http://goodreads.com/user/show/12709413-jie-wen,3,"Jie Wen Guan									Due Date: 9/6/12ISMDear ISM teachers,	The book I choose to read was Mendeleyev's Dream: The Quest for the Elements by Paul Strathern. The author is telling about Mendeleyev and the problem of chemical elements. Mendeleyev was a Russian chemist and also a professor of chemistry at St Petersburg university. His investigation was the problem of chemical elements. There were sixty three chemical elements discovered and every one of these elements consist of different atoms. The atoms had their own properties. The problem was that some elements was found having similar properties which can't be classified in groups. The lightest element have a atomic weight of one and the heaviest have a atomic weight of 207. The lightest element was hydrogen and the heaviest was lead.	The author integrate the Periodic table into their story. I notice that the Periodic table is related to chemistry because it shows us how elements are grouped. The quote, ""In his dream, Mendeleyev had realized that when the elements were listed in order of their atomic weights, their properties repeated in a series of periodic intervals. For this reason, he named his discovery the Periodic Table of the Elements."" (p. 286). This shows why he named it the Periodic Table of the Elements. The author also integrate Pythagoras into the story. Pythagoras is a kind of math. Another quote, ""Pythagoras had believed that the world was ultimately mathematical; Nicholas of Cusa introduced the idea that applied math was the way to know the world."" (p.101). This shows that math was also a way to know the world. Based on math, we can see the connection between people. For example, in everyday life, we use numbers for anything such as looking at the clock, pay the bills, etc. This prove that math can also lead to scientific discovery. The reason why math can also lead to scientific discovery is because scientists use numbers to help them predict the results of their tests. As a result, science or math have a great impact in human life, not only use it scientifically but also use it in daily life to help us solve a lot of questions.	There aren't any questions I have about this book but there are things I want to know more about. I want to know more about the Periodic table because it interests me of how elements are being classified. I also want to know more about Pythagoras and many other elements. "
20,0425184676,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7947185-zoe,4,"Really liking it so far, facinating, well written, and it's giving me a long list of other things to look in to once i've finished reading...Just at the start, we haven't heard a lot about Mendeleyev yet apart from the fact that he had a very impressive beard and had his hair cut once a year by a shepherd. I picked it up from an interest in Chemistry, I did study it up to A level although not that successfully. So far it's been talking about the philosophical shift in the beliefs of how the universe is ordered. It has some links with Helliconia Spring (Brian Aldis) which I recently read, highlighting the different ways in which people viewed the world and how they came by the scientific knowledge that we take for granted today"
21,0425184676,http://goodreads.com/user/show/44369655-elizabeth-turner,4,"While the readability of Strathern's amalgamation of historical narrative and scientific progress dips at times, I was completely pulled in to the amazing 2,500 year marathon that produced the modern study of Chemistry. I laughed, expanded my vocabulary, and was moved by just how many hands passed the baton of research toward a goal of understanding the world around us. The last chapter is an extremely satisfying resolution to a winding and dramatic collection of stories! I highly recommend this book to those looking to broaden their knowledge of world history and chemical literacy from a humanistic perspective."
22,0425184676,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8032118-phoebe,5,"Science history at its best. This wonderful story reminds us that the birth of modern chemistry and particle physics can both be linked directly to Mendeleyev's discovery of the periodic table, published 1869. Strathern argues that prior to Mendeleyev's discovery, chemistry was still in fact alchemy. Without the periodic table, chemicals were infinitely permutable, and therefore the search for how to ""make"" gold was part of every chemist's work.Srathern's stye is elegant and eloquent."
23,0425184676,http://goodreads.com/user/show/25064843-kevin-speck,3,"This is a wonderful read through the history of science. However it deals only superficially with the subject matter of Mendeleyev's life and work. Most of the book focuses on the history of science from ancient times until Mendeleyev's discovery. The passages regarding the history of alchemy, including Newton building a brick furnace in the grounds of a Cambridge university solely for this pursuit, are particularly well presented. However it deals only superficially with the subject of Mendeleyev himself. I recommend it as a general history of early chemistry. "
24,0425184676,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7852031-annie-kate,3,"This is a well-written book filled with informative vignettes about fascinating people, so why do I dislike it? Its tone is unpleasant, and it contains far too much judgement, insinuation, and mockery. Strathern is trained in philosophy and his cynicism about many of the great scientists and historical ideas seems to result from his atheistic and evolutionary worldview. Read my complete review: http://anniekateshomeschoolreviews.co..."
25,0425184676,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8156215-ann,5,"And what a dream it was! Strathem's prose weaves together the intellectual history that lead up to the snowy day when Mendeleyev formulates the periodic table. This book is wonderfully written. I highly recommend it for all interested in the periodic table, alchemy and chemistry, the history and philosophy of science, the process of science, intellectual history, or just want a spellbinding tale of how we got the periodic table. All chemistry majors should read this book."
26,0425184676,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3941555-carlos,5,I found this book absolutely amazing! Strathern writes a clear and non-nerd-friendly history of chemistry with its culmination in the periodic table of elements as set up by Mendeleyev. Strathern also treats the history of the disputes and heart-wrenching moments of deviation that could have set back this central aspect of science for centuries.
27,0425184676,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2977844-unojoe2,4,This is a great book for developing knowledge of chemistry and the history of chemical knowledge and Alchemy. Anyone interested in chemistry or specific element or elements would be well off to read this book to understand more about the developments associated to the discovery of a great many of the elements and the path that led to modern chemical practices and theory. 
28,0425184676,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4192257-rick,3,"It ended rather abruptly, I thought. We encounter Mendeleyev at the beginning of the book, leave him and go through centuries of the history of chemistry (which is more interesting than it sounds), return to Mendeleyev when he, after a dream, comes up the periodic table. Five or so pages later, the book ends."
29,0425184676,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1037917-alex,2,"Overall a decent book on the history of chemistry, but the author clearly had biases regarding certain figures and their discoveries/research/personal lives etc. It also took a while to read because at times it was kind of boring.

34,0425184676,http://goodreads.com/user/show/30281185-sajith-kumar,4," Every school boy and girl is familiar with the periodic table in chemistry lessons. Most high school classroom walls will be adorned by one. This book is for those who wonder how the elements were identified, discovered and arranged in the specific order with which we are so familiar today. Paul Strathern does an eminent job in telling the story of how chemistry became what it is at the present. The book’s central character is Dmitri Ivanovich Mendeleyev, the scholar from Siberia who first identified the structure of the table. Even though the book is titled ‘Mendeleyev’s Dream’, the man appears only in a couple of chapters. All others narrate the progress of scientific thought in general and the development of chemistry in particular over the last two millennia. Strathern is a writer and an academic as well. He has traveled around the world and has authored five novels besides numerous books on science, philosophy, history, literature, medicine and economics.Scientific speculation began in ancient Greece, mostly in Ionia, that is, in present day Turkey. In fact, what we perceive today as Greece’s golden era of Periclean Athens was a dead end as far as science was concerned. The excruciating style of Socrates’ debates further weakened science’s fledgling proponents. Amidst these obstacles, Thales of Miletus postulated that water is the basic element of the universe, which was extended by Anaximenes to include earth, fire and air as well. Aristotle confirmed this hypothesis. The Greek kingdoms were in turn replaced by the Roman Empire, in which science drew a blank. The only Roman said to have entered the history of science is the soldier who killed Archimedes! After the decline of the empire, Europe relapsed into a dark age. The onus of keeping the scientific flicker alive fell on the Islamic world. Baghdad, which was the seat of the Abbasid caliphate, was adorned with scholars of all professions. Strathern gives a lucid description of the contributions made by Jabir, ibn Sina (Avicenna) and al Razi. By the time of the Renaissance, Europe was blessed with classical knowledge collected during the plunder of the crusades and the migration of Greek scholars from Constantinople immediately before that city fell to the Ottoman Turks. The dark ages was permeated by alchemy, the quest to transmute base metals into gold. However mystical or superstitious the quest was, a lot of valuable information on chemical reactions, compounds and elements were collected in the process.Early scientists were subjected to severe persecution for their scientific beliefs. Giordano Bruno was burnt alive at the stake; Galileo was bound for the same destination, but escaped with his life only because of his advanced age and poor health. He was kept under house arrest until death. The crime alleged on both was the same – teaching that the earth was not at the centre of the universe, but sun was. They also postulated that there are countless stars in the night sky, some of whom were not even visible to the naked eye. This went against the church’s stand that god created man in his image and the earth was entitled to a special place. As the entire universe was created for the benefit of mankind, what use is there in the scheme for invisible stars? But anyone who is somewhat familiar with the Bible knows that the holy writ does not contain any reference to earth’s position in the solar system. Then why did the church was so adamant to enforce its position which was not supported by the scriptures and even at the extreme cost of taking a human life? Strathern attempts to produce a convincing explanation, which removes all doubts in this regard. Christianity, when it was adopted as the state religion of the Roman Empire, stepped into the shoes of Hellenic philosophers like Aristotle. What distinguished Greek philosophy from others was its secularism. Thinkers contemplating on the root causes of the events didn’t find it necessary to ascribe divine mediation in order to explain them. Hence the church found it too easy to assimilate the Greek wisdom as it was already free from pagan beliefs. Once the established church stumbled on to something, it clung to it with its notorious aversion to change. It was Aristotle’s one fallacy among many that the earth was the centre of the universe. The church blindly followed suit and didn’t correct the course until it was too late. Another curious observation the readers can obtain from the book was that Aristotle faltered almost on all occasions he laid his hands on scientific concepts. Even though, or in spite of, being the greatest philosopher of his time, experimentation was not his forte. He believed that objects of different weights fell at different rates and celestial objects orbited each other in perfect circles. All these were proved false in the modern age.Most of the students of science are ignorant of its tumultuous history and would benefit much from reading this book. It may be nothing short of a revelation to many to learn that the principles which are now taken for granted have been around for hardly two centuries. Think of an era in which carbon dioxide was called ‘fixed air’, oxygen ‘dephlogisticated air’ and so on. The 17th century was the crucial period in which the stage for transformation from alchemy and religion was set. The works of Robert Boyle was the backbone of modern chemistry’s measurement paradigm. Newton also dabbled with alchemy, which may come as a surprise to many. A still larger shock may be experienced when learning that most of the scientists, including Newton and Boyle were deeply religious figures. Boyle had intended the lecture series he instituted in science’s foremost debating platform – the Royal Society – to proving ‘Christian beliefs against pagans’! The array of glassware on which reactions are conducted, the wide range of measuring instruments and dedicated safety measures which constitute the essential components of any decent chemistry lab at present were not available to the pioneers. Karl Scheele, the Swedish discoverer of elements used his own tongue to classify the compounds using taste as an indicator. This was a dangerous practice and he had successfully tasted even hydrogen cyanide! This may be the inspiration for the apocryphal anecdote of a maverick scientist who was desirous of finding out the taste of a highly poisonous cyanide compound meeting his death while doing this on a miniscule portion of the poison. Similarly, Henry Cavendish measured the strength of electric current by the amount of pain he felt while touching it. Strathern thus reminds the young students about the legacy they are inheriting from masters of yore. Lavoisier in 1787 published ‘A Method of Chemical Nomenclature’ which heralded the era in which chemicals were expressed according to their modern names. Around this time, a lot more elements were also discovered. The stage was being prepared for a new classification scheme.Mendeleyev’s biography and the insight which helped him find the hidden structure of the elements occupy only the two final chapters. We find him a gnomic figure from a photograph dating to that time. He was a typical scholar, in the sense that he made life miserable for family members who had to share the same roof. Mendeleyev’s wife found a novel way out of this dilemma. The family had two houses in the city of St. Petersburg and in the country. The scientist lived alone and his wife and children occupied the home other than where he was. And when he visited the place for a change of ambience, she no sooner packed the things and went with the children to the other house. In 1869, Mendeleyev developed the structure of the periodic table in a sudden surge of insight. This was so revolutionarily prescient that he was not even bothered at the two vacant spots in his table. Around 60 elements were discovered at that time and new elements were popping up everywhere. Mendeleyev predicted that an element will eventually be found between aluminium and uranium with an atomic weight of 68 and another one between silicon and tin with weight 70. In a fit of supreme confidence, he even named them eka-aluminium and eka-silicon! Just think about his thrill when barely five years later, gallium was discovered with weight 69 and after ten years, germanium with weight 72 and having the exact physical properties anticipated! Much reform has been made between that one table and what we see today, but the spirit observed by the Russian genius remains the same. But it took almost a century for an element to be named in honour of him. In 1955, mendeleviyum (Md) with atomic number 101 was discovered and suitably named.The author’s experience as a novelist lends a subtle charm to the narrative. The book is easy to read, as the concepts are illustrated in a down-to-earth way.The author has suggested several books for further reading that will be ideal for serious readers. It sports an index too. However, the number of illustrations could have been more.The book is highly recommended."

Most high school classroom walls will be adorned by one. This book is for those who wonder how the elements were identified, discovered and arranged in the specific order with which we are so familiar today. Paul Strathern does an eminent job in telling the story of how chemistry became what it is at the present. The book’s central character is Dmitri Ivanovich Mendeleyev, the scholar from Siberia who first identified the structure of the table. Even though the book is titled ‘Mendeleyev’s Dream’, the man appears only in a couple of chapters. All others narrate the progress of scientific thought in general and the development of chemistry in particular over the last two millennia. Strathern is a writer and an academic as well. He has traveled around the world and has authored five novels besides numerous books on science, philosophy, history, literature, medicine and economics.Scientific speculation began in ancient Greece, mostly in Ionia, that is, in present day Turkey. In fact, what we perceive today as Greece’s golden era of Periclean Athens was a dead end as far as science was concerned. The excruciating style of Socrates’ debates further weakened science’s fledgling proponents. Amidst these obstacles, Thales of Miletus postulated that water is the basic element of the universe, which was extended by Anaximenes to include earth, fire and air as well. Aristotle confirmed this hypothesis. The Greek kingdoms were in turn replaced by the Roman Empire, in which science drew a blank. The only Roman said to have entered the history of science is the soldier who killed Archimedes! After the decline of the empire, Europe relapsed into a dark age. The onus of keeping the scientific flicker alive fell on the Islamic world. Baghdad, which was the seat of the Abbasid caliphate, was adorned with scholars of all professions. Strathern gives a lucid description of the contributions made by Jabir, ibn Sina (Avicenna) and al Razi. By the time of the Renaissance, Europe was blessed with classical knowledge collected during the plunder of the crusades and the migration of Greek scholars from Constantinople immediately before that city fell to the Ottoman Turks. The dark ages was permeated by alchemy, the quest to transmute base metals into gold. However mystical or superstitious the quest was, a lot of valuable information on chemical reactions, compounds and elements were collected in the process.Early scientists were subjected to severe persecution for their scientific beliefs. Giordano Bruno was burnt alive at the stake; Galileo was bound for the same destination, but escaped with his life only because of his advanced age and poor health. He was kept under house arrest until death. The crime alleged on both was the same – teaching that the earth was not at the centre of the universe, but sun was. They also postulated that there are countless stars in the night sky, some of whom were not even visible to the naked eye. This went against the church’s stand that god created man in his image and the earth was entitled to a special place. As the entire universe was created for the benefit of mankind, what use is there in the scheme for invisible stars? But anyone who is somewhat familiar with the Bible knows that the holy writ does not contain any reference to earth’s position in the solar system. Then why did the church was so adamant to enforce its position which was not supported by the scriptures and even at the extreme cost of taking a human life? Strathern attempts to produce a convincing explanation, which removes all doubts in this regard. Christianity, when it was adopted as the state religion of the Roman Empire, stepped into the shoes of Hellenic philosophers like Aristotle. What distinguished Greek philosophy from others was its secularism. Thinkers contemplating on the root causes of the events didn’t find it necessary to ascribe divine mediation in order to explain them. Hence the church found it too easy to assimilate the Greek wisdom as it was already free from pagan beliefs. Once the established church stumbled on to something, it clung to it with its notorious aversion to change. It was Aristotle’s one fallacy among many that the earth was the centre of the universe. The church blindly followed suit and didn’t correct the course until it was too late. Another curious observation the readers can obtain from the book was that Aristotle faltered almost on all occasions he laid his hands on scientific concepts. Even though, or in spite of, being the greatest philosopher of his time, experimentation was not his forte. He believed that objects of different weights fell at different rates and celestial objects orbited each other in perfect circles. All these were proved false in the modern age.Most of the students of science are ignorant of its tumultuous history and would benefit much from reading this book. It may be nothing short of a revelation to many to learn that the principles which are now taken for granted have been around for hardly two centuries. Think of an era in which carbon dioxide was called ‘fixed air’, oxygen ‘dephlogisticated air’ and so on. The 17th century was the crucial period in which the stage for transformation from alchemy and religion was set. The works of Robert Boyle was the backbone of modern chemistry’s measurement paradigm. Newton also dabbled with alchemy, which may come as a surprise to many. A still larger shock may be experienced when learning that most of the scientists, including Newton and Boyle were deeply religious figures. Boyle had intended the lecture series he instituted in science’s foremost debating platform – the Royal Society – to proving ‘Christian beliefs against pagans’! The array of glassware on which reactions are conducted, the wide range of measuring instruments and dedicated safety measures which constitute the essential components of any decent chemistry lab at present were not available to the pioneers. Karl Scheele, the Swedish discoverer of elements used his own tongue to classify the compounds using taste as an indicator. This was a dangerous practice and he had successfully tasted even hydrogen cyanide! This may be the inspiration for the apocryphal anecdote of a maverick scientist who was desirous of finding out the taste of a highly poisonous cyanide compound meeting his death while doing this on a miniscule portion of the poison. Similarly, Henry Cavendish measured the strength of electric current by the amount of pain he felt while touching it. Strathern thus reminds the young students about the legacy they are inheriting from masters of yore. Lavoisier in 1787 published ‘A Method of Chemical Nomenclature’ which heralded the era in which chemicals were expressed according to their modern names. Around this time, a lot more elements were also discovered. The stage was being prepared for a new classification scheme.Mendeleyev’s biography and the insight which helped him find the hidden structure of the elements occupy only the two final chapters. We find him a gnomic figure from a photograph dating to that time. He was a typical scholar, in the sense that he made life miserable for family members who had to share the same roof. Mendeleyev’s wife found a novel way out of this dilemma. The family had two houses in the city of St. Petersburg and in the country. The scientist lived alone and his wife and children occupied the home other than where he was. And when he visited the place for a change of ambience, she no sooner packed the things and went with the children to the other house. In 1869, Mendeleyev developed the structure of the periodic table in a sudden surge of insight. This was so revolutionarily prescient that he was not even bothered at the two vacant spots in his table. Around 60 elements were discovered at that time and new elements were popping up everywhere. Mendeleyev predicted that an element will eventually be found between aluminium and uranium with an atomic weight of 68 and another one between silicon and tin with weight 70. In a fit of supreme confidence, he even named them eka-aluminium and eka-silicon! Just think about his thrill when barely five years later, gallium was discovered with weight 69 and after ten years, germanium with weight 72 and having the exact physical properties anticipated! Much reform has been made between that one table and what we see today, but the spirit observed by the Russian genius remains the same. But it took almost a century for an element to be named in honour of him. In 1955, mendeleviyum (Md) with atomic number 101 was discovered and suitably named.The author’s experience as a novelist lends a subtle charm to the narrative. The book is easy to read, as the concepts are illustrated in a down-to-earth way.The author has suggested several books for further reading that will be ideal for serious readers. It sports an index too. However, the number of illustrations could have been more.The book is highly recommended."

This may be the inspiration for the apocryphal anecdote of a maverick scientist who was desirous of finding out the taste of a highly poisonous cyanide compound meeting his death while doing this on a miniscule portion of the poison. Similarly, Henry Cavendish measured the strength of electric current by the amount of pain he felt while touching it. Strathern thus reminds the young students about the legacy they are inheriting from masters of yore. Lavoisier in 1787 published ‘A Method of Chemical Nomenclature’ which heralded the era in which chemicals were expressed according to their modern names. Around this time, a lot more elements were also discovered. The stage was being prepared for a new classification scheme.Mendeleyev’s biography and the insight which helped him find the hidden structure of the elements occupy only the two final chapters. We find him a gnomic figure from a photograph dating to that time. He was a typical scholar, in the sense that he made life miserable for family members who had to share the same roof. Mendeleyev’s wife found a novel way out of this dilemma. The family had two houses in the city of St. Petersburg and in the country. The scientist lived alone and his wife and children occupied the home other than where he was. And when he visited the place for a change of ambience, she no sooner packed the things and went with the children to the other house. In 1869, Mendeleyev developed the structure of the periodic table in a sudden surge of insight. This was so revolutionarily prescient that he was not even bothered at the two vacant spots in his table. Around 60 elements were discovered at that time and new elements were popping up everywhere. Mendeleyev predicted that an element will eventually be found between aluminium and uranium with an atomic weight of 68 and another one between silicon and tin with weight 70. In a fit of supreme confidence, he even named them eka-aluminium and eka-silicon! Just think about his thrill when barely five years later, gallium was discovered with weight 69 and after ten years, germanium with weight 72 and having the exact physical properties anticipated! Much reform has been made between that one table and what we see today, but the spirit observed by the Russian genius remains the same. But it took almost a century for an element to be named in honour of him. In 1955, mendeleviyum (Md) with atomic number 101 was discovered and suitably named.The author’s experience as a novelist lends a subtle charm to the narrative.

Most high school classroom walls will be adorned by one. This book is for those who wonder how the elements were identified, discovered and arranged in the specific order with which we are so familiar today. Paul Strathern does an eminent job in telling the story of how chemistry became what it is at the present. The book’s central character is Dmitri Ivanovich Mendeleyev, the scholar from Siberia who first identified the structure of the table. Even though the book is titled ‘Mendeleyev’s Dream’, the man appears only in a couple of chapters. All others narrate the progress of scientific thought in general and the development of chemistry in particular over the last two millennia. Strathern is a writer and an academic as well. He has traveled around the world and has authored five novels besides numerous books on science, philosophy, history, literature, medicine and economics.Scientific speculation began in ancient Greece, mostly in Ionia, that is, in present day Turkey. In fact, what we perceive today as Greece’s golden era of Periclean Athens was a dead end as far as science was concerned. The excruciating style of Socrates’ debates further weakened science’s fledgling proponents. Amidst these obstacles, Thales of Miletus postulated that water is the basic element of the universe, which was extended by Anaximenes to include earth, fire and air as well. Aristotle confirmed this hypothesis. The Greek kingdoms were in turn replaced by the Roman Empire, in which science drew a blank. The only Roman said to have entered the history of science is the soldier who killed Archimedes! After the decline of the empire, Europe relapsed into a dark age. The onus of keeping the scientific flicker alive fell on the Islamic world. Baghdad, which was the seat of the Abbasid caliphate, was adorned with scholars of all professions. Strathern gives a lucid description of the contributions made by Jabir, ibn Sina (Avicenna) and al Razi. By the time of the Renaissance, Europe was blessed with classical knowledge collected during the plunder of the crusades and the migration of Greek scholars from Constantinople immediately before that city fell to the Ottoman Turks. The dark ages was permeated by alchemy, the quest to transmute base metals into gold. However mystical or superstitious the quest was, a lot of valuable information on chemical reactions, compounds and elements were collected in the process.Early scientists were subjected to severe persecution for their scientific beliefs. Giordano Bruno was burnt alive at the stake; Galileo was bound for the same destination, but escaped with his life only because of his advanced age and poor health. He was kept under house arrest until death. The crime alleged on both was the same – teaching that the earth was not at the centre of the universe, but sun was. They also postulated that there are countless stars in the night sky, some of whom were not even visible to the naked eye. This went against the church’s stand that god created man in his image and the earth was entitled to a special place. As the entire universe was created for the benefit of mankind, what use is there in the scheme for invisible stars? But anyone who is somewhat familiar with the Bible knows that the holy writ does not contain any reference to earth’s position in the solar system. Then why did the church was so adamant to enforce its position which was not supported by the scriptures and even at the extreme cost of taking a human life? Strathern attempts to produce a convincing explanation, which removes all doubts in this regard. Christianity, when it was adopted as the state religion of the Roman Empire, stepped into the shoes of Hellenic philosophers like Aristotle. What distinguished Greek philosophy from others was its secularism. Thinkers contemplating on the root causes of the events didn’t find it necessary to ascribe divine mediation in order to explain them. Hence the church found it too easy to assimilate the Greek wisdom as it was already free from pagan beliefs. Once the established church stumbled on to something, it clung to it with its notorious aversion to change. It was Aristotle’s one fallacy among many that the earth was the centre of the universe. The church blindly followed suit and didn’t correct the course until it was too late. Another curious observation the readers can obtain from the book was that Aristotle faltered almost on all occasions he laid his hands on scientific concepts. Even though, or in spite of, being the greatest philosopher of his time, experimentation was not his forte. He believed that objects of different weights fell at different rates and celestial objects orbited each other in perfect circles. All these were proved false in the modern age.Most of the students of science are ignorant of its tumultuous history and would benefit much from reading this book. It may be nothing short of a revelation to many to learn that the principles which are now taken for granted have been around for hardly two centuries. Think of an era in which carbon dioxide was called ‘fixed air’, oxygen ‘dephlogisticated air’ and so on. The 17th century was the crucial period in which the stage for transformation from alchemy and religion was set. The works of Robert Boyle was the backbone of modern chemistry’s measurement paradigm. Newton also dabbled with alchemy, which may come as a surprise to many. A still larger shock may be experienced when learning that most of the scientists, including Newton and Boyle were deeply religious figures. Boyle had intended the lecture series he instituted in science’s foremost debating platform – the Royal Society – to proving ‘Christian beliefs against pagans’! The array of glassware on which reactions are conducted, the wide range of measuring instruments and dedicated safety measures which constitute the essential components of any decent chemistry lab at present were not available to the pioneers. Karl Scheele, the Swedish discoverer of elements used his own tongue to classify the compounds using taste as an indicator.

The onus of keeping the scientific flicker alive fell on the Islamic world. Baghdad, which was the seat of the Abbasid caliphate, was adorned with scholars of all professions. Strathern gives a lucid description of the contributions made by Jabir, ibn Sina (Avicenna) and al Razi. By the time of the Renaissance, Europe was blessed with classical knowledge collected during the plunder of the crusades and the migration of Greek scholars from Constantinople immediately before that city fell to the Ottoman Turks. The dark ages was permeated by alchemy, the quest to transmute base metals into gold. However mystical or superstitious the quest was, a lot of valuable information on chemical reactions, compounds and elements were collected in the process.Early scientists were subjected to severe persecution for their scientific beliefs. Giordano Bruno was burnt alive at the stake; Galileo was bound for the same destination, but escaped with his life only because of his advanced age and poor health. He was kept under house arrest until death. The crime alleged on both was the same – teaching that the earth was not at the centre of the universe, but sun was. They also postulated that there are countless stars in the night sky, some of whom were not even visible to the naked eye. This went against the church’s stand that god created man in his image and the earth was entitled to a special place. As the entire universe was created for the benefit of mankind, what use is there in the scheme for invisible stars? But anyone who is somewhat familiar with the Bible knows that the holy writ does not contain any reference to earth’s position in the solar system. Then why did the church was so adamant to enforce its position which was not supported by the scriptures and even at the extreme cost of taking a human life? Strathern attempts to produce a convincing explanation, which removes all doubts in this regard. Christianity, when it was adopted as the state religion of the Roman Empire, stepped into the shoes of Hellenic philosophers like Aristotle. What distinguished Greek philosophy from others was its secularism. Thinkers contemplating on the root causes of the events didn’t find it necessary to ascribe divine mediation in order to explain them. Hence the church found it too easy to assimilate the Greek wisdom as it was already free from pagan beliefs. Once the established church stumbled on to something, it clung to it with its notorious aversion to change. It was Aristotle’s one fallacy among many that the earth was the centre of the universe. The church blindly followed suit and didn’t correct the course until it was too late. Another curious observation the readers can obtain from the book was that Aristotle faltered almost on all occasions he laid his hands on scientific concepts. Even though, or in spite of, being the greatest philosopher of his time, experimentation was not his forte. He believed that objects of different weights fell at different rates and celestial objects orbited each other in perfect circles. All these were proved false in the modern age.Most of the students of science are ignorant of its tumultuous history and would benefit much from reading this book. It may be nothing short of a revelation to many to learn that the principles which are now taken for granted have been around for hardly two centuries. Think of an era in which carbon dioxide was called ‘fixed air’, oxygen ‘dephlogisticated air’ and so on. The 17th century was the crucial period in which the stage for transformation from alchemy and religion was set. The works of Robert Boyle was the backbone of modern chemistry’s measurement paradigm. Newton also dabbled with alchemy, which may come as a surprise to many. A still larger shock may be experienced when learning that most of the scientists, including Newton and Boyle were deeply religious figures. Boyle had intended the lecture series he instituted in science’s foremost debating platform – the Royal Society – to proving ‘Christian beliefs against pagans’! The array of glassware on which reactions are conducted, the wide range of measuring instruments and dedicated safety measures which constitute the essential components of any decent chemistry lab at present were not available to the pioneers. Karl Scheele, the Swedish discoverer of elements used his own tongue to classify the compounds using taste as an indicator. This was a dangerous practice and he had successfully tasted even hydrogen cyanide! This may be the inspiration for the apocryphal anecdote of a maverick scientist who was desirous of finding out the taste of a highly poisonous cyanide compound meeting his death while doing this on a miniscule portion of the poison. Similarly, Henry Cavendish measured the strength of electric current by the amount of pain he felt while touching it. Strathern thus reminds the young students about the legacy they are inheriting from masters of yore. Lavoisier in 1787 published ‘A Method of Chemical Nomenclature’ which heralded the era in which chemicals were expressed according to their modern names. Around this time, a lot more elements were also discovered. The stage was being prepared for a new classification scheme.Mendeleyev’s biography and the insight which helped him find the hidden structure of the elements occupy only the two final chapters. We find him a gnomic figure from a photograph dating to that time. He was a typical scholar, in the sense that he made life miserable for family members who had to share the same roof. Mendeleyev’s wife found a novel way out of this dilemma. The family had two houses in the city of St. Petersburg and in the country. The scientist lived alone and his wife and children occupied the home other than where he was. And when he visited the place for a change of ambience, she no sooner packed the things and went with the children to the other house. In 1869, Mendeleyev developed the structure of the periodic table in a sudden surge of insight. This was so revolutionarily prescient that he was not even bothered at the two vacant spots in his table. Around 60 elements were discovered at that time and new elements were popping up everywhere. Mendeleyev predicted that an element will eventually be found between aluminium and uranium with an atomic weight of 68 and another one between silicon and tin with weight 70. In a fit of supreme confidence, he even named them eka-aluminium and eka-silicon! Just think about his thrill when barely five years later, gallium was discovered with weight 69 and after ten years, germanium with weight 72 and having the exact physical properties anticipated! Much reform has been made between that one table and what we see today, but the spirit observed by the Russian genius remains the same. But it took almost a century for an element to be named in honour of him. In 1955, mendeleviyum (Md) with atomic number 101 was discovered and suitably named.The author’s experience as a novelist lends a subtle charm to the narrative. The book is easy to read, as the concepts are illustrated in a down-to-earth way.The author has suggested several books for further reading that will be ideal for serious readers. It sports an index too. However, the number of illustrations could have been more.The book is highly recommended."
