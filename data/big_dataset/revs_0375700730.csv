0,0375700730,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1133370-rebecca,2,"As an admirer of Oliver Sacks’s clear, inquisitive articles on neurobiology, I was saddened to discover that his travelogue of Micronesia is both patronizing and exoticizing. Throughout this book, Sacks employs the same tone he uses when discussing patients with debilitating medical ailments, a kind of sympathetic wonderment at the bizarre feats performed damaged brains. Here, this tone is applied to entire populations and cultures, as when he describes the ponderously fat islanders whose diets include vast quantities of Spam. He casually remarks that the Micronesians might have practiced cannibalism, and that Spam’s popularity might therefore be attributed its similarity in flavor to the taste of human flesh.Needless to say, this is a preposterous and racist supposition. In the Pacific islands (where I grew up), communities and economies were devastated by both World War II and decades of colonial occupation. People became dependent on Spam and other high-sodium, high-fat, high-sugar tinned products imported and distributed by the United States military. Obesity and diabetes are the natural consequences of replacing a native, lean, seafood diet with one manufactured by ConAgra. But Sacks is delighted by the possibility of remote island peoples retaining their primitive (and putative) taste for human flesh, and so fails to explore the more prosaic, less sensational truth.Elsewhere, he is paternalistic in a reflexive, unthinking way. He described seeing beautiful children running in packs, as wild animals, and his urge to pluck them up and keep them. It is an offhand remark, but one that stings. This kind of thoughtless condescension, wherein he treats islanders as exotic foreign specimens rather than people, crops up repeatedly.Still, Sacks is a terrific writer with an unrivaled instinct for describing the indescribable. He writes stunningly of the out-of-body disorientation caused by kava-kava, and imagines the experience of a color-blind person seeing the world through textures. He describes the experience of aging into a state of neurodegenerative paralysis, and shows remarkable breadth of knowledge over the disease’s possible botanical causes. The neurological disorders at the heart of the book are legitimately unique and fascinating – if only Sacks didn’t see fit to treat the people like the disease."
1,0375700730,http://goodreads.com/user/show/23195904-radiantflux,3,"1st book for 2020.When I was studying psychology in the 1990s, I hung out with a lot of people studying clinical neuropsychology, where Sacks had a universally bad reputation—great words, terrible science—was the people smarter than me would always say. Because of this I have always sort of avoided reading him, but recently, just before Christmas I came across and read his book Hallucinations, which I really enjoyed and decided to slowly work my way through his works enjoying them as works of writing, and not getting to caught up on their scientific veracity. This book describes two unrelated trips to the Pacific: the first, to an island with a large percentage of achromatopes—people suffering a genetic mutation which leads to a lack of active cones in the retina, forcing them to rely solely on their retina rods for vision. Cones are responsible not only for color vision (hence the title of the book), but also for fine acuity and day vision—our night vision is essentially mediated by the rods. The second part of the book details a trip to Guam to visit a neurologist studying a mysterious endemic ALS-like disease, that was thought to perhaps have been caused by the ingestion of flour made by cycad seeds (though this has now been discarded). Both stories are relatively slight works, which have the feeling of being travelog pieces that might appear in some Sunday newspaper supplement. Still an enjoyable, if quick read."
2,0375700730,http://goodreads.com/user/show/50066399-diane-in-australia,4,"Great book. Sacks is a superb writer, and his enthusiasm bubbles along at a pleasing pace. You'll learn about an island where a huge percentage of the folks are born totally colour-blind. He also checks into a neurological disease on another island ... again, huge percentage of folks affected ... which causes profound, progressive, and fatal muscular weakness.When I find myself reading bits aloud to my hubby, I know it's a great book. We both learned a lot!4 Stars = It touched my heart, and/or gave me much food for thought."
3,0375700730,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4765339-wanda,1,"This is mainly a more or less ill-informed travelogue by a person interested in neurological diseases. The core of the book is Sacks' visit to Guam in the 1990s to check out Lytico-Bodig disease, an ALS-like disease once endemic on this island.Alas, there's not much to the book. Sacks relates a bit about the research of others and his visits to patients with the disease who are under the care of Dr. John C. Steele.I say ill-informed travelogue because his knowledge of Guam and the other islands he visits seems limited. For example, he relates a garbled history of the village of Sumay. He doesn't seem to know that it was the site of a US Navy installation as well as the Marine Corps barracks before World War Two, or that it was also the site of the Pan American hotel and other PAA facilities, where the old flying-boat Pan American clippers docked. He seems to believe Sumay was a pristine Chamorro village in those days, which it most certainly was not.Also, Sacks' attitude to the military seems rather silly, a relic of the hippy-dippy sixties and sticking it to the man mentality. And he doesn't get that the coral in the waters adjacent to the Navy base are healthier because access is restricted. If the Navy let all the locals and tourists in, the corals would be severely degraded. I can't help thinking Sacks can't be much of a scientist if he doesn't grasp that fact. On top of that, these days it is the US Navy that is protecting and preserving the threatened cycads that Sacks is so enamored with. If the Navy had left Guam all those still-undeveloped areas would have been bulldozed and turned into resorts,condos, strip malls and golf courses, just like what happened in Saipan.Sacks' description of John Steele's personality and interactions with his Lytico-Bodig patients was most interesting to me. He describes Steele as highly empathetic and caring. However, on the ""Vitals"" website these days, he is rated ""poor"" with a 1.0 out of a possible 4.0 score, for what that's worth. But he was also fired as the physician director of the Skilled Nursing Unit, Guam Memorial Hospital's long-term care facility, early in 2012 after the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid conducted a ""scathing"" (according to press reports) survey of the SNU. Well, whatevs.... I guess Sacks has come down in favor of bats eating cycad seeds and concentrating a toxin (BMAA) that Chamorros who ate the bats got a heavy dose of, giving them the Lytico-Bodig, though he doesn't elaborate on that in the book. Steele, who has studied the disease for most of his professional career, has discarded that thesis, along with postulated connections with genetics, minerals, metals, food and water. The cause remains a mystery, which is remarkable for a disease that at one point in the 1940s was the leading cause of death among Chamorros. But now it is essentially extinct, with only some elderly patients still affected; no one has acquired the disease since 1951.I wouldn't be surprised if the disease is just another taupathy, related to abnormalities in the MAPT gene. Or something. But even if it is, why, when and where did it first appear on Guam, and why has it died out? I can't help thinking the population bottleneck the Chamorros suffered courtesy of the Spanish had something to do with it, but what do I know? Perhaps Dr. Steele will write the definitive book on this disease. I look forward to reading it.I was hoping to learn something interesting about Lytico-Bodig from Sacks' book. But I didn't. "
4,0375700730,http://goodreads.com/user/show/21707944-travelin,1,"I KNEW, KNEW that Oliver Sacks wouldn't give me informative details on the epidemiology of islands. His chatty, superficial, and self-absorbed style made me drop both his Hat and Awakenings books and give it 4 stars anyway, out of what, charity? But this one I bought new, with high hopes anyway, and it quickly became apparent that there is something seriously wrong with this man. By page 30 he'd spent several pages talking about his prowess as a swimmer, being a Victorian reader who always picked out adventure stories high on style, light on substance, etc., etc.Well, as Wikipedia so pointedly put it, Oliver Sacks is the man who mistook his patients for a book --about himself. Not only is there, according to the New York Times, doubt about his clinical accomplishments, but the man is pushing on, full steam ahead, with an autobiography about his greatness. Look at his profile page. Look at it! This man would write about truckdriving if it gave him some kind of celebrity. Look at the weightlifter! That's not him lifting the weights!If this fool doesn't define an era of self-centred pretense over genuine accomplishment, I'll eat my hat."
5,0375700730,http://goodreads.com/user/show/86946-jessica,3,"I've loved Oliver Sacks for a long time, but up until now I'd only read and re-read The Man who Mistook his Wife for a Hat and An Anthropologist on Mars. The Island of the Colorblind seemed like a natural next choice for me, because it combines my interest in neuropsychology with my interest in island biogeography (the study of the way species on islands evolve to become very specialized, to the point where an extremely high percentage of the species on any given island may be endemic to that particular island). The Island of the Colorblind actually contains two separate but closely related books of about 100 pages each, the first being the titular story, and a second called ""Cycad Island."" (The book also contains nearly another 100 pages of endnotes.) As Sacks says in the opening line of the Preface, ""This book is really two books, independent narratives of two parallel but independent journeys to Micronesia."" In ""The Island of the Colorblind,"" he visits Pingelap and Pohnpei, two neighboring islands, to study the unusually high incidence of achromatopsia, or total colorblindness. As one comes to expect from Sacks, the text not only explores the condition and its effects on individuals and society, but also revels in the botany, zoology, and history of the islands themselves. Sacks is openly fascinated with so many facets of the world that it's hard not to share his excitement, and ""The Island of the Colorblind"" is a delight to read.The first half of ""Cycad Island"" picks up where ""The Island of the Colorblind"" left off - this time Sacks is visiting Guam to study a mysterious disease known as lytico-bodig. While this disease shows similarities to a number of other diseases, including Parkinson's, it appears to be a separate condition which exists only on Guam and some of its surrounding islands (and its cause and treatment, at least to the time of Sacks's writing, remain unknown). However, mid-way through ""Cycad Island"", the focus of the text shifts abruptly from his previous admixture of medicine, biology, and history to a strict discussion of cycads (a kind of primitive plant resembling ferns and palm trees). While cycads are closely related to his discussion of lytico-bodig (it has been suggested that the disease could be caused by toxins in the plants, since cycads are favored foods of the Chamorros people of Guam), the change in focus is abrupt, and the singlemindedness of his discussion does not reflect the charm of Sacks's usual diversity of interests, and for the most part becomes quite dry.I love Oliver Sacks and I'd heartily recommend reading anything of his. However, the sudden change in focus three-quarters of the way through The Island of the Colorblind kills the momentum of what is otherwise a delightful book. Also, the extensive use of notes in this text make it hard to follow the story well - either you ignore them (which I appear to be unable to do), or you stop every few paragraphs to read a full-page digression at the back of the book. It seems that Sacks was allowed to wax somewhat overindulgent in this book, and for this reason I wouldn't suggest it as the first place to visit Sacks's writing, although it's well worth a read if you already know and enjoy his other works."
6,0375700730,http://goodreads.com/user/show/24011982-cynda,1,Reading books by Oliver Sacks is so hit or miss. This one is a miss. I wanted to learn about colorblindness. Instead in this book I mostly find a travelogue with some acknowledgement of the colorblind children of various Oceania islands. So far what I appreciate of Sacks' writingThe Man Who Mistook His Wife for a Hat and Other Clinical TalesSeeing VoicesBoth these books describe what happens when . . . . when a person forgets or misunderstands their world and what they do really really understand. . . . when a deaf person gain empowerment as that person learns to communicate with sign language. This book would make a good travelogue book. Maybe Sacks estate might be able to re-cast this information into a delightful we-several-doctors-went-to-Oceania-and-saw-the-sights-which included-the-colorblind-folk.
7,0375700730,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11544339-geraldine,4,"This is an absolutely fascinating book by Oliver Sacks. Really cool dude. See, he goes on this trip to the Pacific and there is an island there where a huge chunk of the population is Achromatropic (pure colorblindedness as in grayscale) and he sets out to that island with an achromatropic friend. Then he goes to Guam where there is also a huge density of people with a disease called lytico-bodig. Oh man, the world is so FASCINATING!!! The Earth is ancient and cruel and beautiful! That's how it feels after reading this book. "
8,0375700730,http://goodreads.com/user/show/15052079-logan-hughes,2,"Read for Boston Public Library Summer Reading Bingo 2020, ""A true story."" Oliver Sacks writes beautiful prose and inspires curiosity about the wonders of the human brain through descriptions of neurology problems. This is true in all his writing and here, too, as he describes rare disorders that are concentrated in Pacific Island populations: achromatic colorblindness in Pingelap, and lytico-bodig (a degenerative paralysis similar to parkinsonism or ALS) in Guam. What makes me uncomfortable about this particular book is the ways in which it is very much in the tradition of Eurocentric, white-saviory, exoticizing travel/exploration narratives. Sacks writes with sympathy about the plight of the Pingelapese, Pohnpeian, and Chamarro people and the devastation wrought on them by European and American colonialism and genocide, yet, he never truly seems to see them as complete people on par with the white scientist colleagues he writes about; he betrays his worldview, for example, by writing about such and such white scientist being the ""first to discover"" a disease that has been known in Guam for hundreds of years. At the same time, Sacks has introduced me in this readable, poetic narrative to a number of scientific and historical concepts that were totally unfamiliar to me before. I'm not ready to trust him entirely - I think the things he says and the way he says them require a bit of a critical eye - but would I have otherwise researched the history of Guam? Probably not! Sacks has a talent for making complex topics accessible to a wide variety of audiences."
9,0375700730,http://goodreads.com/user/show/788220-conor,4,"I was about to give this one three stars because I got a bit bored in the late middle. Things are less cohesive and less to-the-point in the fifty pages before the conclusion then I thought they needed to be.Then I remembered that I read Sacks because he's a powerful anecdote teller, and he makes Neurology a terrifically human and humane pursuit in the telling. So maybe what I mean is that if I'm reading something off the non-fiction shelf, and I get a little choked up = Instant bonus star!"
10,0375700730,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1318962-carol-jinx,4,"I love Oliver Sacks. He picks interesting things to write about. I first read The Man Who Mistook His Wife for a Hat a few years ago (now who could resist such a catchy title) and I loved it. This book addresses a disease I didn't think was so prevalent, colorblindness. I just thought that was a good excuse for men who couldn't put their ties and shirts together properly but now I consider myself more informed on the disease,achromatopsia."
11,0375700730,http://goodreads.com/user/show/281809-hannah,1,"Ugh. I love Oliver Sacks normally. This was painful and would have been more educational boiled down to three sentences:1. There are a huge number of colorblind folks in Micronesia.2. There is a weird disease that runs through clans/families in Guam. It may be caused by eating ancient plants, but nobody really knows. The end. "
12,0375700730,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7273998-courtney,3,"I really enjoyed the first part, part two and three were meh."
13,0375700730,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2272557-charles-dee-mitchell,3,"In his autobiography, Oliver Sacks writes that this is the favorite of his books. He must be so close to it that he finds something here most readers don't. I liked the part about cycads."
14,0375700730,http://goodreads.com/user/show/23951280-mark-conrad,4,I'd give quite a lot to have 1/8 of his life. He puts humanity into every little drop off the world. This book gave me wanderlust like I haven't felt in a long time.
15,0375700730,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5733902-sally,3,"""Islands were, so to speak, experiments of nature"", August 7, 2014 This review is from: The Island of the Colour-blind (Hardcover)An interesting account of two trips made by the author to the islands of Oceania, where the remoteness of the locations have led to two different illnesses among the locals.The first section of the book - and to me, by far the most readable - was his visit to Pingelap atoll in Micronesia, where interbreeding of a small population has led to 1 person in 12 being totally colour-blind. Finding out how life 'feels' to such people, along with a fascinating travelogue, made this a wonderful read:""And in that first long moment, with the children coming out of the forest...and the tropical luxuriance of vegetation in all directions - the beauty of the primitive, the human and the natural took hold of me...I had a sense of paradise, of an almost magical reality.""""Little black-and-white piglets darted across our path...we were struck by the fact that the pigs were black and white and wondered, half seriously, if they had been specially bred for, or by, an achromatic population.""In the second section, Sacks visits Guam, where the illness of lytico-bodig (similar to motor neurone disease) was endemic - although the younger generation are no longer affected. Again the travel aspect was fascinating - Sacks' experience of arrival in a US military base seems as bad as any totalitarian state. And the efforts of scientists to crack the reason for the disease (blamed by many on the toxic cycad trees, whose roots were once used as flour) was fairly interesting. But I found the end of the chapter starting to get a bit too scientific for me!In the third, short chapter, Sacks visits Rota, close to Guam but unspoiled. Here he visits the cycad jungle, similar to the primeval world, and observes that ""it seemed as if my senses were actually enlarging, as if a new sense, a time sense, was opening within me, something which might allow me to appreciate millennia or aeons as directly as I had experienced seconds or minutes.""Contains a number of b/w drawings"
16,0375700730,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3049744-daniel-gon-alves,4,"As read here“Awakenings” by Oliver Sacks might be regarded as one of the most poetic stories ever told. When brought to the corporate Hollywood screens, it caused an enormous impact on its audience, propelling the author’s name into the luminous aura of mainstream culture. In itself, “The Island of the Colorblind” serves as the logic continuation of the literary brilliance found in his previous works. In it, the renowned neurologist recounts his experiences during his summer visit to the Pacific Ocean archipelago of the Micronesia. In some of these small islands, genetically transmitted diseases proliferate due to the isolation of such locales. As a result, the same maladies recur throughout subsequent generations of individuals. There are societies where colorblindness is the norm, and there are population where strange neurologic syndromes resembling Parkinsonism strike many individuals. Both of these intriguing cases are all meticulously described by Sacks, that reveals his emotion through his accounts. As a result, he surfaces as a very empathetically humanistic scientist.But the book is more than a scientific analysis on such terrible diseases. It is a thorough exploitation of the author’s literary resources. Sacks possesses the unique ability to write about reality in such whimsical terms. Metaphors and adjectives prevail amongst his descriptions of nature and of the human condition, a writing ability so profound and authentic to the reader’s mind that after he finishes reading the book, all he wants to do is meet Oliver Sacks in the flesh. "
17,0375700730,http://goodreads.com/user/show/764967-nola,3,"There is a type of complete colorblindness, achromatopsia, where people do not have functional cones in their eyes and are almost blind in sunlight because of the sensitivity of the rods. Achromatopsia, unlike red-green colorblindness, is very rare. The island of Fuur and the island of Pingelap both had large numbers of people suffering from this congenital achromatopsia. Only Pingelap, in the south Pacific, still has large numbers of achromatopes. The author visited Pingelap with a physiologist who is an achromatope himself and a friend who is an ophthalmologist. He writes a pretty interesting travel biography of their trip in addition to talking about the examinations and interviews with the achromatopes and how such large numbers of them cope with limited vision. He has a strong interest in their compensations and alternate ways of perceiving the world. Achromatopes may have an advantage in such things as night diving to capture fish because their dark vision is strong.The second part of the book is about traveling to the island of Guam to visit a colleague who treats neurological disorders. This colleague, Dr. John Steele, wants the author to see the cases of lytico and bodig, which are prevalent in Guam. Dr. Steele has been treating and looking for reasons for lytico and bodig. These diseases have symptoms similar to those of patients the author treats for post-encephalitic disorders. Both lytico and bodig, while declining, are believed to have had the same cause sometime in the past on Guam. The candidates are explained with pros and cons for each and there is discussion of similar diseases in other places."
18,0375700730,http://goodreads.com/user/show/811366-esmeralda-rupp-spangle,5," The first Oliver Sacks book I read was The Man Who Mistook His Wife For a Hat, and since then have been a devotee of his work. He is a Neurologist, yes- but he is also a poet, not in the literal sense, but his ability to make the interesting into fantastic and the pretty into the magnificently beautiful is unrivaled. He is also an incredible humanitarian, and though generally he does not ""gush"" per se, he is so thoughtful, kind, and sympathetic in his descriptions that one cannot help but adore him. I honestly cannot put into words how much I love his books. They are often topics that I would be marginally interested in, but not willing to commit myself to. However, his wordsmithing abilities elevate any topic- from Tourettes, to ferns, to Syphilis- into a beautiful, moving, and fascinating read. This particular book hinges around three main stories- all set on islands in the South Pacific: His trip to an island of people who are genetically predisposed to true colorblindness called(black and white) known as ""the Maksun"", a different island of people who have a high incidence of a strange and unexplained degenerative disease called Lyco-Bodig, and a piece all about the ferns and fern-trees particular to certain isolated Pacific islands. Every time I finish one of his books I hold it up and say ""THIS one is my favorite"" - so now I say ""THIS one is my favorite"", but after I read the next one, I'm sure I'll say the same. "
19,0375700730,http://goodreads.com/user/show/26859189-nick,3,"First notes: I read the Dutch version of this book. Backcover is a bit misleading when a quote from NRC Handelsblad states that our author solves a the mystery in the first story and that he investigates a second mystery in the second story which is a bunch of baloney. First 'mystery' has a genetic component to it so no mystery there to solve because the reason behind it is explained. For the second mystery he is invited by another doctor to help him with research for a brain disease. The reasons for this disease are not clear yet but a lot (relative) of research has been put into it and there appear to be three suspects. However in the end it is not made clear by the author which he thinks is the suspect. So much for 'investigating'. It is a strange book containing actually 3 stories but interesting enough. There is some lack of cohesion between those stories other than being in the same geographical region with ferns/cycadales as the main lead throughout two stories. First story doesn't fit with the rest. However what carries this book mostly is the authors writing. Atleast he keeps the stories interesting through telling backgrounds, other perspectives of the story and his earlier experciences. One thing: for the time being not reading any books with footnotes anymore because it interrupts the flow of reading too much."
20,0375700730,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1385097-harry-rutherford,3,"I picked this up again because I was blogging about cycads. In this book Sacks visits a couple of Pacific islands where many of the locals have unusual neurological conditions; total colour-blindness on Pingelap and a degenerative disorder called lytico-bodig on Guam.The neurology is interesting—the colour blindness isn’t typical red/green colour-blindness but a complete absence of colour perception, and lytico-bodig is a disease of unknown cause, with such varied presentation that it was originally thought of as two diseases, lytico and bodig. And he’s very good at the travel-writing side of it, evoking these Pacific islands and supplying lots of context.I think Sacks is always worth reading—he’s thoughtful, brings a diverse range of references to his writing in a very natural way, and is superb at empathising with his patients and presenting them as real people with personalities, rather than just interesting cases. And neurology makes for fascinating subject matter. Having said that, this is one of his less memorable books, so if you haven’t read any Sacks I’d suggest starting with An Anthropologist on Mars or The Man who Mistook his Wife for a Hat. Seeing Voices, about deafness, is excellent too, as is his chemistry-themed memoir, Uncle Tungsten."
21,0375700730,http://goodreads.com/user/show/637121-danna,5,"This is the first time since using Goodreads that I've stepped beyond my stated purpose and logged a book I read before starting my Goodreads list but haven't re-read afresh prior to posting a review. Given the fascinating books I've been reading lately, I'm moved to share with fellow readers how glad I am of the serendipitous occasion back in the mid 1990s when I discovered this gem while clerking for the public library. Idle curiosity led me to check it out; little did I know at the time that Oliver Sacks would renew my fascination with science and open up a whole world of non-fiction reading that I'm still immensely enjoying today. I find that his name pops up every so often in other books, and not just those dealing specifically with neurological or medical subjects. It's no surprise to me that The New York Times has referred to Dr. Sacks as “the poet laureate of medicine,” and in 2002 he was awarded the Lewis Thomas Prize by Rockefeller University, which recognizes the scientist as poet."
22,0375700730,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5181385-m,4,"Another great read by Oliver Sacks who combines my favorite genres, travel memoir and science into entertaining, educational sojourns. Although trained as a forester/ecologist I would have loved to be a neurologist as the human brain fascinates me to no end, thus I always enjoy Oliver, the neurologist/naturalist and his travels, musings and case studies. The book is broken up into 3 chapters or books, each with its own unique theme and all followed by an extensive notes section which I found to be a great read on its own. I only referenced this section once in reading the fore mentioned chapters it corresponds to but after finishing the chapters dove right in and was thoroughly delighted by these extra tidbits of information. Although I see why others might find the notes section a bit tedious and unnecessary as I, excited by my reading of brain eating cannibals and 'Ishi' trees, tried to share these tidbits with my husband and was told it was horribly boring. Not everyone shares Oliver and I's fascination with these odd facts, understandably so. "
23,0375700730,http://goodreads.com/user/show/835731-ryan-berkebile,3," In the first half of the book, Oliver Sacks goes to Micronesia to explore the high rate of colorblindness amongst the population of Pohnpei. One theory cites a terrible hurricane over two hundred years ago decimated over ninty percent of the island. In order to restock the island, inbreeding had to take place over numerous generations which would lead to genetic defects.The second half of the book has Sacks going to Guam to look at a mysterous neurodegenerative paralysis similar to Parkinson's. There are many theories into which this disorder has struck the island. One in particular is from the many generation of eating/drinking of the Cycad. Another theory, directly linked from the first one, posits that the preparing of the cycads, washing out their poisons in the water supply could lead to this disorder.A weird thing about this disorder is that it only effected generations born after 1910 and before 1960. The generations after that were fine. "
24,0375700730,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2092969-miriam,3,"I took this book to Hawaii and read it most of the way home. So reading about island travel (and he was going A LOT farther into the Pacific than Hawaii) resonated.Beyond that, I think I understand why I didn't like The Mapmaker's Wife as much as this. For science writing to reach a wide audience, it has to be about more than science, and it has to be written with emotion as well as scientific accuracy. Sacks is a compassionate, curious man, eager to collaborate, to note the work of another scholar or artist, to go down a rabbit hole for a good footnote or observation. As much as this book is about geographic isolates and what we can learn from them about the passage of disease, or cycads and deep time, it's also a very human book. He always has a key detail about someone's personality or actions or a location's most interesting feature. His interest in the people and world around him come through. He is a nerd in the best sense of the word."
25,0375700730,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1821338-jake,3,"A very good and unusual combination of travelogue and medical mystery-- this book would be an excellent choice for a vacation anywhere in the Pacific. As in his other books, Sacks has a talent for painting very vivid pictures of people and places-- and moreover, he brings a similar clarity to his descriptions of complex scientific and medical phenomena. One thing I love about him is that he never dumbs it down-- he speaks in the language of science and expects you to have the right vocabulary. A side-note: the volume I had was written in 1998, but in 2002, Sacks and a colleague published an interesting new theory on the cause of Lytico-Bodig, the Guam disease that is the focus of the second half of the book. Once you're done reading, look that up on the internet-- it's a great postscript."

Perhaps because it narrates a journey through the Islands of the Pacific where I have never been though I am of the blood true. Perhaps because it is surprising, in the modern world of specialization, to come across a renaissance man of the same breed as Charles Darwin, people who don't distinguish between modes of science any more than they distinguish between science and life. Whatever the reason, I found this book enchanting.A neurologist with his own neurological disorder to give him insight into the people behind the conditions he treats, Oliver Sacks, in addition to a high level of expertise in his own field, has many intensely felt interests and loves: ancient plants, classic writings, sea cucumbers. "
27,0375700730,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8443281-jacklynn,4,I love Oliver Sacks' books. This one was about his travels to various island/island groups to study interesting medical conditions occurring in higher numbers than in other places. His books are always fascinating and are easy to read even though their non-fiction and typically deal with medical conditions. They are more like a sympathetic narrative of his patients than a medical journal. He travels to island were there is a large number of colorblind people. And another where people are affected by a rare parkinsons-like disease (to reduce it way more than is fair). I didn't realize that the footnotes were pretty much a whole nother book and admit I didn't read them as I was going along. I didn't see them until the end!

This time he's combining neurology with naturalist, anthropologist, and and even archaeologist in his journey to two islands in Micronesia to investigate two strange conditions among the inhabitants. This is a terrific read for 'armchair explorers' as well as the scientifically curious. Sachs' intellectual curiosity and spirit of adventure are at the forefront in this book."

36,0375700730,http://goodreads.com/user/show/30281185-sajith-kumar,3,"Islands are unique in many ways. The separation guaranteed by the vastness of the sea ensures subtle changes in the language and culture of the societies inhabiting them and the mainland, even though one is an offspring of the other. Not only in sociocultural mores, the isolation brings about genetic changes in the people, animals and plants. This was observed and characterized in great detail by none other than Charles Darwin himself, by his famous voyage around the globe in HMS Beagle. The rate of changes accumulated in the genome in response to natural selection against local conditions prevailing in an island will be far greater than that on the mainland. Darwin was amazed and encouraged by the sharp evolutionary changes he observed on the Galapagos Islands, which finally led to his theory of evolution. With this in the background, we turn to this book that showcases two remote islands in the Pacific Ocean, distant thousands of miles from the continents, in which two grotesque illnesses are widely prevalent in the indigenous populations. In Pingelap, total colour-blindness is fairly common, and in Guam, a neurological disease called lytico-bodig, that exhibits symptoms of Parkinsonism and paralysis affects a section of the populace born before 1945. The author visits these islands in turn, muses on them and the probable causes. Oliver Sacks is a physician and the author of many books. Born in London and educated at Oxford, he now lives in New York where he is Professor of Neurology and Psychiatry at Columbia University.There are many places in the world where first cousin marriage is common. In many parts of India itself, this was the norm before education and better living standards threw open the door to the outside world to those languishing in fetid superstition. Science has categorically outlined the dangers of inbreeding including widespread prevalence of genetic disorders, to mention nothing about the eventual impoverishment of the gene pool. Genetic diseases are marked often by recessive genes. Since every person possesses two sets of genes inherited from the father and mother, if one copy of the gene is healthy, the recessive gene stays dormant, without causing its harmful effects. The person with one faulty gene acts as a carrier of the disease, but the ailment itself will not be expressed in his body. When too much breeding occurs between people who are closely related, the chances of an offspring getting two copies of the recessive gene heightens. The higher than normal incidence of lunacy and other genetic defects observed in Kerala’s matrilineal society of the previous centuries may be taken note of. Pingelap Atoll’s people had to pass through a natural catastrophe that forced them to resort to inbreeding as a case of necessity. This paradise-like atoll in the middle of the Pacific vastness was hit by a huge typhoon in 1775. Most of the inhabitants perished. Out of the thousand or so dwellers, around twenty, mainly from the chief’s family, survived. The population slowly picked up over the decades, but the harmful effects of inbreeding began to tell heavily on the society’s well being. The loss of colour vision, called achromatopsia, spread among the descendants. The patients lacked all sense of colour, losing the cone cells in the retina which distinguishes colour. They depend only on the rod cells, which normal people use to see in darkness. As a result, people suffering from the disorder find it difficult to fully open their eyes in bright sunlight. This is accompanied by squint. Some semblance to normal human eyes can be generated by the liberal use of dark sunglasses. There is no cure for the disease as yet. Among the general population in other parts of the world, the rate of incidence is 1 in 30,000 whereas it is an astounding 1 in 12 in Pingelap.Sacks presents another startling phenomenon from Guam Island in the Pacific, which falls under U.S. administration. It is a U.S. military base, with a large area of the island out of bounds for ordinary citizens. The indigenous people in this lovely tropical island is afflicted with a paralyzing sickness called lytico-bodig, somewhat related to encephalitis lethargica. The sufferers show symptoms of Parkinson’s disease or display extreme inability to move muscles or speak. The disease worsens progressively, and finally kills the patient. This disease affects only the indigenous people of the island. The cause of this ailment is still shrouded in mystery. The chapter offers an absorbing discussion on the probable causes of the disease. A strong contender is the cycad plant found in large numbers on the island, whose seeds are eaten by the people as a source of protein during droughts or famines. This was widely used during the Second World War when the island was under Japanese occupation and the local people were mercilessly starved. The highest incidence of the malady was on the people born during the war years when all they had to eat was the cycad seeds. After the island was retaken by American troops, matters returned to normalcy. There has not been a single case of lytico-bodig on the people born after the event. The cycad plant contains a neurotoxin that may be responsible for the deleterious effects, but elaborate preparation of the seed before consumption takes care of removing most of the toxin. Scientists posit that genetic predisposition and deficiency of minerals rich in calcium and aluminium may also explain the phenomenon. The last word has not been said yet.The book is not just about diseases and cycads alone. It narrates a really adventurous travel to the beautiful Pacific islands. To reach Pohnpei, Sacks had to undergo some anxious hours in the form of a damaged plane tyre. Many of the islands in the Pacific are controlled by U.S. military. Repairs to the plane were carried out in a military base and the passengers were grudgingly allowed to stay on the island under the watchful eyes of the soldiers – a prospect equally disliked by both parties. The author gives a thrilling description of his journeys on the islands and the heaven-like beaches ideal for swimming or snorkeling. His revulsion to military bureaucracy is evident in more than one place in the book. Guam is a pretty island, but most of the prettiest beaches are under military control. Access is granted after thorough interrogation and that too, after forcing the visitors to wait for hours. But the author has not proposed exposure to radioactivity or other military-related causes for the spread of lytico-bodig.An illuminating discussion on ancient plants like ferns and cycads that still exist in the world is also presented as a bonus. Apparently, this was facilitated by his visit to Rota Island, near Guam. This book includes a huge section of Notes that runs to about a third of the book. But they are very informative and readers don’t feel interrupted from the main story even though they have to frequently refer to these elaborate pieces of information. Nice sketches of the trees and plants are very apt to the theme. An expansive bibliography and index add to the attraction of the book. The book was first published nearly twenty years ago, and that may be why he has not included the names of those genes that cause the diseases. Not that the readers get any wiser by a cryptic acronym, but it contributes to a feeling that the malady is being studied in detail by the academia and pharma.The book is highly recommended."
37,0375700730,http://goodreads.com/user/show/75006997-mo,2,"2,4 stars. After reading 'The Man Who Mistook His Wife For A Hat' by this writer, I had really high expectations for this book. I thought there would be a lot of interesting conversations with patients and notes from Sacks in which he seems to emphasize with them. But this book was really boring and formal, and sometimes the nature seemed more important to Sacks than the people he meets on his journey (1). A really spiritual atmosphere was also central, which I didn't like so much. In the end, it felt more like a travelogue than a report from a neurologist.Maybe the book was professional and informative, but it just wasn't what I hoped and/or expected. Still two stars, because the second half of the book was more interesting; there were more conversations with patients and insights in the sickness Sacks is trying to understand (2). (1) ""There was a large cantilevered bridge-ornate, gaudy, startling-spanning a gulch as the main road entered town. I had no idea of its history or function; it was as absurd, in its way, as the transplanted London Bridge in Arizona - but it looked festive, fun, as it leapt into the air, a pure effervescence of high spirits.""(2) (about ALS-patients) "".. to see all this and feel you can do nothing, absolutely nothing, to help them. Sometimes it seems especially horrible because their minds remain absolutely clear until the end - they know what is happening to them."""

42,0375700730,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4443481-sarah-beth,3,"In this work of non-fiction, neurologist Oliver Sacks describes his visits to the Micronesian island of Pingelap and later to Guam to investigate the effects of isolation on the incidence of neurological disorders in the small, island communities. In Pingelap, he investigates the large percentage of the population who suffer from total colorblindness, relying instead on pattern and shadows. In Guam, he visits patients suffering from a mysterious neurodegenerative paralysis whose cause has not been uncovered, even as the incidence of the disease seems to have disappeared in the younger generations. It's thought that achromatopsia, or total colorblindness accompanied by extreme sensitivity to light, originated in Pingelap in 1775, when a typhoon killed 90% of the island's population, leaving most of the survivors to die of starvation since most of the plants on the island were also destroyed. Only twenty or so survived but as this small group of survivors attempted to repopulate the island, ""genetic traits previously rare began to spread, so that in the fourth generation after the typhoon a 'new' disease showed itself. The first children with the Pingelap eye disease were born in the 1820s, and within a few generations their numbers had increased to more than five percent of the population"" (37). Elsewhere in the world, the incidence is less than one in 30,000 but on Pingelap it is one in 12. The greatest effects of this disorder, on an island community that cannot seek even basic accommodations like sunglasses, are social. Most sufferers never learn to read, because they cannot see the teacher's writing on the board. Additionally, they are less likely to marry because of a wish not to pass on the disorder and they cannot work outdoors, which limits their options in an already small island economy. In Guam, the effects of the prevalent neurological disorder is much more devastating. ""A tenth of all the adult Chamorro deaths on Guam were due to the disease, and its prevalence was at least a hundred times greater than on the mainland (in some villages, like Umatac, it was over four hundred times greater). Puzzlingly, the disease affects individuals differently, with affected family members exhibiting wildly different symptoms. Some suffered from profound mental and physical slowing and profound immobility. Others had tremors and rigidity. Even more curious, younger generations no longer seem to fall victim to this curious and fatal disease. Although many theories have been postulated for its origins, including consumption of certain species of local plants, no definitive explanation has been achieved. Similarly to my conclusions after reading An Anthropologist on Mars, I wondered what the intended takeaway is for the reader other than to describe these curious island maladies before they are corrected by time and exposure to a widening genetic pool. Sacks offers no solutions or treatments for the maladies explored in this book. Instead this book reads more like a travel narrative, recounting anecdotes of curiosities encountered on his journey, than a medical book shedding light on neurological conditions. This book reads almost like a rambling conversation with Sacks about his impressions after visiting the islands. Similarly, I found the final chapter of the book, which is devoted solely to island plants, and cycads in particular, sort of random. Although cycads have been thought to cause the neurological disorder found in Guam, the chapter does not connect back to the disorder in any way. However, despite this purely descriptive and rambling nature of the book, I found the neurological disorders he explores fascinating. Only on genetically isolated islands can such genetic anomalies arise. ""But islands open up, people die or intermarry; genetic attenuation sets in, and the condition disappears. The life of such a genetic disease in an isolate tends to be six or eight generations, two hundred years perhaps, and then it vanishes, as do its memories and traces, lost in the ongoing stream of time"" (177). 3.5 Stars"

44,0375700730,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5636777-kevin,3,"Dr. Sacks travels to pacific islands in this book. it’s really more of travel log whereas other books of his could be described as medical histories which focus on neurological disorders or peculiarities, this one focuses more on the society and geography of the places than the diseases/afflictions he went there to study.as always, his writing is amiable yet descriptive but the lack of focus in this book kept me from seeing a real point other than the publishing of a memoir of his time in these places. interesting maybe but without much substance. especially since the book is really two books: one about the island of the colorblind (ie a high percentage of the population is achromatopic) and the other about an affliction or disease on Guam that mimics Parkinson’s and may be caused somehow by the prolific species of cycads on the island. apparently, this notion has been around since the 1960s but never proven beyond a doubt. Sacks went there to see what he could figure out.there exists a thin but vital underlying thread of science tribalism and territoriality in the book. Sacks notes how the medical conditions in both parts of the book attract ambitious physician-scientists looking to solve the mystery and make a name for themselves. this is especially present in the latter book on cycads where researchers are seen covering up information sources, skewing and misreporting data, and blackballing heretics from their bailiwick field because, frankly, who’s around to know better? it seems claustrophobic to attempt to practice medicine or research on this remote islands where large, determined personalities can easily dominate by controlling and projecting a carefully crafted outward image. but like i said, this was a significant but nearly ephemeral theme running through Sacks’s narrative- it was not his main purpose to expose this kind of politics in science, he was simply relating the trials and tribulations of doing research in these isolated places and painted an accurate picture.like any good scholar/journalist, Sacks adds a metric ton of notes to his work to flesh out small points he wants to make and to provide references for his ramblings. i’ve always seen the excessive use of notes (both end- and foot-) as lazy writing. if it’s so very important that you need to take up pages for these notes, why can’t you incorporate it into your narrative and be done with the notes? i always have in my own work and it makes for a much smoother and enjoyable read. having said that, i think Sacks’s writing is “lazy” only in the sense that he was driven and didn’t much care to make his way as a polished, eloquent author. he wanted to say something and he did - then he would add asides as he thought of them to deepen and enrich the model of events he was building. in other words, i don’t see him using notes as though they are expected as many scholarly writers do; he used them because he was sitting round a campfire telling stories and kept thinking of more interesting things to say. “this happened and then - I ALMOST FORGOT!- this other thing happened, too!”"
45,0375700730,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1261617-jeroen,4,"About a third of my copy of The Island of the Colour-blind is taken up by notes and the index - I think that might be a record in my collection, apart from academic works. It's tempting to say this tells us something about the writer, Oliver Sacks. In the preface he writes that after writing the book in one fell swoop, it ended up growing ""like an unruly cycad."" To keep the pristinity of the main narrative, as it were, the notes were used, and one note can sometimes go on for three or four pages.I do think it's telling of the author. What defines Sacks is not only his renowned capacity for empathy, but also the breadth of his writing, which seems to situate itself on the crossroads of literature and medicine and is in this still (perhaps surprisingly) unique. Though there are many novels that play themselves out in hospitals, as well as medical literature meant for popular consumption, these are usually written in only one of the particular idioms. Sacks seems to be special in being able to write with the narratival grasp of a novelist and the scientific eye of a doctor.This also necessarily opens him up for critique. The literary reader might find the episode on the history of the lytico-bodig disease to be overlong, whereas the neurologist might not care so much for the scene setting and elaborate description, for what we might call the gravy of narratival writing - extraskeletal, perhaps, might be a good crossdisciplinary word here.I am certainly in the former group, and found the story on achromatopsia far more interesting. The curious quality of this quote-unquote disease - full colour-blindness - is that, the way deafness can free up one's brain for extrasensitive vision, so can lack of colour. And while one shouldn't go as far as to envy the achromatopsian - a kind of parallel false yearning as the one towards an age where our media streamed in sepiatonal - the spoilt first-world brat that I am couldn't help but dream of experiencing it just for a few hours.The other attraction here is the Pacific setting, and it struck me that it must be an odd place to have been over the twentieth century. There are hardly inhabitable places in the world that are more remote, and that will consequently feel more remote, and yet these islands have continually been drawn into something that happened far away from them. This is kind of heartbreaking, but also kind of beautiful - the island as a strange palimpsest forever re-written by the busy doings of all these self-important countries, and I'd like to picture the autochthonous islanders slowly shaking their heads, waving a limp arm in the direction of their new rulers, and ambling away. I would like to picture that, but that would be a lie: they suffered horribly in every consequent invasion of the supposedly cultured West, and the continued presence of military bases on these islands makes it not at all unlikely that more is still in store for them.To be honest I find that the ultimate sadness of globalisation: increasingly there is, it seems, nowhere left to really ""get away from it all""."
46,0375700730,http://goodreads.com/user/show/53470308-muskaan-multani,3,"The Island Of The Colorblind is a Nonfiction book written by, Oliver Sacks. The first part of the book is about a medical syndrome called Achromatopsia (results in total colorblindness) on the Micronesian Atoll of Pingelap. The second half of the book is about mystery, of Lytico-Bodig disease in Guam.A neurologist travels to a Micronesian island called Pingelap, where ten percent of the population is completely colorblind, this is a rare medical syndrome called, achromatopsia. Hundreds of years ago the island was wiped out by a typhoon killing many residents, they began to repopulate, but the father of the island carried a gene for achromatopsia that eventually spread out to the population of Pingelap. Oliver Sacks is fascinated by this island and he was very excited to learn about their culture and daily lives. Sacks brought along with him a man named Knut who had been color blind since birth. Knut required a magnifying glass for close up reading and monoculars for distance reading, also he is very sensitive to light so he wore three pairs of sunglasses. Knut and Oliver Sacks discovered that the people with achromatopsia on the island required these same objects in order to see better, but the didn’t have the resources for these necessities. The two “researchers” have a great time in Pingelap and were very upset when they had to leave.In the second part of the book, Oliver Sacks travels to Guam and learns about Lytico-Bodig disease, “The disease resembles Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS), Parkinson's disease, and Alzheimer's.[3] First reports of the disease surfaced in three death certificates on Guam in 1904”. Sacks has a difficult time finding a solution to the disease with other scientists, it is very puzzling throughout the entire story for him. Sacks does have a theory that the disease could be caused by eating the fruits of the cycads, that are today known as common ferns and sage palms. The natives have to carefully prepare the fruits and wash away the alkalines. In the end, he doesn’t find a solution but he has learned a great deal of information. I would recommend this book to anyone who is interested in learning about islands and are interested in medical issues. I somewhat enjoyed this book because, while it did give a lot of interesting information, the book was difficult to follow. For example, after each paragraph the author would change the topic, there wasn’t a good flow when reading. There was also some terminology that the average reader wouldn’t know about, but there was an index at the of the book, which was helpful. Overall, it was a good book, but there are only specific people that will enjoy it. "
47,0375700730,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3915142-garrett-haynes,5,"This is my first reading of Oliver Sacks and I thoroughly enjoyed it. I love his mixture of science, mystery, medicine, wonder, awe and adventure. Sure there are times where he expresses contorted western views of the natives but it is hard to escape our own world views that are shaped by living as westerners, not as islanders. Oliver honestly expresses his musings and I appreciate that especially since many of them are so interesting. The varied content of this book was unexpected but more and more welcomed as he lands on each new island full of endemic plants and endemic diseases. It is hard not to be fascinated by the juxtaposition between the various expressions of the lytico-bodig and also the various species of cycads. Even more so by their likely but yet unprovable link. It is sad to know of the devastating effect our western nations have had on these people and their islands. Disease, oppression, slavery, murder, Destruction of their rich cultural heritage, and the Extinction of birds and plants. Our human nature is to explore and we all love stories of explorers and adventurers. Even the natives themselves ventured to these islands themselves centuries ago, likely spurred by the same desire for new worlds as the European explorers. However, they were able to integrate with the island whereas we have a tendency to consume the worlds we discover. I am not suggesting we all start living in huts again and only eating what we catch ourselves but we can learn from the natives ability to coexist with their environment rather than consume it.I have always wanted to have a more intellectual and scientific life and maybe I will grow more toward that, I hope I will. Reading a book like this stokes these desires and you can bet I will be checking out more of Ollie's books from the library. "

Full cases of color blindness (achromatopsia) are hard to come by, yet in some micronesian islands there are large percentages of full cases. He also recounts a mysterious illness on the islands that onlyaffects people who were born or visited there in the 40's. People born there after 52 did not come down with either of the two various forms it takes (neurdegenerative akin to parkinsonia).His asides on the cycads are interesting. Some have countless ways ofpropagating in very ingenious ways.Another interesting side is the love of SPAM, which was introduced in the 40's. Grocery stores have (had?) aisles of it. In a mainly seafood and vegetarian society it seemed odd to have this fixation on such a meat by-product. His one observation was that in borneo SPAM was to be seen as the closest meat product with a taste and texture to long pig, or human flesh. Pig being the second runner up. The strange note was that Micronesia doesn't have a history of cannibalism. So, eat up you SPAM lovers!"

It's really two books: one about the island (well, two) where there are large populations of achromatopes: people with no color perception at all. He describes how they live and cope, and there's lots of his personal ideas mixed in.The second half is about Guam and the strange disease that is common there, which is not unlike the post-encaphilitic parkinsonism he describes at length in Awakenings. It feels a bit like cheating: oh, so as I was checking out the nearby islands, I found this place that just happened to have a weird disease that perfectly matches my expertise! But his writing is great, the story of the strangely-named disease is fascinating, and it makes for a very satisfying book overall (especially if you've read Awakenings).Oh, and it's also about another one of his obsessions: botany, and in particular cycads. They play an important role, too. There's a beautiful epilogue of sorts that describes his experience of the jungle and the cycads that has nothing to do with the topic of the book, but is simply great.As usual, skip the million-or-so notes, they just interrupt the flow of the story.

As always, Sacks keeps the patient in the forefront in writing their case histories; one gets a sense of what it might feel to be someone with such a rare yet terrible affliction. Sack's gestalt portrait of each patient paints them organically - more than just an acronym or a collection of neurological maladies. All of this serves as a background to solving the decade long puzzle of rare neurological disorders by systematically incorporating knowledge from disparate disciplines, a feat which Sacks achieves deft zeal, one hardly feels one is reading a case study. Although I don't share the author's interest in cycads and the other plants he describes over many pages, his enthusiasm and passionate description of them is contagious. The picture he paints of the various islands traveled to in the book was equally vivid, such that I found myself wanting to visit them.

The first half of the book is a study of a group of natives to islands in the Pacific where around 10% of the population is colorblind. It is more than just a neurological picture of them, it is also a cultural picture of how these people cope with their sight issues. Sacks does a great job of drawing you into the story of this group of people. The second half of the book is also about a population of people living on a couple of islands in the Pacific. This group of people have a neurological disorder similar to those in Awakenings. This part of the book is more technical, and not as easy to read for a lay-person, but still interesting. "
52,0375700730,http://goodreads.com/user/show/46722444-olga-werby,5,"In the book “The Island of the Colorblind,” Dr. Oliver Sacks describes his adventures through a series of islands in Micronesia, which have an unusually high percentage of congenital achromatopsia (sever colorblindness) among the population. One of his traveling companions was a Norwegian scientist, Knut Nordby, an achromatope himself. Dr. Nordby described how his rather rare condition affected his early education. In addition to complete color blindness, congenital achromatopsia causes extreme sensitivity to bright light and poor visual acuity. Dr. Nordby’s condition was diagnosed early, and since his vision was thought too poor to learn to read, he was sent to the school for the blind. But he hated Braille and used his sight to decipher the shadows on the page made by the raised bumps. He “cheated” at Braille and was caught. His teachers punished him for using his eyes to read and made him wear a blindfold in class. Dr. Nordby ran away from that school and eventually taught himself to read printed words and became a successful psychologist."
53,0375700730,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6732556-joe-silber,3,"Fairly different from other books by Sacks that I have read; it contains (in addition to the medical studies and mysteries that you would expect) island travelogue, botany, and a touch of autobiography, all written in Sacks' familiar warm, literate style. It is split into two main sections (plus a brief epilogue) both involving islands - the first half covers the titular Island of the Colorblind, Pingelap, while the second half discusses the mysterious lytico-bodig disease found among natives of Guam. As always, Sacks' writing is excellent, and I found the book interesting and readable (only occasional sloggy bits, usually found in the copious footnote entries) but ultimately I felt like it was a little bit padded and indulgent (despite the short length), and that more trim, tightly-edited versions of these stories belonged as part of a longer book like Sacks' ""Anthropologist on Mars""."
54,0375700730,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4414163-drew,4,"This is essentially two books. Both center around islands where the populations have surprisingly high occurrences of certain medical conditions. As the title suggests, one of those conditions colorblindness. Not standard colorblindness either, but a complete inability to see any color. The second is neurological disease with similarities to Parkinsons, ALS, and dementia. Mixed in both books, but mainly the second, is some history of plants. Mostly cycads.This was my first book by Oliver Sacks, and I think I'd happily pick up any of his other books now. I was interested because he's a neuroligist, but wary because a quick skim showed I suspected he had the type of flowery, meandering writing style that drives me batty. Turns out, he strikes a wonderful balance between story telling and science. It leans more storytelling - I could go for a dash more science - but it does make for enjoyable and interesting reading."
55,0375700730,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1527994-nora,3,"Sacks writes a pretty scientific account of his Micronesian tour, which I guess I can't criticize. The guy's a neurologist. However, that being said, he does a phenomenal job describing the interactions he has with Pacific Islanders and how mystified he is by nature.***And in that first long moment, with the children coming out of the forest, some with their arms around each other, and the tropical luxuriance of vegetation in all directions - the beauty of the primitive, the human and the natural, tool hold of me. I felt a wave of love - for the children, for the forest, for the island, for the whole scene; I had a sense of paradise, of an almost magical reality. I thought, I have arrived. I am here at last. I want to spend the rest of my life here - and some of these beautiful children could be mine (30)."

Little time is spent on the actual colorblindness, which is the primary reason for picking up this book, the secondary reason was that is was by Oliver Sacks. It was misleading in that I thought that book was going to fixate on the colorblind, or at least their island, but it's only a third (roughly) of the book, we then wander to Guam to learn about a mystery disease, and then on to Rota for the cycads. At times these additional subjects were fascinating, occasionally getting bogged down in jargon -- although that was partially expected -- and at times I just reached my limit for caring, my interest for the additional subjects were not of his depth."
57,0375700730,http://goodreads.com/user/show/27000109-harpoon,2,"A somewhat disjointed book with some interesting spots. When he is in neurology mode, talking about the inherited color blindness of the title, or a mysterious island syndrome mimicking ALS or Parkinson's but not quite like either, the book is good, though not as compelling as Sacks' other works. But too much is the book is a sort of travelogue, and this just wasn't very interesting. It felt like he had to deliver a book to his publisher, and filled it up with somewhat pedestrian stuff. Also, like another reviewer mentioned, the footnote strategy of this book adds to the disjointed feeling. The footnotes are long and digressive; they're like mini-essays loosely related to the text. I gave up flipping between notes and text, and just read the notes at the end, which actually worked okay. "

While the cause(s) have never been determined, the prevalence seems to be diminishing over time.The pieces are well written and interesting, and probably a higher rating, but for whatever the book did not have that magic that brings me to give more stars."

This book reminds me of Bill Brysons A Short History Of Nearly Everything, because of the wrong tracks, solutions that aren't quite right, etc. This is how real science marches forward: not a few individuals making grand discoveries, but scores of people who try and try and try to find an answer, until somebody stands on the shoulders of a giant and finds the solution (and then somebody else refines it, and gets either all of the credit or none at all).But the ending is depressing, especially when you check when this book was written.

66,0375700730,http://goodreads.com/user/show/30281185-sajith-kumar,3,"Islands are unique in many ways. The separation guaranteed by the vastness of the sea ensures subtle changes in the language and culture of the societies inhabiting them and the mainland, even though one is an offspring of the other. Not only in sociocultural mores, the isolation brings about genetic changes in the people, animals and plants. This was observed and characterized in great detail by none other than Charles Darwin himself, by his famous voyage around the globe in HMS Beagle. The rate of changes accumulated in the genome in response to natural selection against local conditions prevailing in an island will be far greater than that on the mainland. Darwin was amazed and encouraged by the sharp evolutionary changes he observed on the Galapagos Islands, which finally led to his theory of evolution. With this in the background, we turn to this book that showcases two remote islands in the Pacific Ocean, distant thousands of miles from the continents, in which two grotesque illnesses are widely prevalent in the indigenous populations. In Pingelap, total colour-blindness is fairly common, and in Guam, a neurological disease called lytico-bodig, that exhibits symptoms of Parkinsonism and paralysis affects a section of the populace born before 1945. The author visits these islands in turn, muses on them and the probable causes. Oliver Sacks is a physician and the author of many books. Born in London and educated at Oxford, he now lives in New York where he is Professor of Neurology and Psychiatry at Columbia University.There are many places in the world where first cousin marriage is common. In many parts of India itself, this was the norm before education and better living standards threw open the door to the outside world to those languishing in fetid superstition. Science has categorically outlined the dangers of inbreeding including widespread prevalence of genetic disorders, to mention nothing about the eventual impoverishment of the gene pool. Genetic diseases are marked often by recessive genes. Since every person possesses two sets of genes inherited from the father and mother, if one copy of the gene is healthy, the recessive gene stays dormant, without causing its harmful effects. The person with one faulty gene acts as a carrier of the disease, but the ailment itself will not be expressed in his body. When too much breeding occurs between people who are closely related, the chances of an offspring getting two copies of the recessive gene heightens. The higher than normal incidence of lunacy and other genetic defects observed in Kerala’s matrilineal society of the previous centuries may be taken note of. Pingelap Atoll’s people had to pass through a natural catastrophe that forced them to resort to inbreeding as a case of necessity. This paradise-like atoll in the middle of the Pacific vastness was hit by a huge typhoon in 1775. Most of the inhabitants perished. Out of the thousand or so dwellers, around twenty, mainly from the chief’s family, survived. The population slowly picked up over the decades, but the harmful effects of inbreeding began to tell heavily on the society’s well being. The loss of colour vision, called achromatopsia, spread among the descendants. The patients lacked all sense of colour, losing the cone cells in the retina which distinguishes colour. They depend only on the rod cells, which normal people use to see in darkness. As a result, people suffering from the disorder find it difficult to fully open their eyes in bright sunlight. This is accompanied by squint. Some semblance to normal human eyes can be generated by the liberal use of dark sunglasses. There is no cure for the disease as yet. Among the general population in other parts of the world, the rate of incidence is 1 in 30,000 whereas it is an astounding 1 in 12 in Pingelap.Sacks presents another startling phenomenon from Guam Island in the Pacific, which falls under U.S. administration. It is a U.S. military base, with a large area of the island out of bounds for ordinary citizens. The indigenous people in this lovely tropical island is afflicted with a paralyzing sickness called lytico-bodig, somewhat related to encephalitis lethargica. The sufferers show symptoms of Parkinson’s disease or display extreme inability to move muscles or speak. The disease worsens progressively, and finally kills the patient. This disease affects only the indigenous people of the island. The cause of this ailment is still shrouded in mystery. The chapter offers an absorbing discussion on the probable causes of the disease. A strong contender is the cycad plant found in large numbers on the island, whose seeds are eaten by the people as a source of protein during droughts or famines. This was widely used during the Second World War when the island was under Japanese occupation and the local people were mercilessly starved. The highest incidence of the malady was on the people born during the war years when all they had to eat was the cycad seeds. After the island was retaken by American troops, matters returned to normalcy. There has not been a single case of lytico-bodig on the people born after the event. The cycad plant contains a neurotoxin that may be responsible for the deleterious effects, but elaborate preparation of the seed before consumption takes care of removing most of the toxin. Scientists posit that genetic predisposition and deficiency of minerals rich in calcium and aluminium may also explain the phenomenon. The last word has not been said yet.The book is not just about diseases and cycads alone. It narrates a really adventurous travel to the beautiful Pacific islands. To reach Pohnpei, Sacks had to undergo some anxious hours in the form of a damaged plane tyre. Many of the islands in the Pacific are controlled by U.S. military. Repairs to the plane were carried out in a military base and the passengers were grudgingly allowed to stay on the island under the watchful eyes of the soldiers – a prospect equally disliked by both parties. The author gives a thrilling description of his journeys on the islands and the heaven-like beaches ideal for swimming or snorkeling. His revulsion to military bureaucracy is evident in more than one place in the book. Guam is a pretty island, but most of the prettiest beaches are under military control. Access is granted after thorough interrogation and that too, after forcing the visitors to wait for hours. But the author has not proposed exposure to radioactivity or other military-related causes for the spread of lytico-bodig.An illuminating discussion on ancient plants like ferns and cycads that still exist in the world is also presented as a bonus. Apparently, this was facilitated by his visit to Rota Island, near Guam. This book includes a huge section of Notes that runs to about a third of the book. But they are very informative and readers don’t feel interrupted from the main story even though they have to frequently refer to these elaborate pieces of information. Nice sketches of the trees and plants are very apt to the theme. An expansive bibliography and index add to the attraction of the book. The book was first published nearly twenty years ago, and that may be why he has not included the names of those genes that cause the diseases. Not that the readers get any wiser by a cryptic acronym, but it contributes to a feeling that the malady is being studied in detail by the academia and pharma.The book is highly recommended."
67,0375700730,http://goodreads.com/user/show/75006997-mo,2,"2,4 stars. After reading 'The Man Who Mistook His Wife For A Hat' by this writer, I had really high expectations for this book. I thought there would be a lot of interesting conversations with patients and notes from Sacks in which he seems to emphasize with them. But this book was really boring and formal, and sometimes the nature seemed more important to Sacks than the people he meets on his journey (1). A really spiritual atmosphere was also central, which I didn't like so much. In the end, it felt more like a travelogue than a report from a neurologist.Maybe the book was professional and informative, but it just wasn't what I hoped and/or expected. Still two stars, because the second half of the book was more interesting; there were more conversations with patients and insights in the sickness Sacks is trying to understand (2). (1) ""There was a large cantilevered bridge-ornate, gaudy, startling-spanning a gulch as the main road entered town. I had no idea of its history or function; it was as absurd, in its way, as the transplanted London Bridge in Arizona - but it looked festive, fun, as it leapt into the air, a pure effervescence of high spirits.""(2) (about ALS-patients) "".. to see all this and feel you can do nothing, absolutely nothing, to help them.

72,0375700730,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4443481-sarah-beth,3,"In this work of non-fiction, neurologist Oliver Sacks describes his visits to the Micronesian island of Pingelap and later to Guam to investigate the effects of isolation on the incidence of neurological disorders in the small, island communities. In Pingelap, he investigates the large percentage of the population who suffer from total colorblindness, relying instead on pattern and shadows. In Guam, he visits patients suffering from a mysterious neurodegenerative paralysis whose cause has not been uncovered, even as the incidence of the disease seems to have disappeared in the younger generations. It's thought that achromatopsia, or total colorblindness accompanied by extreme sensitivity to light, originated in Pingelap in 1775, when a typhoon killed 90% of the island's population, leaving most of the survivors to die of starvation since most of the plants on the island were also destroyed. Only twenty or so survived but as this small group of survivors attempted to repopulate the island, ""genetic traits previously rare began to spread, so that in the fourth generation after the typhoon a 'new' disease showed itself. The first children with the Pingelap eye disease were born in the 1820s, and within a few generations their numbers had increased to more than five percent of the population"" (37). Elsewhere in the world, the incidence is less than one in 30,000 but on Pingelap it is one in 12. The greatest effects of this disorder, on an island community that cannot seek even basic accommodations like sunglasses, are social. Most sufferers never learn to read, because they cannot see the teacher's writing on the board. Additionally, they are less likely to marry because of a wish not to pass on the disorder and they cannot work outdoors, which limits their options in an already small island economy. In Guam, the effects of the prevalent neurological disorder is much more devastating. ""A tenth of all the adult Chamorro deaths on Guam were due to the disease, and its prevalence was at least a hundred times greater than on the mainland (in some villages, like Umatac, it was over four hundred times greater). Puzzlingly, the disease affects individuals differently, with affected family members exhibiting wildly different symptoms. Some suffered from profound mental and physical slowing and profound immobility. Others had tremors and rigidity. Even more curious, younger generations no longer seem to fall victim to this curious and fatal disease. Although many theories have been postulated for its origins, including consumption of certain species of local plants, no definitive explanation has been achieved. Similarly to my conclusions after reading An Anthropologist on Mars, I wondered what the intended takeaway is for the reader other than to describe these curious island maladies before they are corrected by time and exposure to a widening genetic pool. Sacks offers no solutions or treatments for the maladies explored in this book. Instead this book reads more like a travel narrative, recounting anecdotes of curiosities encountered on his journey, than a medical book shedding light on neurological conditions. This book reads almost like a rambling conversation with Sacks about his impressions after visiting the islands. Similarly, I found the final chapter of the book, which is devoted solely to island plants, and cycads in particular, sort of random. Although cycads have been thought to cause the neurological disorder found in Guam, the chapter does not connect back to the disorder in any way. However, despite this purely descriptive and rambling nature of the book, I found the neurological disorders he explores fascinating. Only on genetically isolated islands can such genetic anomalies arise. ""But islands open up, people die or intermarry; genetic attenuation sets in, and the condition disappears. The life of such a genetic disease in an isolate tends to be six or eight generations, two hundred years perhaps, and then it vanishes, as do its memories and traces, lost in the ongoing stream of time"" (177). 3.5 Stars"

74,0375700730,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5636777-kevin,3,"Dr. Sacks travels to pacific islands in this book. it’s really more of travel log whereas other books of his could be described as medical histories which focus on neurological disorders or peculiarities, this one focuses more on the society and geography of the places than the diseases/afflictions he went there to study.as always, his writing is amiable yet descriptive but the lack of focus in this book kept me from seeing a real point other than the publishing of a memoir of his time in these places. interesting maybe but without much substance. especially since the book is really two books: one about the island of the colorblind (ie a high percentage of the population is achromatopic) and the other about an affliction or disease on Guam that mimics Parkinson’s and may be caused somehow by the prolific species of cycads on the island. apparently, this notion has been around since the 1960s but never proven beyond a doubt. Sacks went there to see what he could figure out.there exists a thin but vital underlying thread of science tribalism and territoriality in the book. Sacks notes how the medical conditions in both parts of the book attract ambitious physician-scientists looking to solve the mystery and make a name for themselves. this is especially present in the latter book on cycads where researchers are seen covering up information sources, skewing and misreporting data, and blackballing heretics from their bailiwick field because, frankly, who’s around to know better? it seems claustrophobic to attempt to practice medicine or research on this remote islands where large, determined personalities can easily dominate by controlling and projecting a carefully crafted outward image. but like i said, this was a significant but nearly ephemeral theme running through Sacks’s narrative- it was not his main purpose to expose this kind of politics in science, he was simply relating the trials and tribulations of doing research in these isolated places and painted an accurate picture.like any good scholar/journalist, Sacks adds a metric ton of notes to his work to flesh out small points he wants to make and to provide references for his ramblings. i’ve always seen the excessive use of notes (both end- and foot-) as lazy writing. if it’s so very important that you need to take up pages for these notes, why can’t you incorporate it into your narrative and be done with the notes? i always have in my own work and it makes for a much smoother and enjoyable read. having said that, i think Sacks’s writing is “lazy” only in the sense that he was driven and didn’t much care to make his way as a polished, eloquent author. he wanted to say something and he did - then he would add asides as he thought of them to deepen and enrich the model of events he was building. in other words, i don’t see him using notes as though they are expected as many scholarly writers do; he used them because he was sitting round a campfire telling stories and kept thinking of more interesting things to say. “this happened and then - I ALMOST FORGOT!- this other thing happened, too!”"
75,0375700730,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1261617-jeroen,4,"About a third of my copy of The Island of the Colour-blind is taken up by notes and the index - I think that might be a record in my collection, apart from academic works. It's tempting to say this tells us something about the writer, Oliver Sacks. In the preface he writes that after writing the book in one fell swoop, it ended up growing ""like an unruly cycad."" To keep the pristinity of the main narrative, as it were, the notes were used, and one note can sometimes go on for three or four pages.I do think it's telling of the author. What defines Sacks is not only his renowned capacity for empathy, but also the breadth of his writing, which seems to situate itself on the crossroads of literature and medicine and is in this still (perhaps surprisingly) unique. Though there are many novels that play themselves out in hospitals, as well as medical literature meant for popular consumption, these are usually written in only one of the particular idioms. Sacks seems to be special in being able to write with the narratival grasp of a novelist and the scientific eye of a doctor.This also necessarily opens him up for critique. The literary reader might find the episode on the history of the lytico-bodig disease to be overlong, whereas the neurologist might not care so much for the scene setting and elaborate description, for what we might call the gravy of narratival writing - extraskeletal, perhaps, might be a good crossdisciplinary word here.I am certainly in the former group, and found the story on achromatopsia far more interesting. The curious quality of this quote-unquote disease - full colour-blindness - is that, the way deafness can free up one's brain for extrasensitive vision, so can lack of colour. And while one shouldn't go as far as to envy the achromatopsian - a kind of parallel false yearning as the one towards an age where our media streamed in sepiatonal - the spoilt first-world brat that I am couldn't help but dream of experiencing it just for a few hours.The other attraction here is the Pacific setting, and it struck me that it must be an odd place to have been over the twentieth century. There are hardly inhabitable places in the world that are more remote, and that will consequently feel more remote, and yet these islands have continually been drawn into something that happened far away from them. This is kind of heartbreaking, but also kind of beautiful - the island as a strange palimpsest forever re-written by the busy doings of all these self-important countries, and I'd like to picture the autochthonous islanders slowly shaking their heads, waving a limp arm in the direction of their new rulers, and ambling away. I would like to picture that, but that would be a lie: they suffered horribly in every consequent invasion of the supposedly cultured West, and the continued presence of military bases on these islands makes it not at all unlikely that more is still in store for them.To be honest I find that the ultimate sadness of globalisation: increasingly there is, it seems, nowhere left to really ""get away from it all""."
76,0375700730,http://goodreads.com/user/show/53470308-muskaan-multani,3,"The Island Of The Colorblind is a Nonfiction book written by, Oliver Sacks. The first part of the book is about a medical syndrome called Achromatopsia (results in total colorblindness) on the Micronesian Atoll of Pingelap. The second half of the book is about mystery, of Lytico-Bodig disease in Guam.A neurologist travels to a Micronesian island called Pingelap, where ten percent of the population is completely colorblind, this is a rare medical syndrome called, achromatopsia. Hundreds of years ago the island was wiped out by a typhoon killing many residents, they began to repopulate, but the father of the island carried a gene for achromatopsia that eventually spread out to the population of Pingelap. Oliver Sacks is fascinated by this island and he was very excited to learn about their culture and daily lives. Sacks brought along with him a man named Knut who had been color blind since birth. Knut required a magnifying glass for close up reading and monoculars for distance reading, also he is very sensitive to light so he wore three pairs of sunglasses. Knut and Oliver Sacks discovered that the people with achromatopsia on the island required these same objects in order to see better, but the didn’t have the resources for these necessities. The two “researchers” have a great time in Pingelap and were very upset when they had to leave.In the second part of the book, Oliver Sacks travels to Guam and learns about Lytico-Bodig disease, “The disease resembles Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS), Parkinson's disease, and Alzheimer's.[3] First reports of the disease surfaced in three death certificates on Guam in 1904”. Sacks has a difficult time finding a solution to the disease with other scientists, it is very puzzling throughout the entire story for him. Sacks does have a theory that the disease could be caused by eating the fruits of the cycads, that are today known as common ferns and sage palms. The natives have to carefully prepare the fruits and wash away the alkalines. In the end, he doesn’t find a solution but he has learned a great deal of information. I would recommend this book to anyone who is interested in learning about islands and are interested in medical issues. I somewhat enjoyed this book because, while it did give a lot of interesting information, the book was difficult to follow. For example, after each paragraph the author would change the topic, there wasn’t a good flow when reading. There was also some terminology that the average reader wouldn’t know about, but there was an index at the of the book, which was helpful. Overall, it was a good book, but there are only specific people that will enjoy it. "
77,0375700730,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3915142-garrett-haynes,5,"This is my first reading of Oliver Sacks and I thoroughly enjoyed it. I love his mixture of science, mystery, medicine, wonder, awe and adventure. Sure there are times where he expresses contorted western views of the natives but it is hard to escape our own world views that are shaped by living as westerners, not as islanders. Oliver honestly expresses his musings and I appreciate that especially since many of them are so interesting. The varied content of this book was unexpected but more and more welcomed as he lands on each new island full of endemic plants and endemic diseases. It is hard not to be fascinated by the juxtaposition between the various expressions of the lytico-bodig and also the various species of cycads. Even more so by their likely but yet unprovable link. It is sad to know of the devastating effect our western nations have had on these people and their islands. Disease, oppression, slavery, murder, Destruction of their rich cultural heritage, and the Extinction of birds and plants. Our human nature is to explore and we all love stories of explorers and adventurers. Even the natives themselves ventured to these islands themselves centuries ago, likely spurred by the same desire for new worlds as the European explorers. However, they were able to integrate with the island whereas we have a tendency to consume the worlds we discover. I am not suggesting we all start living in huts again and only eating what we catch ourselves but we can learn from the natives ability to coexist with their environment rather than consume it.I have always wanted to have a more intellectual and scientific life and maybe I will grow more toward that, I hope I will. Reading a book like this stokes these desires and you can bet I will be checking out more of Ollie's books from the library. "

Full cases of color blindness (achromatopsia) are hard to come by, yet in some micronesian islands there are large percentages of full cases. He also recounts a mysterious illness on the islands that onlyaffects people who were born or visited there in the 40's. People born there after 52 did not come down with either of the two various forms it takes (neurdegenerative akin to parkinsonia).His asides on the cycads are interesting. Some have countless ways ofpropagating in very ingenious ways.Another interesting side is the love of SPAM, which was introduced in the 40's. Grocery stores have (had?) aisles of it. In a mainly seafood and vegetarian society it seemed odd to have this fixation on such a meat by-product. His one observation was that in borneo SPAM was to be seen as the closest meat product with a taste and texture to long pig, or human flesh. Pig being the second runner up. The strange note was that Micronesia doesn't have a history of cannibalism. So, eat up you SPAM lovers!"

It's really two books: one about the island (well, two) where there are large populations of achromatopes: people with no color perception at all. He describes how they live and cope, and there's lots of his personal ideas mixed in.The second half is about Guam and the strange disease that is common there, which is not unlike the post-encaphilitic parkinsonism he describes at length in Awakenings. It feels a bit like cheating: oh, so as I was checking out the nearby islands, I found this place that just happened to have a weird disease that perfectly matches my expertise! But his writing is great, the story of the strangely-named disease is fascinating, and it makes for a very satisfying book overall (especially if you've read Awakenings).Oh, and it's also about another one of his obsessions: botany, and in particular cycads. They play an important role, too. There's a beautiful epilogue of sorts that describes his experience of the jungle and the cycads that has nothing to do with the topic of the book, but is simply great.As usual, skip the million-or-so notes, they just interrupt the flow of the story. Luckily, they're at the end of the book, so they don't get in the way at all."

As always, Sacks keeps the patient in the forefront in writing their case histories; one gets a sense of what it might feel to be someone with such a rare yet terrible affliction. Sack's gestalt portrait of each patient paints them organically - more than just an acronym or a collection of neurological maladies. All of this serves as a background to solving the decade long puzzle of rare neurological disorders by systematically incorporating knowledge from disparate disciplines, a feat which Sacks achieves deft zeal, one hardly feels one is reading a case study. Although I don't share the author's interest in cycads and the other plants he describes over many pages, his enthusiasm and passionate description of them is contagious. The picture he paints of the various islands traveled to in the book was equally vivid, such that I found myself wanting to visit them.

The first half of the book is a study of a group of natives to islands in the Pacific where around 10% of the population is colorblind. It is more than just a neurological picture of them, it is also a cultural picture of how these people cope with their sight issues. Sacks does a great job of drawing you into the story of this group of people. The second half of the book is also about a population of people living on a couple of islands in the Pacific. This group of people have a neurological disorder similar to those in Awakenings. This part of the book is more technical, and not as easy to read for a lay-person, but still interesting. "
82,0375700730,http://goodreads.com/user/show/46722444-olga-werby,5,"In the book “The Island of the Colorblind,” Dr. Oliver Sacks describes his adventures through a series of islands in Micronesia, which have an unusually high percentage of congenital achromatopsia (sever colorblindness) among the population. One of his traveling companions was a Norwegian scientist, Knut Nordby, an achromatope himself. Dr. Nordby described how his rather rare condition affected his early education. In addition to complete color blindness, congenital achromatopsia causes extreme sensitivity to bright light and poor visual acuity. Dr. Nordby’s condition was diagnosed early, and since his vision was thought too poor to learn to read, he was sent to the school for the blind. But he hated Braille and used his sight to decipher the shadows on the page made by the raised bumps. He “cheated” at Braille and was caught. His teachers punished him for using his eyes to read and made him wear a blindfold in class. Dr. Nordby ran away from that school and eventually taught himself to read printed words and became a successful psychologist."
83,0375700730,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6732556-joe-silber,3,"Fairly different from other books by Sacks that I have read; it contains (in addition to the medical studies and mysteries that you would expect) island travelogue, botany, and a touch of autobiography, all written in Sacks' familiar warm, literate style. It is split into two main sections (plus a brief epilogue) both involving islands - the first half covers the titular Island of the Colorblind, Pingelap, while the second half discusses the mysterious lytico-bodig disease found among natives of Guam. As always, Sacks' writing is excellent, and I found the book interesting and readable (only occasional sloggy bits, usually found in the copious footnote entries) but ultimately I felt like it was a little bit padded and indulgent (despite the short length), and that more trim, tightly-edited versions of these stories belonged as part of a longer book like Sacks' ""Anthropologist on Mars""."

Both center around islands where the populations have surprisingly high occurrences of certain medical conditions. As the title suggests, one of those conditions colorblindness. Not standard colorblindness either, but a complete inability to see any color. The second is neurological disease with similarities to Parkinsons, ALS, and dementia. Mixed in both books, but mainly the second, is some history of plants. Mostly cycads.This was my first book by Oliver Sacks, and I think I'd happily pick up any of his other books now. I was interested because he's a neuroligist, but wary because a quick skim showed I suspected he had the type of flowery, meandering writing style that drives me batty. Turns out, he strikes a wonderful balance between story telling and science. It leans more storytelling - I could go for a dash more science - but it does make for enjoyable and interesting reading."

I felt a wave of love - for the children, for the forest, for the island, for the whole scene; I had a sense of paradise, of an almost magical reality. I thought, I have arrived. I am here at last.

Little time is spent on the actual colorblindness, which is the primary reason for picking up this book, the secondary reason was that is was by Oliver Sacks. It was misleading in that I thought that book was going to fixate on the colorblind, or at least their island, but it's only a third (roughly) of the book, we then wander to Guam to learn about a mystery disease, and then on to Rota for the cycads. At times these additional subjects were fascinating, occasionally getting bogged down in jargon -- although that was partially expected -- and at times I just reached my limit for caring, my interest for the additional subjects were not of his depth."

When he is in neurology mode, talking about the inherited color blindness of the title, or a mysterious island syndrome mimicking ALS or Parkinson's but not quite like either, the book is good, though not as compelling as Sacks' other works. But too much is the book is a sort of travelogue, and this just wasn't very interesting. It felt like he had to deliver a book to his publisher, and filled it up with somewhat pedestrian stuff. Also, like another reviewer mentioned, the footnote strategy of this book adds to the disjointed feeling. The footnotes are long and digressive; they're like mini-essays loosely related to the text. I gave up flipping between notes and text, and just read the notes at the end, which actually worked okay. "

96,0375700730,http://goodreads.com/user/show/30281185-sajith-kumar,3,"Islands are unique in many ways. The separation guaranteed by the vastness of the sea ensures subtle changes in the language and culture of the societies inhabiting them and the mainland, even though one is an offspring of the other. Not only in sociocultural mores, the isolation brings about genetic changes in the people, animals and plants. This was observed and characterized in great detail by none other than Charles Darwin himself, by his famous voyage around the globe in HMS Beagle. The rate of changes accumulated in the genome in response to natural selection against local conditions prevailing in an island will be far greater than that on the mainland. Darwin was amazed and encouraged by the sharp evolutionary changes he observed on the Galapagos Islands, which finally led to his theory of evolution. With this in the background, we turn to this book that showcases two remote islands in the Pacific Ocean, distant thousands of miles from the continents, in which two grotesque illnesses are widely prevalent in the indigenous populations. In Pingelap, total colour-blindness is fairly common, and in Guam, a neurological disease called lytico-bodig, that exhibits symptoms of Parkinsonism and paralysis affects a section of the populace born before 1945. The author visits these islands in turn, muses on them and the probable causes. Oliver Sacks is a physician and the author of many books. Born in London and educated at Oxford, he now lives in New York where he is Professor of Neurology and Psychiatry at Columbia University.There are many places in the world where first cousin marriage is common. In many parts of India itself, this was the norm before education and better living standards threw open the door to the outside world to those languishing in fetid superstition. Science has categorically outlined the dangers of inbreeding including widespread prevalence of genetic disorders, to mention nothing about the eventual impoverishment of the gene pool. Genetic diseases are marked often by recessive genes. Since every person possesses two sets of genes inherited from the father and mother, if one copy of the gene is healthy, the recessive gene stays dormant, without causing its harmful effects. The person with one faulty gene acts as a carrier of the disease, but the ailment itself will not be expressed in his body. When too much breeding occurs between people who are closely related, the chances of an offspring getting two copies of the recessive gene heightens. The higher than normal incidence of lunacy and other genetic defects observed in Kerala’s matrilineal society of the previous centuries may be taken note of. Pingelap Atoll’s people had to pass through a natural catastrophe that forced them to resort to inbreeding as a case of necessity. This paradise-like atoll in the middle of the Pacific vastness was hit by a huge typhoon in 1775. Most of the inhabitants perished. Out of the thousand or so dwellers, around twenty, mainly from the chief’s family, survived. The population slowly picked up over the decades, but the harmful effects of inbreeding began to tell heavily on the society’s well being. The loss of colour vision, called achromatopsia, spread among the descendants. The patients lacked all sense of colour, losing the cone cells in the retina which distinguishes colour. They depend only on the rod cells, which normal people use to see in darkness. As a result, people suffering from the disorder find it difficult to fully open their eyes in bright sunlight. This is accompanied by squint. Some semblance to normal human eyes can be generated by the liberal use of dark sunglasses. There is no cure for the disease as yet. Among the general population in other parts of the world, the rate of incidence is 1 in 30,000 whereas it is an astounding 1 in 12 in Pingelap.Sacks presents another startling phenomenon from Guam Island in the Pacific, which falls under U.S. administration. It is a U.S. military base, with a large area of the island out of bounds for ordinary citizens. The indigenous people in this lovely tropical island is afflicted with a paralyzing sickness called lytico-bodig, somewhat related to encephalitis lethargica. The sufferers show symptoms of Parkinson’s disease or display extreme inability to move muscles or speak. The disease worsens progressively, and finally kills the patient. This disease affects only the indigenous people of the island. The cause of this ailment is still shrouded in mystery. The chapter offers an absorbing discussion on the probable causes of the disease. A strong contender is the cycad plant found in large numbers on the island, whose seeds are eaten by the people as a source of protein during droughts or famines. This was widely used during the Second World War when the island was under Japanese occupation and the local people were mercilessly starved. The highest incidence of the malady was on the people born during the war years when all they had to eat was the cycad seeds. After the island was retaken by American troops, matters returned to normalcy. There has not been a single case of lytico-bodig on the people born after the event. The cycad plant contains a neurotoxin that may be responsible for the deleterious effects, but elaborate preparation of the seed before consumption takes care of removing most of the toxin. Scientists posit that genetic predisposition and deficiency of minerals rich in calcium and aluminium may also explain the phenomenon. The last word has not been said yet.The book is not just about diseases and cycads alone. It narrates a really adventurous travel to the beautiful Pacific islands. To reach Pohnpei, Sacks had to undergo some anxious hours in the form of a damaged plane tyre. Many of the islands in the Pacific are controlled by U.S. military. Repairs to the plane were carried out in a military base and the passengers were grudgingly allowed to stay on the island under the watchful eyes of the soldiers – a prospect equally disliked by both parties. The author gives a thrilling description of his journeys on the islands and the heaven-like beaches ideal for swimming or snorkeling. His revulsion to military bureaucracy is evident in more than one place in the book. Guam is a pretty island, but most of the prettiest beaches are under military control. Access is granted after thorough interrogation and that too, after forcing the visitors to wait for hours. But the author has not proposed exposure to radioactivity or other military-related causes for the spread of lytico-bodig.An illuminating discussion on ancient plants like ferns and cycads that still exist in the world is also presented as a bonus. Apparently, this was facilitated by his visit to Rota Island, near Guam. This book includes a huge section of Notes that runs to about a third of the book. But they are very informative and readers don’t feel interrupted from the main story even though they have to frequently refer to these elaborate pieces of information. Nice sketches of the trees and plants are very apt to the theme. An expansive bibliography and index add to the attraction of the book. The book was first published nearly twenty years ago, and that may be why he has not included the names of those genes that cause the diseases. Not that the readers get any wiser by a cryptic acronym, but it contributes to a feeling that the malady is being studied in detail by the academia and pharma.The book is highly recommended."
97,0375700730,http://goodreads.com/user/show/75006997-mo,2,"2,4 stars. After reading 'The Man Who Mistook His Wife For A Hat' by this writer, I had really high expectations for this book. I thought there would be a lot of interesting conversations with patients and notes from Sacks in which he seems to emphasize with them. But this book was really boring and formal, and sometimes the nature seemed more important to Sacks than the people he meets on his journey (1). A really spiritual atmosphere was also central, which I didn't like so much. In the end, it felt more like a travelogue than a report from a neurologist.Maybe the book was professional and informative, but it just wasn't what I hoped and/or expected. Still two stars, because the second half of the book was more interesting; there were more conversations with patients and insights in the sickness Sacks is trying to understand (2). (1) ""There was a large cantilevered bridge-ornate, gaudy, startling-spanning a gulch as the main road entered town. I had no idea of its history or function; it was as absurd, in its way, as the transplanted London Bridge in Arizona - but it looked festive, fun, as it leapt into the air, a pure effervescence of high spirits.""(2) (about ALS-patients) "".. to see all this and feel you can do nothing, absolutely nothing, to help them.

102,0375700730,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4443481-sarah-beth,3,"In this work of non-fiction, neurologist Oliver Sacks describes his visits to the Micronesian island of Pingelap and later to Guam to investigate the effects of isolation on the incidence of neurological disorders in the small, island communities. In Pingelap, he investigates the large percentage of the population who suffer from total colorblindness, relying instead on pattern and shadows. In Guam, he visits patients suffering from a mysterious neurodegenerative paralysis whose cause has not been uncovered, even as the incidence of the disease seems to have disappeared in the younger generations. It's thought that achromatopsia, or total colorblindness accompanied by extreme sensitivity to light, originated in Pingelap in 1775, when a typhoon killed 90% of the island's population, leaving most of the survivors to die of starvation since most of the plants on the island were also destroyed. Only twenty or so survived but as this small group of survivors attempted to repopulate the island, ""genetic traits previously rare began to spread, so that in the fourth generation after the typhoon a 'new' disease showed itself. The first children with the Pingelap eye disease were born in the 1820s, and within a few generations their numbers had increased to more than five percent of the population"" (37). Elsewhere in the world, the incidence is less than one in 30,000 but on Pingelap it is one in 12. The greatest effects of this disorder, on an island community that cannot seek even basic accommodations like sunglasses, are social. Most sufferers never learn to read, because they cannot see the teacher's writing on the board. Additionally, they are less likely to marry because of a wish not to pass on the disorder and they cannot work outdoors, which limits their options in an already small island economy. In Guam, the effects of the prevalent neurological disorder is much more devastating. ""A tenth of all the adult Chamorro deaths on Guam were due to the disease, and its prevalence was at least a hundred times greater than on the mainland (in some villages, like Umatac, it was over four hundred times greater). Puzzlingly, the disease affects individuals differently, with affected family members exhibiting wildly different symptoms. Some suffered from profound mental and physical slowing and profound immobility. Others had tremors and rigidity. Even more curious, younger generations no longer seem to fall victim to this curious and fatal disease. Although many theories have been postulated for its origins, including consumption of certain species of local plants, no definitive explanation has been achieved. Similarly to my conclusions after reading An Anthropologist on Mars, I wondered what the intended takeaway is for the reader other than to describe these curious island maladies before they are corrected by time and exposure to a widening genetic pool. Sacks offers no solutions or treatments for the maladies explored in this book. Instead this book reads more like a travel narrative, recounting anecdotes of curiosities encountered on his journey, than a medical book shedding light on neurological conditions. This book reads almost like a rambling conversation with Sacks about his impressions after visiting the islands. Similarly, I found the final chapter of the book, which is devoted solely to island plants, and cycads in particular, sort of random. Although cycads have been thought to cause the neurological disorder found in Guam, the chapter does not connect back to the disorder in any way. However, despite this purely descriptive and rambling nature of the book, I found the neurological disorders he explores fascinating. Only on genetically isolated islands can such genetic anomalies arise. ""But islands open up, people die or intermarry; genetic attenuation sets in, and the condition disappears. The life of such a genetic disease in an isolate tends to be six or eight generations, two hundred years perhaps, and then it vanishes, as do its memories and traces, lost in the ongoing stream of time"" (177). 3.5 Stars"

104,0375700730,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5636777-kevin,3,"Dr. Sacks travels to pacific islands in this book. it’s really more of travel log whereas other books of his could be described as medical histories which focus on neurological disorders or peculiarities, this one focuses more on the society and geography of the places than the diseases/afflictions he went there to study.as always, his writing is amiable yet descriptive but the lack of focus in this book kept me from seeing a real point other than the publishing of a memoir of his time in these places. interesting maybe but without much substance. especially since the book is really two books: one about the island of the colorblind (ie a high percentage of the population is achromatopic) and the other about an affliction or disease on Guam that mimics Parkinson’s and may be caused somehow by the prolific species of cycads on the island. apparently, this notion has been around since the 1960s but never proven beyond a doubt. Sacks went there to see what he could figure out.there exists a thin but vital underlying thread of science tribalism and territoriality in the book. Sacks notes how the medical conditions in both parts of the book attract ambitious physician-scientists looking to solve the mystery and make a name for themselves. this is especially present in the latter book on cycads where researchers are seen covering up information sources, skewing and misreporting data, and blackballing heretics from their bailiwick field because, frankly, who’s around to know better? it seems claustrophobic to attempt to practice medicine or research on this remote islands where large, determined personalities can easily dominate by controlling and projecting a carefully crafted outward image. but like i said, this was a significant but nearly ephemeral theme running through Sacks’s narrative- it was not his main purpose to expose this kind of politics in science, he was simply relating the trials and tribulations of doing research in these isolated places and painted an accurate picture.like any good scholar/journalist, Sacks adds a metric ton of notes to his work to flesh out small points he wants to make and to provide references for his ramblings. i’ve always seen the excessive use of notes (both end- and foot-) as lazy writing. if it’s so very important that you need to take up pages for these notes, why can’t you incorporate it into your narrative and be done with the notes? i always have in my own work and it makes for a much smoother and enjoyable read. having said that, i think Sacks’s writing is “lazy” only in the sense that he was driven and didn’t much care to make his way as a polished, eloquent author. he wanted to say something and he did - then he would add asides as he thought of them to deepen and enrich the model of events he was building. in other words, i don’t see him using notes as though they are expected as many scholarly writers do; he used them because he was sitting round a campfire telling stories and kept thinking of more interesting things to say. “this happened and then - I ALMOST FORGOT!- this other thing happened, too!”"
105,0375700730,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1261617-jeroen,4,"About a third of my copy of The Island of the Colour-blind is taken up by notes and the index - I think that might be a record in my collection, apart from academic works. It's tempting to say this tells us something about the writer, Oliver Sacks. In the preface he writes that after writing the book in one fell swoop, it ended up growing ""like an unruly cycad."" To keep the pristinity of the main narrative, as it were, the notes were used, and one note can sometimes go on for three or four pages.I do think it's telling of the author. What defines Sacks is not only his renowned capacity for empathy, but also the breadth of his writing, which seems to situate itself on the crossroads of literature and medicine and is in this still (perhaps surprisingly) unique. Though there are many novels that play themselves out in hospitals, as well as medical literature meant for popular consumption, these are usually written in only one of the particular idioms. Sacks seems to be special in being able to write with the narratival grasp of a novelist and the scientific eye of a doctor.This also necessarily opens him up for critique. The literary reader might find the episode on the history of the lytico-bodig disease to be overlong, whereas the neurologist might not care so much for the scene setting and elaborate description, for what we might call the gravy of narratival writing - extraskeletal, perhaps, might be a good crossdisciplinary word here.I am certainly in the former group, and found the story on achromatopsia far more interesting. The curious quality of this quote-unquote disease - full colour-blindness - is that, the way deafness can free up one's brain for extrasensitive vision, so can lack of colour. And while one shouldn't go as far as to envy the achromatopsian - a kind of parallel false yearning as the one towards an age where our media streamed in sepiatonal - the spoilt first-world brat that I am couldn't help but dream of experiencing it just for a few hours.The other attraction here is the Pacific setting, and it struck me that it must be an odd place to have been over the twentieth century. There are hardly inhabitable places in the world that are more remote, and that will consequently feel more remote, and yet these islands have continually been drawn into something that happened far away from them. This is kind of heartbreaking, but also kind of beautiful - the island as a strange palimpsest forever re-written by the busy doings of all these self-important countries, and I'd like to picture the autochthonous islanders slowly shaking their heads, waving a limp arm in the direction of their new rulers, and ambling away. I would like to picture that, but that would be a lie: they suffered horribly in every consequent invasion of the supposedly cultured West, and the continued presence of military bases on these islands makes it not at all unlikely that more is still in store for them.To be honest I find that the ultimate sadness of globalisation: increasingly there is, it seems, nowhere left to really ""get away from it all""."

The first part of the book is about a medical syndrome called Achromatopsia (results in total colorblindness) on the Micronesian Atoll of Pingelap. The second half of the book is about mystery, of Lytico-Bodig disease in Guam.A neurologist travels to a Micronesian island called Pingelap, where ten percent of the population is completely colorblind, this is a rare medical syndrome called, achromatopsia. Hundreds of years ago the island was wiped out by a typhoon killing many residents, they began to repopulate, but the father of the island carried a gene for achromatopsia that eventually spread out to the population of Pingelap. Oliver Sacks is fascinated by this island and he was very excited to learn about their culture and daily lives. Sacks brought along with him a man named Knut who had been color blind since birth. Knut required a magnifying glass for close up reading and monoculars for distance reading, also he is very sensitive to light so he wore three pairs of sunglasses. Knut and Oliver Sacks discovered that the people with achromatopsia on the island required these same objects in order to see better, but the didn’t have the resources for these necessities. The two “researchers” have a great time in Pingelap and were very upset when they had to leave.In the second part of the book, Oliver Sacks travels to Guam and learns about Lytico-Bodig disease, “The disease resembles Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS), Parkinson's disease, and Alzheimer's.[3] First reports of the disease surfaced in three death certificates on Guam in 1904”. Sacks has a difficult time finding a solution to the disease with other scientists, it is very puzzling throughout the entire story for him. Sacks does have a theory that the disease could be caused by eating the fruits of the cycads, that are today known as common ferns and sage palms. The natives have to carefully prepare the fruits and wash away the alkalines. In the end, he doesn’t find a solution but he has learned a great deal of information. I would recommend this book to anyone who is interested in learning about islands and are interested in medical issues. I somewhat enjoyed this book because, while it did give a lot of interesting information, the book was difficult to follow. For example, after each paragraph the author would change the topic, there wasn’t a good flow when reading. There was also some terminology that the average reader wouldn’t know about, but there was an index at the of the book, which was helpful. Overall, it was a good book, but there are only specific people that will enjoy it. "
107,0375700730,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3915142-garrett-haynes,5,"This is my first reading of Oliver Sacks and I thoroughly enjoyed it. I love his mixture of science, mystery, medicine, wonder, awe and adventure. Sure there are times where he expresses contorted western views of the natives but it is hard to escape our own world views that are shaped by living as westerners, not as islanders. Oliver honestly expresses his musings and I appreciate that especially since many of them are so interesting. The varied content of this book was unexpected but more and more welcomed as he lands on each new island full of endemic plants and endemic diseases. It is hard not to be fascinated by the juxtaposition between the various expressions of the lytico-bodig and also the various species of cycads. Even more so by their likely but yet unprovable link. It is sad to know of the devastating effect our western nations have had on these people and their islands. Disease, oppression, slavery, murder, Destruction of their rich cultural heritage, and the Extinction of birds and plants. Our human nature is to explore and we all love stories of explorers and adventurers. Even the natives themselves ventured to these islands themselves centuries ago, likely spurred by the same desire for new worlds as the European explorers. However, they were able to integrate with the island whereas we have a tendency to consume the worlds we discover. I am not suggesting we all start living in huts again and only eating what we catch ourselves but we can learn from the natives ability to coexist with their environment rather than consume it.I have always wanted to have a more intellectual and scientific life and maybe I will grow more toward that, I hope I will. Reading a book like this stokes these desires and you can bet I will be checking out more of Ollie's books from the library. "

Full cases of color blindness (achromatopsia) are hard to come by, yet in some micronesian islands there are large percentages of full cases. He also recounts a mysterious illness on the islands that onlyaffects people who were born or visited there in the 40's. People born there after 52 did not come down with either of the two various forms it takes (neurdegenerative akin to parkinsonia).His asides on the cycads are interesting. Some have countless ways ofpropagating in very ingenious ways.Another interesting side is the love of SPAM, which was introduced in the 40's. Grocery stores have (had?) aisles of it. In a mainly seafood and vegetarian society it seemed odd to have this fixation on such a meat by-product. His one observation was that in borneo SPAM was to be seen as the closest meat product with a taste and texture to long pig, or human flesh. Pig being the second runner up. The strange note was that Micronesia doesn't have a history of cannibalism. So, eat up you SPAM lovers!"
109,0375700730,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5929851-robert-kosara,4,"Good book, with lots of what Sacks does best: telling stories. It's really two books: one about the island (well, two) where there are large populations of achromatopes: people with no color perception at all. He describes how they live and cope, and there's lots of his personal ideas mixed in.The second half is about Guam and the strange disease that is common there, which is not unlike the post-encaphilitic parkinsonism he describes at length in Awakenings. It feels a bit like cheating: oh, so as I was checking out the nearby islands, I found this place that just happened to have a weird disease that perfectly matches my expertise! But his writing is great, the story of the strangely-named disease is fascinating, and it makes for a very satisfying book overall (especially if you've read Awakenings).Oh, and it's also about another one of his obsessions: botany, and in particular cycads. They play an important role, too. There's a beautiful epilogue of sorts that describes his experience of the jungle and the cycads that has nothing to do with the topic of the book, but is simply great.As usual, skip the million-or-so notes, they just interrupt the flow of the story. Luckily, they're at the end of the book, so they don't get in the way at all."

As always, Sacks keeps the patient in the forefront in writing their case histories; one gets a sense of what it might feel to be someone with such a rare yet terrible affliction. Sack's gestalt portrait of each patient paints them organically - more than just an acronym or a collection of neurological maladies. All of this serves as a background to solving the decade long puzzle of rare neurological disorders by systematically incorporating knowledge from disparate disciplines, a feat which Sacks achieves deft zeal, one hardly feels one is reading a case study. Although I don't share the author's interest in cycads and the other plants he describes over many pages, his enthusiasm and passionate description of them is contagious. The picture he paints of the various islands traveled to in the book was equally vivid, such that I found myself wanting to visit them.

The first half of the book is a study of a group of natives to islands in the Pacific where around 10% of the population is colorblind. It is more than just a neurological picture of them, it is also a cultural picture of how these people cope with their sight issues. Sacks does a great job of drawing you into the story of this group of people. The second half of the book is also about a population of people living on a couple of islands in the Pacific. This group of people have a neurological disorder similar to those in Awakenings. This part of the book is more technical, and not as easy to read for a lay-person, but still interesting. "
112,0375700730,http://goodreads.com/user/show/46722444-olga-werby,5,"In the book “The Island of the Colorblind,” Dr. Oliver Sacks describes his adventures through a series of islands in Micronesia, which have an unusually high percentage of congenital achromatopsia (sever colorblindness) among the population. One of his traveling companions was a Norwegian scientist, Knut Nordby, an achromatope himself. Dr. Nordby described how his rather rare condition affected his early education. In addition to complete color blindness, congenital achromatopsia causes extreme sensitivity to bright light and poor visual acuity. Dr. Nordby’s condition was diagnosed early, and since his vision was thought too poor to learn to read, he was sent to the school for the blind. But he hated Braille and used his sight to decipher the shadows on the page made by the raised bumps. He “cheated” at Braille and was caught. His teachers punished him for using his eyes to read and made him wear a blindfold in class. Dr. Nordby ran away from that school and eventually taught himself to read printed words and became a successful psychologist."
113,0375700730,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6732556-joe-silber,3,"Fairly different from other books by Sacks that I have read; it contains (in addition to the medical studies and mysteries that you would expect) island travelogue, botany, and a touch of autobiography, all written in Sacks' familiar warm, literate style. It is split into two main sections (plus a brief epilogue) both involving islands - the first half covers the titular Island of the Colorblind, Pingelap, while the second half discusses the mysterious lytico-bodig disease found among natives of Guam. As always, Sacks' writing is excellent, and I found the book interesting and readable (only occasional sloggy bits, usually found in the copious footnote entries) but ultimately I felt like it was a little bit padded and indulgent (despite the short length), and that more trim, tightly-edited versions of these stories belonged as part of a longer book like Sacks' ""Anthropologist on Mars""."

Both center around islands where the populations have surprisingly high occurrences of certain medical conditions. As the title suggests, one of those conditions colorblindness. Not standard colorblindness either, but a complete inability to see any color. The second is neurological disease with similarities to Parkinsons, ALS, and dementia. Mixed in both books, but mainly the second, is some history of plants. Mostly cycads.This was my first book by Oliver Sacks, and I think I'd happily pick up any of his other books now. I was interested because he's a neuroligist, but wary because a quick skim showed I suspected he had the type of flowery, meandering writing style that drives me batty. Turns out, he strikes a wonderful balance between story telling and science. It leans more storytelling - I could go for a dash more science - but it does make for enjoyable and interesting reading."
115,0375700730,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1527994-nora,3,"Sacks writes a pretty scientific account of his Micronesian tour, which I guess I can't criticize. The guy's a neurologist.

I felt a wave of love - for the children, for the forest, for the island, for the whole scene; I had a sense of paradise, of an almost magical reality. I thought, I have arrived. I am here at last.

Little time is spent on the actual colorblindness, which is the primary reason for picking up this book, the secondary reason was that is was by Oliver Sacks. It was misleading in that I thought that book was going to fixate on the colorblind, or at least their island, but it's only a third (roughly) of the book, we then wander to Guam to learn about a mystery disease, and then on to Rota for the cycads. At times these additional subjects were fascinating, occasionally getting bogged down in jargon -- although that was partially expected -- and at times I just reached my limit for caring, my interest for the additional subjects were not of his depth."

When he is in neurology mode, talking about the inherited color blindness of the title, or a mysterious island syndrome mimicking ALS or Parkinson's but not quite like either, the book is good, though not as compelling as Sacks' other works. But too much is the book is a sort of travelogue, and this just wasn't very interesting. It felt like he had to deliver a book to his publisher, and filled it up with somewhat pedestrian stuff. Also, like another reviewer mentioned, the footnote strategy of this book adds to the disjointed feeling. The footnotes are long and digressive; they're like mini-essays loosely related to the text. I gave up flipping between notes and text, and just read the notes at the end, which actually worked okay. "

While the cause(s) have never been determined, the prevalence seems to be diminishing over time.The pieces are well written and interesting, and probably a higher rating, but for whatever the book did not have that magic that brings me to give more stars."

126,0375700730,http://goodreads.com/user/show/30281185-sajith-kumar,3,"Islands are unique in many ways. The separation guaranteed by the vastness of the sea ensures subtle changes in the language and culture of the societies inhabiting them and the mainland, even though one is an offspring of the other. Not only in sociocultural mores, the isolation brings about genetic changes in the people, animals and plants. This was observed and characterized in great detail by none other than Charles Darwin himself, by his famous voyage around the globe in HMS Beagle. The rate of changes accumulated in the genome in response to natural selection against local conditions prevailing in an island will be far greater than that on the mainland. Darwin was amazed and encouraged by the sharp evolutionary changes he observed on the Galapagos Islands, which finally led to his theory of evolution. With this in the background, we turn to this book that showcases two remote islands in the Pacific Ocean, distant thousands of miles from the continents, in which two grotesque illnesses are widely prevalent in the indigenous populations. In Pingelap, total colour-blindness is fairly common, and in Guam, a neurological disease called lytico-bodig, that exhibits symptoms of Parkinsonism and paralysis affects a section of the populace born before 1945. The author visits these islands in turn, muses on them and the probable causes. Oliver Sacks is a physician and the author of many books. Born in London and educated at Oxford, he now lives in New York where he is Professor of Neurology and Psychiatry at Columbia University.There are many places in the world where first cousin marriage is common. In many parts of India itself, this was the norm before education and better living standards threw open the door to the outside world to those languishing in fetid superstition. Science has categorically outlined the dangers of inbreeding including widespread prevalence of genetic disorders, to mention nothing about the eventual impoverishment of the gene pool. Genetic diseases are marked often by recessive genes. Since every person possesses two sets of genes inherited from the father and mother, if one copy of the gene is healthy, the recessive gene stays dormant, without causing its harmful effects. The person with one faulty gene acts as a carrier of the disease, but the ailment itself will not be expressed in his body. When too much breeding occurs between people who are closely related, the chances of an offspring getting two copies of the recessive gene heightens. The higher than normal incidence of lunacy and other genetic defects observed in Kerala’s matrilineal society of the previous centuries may be taken note of. Pingelap Atoll’s people had to pass through a natural catastrophe that forced them to resort to inbreeding as a case of necessity. This paradise-like atoll in the middle of the Pacific vastness was hit by a huge typhoon in 1775. Most of the inhabitants perished. Out of the thousand or so dwellers, around twenty, mainly from the chief’s family, survived. The population slowly picked up over the decades, but the harmful effects of inbreeding began to tell heavily on the society’s well being. The loss of colour vision, called achromatopsia, spread among the descendants. The patients lacked all sense of colour, losing the cone cells in the retina which distinguishes colour. They depend only on the rod cells, which normal people use to see in darkness. As a result, people suffering from the disorder find it difficult to fully open their eyes in bright sunlight. This is accompanied by squint. Some semblance to normal human eyes can be generated by the liberal use of dark sunglasses. There is no cure for the disease as yet. Among the general population in other parts of the world, the rate of incidence is 1 in 30,000 whereas it is an astounding 1 in 12 in Pingelap.Sacks presents another startling phenomenon from Guam Island in the Pacific, which falls under U.S. administration. It is a U.S. military base, with a large area of the island out of bounds for ordinary citizens. The indigenous people in this lovely tropical island is afflicted with a paralyzing sickness called lytico-bodig, somewhat related to encephalitis lethargica. The sufferers show symptoms of Parkinson’s disease or display extreme inability to move muscles or speak. The disease worsens progressively, and finally kills the patient. This disease affects only the indigenous people of the island. The cause of this ailment is still shrouded in mystery. The chapter offers an absorbing discussion on the probable causes of the disease. A strong contender is the cycad plant found in large numbers on the island, whose seeds are eaten by the people as a source of protein during droughts or famines. This was widely used during the Second World War when the island was under Japanese occupation and the local people were mercilessly starved. The highest incidence of the malady was on the people born during the war years when all they had to eat was the cycad seeds. After the island was retaken by American troops, matters returned to normalcy. There has not been a single case of lytico-bodig on the people born after the event. The cycad plant contains a neurotoxin that may be responsible for the deleterious effects, but elaborate preparation of the seed before consumption takes care of removing most of the toxin. Scientists posit that genetic predisposition and deficiency of minerals rich in calcium and aluminium may also explain the phenomenon. The last word has not been said yet.The book is not just about diseases and cycads alone. It narrates a really adventurous travel to the beautiful Pacific islands. To reach Pohnpei, Sacks had to undergo some anxious hours in the form of a damaged plane tyre. Many of the islands in the Pacific are controlled by U.S. military. Repairs to the plane were carried out in a military base and the passengers were grudgingly allowed to stay on the island under the watchful eyes of the soldiers – a prospect equally disliked by both parties. The author gives a thrilling description of his journeys on the islands and the heaven-like beaches ideal for swimming or snorkeling. His revulsion to military bureaucracy is evident in more than one place in the book. Guam is a pretty island, but most of the prettiest beaches are under military control. Access is granted after thorough interrogation and that too, after forcing the visitors to wait for hours. But the author has not proposed exposure to radioactivity or other military-related causes for the spread of lytico-bodig.An illuminating discussion on ancient plants like ferns and cycads that still exist in the world is also presented as a bonus. Apparently, this was facilitated by his visit to Rota Island, near Guam. This book includes a huge section of Notes that runs to about a third of the book. But they are very informative and readers don’t feel interrupted from the main story even though they have to frequently refer to these elaborate pieces of information. Nice sketches of the trees and plants are very apt to the theme. An expansive bibliography and index add to the attraction of the book. The book was first published nearly twenty years ago, and that may be why he has not included the names of those genes that cause the diseases. Not that the readers get any wiser by a cryptic acronym, but it contributes to a feeling that the malady is being studied in detail by the academia and pharma.The book is highly recommended."
127,0375700730,http://goodreads.com/user/show/75006997-mo,2,"2,4 stars. After reading 'The Man Who Mistook His Wife For A Hat' by this writer, I had really high expectations for this book. I thought there would be a lot of interesting conversations with patients and notes from Sacks in which he seems to emphasize with them. But this book was really boring and formal, and sometimes the nature seemed more important to Sacks than the people he meets on his journey (1). A really spiritual atmosphere was also central, which I didn't like so much. In the end, it felt more like a travelogue than a report from a neurologist.Maybe the book was professional and informative, but it just wasn't what I hoped and/or expected. Still two stars, because the second half of the book was more interesting; there were more conversations with patients and insights in the sickness Sacks is trying to understand (2). (1) ""There was a large cantilevered bridge-ornate, gaudy, startling-spanning a gulch as the main road entered town. I had no idea of its history or function; it was as absurd, in its way, as the transplanted London Bridge in Arizona - but it looked festive, fun, as it leapt into the air, a pure effervescence of high spirits.""(2) (about ALS-patients) "".. to see all this and feel you can do nothing, absolutely nothing, to help them.

132,0375700730,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4443481-sarah-beth,3,"In this work of non-fiction, neurologist Oliver Sacks describes his visits to the Micronesian island of Pingelap and later to Guam to investigate the effects of isolation on the incidence of neurological disorders in the small, island communities. In Pingelap, he investigates the large percentage of the population who suffer from total colorblindness, relying instead on pattern and shadows. In Guam, he visits patients suffering from a mysterious neurodegenerative paralysis whose cause has not been uncovered, even as the incidence of the disease seems to have disappeared in the younger generations. It's thought that achromatopsia, or total colorblindness accompanied by extreme sensitivity to light, originated in Pingelap in 1775, when a typhoon killed 90% of the island's population, leaving most of the survivors to die of starvation since most of the plants on the island were also destroyed. Only twenty or so survived but as this small group of survivors attempted to repopulate the island, ""genetic traits previously rare began to spread, so that in the fourth generation after the typhoon a 'new' disease showed itself. The first children with the Pingelap eye disease were born in the 1820s, and within a few generations their numbers had increased to more than five percent of the population"" (37). Elsewhere in the world, the incidence is less than one in 30,000 but on Pingelap it is one in 12. The greatest effects of this disorder, on an island community that cannot seek even basic accommodations like sunglasses, are social. Most sufferers never learn to read, because they cannot see the teacher's writing on the board. Additionally, they are less likely to marry because of a wish not to pass on the disorder and they cannot work outdoors, which limits their options in an already small island economy. In Guam, the effects of the prevalent neurological disorder is much more devastating. ""A tenth of all the adult Chamorro deaths on Guam were due to the disease, and its prevalence was at least a hundred times greater than on the mainland (in some villages, like Umatac, it was over four hundred times greater). Puzzlingly, the disease affects individuals differently, with affected family members exhibiting wildly different symptoms. Some suffered from profound mental and physical slowing and profound immobility. Others had tremors and rigidity. Even more curious, younger generations no longer seem to fall victim to this curious and fatal disease. Although many theories have been postulated for its origins, including consumption of certain species of local plants, no definitive explanation has been achieved. Similarly to my conclusions after reading An Anthropologist on Mars, I wondered what the intended takeaway is for the reader other than to describe these curious island maladies before they are corrected by time and exposure to a widening genetic pool. Sacks offers no solutions or treatments for the maladies explored in this book. Instead this book reads more like a travel narrative, recounting anecdotes of curiosities encountered on his journey, than a medical book shedding light on neurological conditions. This book reads almost like a rambling conversation with Sacks about his impressions after visiting the islands. Similarly, I found the final chapter of the book, which is devoted solely to island plants, and cycads in particular, sort of random. Although cycads have been thought to cause the neurological disorder found in Guam, the chapter does not connect back to the disorder in any way. However, despite this purely descriptive and rambling nature of the book, I found the neurological disorders he explores fascinating. Only on genetically isolated islands can such genetic anomalies arise. ""But islands open up, people die or intermarry; genetic attenuation sets in, and the condition disappears. The life of such a genetic disease in an isolate tends to be six or eight generations, two hundred years perhaps, and then it vanishes, as do its memories and traces, lost in the ongoing stream of time"" (177). 3.5 Stars"

134,0375700730,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5636777-kevin,3,"Dr. Sacks travels to pacific islands in this book. it’s really more of travel log whereas other books of his could be described as medical histories which focus on neurological disorders or peculiarities, this one focuses more on the society and geography of the places than the diseases/afflictions he went there to study.as always, his writing is amiable yet descriptive but the lack of focus in this book kept me from seeing a real point other than the publishing of a memoir of his time in these places. interesting maybe but without much substance. especially since the book is really two books: one about the island of the colorblind (ie a high percentage of the population is achromatopic) and the other about an affliction or disease on Guam that mimics Parkinson’s and may be caused somehow by the prolific species of cycads on the island. apparently, this notion has been around since the 1960s but never proven beyond a doubt. Sacks went there to see what he could figure out.there exists a thin but vital underlying thread of science tribalism and territoriality in the book. Sacks notes how the medical conditions in both parts of the book attract ambitious physician-scientists looking to solve the mystery and make a name for themselves. this is especially present in the latter book on cycads where researchers are seen covering up information sources, skewing and misreporting data, and blackballing heretics from their bailiwick field because, frankly, who’s around to know better? it seems claustrophobic to attempt to practice medicine or research on this remote islands where large, determined personalities can easily dominate by controlling and projecting a carefully crafted outward image. but like i said, this was a significant but nearly ephemeral theme running through Sacks’s narrative- it was not his main purpose to expose this kind of politics in science, he was simply relating the trials and tribulations of doing research in these isolated places and painted an accurate picture.like any good scholar/journalist, Sacks adds a metric ton of notes to his work to flesh out small points he wants to make and to provide references for his ramblings. i’ve always seen the excessive use of notes (both end- and foot-) as lazy writing. if it’s so very important that you need to take up pages for these notes, why can’t you incorporate it into your narrative and be done with the notes? i always have in my own work and it makes for a much smoother and enjoyable read. having said that, i think Sacks’s writing is “lazy” only in the sense that he was driven and didn’t much care to make his way as a polished, eloquent author. he wanted to say something and he did - then he would add asides as he thought of them to deepen and enrich the model of events he was building. in other words, i don’t see him using notes as though they are expected as many scholarly writers do; he used them because he was sitting round a campfire telling stories and kept thinking of more interesting things to say. “this happened and then - I ALMOST FORGOT!- this other thing happened, too!”"
135,0375700730,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1261617-jeroen,4,"About a third of my copy of The Island of the Colour-blind is taken up by notes and the index - I think that might be a record in my collection, apart from academic works. It's tempting to say this tells us something about the writer, Oliver Sacks. In the preface he writes that after writing the book in one fell swoop, it ended up growing ""like an unruly cycad."" To keep the pristinity of the main narrative, as it were, the notes were used, and one note can sometimes go on for three or four pages.I do think it's telling of the author. What defines Sacks is not only his renowned capacity for empathy, but also the breadth of his writing, which seems to situate itself on the crossroads of literature and medicine and is in this still (perhaps surprisingly) unique. Though there are many novels that play themselves out in hospitals, as well as medical literature meant for popular consumption, these are usually written in only one of the particular idioms. Sacks seems to be special in being able to write with the narratival grasp of a novelist and the scientific eye of a doctor.This also necessarily opens him up for critique. The literary reader might find the episode on the history of the lytico-bodig disease to be overlong, whereas the neurologist might not care so much for the scene setting and elaborate description, for what we might call the gravy of narratival writing - extraskeletal, perhaps, might be a good crossdisciplinary word here.I am certainly in the former group, and found the story on achromatopsia far more interesting. The curious quality of this quote-unquote disease - full colour-blindness - is that, the way deafness can free up one's brain for extrasensitive vision, so can lack of colour. And while one shouldn't go as far as to envy the achromatopsian - a kind of parallel false yearning as the one towards an age where our media streamed in sepiatonal - the spoilt first-world brat that I am couldn't help but dream of experiencing it just for a few hours.The other attraction here is the Pacific setting, and it struck me that it must be an odd place to have been over the twentieth century. There are hardly inhabitable places in the world that are more remote, and that will consequently feel more remote, and yet these islands have continually been drawn into something that happened far away from them. This is kind of heartbreaking, but also kind of beautiful - the island as a strange palimpsest forever re-written by the busy doings of all these self-important countries, and I'd like to picture the autochthonous islanders slowly shaking their heads, waving a limp arm in the direction of their new rulers, and ambling away. I would like to picture that, but that would be a lie: they suffered horribly in every consequent invasion of the supposedly cultured West, and the continued presence of military bases on these islands makes it not at all unlikely that more is still in store for them.To be honest I find that the ultimate sadness of globalisation: increasingly there is, it seems, nowhere left to really ""get away from it all""."

The first part of the book is about a medical syndrome called Achromatopsia (results in total colorblindness) on the Micronesian Atoll of Pingelap. The second half of the book is about mystery, of Lytico-Bodig disease in Guam.A neurologist travels to a Micronesian island called Pingelap, where ten percent of the population is completely colorblind, this is a rare medical syndrome called, achromatopsia. Hundreds of years ago the island was wiped out by a typhoon killing many residents, they began to repopulate, but the father of the island carried a gene for achromatopsia that eventually spread out to the population of Pingelap. Oliver Sacks is fascinated by this island and he was very excited to learn about their culture and daily lives. Sacks brought along with him a man named Knut who had been color blind since birth. Knut required a magnifying glass for close up reading and monoculars for distance reading, also he is very sensitive to light so he wore three pairs of sunglasses. Knut and Oliver Sacks discovered that the people with achromatopsia on the island required these same objects in order to see better, but the didn’t have the resources for these necessities. The two “researchers” have a great time in Pingelap and were very upset when they had to leave.In the second part of the book, Oliver Sacks travels to Guam and learns about Lytico-Bodig disease, “The disease resembles Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS), Parkinson's disease, and Alzheimer's.[3] First reports of the disease surfaced in three death certificates on Guam in 1904”. Sacks has a difficult time finding a solution to the disease with other scientists, it is very puzzling throughout the entire story for him. Sacks does have a theory that the disease could be caused by eating the fruits of the cycads, that are today known as common ferns and sage palms. The natives have to carefully prepare the fruits and wash away the alkalines. In the end, he doesn’t find a solution but he has learned a great deal of information. I would recommend this book to anyone who is interested in learning about islands and are interested in medical issues. I somewhat enjoyed this book because, while it did give a lot of interesting information, the book was difficult to follow. For example, after each paragraph the author would change the topic, there wasn’t a good flow when reading. There was also some terminology that the average reader wouldn’t know about, but there was an index at the of the book, which was helpful. Overall, it was a good book, but there are only specific people that will enjoy it. "
137,0375700730,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3915142-garrett-haynes,5,"This is my first reading of Oliver Sacks and I thoroughly enjoyed it. I love his mixture of science, mystery, medicine, wonder, awe and adventure. Sure there are times where he expresses contorted western views of the natives but it is hard to escape our own world views that are shaped by living as westerners, not as islanders. Oliver honestly expresses his musings and I appreciate that especially since many of them are so interesting. The varied content of this book was unexpected but more and more welcomed as he lands on each new island full of endemic plants and endemic diseases. It is hard not to be fascinated by the juxtaposition between the various expressions of the lytico-bodig and also the various species of cycads. Even more so by their likely but yet unprovable link. It is sad to know of the devastating effect our western nations have had on these people and their islands. Disease, oppression, slavery, murder, Destruction of their rich cultural heritage, and the Extinction of birds and plants. Our human nature is to explore and we all love stories of explorers and adventurers. Even the natives themselves ventured to these islands themselves centuries ago, likely spurred by the same desire for new worlds as the European explorers. However, they were able to integrate with the island whereas we have a tendency to consume the worlds we discover. I am not suggesting we all start living in huts again and only eating what we catch ourselves but we can learn from the natives ability to coexist with their environment rather than consume it.I have always wanted to have a more intellectual and scientific life and maybe I will grow more toward that, I hope I will. Reading a book like this stokes these desires and you can bet I will be checking out more of Ollie's books from the library. "

Full cases of color blindness (achromatopsia) are hard to come by, yet in some micronesian islands there are large percentages of full cases. He also recounts a mysterious illness on the islands that onlyaffects people who were born or visited there in the 40's. People born there after 52 did not come down with either of the two various forms it takes (neurdegenerative akin to parkinsonia).His asides on the cycads are interesting. Some have countless ways ofpropagating in very ingenious ways.Another interesting side is the love of SPAM, which was introduced in the 40's. Grocery stores have (had?) aisles of it. In a mainly seafood and vegetarian society it seemed odd to have this fixation on such a meat by-product. His one observation was that in borneo SPAM was to be seen as the closest meat product with a taste and texture to long pig, or human flesh. Pig being the second runner up. The strange note was that Micronesia doesn't have a history of cannibalism. So, eat up you SPAM lovers!"
139,0375700730,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5929851-robert-kosara,4,"Good book, with lots of what Sacks does best: telling stories. It's really two books: one about the island (well, two) where there are large populations of achromatopes: people with no color perception at all. He describes how they live and cope, and there's lots of his personal ideas mixed in.The second half is about Guam and the strange disease that is common there, which is not unlike the post-encaphilitic parkinsonism he describes at length in Awakenings. It feels a bit like cheating: oh, so as I was checking out the nearby islands, I found this place that just happened to have a weird disease that perfectly matches my expertise! But his writing is great, the story of the strangely-named disease is fascinating, and it makes for a very satisfying book overall (especially if you've read Awakenings).Oh, and it's also about another one of his obsessions: botany, and in particular cycads. They play an important role, too. There's a beautiful epilogue of sorts that describes his experience of the jungle and the cycads that has nothing to do with the topic of the book, but is simply great.As usual, skip the million-or-so notes, they just interrupt the flow of the story. Luckily, they're at the end of the book, so they don't get in the way at all."

As always, Sacks keeps the patient in the forefront in writing their case histories; one gets a sense of what it might feel to be someone with such a rare yet terrible affliction. Sack's gestalt portrait of each patient paints them organically - more than just an acronym or a collection of neurological maladies. All of this serves as a background to solving the decade long puzzle of rare neurological disorders by systematically incorporating knowledge from disparate disciplines, a feat which Sacks achieves deft zeal, one hardly feels one is reading a case study. Although I don't share the author's interest in cycads and the other plants he describes over many pages, his enthusiasm and passionate description of them is contagious. The picture he paints of the various islands traveled to in the book was equally vivid, such that I found myself wanting to visit them.

The first half of the book is a study of a group of natives to islands in the Pacific where around 10% of the population is colorblind. It is more than just a neurological picture of them, it is also a cultural picture of how these people cope with their sight issues. Sacks does a great job of drawing you into the story of this group of people. The second half of the book is also about a population of people living on a couple of islands in the Pacific. This group of people have a neurological disorder similar to those in Awakenings. This part of the book is more technical, and not as easy to read for a lay-person, but still interesting. "
142,0375700730,http://goodreads.com/user/show/46722444-olga-werby,5,"In the book “The Island of the Colorblind,” Dr. Oliver Sacks describes his adventures through a series of islands in Micronesia, which have an unusually high percentage of congenital achromatopsia (sever colorblindness) among the population. One of his traveling companions was a Norwegian scientist, Knut Nordby, an achromatope himself. Dr. Nordby described how his rather rare condition affected his early education. In addition to complete color blindness, congenital achromatopsia causes extreme sensitivity to bright light and poor visual acuity. Dr. Nordby’s condition was diagnosed early, and since his vision was thought too poor to learn to read, he was sent to the school for the blind. But he hated Braille and used his sight to decipher the shadows on the page made by the raised bumps. He “cheated” at Braille and was caught. His teachers punished him for using his eyes to read and made him wear a blindfold in class. Dr. Nordby ran away from that school and eventually taught himself to read printed words and became a successful psychologist."
143,0375700730,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6732556-joe-silber,3,"Fairly different from other books by Sacks that I have read; it contains (in addition to the medical studies and mysteries that you would expect) island travelogue, botany, and a touch of autobiography, all written in Sacks' familiar warm, literate style. It is split into two main sections (plus a brief epilogue) both involving islands - the first half covers the titular Island of the Colorblind, Pingelap, while the second half discusses the mysterious lytico-bodig disease found among natives of Guam. As always, Sacks' writing is excellent, and I found the book interesting and readable (only occasional sloggy bits, usually found in the copious footnote entries) but ultimately I felt like it was a little bit padded and indulgent (despite the short length), and that more trim, tightly-edited versions of these stories belonged as part of a longer book like Sacks' ""Anthropologist on Mars""."

Both center around islands where the populations have surprisingly high occurrences of certain medical conditions. As the title suggests, one of those conditions colorblindness. Not standard colorblindness either, but a complete inability to see any color. The second is neurological disease with similarities to Parkinsons, ALS, and dementia. Mixed in both books, but mainly the second, is some history of plants. Mostly cycads.This was my first book by Oliver Sacks, and I think I'd happily pick up any of his other books now. I was interested because he's a neuroligist, but wary because a quick skim showed I suspected he had the type of flowery, meandering writing style that drives me batty. Turns out, he strikes a wonderful balance between story telling and science. It leans more storytelling - I could go for a dash more science - but it does make for enjoyable and interesting reading."

I felt a wave of love - for the children, for the forest, for the island, for the whole scene; I had a sense of paradise, of an almost magical reality. I thought, I have arrived. I am here at last.

Little time is spent on the actual colorblindness, which is the primary reason for picking up this book, the secondary reason was that is was by Oliver Sacks. It was misleading in that I thought that book was going to fixate on the colorblind, or at least their island, but it's only a third (roughly) of the book, we then wander to Guam to learn about a mystery disease, and then on to Rota for the cycads. At times these additional subjects were fascinating, occasionally getting bogged down in jargon -- although that was partially expected -- and at times I just reached my limit for caring, my interest for the additional subjects were not of his depth."

When he is in neurology mode, talking about the inherited color blindness of the title, or a mysterious island syndrome mimicking ALS or Parkinson's but not quite like either, the book is good, though not as compelling as Sacks' other works. But too much is the book is a sort of travelogue, and this just wasn't very interesting. It felt like he had to deliver a book to his publisher, and filled it up with somewhat pedestrian stuff. Also, like another reviewer mentioned, the footnote strategy of this book adds to the disjointed feeling. The footnotes are long and digressive; they're like mini-essays loosely related to the text. I gave up flipping between notes and text, and just read the notes at the end, which actually worked okay. "

While the cause(s) have never been determined, the prevalence seems to be diminishing over time.The pieces are well written and interesting, and probably a higher rating, but for whatever the book did not have that magic that brings me to give more stars."

This book reminds me of Bill Brysons A Short History Of Nearly Everything, because of the wrong tracks, solutions that aren't quite right, etc. This is how real science marches forward: not a few individuals making grand discoveries, but scores of people who try and try and try to find an answer, until somebody stands on the shoulders of a giant and finds the solution (and then somebody else refines it, and gets either all of the credit or none at all).But the ending is depressing, especially when you check when this book was written.

156,0375700730,http://goodreads.com/user/show/30281185-sajith-kumar,3,"Islands are unique in many ways. The separation guaranteed by the vastness of the sea ensures subtle changes in the language and culture of the societies inhabiting them and the mainland, even though one is an offspring of the other. Not only in sociocultural mores, the isolation brings about genetic changes in the people, animals and plants. This was observed and characterized in great detail by none other than Charles Darwin himself, by his famous voyage around the globe in HMS Beagle. The rate of changes accumulated in the genome in response to natural selection against local conditions prevailing in an island will be far greater than that on the mainland. Darwin was amazed and encouraged by the sharp evolutionary changes he observed on the Galapagos Islands, which finally led to his theory of evolution. With this in the background, we turn to this book that showcases two remote islands in the Pacific Ocean, distant thousands of miles from the continents, in which two grotesque illnesses are widely prevalent in the indigenous populations. In Pingelap, total colour-blindness is fairly common, and in Guam, a neurological disease called lytico-bodig, that exhibits symptoms of Parkinsonism and paralysis affects a section of the populace born before 1945. The author visits these islands in turn, muses on them and the probable causes. Oliver Sacks is a physician and the author of many books. Born in London and educated at Oxford, he now lives in New York where he is Professor of Neurology and Psychiatry at Columbia University.There are many places in the world where first cousin marriage is common. In many parts of India itself, this was the norm before education and better living standards threw open the door to the outside world to those languishing in fetid superstition. Science has categorically outlined the dangers of inbreeding including widespread prevalence of genetic disorders, to mention nothing about the eventual impoverishment of the gene pool. Genetic diseases are marked often by recessive genes. Since every person possesses two sets of genes inherited from the father and mother, if one copy of the gene is healthy, the recessive gene stays dormant, without causing its harmful effects. The person with one faulty gene acts as a carrier of the disease, but the ailment itself will not be expressed in his body. When too much breeding occurs between people who are closely related, the chances of an offspring getting two copies of the recessive gene heightens. The higher than normal incidence of lunacy and other genetic defects observed in Kerala’s matrilineal society of the previous centuries may be taken note of. Pingelap Atoll’s people had to pass through a natural catastrophe that forced them to resort to inbreeding as a case of necessity. This paradise-like atoll in the middle of the Pacific vastness was hit by a huge typhoon in 1775. Most of the inhabitants perished. Out of the thousand or so dwellers, around twenty, mainly from the chief’s family, survived. The population slowly picked up over the decades, but the harmful effects of inbreeding began to tell heavily on the society’s well being. The loss of colour vision, called achromatopsia, spread among the descendants. The patients lacked all sense of colour, losing the cone cells in the retina which distinguishes colour. They depend only on the rod cells, which normal people use to see in darkness. As a result, people suffering from the disorder find it difficult to fully open their eyes in bright sunlight. This is accompanied by squint. Some semblance to normal human eyes can be generated by the liberal use of dark sunglasses. There is no cure for the disease as yet. Among the general population in other parts of the world, the rate of incidence is 1 in 30,000 whereas it is an astounding 1 in 12 in Pingelap.Sacks presents another startling phenomenon from Guam Island in the Pacific, which falls under U.S. administration. It is a U.S. military base, with a large area of the island out of bounds for ordinary citizens. The indigenous people in this lovely tropical island is afflicted with a paralyzing sickness called lytico-bodig, somewhat related to encephalitis lethargica. The sufferers show symptoms of Parkinson’s disease or display extreme inability to move muscles or speak. The disease worsens progressively, and finally kills the patient. This disease affects only the indigenous people of the island. The cause of this ailment is still shrouded in mystery. The chapter offers an absorbing discussion on the probable causes of the disease. A strong contender is the cycad plant found in large numbers on the island, whose seeds are eaten by the people as a source of protein during droughts or famines. This was widely used during the Second World War when the island was under Japanese occupation and the local people were mercilessly starved. The highest incidence of the malady was on the people born during the war years when all they had to eat was the cycad seeds. After the island was retaken by American troops, matters returned to normalcy. There has not been a single case of lytico-bodig on the people born after the event. The cycad plant contains a neurotoxin that may be responsible for the deleterious effects, but elaborate preparation of the seed before consumption takes care of removing most of the toxin. Scientists posit that genetic predisposition and deficiency of minerals rich in calcium and aluminium may also explain the phenomenon. The last word has not been said yet.The book is not just about diseases and cycads alone. It narrates a really adventurous travel to the beautiful Pacific islands. To reach Pohnpei, Sacks had to undergo some anxious hours in the form of a damaged plane tyre. Many of the islands in the Pacific are controlled by U.S. military. Repairs to the plane were carried out in a military base and the passengers were grudgingly allowed to stay on the island under the watchful eyes of the soldiers – a prospect equally disliked by both parties. The author gives a thrilling description of his journeys on the islands and the heaven-like beaches ideal for swimming or snorkeling. His revulsion to military bureaucracy is evident in more than one place in the book. Guam is a pretty island, but most of the prettiest beaches are under military control. Access is granted after thorough interrogation and that too, after forcing the visitors to wait for hours. But the author has not proposed exposure to radioactivity or other military-related causes for the spread of lytico-bodig.An illuminating discussion on ancient plants like ferns and cycads that still exist in the world is also presented as a bonus. Apparently, this was facilitated by his visit to Rota Island, near Guam. This book includes a huge section of Notes that runs to about a third of the book. But they are very informative and readers don’t feel interrupted from the main story even though they have to frequently refer to these elaborate pieces of information. Nice sketches of the trees and plants are very apt to the theme. An expansive bibliography and index add to the attraction of the book. The book was first published nearly twenty years ago, and that may be why he has not included the names of those genes that cause the diseases. Not that the readers get any wiser by a cryptic acronym, but it contributes to a feeling that the malady is being studied in detail by the academia and pharma.The book is highly recommended."

I thought there would be a lot of interesting conversations with patients and notes from Sacks in which he seems to emphasize with them. But this book was really boring and formal, and sometimes the nature seemed more important to Sacks than the people he meets on his journey (1). A really spiritual atmosphere was also central, which I didn't like so much. In the end, it felt more like a travelogue than a report from a neurologist.Maybe the book was professional and informative, but it just wasn't what I hoped and/or expected. Still two stars, because the second half of the book was more interesting; there were more conversations with patients and insights in the sickness Sacks is trying to understand (2).

162,0375700730,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4443481-sarah-beth,3,"In this work of non-fiction, neurologist Oliver Sacks describes his visits to the Micronesian island of Pingelap and later to Guam to investigate the effects of isolation on the incidence of neurological disorders in the small, island communities. In Pingelap, he investigates the large percentage of the population who suffer from total colorblindness, relying instead on pattern and shadows. In Guam, he visits patients suffering from a mysterious neurodegenerative paralysis whose cause has not been uncovered, even as the incidence of the disease seems to have disappeared in the younger generations. It's thought that achromatopsia, or total colorblindness accompanied by extreme sensitivity to light, originated in Pingelap in 1775, when a typhoon killed 90% of the island's population, leaving most of the survivors to die of starvation since most of the plants on the island were also destroyed. Only twenty or so survived but as this small group of survivors attempted to repopulate the island, ""genetic traits previously rare began to spread, so that in the fourth generation after the typhoon a 'new' disease showed itself. The first children with the Pingelap eye disease were born in the 1820s, and within a few generations their numbers had increased to more than five percent of the population"" (37). Elsewhere in the world, the incidence is less than one in 30,000 but on Pingelap it is one in 12. The greatest effects of this disorder, on an island community that cannot seek even basic accommodations like sunglasses, are social. Most sufferers never learn to read, because they cannot see the teacher's writing on the board. Additionally, they are less likely to marry because of a wish not to pass on the disorder and they cannot work outdoors, which limits their options in an already small island economy. In Guam, the effects of the prevalent neurological disorder is much more devastating. ""A tenth of all the adult Chamorro deaths on Guam were due to the disease, and its prevalence was at least a hundred times greater than on the mainland (in some villages, like Umatac, it was over four hundred times greater). Puzzlingly, the disease affects individuals differently, with affected family members exhibiting wildly different symptoms. Some suffered from profound mental and physical slowing and profound immobility. Others had tremors and rigidity. Even more curious, younger generations no longer seem to fall victim to this curious and fatal disease. Although many theories have been postulated for its origins, including consumption of certain species of local plants, no definitive explanation has been achieved. Similarly to my conclusions after reading An Anthropologist on Mars, I wondered what the intended takeaway is for the reader other than to describe these curious island maladies before they are corrected by time and exposure to a widening genetic pool. Sacks offers no solutions or treatments for the maladies explored in this book. Instead this book reads more like a travel narrative, recounting anecdotes of curiosities encountered on his journey, than a medical book shedding light on neurological conditions. This book reads almost like a rambling conversation with Sacks about his impressions after visiting the islands. Similarly, I found the final chapter of the book, which is devoted solely to island plants, and cycads in particular, sort of random. Although cycads have been thought to cause the neurological disorder found in Guam, the chapter does not connect back to the disorder in any way. However, despite this purely descriptive and rambling nature of the book, I found the neurological disorders he explores fascinating. Only on genetically isolated islands can such genetic anomalies arise. ""But islands open up, people die or intermarry; genetic attenuation sets in, and the condition disappears. The life of such a genetic disease in an isolate tends to be six or eight generations, two hundred years perhaps, and then it vanishes, as do its memories and traces, lost in the ongoing stream of time"" (177). 3.5 Stars"

164,0375700730,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5636777-kevin,3,"Dr. Sacks travels to pacific islands in this book. it’s really more of travel log whereas other books of his could be described as medical histories which focus on neurological disorders or peculiarities, this one focuses more on the society and geography of the places than the diseases/afflictions he went there to study.as always, his writing is amiable yet descriptive but the lack of focus in this book kept me from seeing a real point other than the publishing of a memoir of his time in these places. interesting maybe but without much substance. especially since the book is really two books: one about the island of the colorblind (ie a high percentage of the population is achromatopic) and the other about an affliction or disease on Guam that mimics Parkinson’s and may be caused somehow by the prolific species of cycads on the island. apparently, this notion has been around since the 1960s but never proven beyond a doubt. Sacks went there to see what he could figure out.there exists a thin but vital underlying thread of science tribalism and territoriality in the book. Sacks notes how the medical conditions in both parts of the book attract ambitious physician-scientists looking to solve the mystery and make a name for themselves. this is especially present in the latter book on cycads where researchers are seen covering up information sources, skewing and misreporting data, and blackballing heretics from their bailiwick field because, frankly, who’s around to know better? it seems claustrophobic to attempt to practice medicine or research on this remote islands where large, determined personalities can easily dominate by controlling and projecting a carefully crafted outward image. but like i said, this was a significant but nearly ephemeral theme running through Sacks’s narrative- it was not his main purpose to expose this kind of politics in science, he was simply relating the trials and tribulations of doing research in these isolated places and painted an accurate picture.like any good scholar/journalist, Sacks adds a metric ton of notes to his work to flesh out small points he wants to make and to provide references for his ramblings. i’ve always seen the excessive use of notes (both end- and foot-) as lazy writing. if it’s so very important that you need to take up pages for these notes, why can’t you incorporate it into your narrative and be done with the notes? i always have in my own work and it makes for a much smoother and enjoyable read. having said that, i think Sacks’s writing is “lazy” only in the sense that he was driven and didn’t much care to make his way as a polished, eloquent author. he wanted to say something and he did - then he would add asides as he thought of them to deepen and enrich the model of events he was building. in other words, i don’t see him using notes as though they are expected as many scholarly writers do; he used them because he was sitting round a campfire telling stories and kept thinking of more interesting things to say. “this happened and then - I ALMOST FORGOT!- this other thing happened, too!”"
165,0375700730,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1261617-jeroen,4,"About a third of my copy of The Island of the Colour-blind is taken up by notes and the index - I think that might be a record in my collection, apart from academic works. It's tempting to say this tells us something about the writer, Oliver Sacks. In the preface he writes that after writing the book in one fell swoop, it ended up growing ""like an unruly cycad."" To keep the pristinity of the main narrative, as it were, the notes were used, and one note can sometimes go on for three or four pages.I do think it's telling of the author. What defines Sacks is not only his renowned capacity for empathy, but also the breadth of his writing, which seems to situate itself on the crossroads of literature and medicine and is in this still (perhaps surprisingly) unique. Though there are many novels that play themselves out in hospitals, as well as medical literature meant for popular consumption, these are usually written in only one of the particular idioms. Sacks seems to be special in being able to write with the narratival grasp of a novelist and the scientific eye of a doctor.This also necessarily opens him up for critique. The literary reader might find the episode on the history of the lytico-bodig disease to be overlong, whereas the neurologist might not care so much for the scene setting and elaborate description, for what we might call the gravy of narratival writing - extraskeletal, perhaps, might be a good crossdisciplinary word here.I am certainly in the former group, and found the story on achromatopsia far more interesting. The curious quality of this quote-unquote disease - full colour-blindness - is that, the way deafness can free up one's brain for extrasensitive vision, so can lack of colour. And while one shouldn't go as far as to envy the achromatopsian - a kind of parallel false yearning as the one towards an age where our media streamed in sepiatonal - the spoilt first-world brat that I am couldn't help but dream of experiencing it just for a few hours.The other attraction here is the Pacific setting, and it struck me that it must be an odd place to have been over the twentieth century. There are hardly inhabitable places in the world that are more remote, and that will consequently feel more remote, and yet these islands have continually been drawn into something that happened far away from them. This is kind of heartbreaking, but also kind of beautiful - the island as a strange palimpsest forever re-written by the busy doings of all these self-important countries, and I'd like to picture the autochthonous islanders slowly shaking their heads, waving a limp arm in the direction of their new rulers, and ambling away. I would like to picture that, but that would be a lie: they suffered horribly in every consequent invasion of the supposedly cultured West, and the continued presence of military bases on these islands makes it not at all unlikely that more is still in store for them.To be honest I find that the ultimate sadness of globalisation: increasingly there is, it seems, nowhere left to really ""get away from it all""."
166,0375700730,http://goodreads.com/user/show/53470308-muskaan-multani,3,"The Island Of The Colorblind is a Nonfiction book written by, Oliver Sacks. The first part of the book is about a medical syndrome called Achromatopsia (results in total colorblindness) on the Micronesian Atoll of Pingelap. The second half of the book is about mystery, of Lytico-Bodig disease in Guam.A neurologist travels to a Micronesian island called Pingelap, where ten percent of the population is completely colorblind, this is a rare medical syndrome called, achromatopsia. Hundreds of years ago the island was wiped out by a typhoon killing many residents, they began to repopulate, but the father of the island carried a gene for achromatopsia that eventually spread out to the population of Pingelap. Oliver Sacks is fascinated by this island and he was very excited to learn about their culture and daily lives. Sacks brought along with him a man named Knut who had been color blind since birth. Knut required a magnifying glass for close up reading and monoculars for distance reading, also he is very sensitive to light so he wore three pairs of sunglasses. Knut and Oliver Sacks discovered that the people with achromatopsia on the island required these same objects in order to see better, but the didn’t have the resources for these necessities. The two “researchers” have a great time in Pingelap and were very upset when they had to leave.In the second part of the book, Oliver Sacks travels to Guam and learns about Lytico-Bodig disease, “The disease resembles Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS), Parkinson's disease, and Alzheimer's.[3] First reports of the disease surfaced in three death certificates on Guam in 1904”. Sacks has a difficult time finding a solution to the disease with other scientists, it is very puzzling throughout the entire story for him. Sacks does have a theory that the disease could be caused by eating the fruits of the cycads, that are today known as common ferns and sage palms. The natives have to carefully prepare the fruits and wash away the alkalines. In the end, he doesn’t find a solution but he has learned a great deal of information. I would recommend this book to anyone who is interested in learning about islands and are interested in medical issues. I somewhat enjoyed this book because, while it did give a lot of interesting information, the book was difficult to follow. For example, after each paragraph the author would change the topic, there wasn’t a good flow when reading. There was also some terminology that the average reader wouldn’t know about, but there was an index at the of the book, which was helpful. Overall, it was a good book, but there are only specific people that will enjoy it. "
167,0375700730,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3915142-garrett-haynes,5,"This is my first reading of Oliver Sacks and I thoroughly enjoyed it. I love his mixture of science, mystery, medicine, wonder, awe and adventure. Sure there are times where he expresses contorted western views of the natives but it is hard to escape our own world views that are shaped by living as westerners, not as islanders. Oliver honestly expresses his musings and I appreciate that especially since many of them are so interesting. The varied content of this book was unexpected but more and more welcomed as he lands on each new island full of endemic plants and endemic diseases. It is hard not to be fascinated by the juxtaposition between the various expressions of the lytico-bodig and also the various species of cycads. Even more so by their likely but yet unprovable link. It is sad to know of the devastating effect our western nations have had on these people and their islands. Disease, oppression, slavery, murder, Destruction of their rich cultural heritage, and the Extinction of birds and plants. Our human nature is to explore and we all love stories of explorers and adventurers. Even the natives themselves ventured to these islands themselves centuries ago, likely spurred by the same desire for new worlds as the European explorers. However, they were able to integrate with the island whereas we have a tendency to consume the worlds we discover. I am not suggesting we all start living in huts again and only eating what we catch ourselves but we can learn from the natives ability to coexist with their environment rather than consume it.I have always wanted to have a more intellectual and scientific life and maybe I will grow more toward that, I hope I will. Reading a book like this stokes these desires and you can bet I will be checking out more of Ollie's books from the library. "

Full cases of color blindness (achromatopsia) are hard to come by, yet in some micronesian islands there are large percentages of full cases. He also recounts a mysterious illness on the islands that onlyaffects people who were born or visited there in the 40's. People born there after 52 did not come down with either of the two various forms it takes (neurdegenerative akin to parkinsonia).His asides on the cycads are interesting. Some have countless ways ofpropagating in very ingenious ways.Another interesting side is the love of SPAM, which was introduced in the 40's. Grocery stores have (had?) aisles of it. In a mainly seafood and vegetarian society it seemed odd to have this fixation on such a meat by-product. His one observation was that in borneo SPAM was to be seen as the closest meat product with a taste and texture to long pig, or human flesh. Pig being the second runner up. The strange note was that Micronesia doesn't have a history of cannibalism. So, eat up you SPAM lovers!"

It's really two books: one about the island (well, two) where there are large populations of achromatopes: people with no color perception at all. He describes how they live and cope, and there's lots of his personal ideas mixed in.The second half is about Guam and the strange disease that is common there, which is not unlike the post-encaphilitic parkinsonism he describes at length in Awakenings. It feels a bit like cheating: oh, so as I was checking out the nearby islands, I found this place that just happened to have a weird disease that perfectly matches my expertise! But his writing is great, the story of the strangely-named disease is fascinating, and it makes for a very satisfying book overall (especially if you've read Awakenings).Oh, and it's also about another one of his obsessions: botany, and in particular cycads. They play an important role, too. There's a beautiful epilogue of sorts that describes his experience of the jungle and the cycads that has nothing to do with the topic of the book, but is simply great.As usual, skip the million-or-so notes, they just interrupt the flow of the story. Luckily, they're at the end of the book, so they don't get in the way at all."

As always, Sacks keeps the patient in the forefront in writing their case histories; one gets a sense of what it might feel to be someone with such a rare yet terrible affliction. Sack's gestalt portrait of each patient paints them organically - more than just an acronym or a collection of neurological maladies. All of this serves as a background to solving the decade long puzzle of rare neurological disorders by systematically incorporating knowledge from disparate disciplines, a feat which Sacks achieves deft zeal, one hardly feels one is reading a case study. Although I don't share the author's interest in cycads and the other plants he describes over many pages, his enthusiasm and passionate description of them is contagious. The picture he paints of the various islands traveled to in the book was equally vivid, such that I found myself wanting to visit them.

It is more than just a neurological picture of them, it is also a cultural picture of how these people cope with their sight issues. Sacks does a great job of drawing you into the story of this group of people. The second half of the book is also about a population of people living on a couple of islands in the Pacific. This group of people have a neurological disorder similar to those in Awakenings. This part of the book is more technical, and not as easy to read for a lay-person, but still interesting. "
172,0375700730,http://goodreads.com/user/show/46722444-olga-werby,5,"In the book “The Island of the Colorblind,” Dr. Oliver Sacks describes his adventures through a series of islands in Micronesia, which have an unusually high percentage of congenital achromatopsia (sever colorblindness) among the population. One of his traveling companions was a Norwegian scientist, Knut Nordby, an achromatope himself. Dr. Nordby described how his rather rare condition affected his early education. In addition to complete color blindness, congenital achromatopsia causes extreme sensitivity to bright light and poor visual acuity. Dr. Nordby’s condition was diagnosed early, and since his vision was thought too poor to learn to read, he was sent to the school for the blind. But he hated Braille and used his sight to decipher the shadows on the page made by the raised bumps. He “cheated” at Braille and was caught. His teachers punished him for using his eyes to read and made him wear a blindfold in class. Dr. Nordby ran away from that school and eventually taught himself to read printed words and became a successful psychologist."
173,0375700730,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6732556-joe-silber,3,"Fairly different from other books by Sacks that I have read; it contains (in addition to the medical studies and mysteries that you would expect) island travelogue, botany, and a touch of autobiography, all written in Sacks' familiar warm, literate style. It is split into two main sections (plus a brief epilogue) both involving islands - the first half covers the titular Island of the Colorblind, Pingelap, while the second half discusses the mysterious lytico-bodig disease found among natives of Guam. As always, Sacks' writing is excellent, and I found the book interesting and readable (only occasional sloggy bits, usually found in the copious footnote entries) but ultimately I felt like it was a little bit padded and indulgent (despite the short length), and that more trim, tightly-edited versions of these stories belonged as part of a longer book like Sacks' ""Anthropologist on Mars""."

Both center around islands where the populations have surprisingly high occurrences of certain medical conditions. As the title suggests, one of those conditions colorblindness. Not standard colorblindness either, but a complete inability to see any color. The second is neurological disease with similarities to Parkinsons, ALS, and dementia. Mixed in both books, but mainly the second, is some history of plants. Mostly cycads.This was my first book by Oliver Sacks, and I think I'd happily pick up any of his other books now. I was interested because he's a neuroligist, but wary because a quick skim showed I suspected he had the type of flowery, meandering writing style that drives me batty. Turns out, he strikes a wonderful balance between story telling and science. It leans more storytelling - I could go for a dash more science - but it does make for enjoyable and interesting reading."

I felt a wave of love - for the children, for the forest, for the island, for the whole scene; I had a sense of paradise, of an almost magical reality. I thought, I have arrived. I am here at last.

Little time is spent on the actual colorblindness, which is the primary reason for picking up this book, the secondary reason was that is was by Oliver Sacks. It was misleading in that I thought that book was going to fixate on the colorblind, or at least their island, but it's only a third (roughly) of the book, we then wander to Guam to learn about a mystery disease, and then on to Rota for the cycads. At times these additional subjects were fascinating, occasionally getting bogged down in jargon -- although that was partially expected -- and at times I just reached my limit for caring, my interest for the additional subjects were not of his depth."

When he is in neurology mode, talking about the inherited color blindness of the title, or a mysterious island syndrome mimicking ALS or Parkinson's but not quite like either, the book is good, though not as compelling as Sacks' other works. But too much is the book is a sort of travelogue, and this just wasn't very interesting. It felt like he had to deliver a book to his publisher, and filled it up with somewhat pedestrian stuff. Also, like another reviewer mentioned, the footnote strategy of this book adds to the disjointed feeling. The footnotes are long and digressive; they're like mini-essays loosely related to the text. I gave up flipping between notes and text, and just read the notes at the end, which actually worked okay. "

186,0375700730,http://goodreads.com/user/show/30281185-sajith-kumar,3,"Islands are unique in many ways. The separation guaranteed by the vastness of the sea ensures subtle changes in the language and culture of the societies inhabiting them and the mainland, even though one is an offspring of the other. Not only in sociocultural mores, the isolation brings about genetic changes in the people, animals and plants. This was observed and characterized in great detail by none other than Charles Darwin himself, by his famous voyage around the globe in HMS Beagle. The rate of changes accumulated in the genome in response to natural selection against local conditions prevailing in an island will be far greater than that on the mainland. Darwin was amazed and encouraged by the sharp evolutionary changes he observed on the Galapagos Islands, which finally led to his theory of evolution. With this in the background, we turn to this book that showcases two remote islands in the Pacific Ocean, distant thousands of miles from the continents, in which two grotesque illnesses are widely prevalent in the indigenous populations. In Pingelap, total colour-blindness is fairly common, and in Guam, a neurological disease called lytico-bodig, that exhibits symptoms of Parkinsonism and paralysis affects a section of the populace born before 1945. The author visits these islands in turn, muses on them and the probable causes. Oliver Sacks is a physician and the author of many books. Born in London and educated at Oxford, he now lives in New York where he is Professor of Neurology and Psychiatry at Columbia University.There are many places in the world where first cousin marriage is common. In many parts of India itself, this was the norm before education and better living standards threw open the door to the outside world to those languishing in fetid superstition. Science has categorically outlined the dangers of inbreeding including widespread prevalence of genetic disorders, to mention nothing about the eventual impoverishment of the gene pool. Genetic diseases are marked often by recessive genes. Since every person possesses two sets of genes inherited from the father and mother, if one copy of the gene is healthy, the recessive gene stays dormant, without causing its harmful effects. The person with one faulty gene acts as a carrier of the disease, but the ailment itself will not be expressed in his body. When too much breeding occurs between people who are closely related, the chances of an offspring getting two copies of the recessive gene heightens. The higher than normal incidence of lunacy and other genetic defects observed in Kerala’s matrilineal society of the previous centuries may be taken note of. Pingelap Atoll’s people had to pass through a natural catastrophe that forced them to resort to inbreeding as a case of necessity. This paradise-like atoll in the middle of the Pacific vastness was hit by a huge typhoon in 1775. Most of the inhabitants perished. Out of the thousand or so dwellers, around twenty, mainly from the chief’s family, survived. The population slowly picked up over the decades, but the harmful effects of inbreeding began to tell heavily on the society’s well being. The loss of colour vision, called achromatopsia, spread among the descendants. The patients lacked all sense of colour, losing the cone cells in the retina which distinguishes colour. They depend only on the rod cells, which normal people use to see in darkness. As a result, people suffering from the disorder find it difficult to fully open their eyes in bright sunlight. This is accompanied by squint. Some semblance to normal human eyes can be generated by the liberal use of dark sunglasses. There is no cure for the disease as yet. Among the general population in other parts of the world, the rate of incidence is 1 in 30,000 whereas it is an astounding 1 in 12 in Pingelap.Sacks presents another startling phenomenon from Guam Island in the Pacific, which falls under U.S. administration. It is a U.S. military base, with a large area of the island out of bounds for ordinary citizens. The indigenous people in this lovely tropical island is afflicted with a paralyzing sickness called lytico-bodig, somewhat related to encephalitis lethargica. The sufferers show symptoms of Parkinson’s disease or display extreme inability to move muscles or speak. The disease worsens progressively, and finally kills the patient. This disease affects only the indigenous people of the island. The cause of this ailment is still shrouded in mystery. The chapter offers an absorbing discussion on the probable causes of the disease. A strong contender is the cycad plant found in large numbers on the island, whose seeds are eaten by the people as a source of protein during droughts or famines. This was widely used during the Second World War when the island was under Japanese occupation and the local people were mercilessly starved. The highest incidence of the malady was on the people born during the war years when all they had to eat was the cycad seeds. After the island was retaken by American troops, matters returned to normalcy. There has not been a single case of lytico-bodig on the people born after the event. The cycad plant contains a neurotoxin that may be responsible for the deleterious effects, but elaborate preparation of the seed before consumption takes care of removing most of the toxin. Scientists posit that genetic predisposition and deficiency of minerals rich in calcium and aluminium may also explain the phenomenon. The last word has not been said yet.The book is not just about diseases and cycads alone. It narrates a really adventurous travel to the beautiful Pacific islands. To reach Pohnpei, Sacks had to undergo some anxious hours in the form of a damaged plane tyre. Many of the islands in the Pacific are controlled by U.S. military. Repairs to the plane were carried out in a military base and the passengers were grudgingly allowed to stay on the island under the watchful eyes of the soldiers – a prospect equally disliked by both parties. The author gives a thrilling description of his journeys on the islands and the heaven-like beaches ideal for swimming or snorkeling. His revulsion to military bureaucracy is evident in more than one place in the book. Guam is a pretty island, but most of the prettiest beaches are under military control. Access is granted after thorough interrogation and that too, after forcing the visitors to wait for hours. But the author has not proposed exposure to radioactivity or other military-related causes for the spread of lytico-bodig.An illuminating discussion on ancient plants like ferns and cycads that still exist in the world is also presented as a bonus. Apparently, this was facilitated by his visit to Rota Island, near Guam. This book includes a huge section of Notes that runs to about a third of the book. But they are very informative and readers don’t feel interrupted from the main story even though they have to frequently refer to these elaborate pieces of information. Nice sketches of the trees and plants are very apt to the theme. An expansive bibliography and index add to the attraction of the book. The book was first published nearly twenty years ago, and that may be why he has not included the names of those genes that cause the diseases. Not that the readers get any wiser by a cryptic acronym, but it contributes to a feeling that the malady is being studied in detail by the academia and pharma.The book is highly recommended."

I thought there would be a lot of interesting conversations with patients and notes from Sacks in which he seems to emphasize with them. But this book was really boring and formal, and sometimes the nature seemed more important to Sacks than the people he meets on his journey (1). A really spiritual atmosphere was also central, which I didn't like so much. In the end, it felt more like a travelogue than a report from a neurologist.Maybe the book was professional and informative, but it just wasn't what I hoped and/or expected. Still two stars, because the second half of the book was more interesting; there were more conversations with patients and insights in the sickness Sacks is trying to understand (2). (1) ""There was a large cantilevered bridge-ornate, gaudy, startling-spanning a gulch as the main road entered town. I had no idea of its history or function; it was as absurd, in its way, as the transplanted London Bridge in Arizona - but it looked festive, fun, as it leapt into the air, a pure effervescence of high spirits.""(2) (about ALS-patients) "".. to see all this and feel you can do nothing, absolutely nothing, to help them. Sometimes it seems especially horrible because their minds remain absolutely clear until the end - they know what is happening to them."""

192,0375700730,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4443481-sarah-beth,3,"In this work of non-fiction, neurologist Oliver Sacks describes his visits to the Micronesian island of Pingelap and later to Guam to investigate the effects of isolation on the incidence of neurological disorders in the small, island communities. In Pingelap, he investigates the large percentage of the population who suffer from total colorblindness, relying instead on pattern and shadows. In Guam, he visits patients suffering from a mysterious neurodegenerative paralysis whose cause has not been uncovered, even as the incidence of the disease seems to have disappeared in the younger generations. It's thought that achromatopsia, or total colorblindness accompanied by extreme sensitivity to light, originated in Pingelap in 1775, when a typhoon killed 90% of the island's population, leaving most of the survivors to die of starvation since most of the plants on the island were also destroyed. Only twenty or so survived but as this small group of survivors attempted to repopulate the island, ""genetic traits previously rare began to spread, so that in the fourth generation after the typhoon a 'new' disease showed itself. The first children with the Pingelap eye disease were born in the 1820s, and within a few generations their numbers had increased to more than five percent of the population"" (37). Elsewhere in the world, the incidence is less than one in 30,000 but on Pingelap it is one in 12. The greatest effects of this disorder, on an island community that cannot seek even basic accommodations like sunglasses, are social. Most sufferers never learn to read, because they cannot see the teacher's writing on the board. Additionally, they are less likely to marry because of a wish not to pass on the disorder and they cannot work outdoors, which limits their options in an already small island economy. In Guam, the effects of the prevalent neurological disorder is much more devastating. ""A tenth of all the adult Chamorro deaths on Guam were due to the disease, and its prevalence was at least a hundred times greater than on the mainland (in some villages, like Umatac, it was over four hundred times greater). Puzzlingly, the disease affects individuals differently, with affected family members exhibiting wildly different symptoms. Some suffered from profound mental and physical slowing and profound immobility. Others had tremors and rigidity. Even more curious, younger generations no longer seem to fall victim to this curious and fatal disease. Although many theories have been postulated for its origins, including consumption of certain species of local plants, no definitive explanation has been achieved. Similarly to my conclusions after reading An Anthropologist on Mars, I wondered what the intended takeaway is for the reader other than to describe these curious island maladies before they are corrected by time and exposure to a widening genetic pool. Sacks offers no solutions or treatments for the maladies explored in this book. Instead this book reads more like a travel narrative, recounting anecdotes of curiosities encountered on his journey, than a medical book shedding light on neurological conditions. This book reads almost like a rambling conversation with Sacks about his impressions after visiting the islands. Similarly, I found the final chapter of the book, which is devoted solely to island plants, and cycads in particular, sort of random. Although cycads have been thought to cause the neurological disorder found in Guam, the chapter does not connect back to the disorder in any way. However, despite this purely descriptive and rambling nature of the book, I found the neurological disorders he explores fascinating. Only on genetically isolated islands can such genetic anomalies arise. ""But islands open up, people die or intermarry; genetic attenuation sets in, and the condition disappears. The life of such a genetic disease in an isolate tends to be six or eight generations, two hundred years perhaps, and then it vanishes, as do its memories and traces, lost in the ongoing stream of time"" (177). 3.5 Stars"

194,0375700730,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5636777-kevin,3,"Dr. Sacks travels to pacific islands in this book. it’s really more of travel log whereas other books of his could be described as medical histories which focus on neurological disorders or peculiarities, this one focuses more on the society and geography of the places than the diseases/afflictions he went there to study.as always, his writing is amiable yet descriptive but the lack of focus in this book kept me from seeing a real point other than the publishing of a memoir of his time in these places. interesting maybe but without much substance. especially since the book is really two books: one about the island of the colorblind (ie a high percentage of the population is achromatopic) and the other about an affliction or disease on Guam that mimics Parkinson’s and may be caused somehow by the prolific species of cycads on the island. apparently, this notion has been around since the 1960s but never proven beyond a doubt. Sacks went there to see what he could figure out.there exists a thin but vital underlying thread of science tribalism and territoriality in the book. Sacks notes how the medical conditions in both parts of the book attract ambitious physician-scientists looking to solve the mystery and make a name for themselves. this is especially present in the latter book on cycads where researchers are seen covering up information sources, skewing and misreporting data, and blackballing heretics from their bailiwick field because, frankly, who’s around to know better? it seems claustrophobic to attempt to practice medicine or research on this remote islands where large, determined personalities can easily dominate by controlling and projecting a carefully crafted outward image. but like i said, this was a significant but nearly ephemeral theme running through Sacks’s narrative- it was not his main purpose to expose this kind of politics in science, he was simply relating the trials and tribulations of doing research in these isolated places and painted an accurate picture.like any good scholar/journalist, Sacks adds a metric ton of notes to his work to flesh out small points he wants to make and to provide references for his ramblings. i’ve always seen the excessive use of notes (both end- and foot-) as lazy writing. if it’s so very important that you need to take up pages for these notes, why can’t you incorporate it into your narrative and be done with the notes? i always have in my own work and it makes for a much smoother and enjoyable read. having said that, i think Sacks’s writing is “lazy” only in the sense that he was driven and didn’t much care to make his way as a polished, eloquent author. he wanted to say something and he did - then he would add asides as he thought of them to deepen and enrich the model of events he was building. in other words, i don’t see him using notes as though they are expected as many scholarly writers do; he used them because he was sitting round a campfire telling stories and kept thinking of more interesting things to say. “this happened and then - I ALMOST FORGOT!- this other thing happened, too!”"
195,0375700730,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1261617-jeroen,4,"About a third of my copy of The Island of the Colour-blind is taken up by notes and the index - I think that might be a record in my collection, apart from academic works. It's tempting to say this tells us something about the writer, Oliver Sacks. In the preface he writes that after writing the book in one fell swoop, it ended up growing ""like an unruly cycad."" To keep the pristinity of the main narrative, as it were, the notes were used, and one note can sometimes go on for three or four pages.I do think it's telling of the author. What defines Sacks is not only his renowned capacity for empathy, but also the breadth of his writing, which seems to situate itself on the crossroads of literature and medicine and is in this still (perhaps surprisingly) unique. Though there are many novels that play themselves out in hospitals, as well as medical literature meant for popular consumption, these are usually written in only one of the particular idioms. Sacks seems to be special in being able to write with the narratival grasp of a novelist and the scientific eye of a doctor.This also necessarily opens him up for critique. The literary reader might find the episode on the history of the lytico-bodig disease to be overlong, whereas the neurologist might not care so much for the scene setting and elaborate description, for what we might call the gravy of narratival writing - extraskeletal, perhaps, might be a good crossdisciplinary word here.I am certainly in the former group, and found the story on achromatopsia far more interesting. The curious quality of this quote-unquote disease - full colour-blindness - is that, the way deafness can free up one's brain for extrasensitive vision, so can lack of colour. And while one shouldn't go as far as to envy the achromatopsian - a kind of parallel false yearning as the one towards an age where our media streamed in sepiatonal - the spoilt first-world brat that I am couldn't help but dream of experiencing it just for a few hours.The other attraction here is the Pacific setting, and it struck me that it must be an odd place to have been over the twentieth century. There are hardly inhabitable places in the world that are more remote, and that will consequently feel more remote, and yet these islands have continually been drawn into something that happened far away from them. This is kind of heartbreaking, but also kind of beautiful - the island as a strange palimpsest forever re-written by the busy doings of all these self-important countries, and I'd like to picture the autochthonous islanders slowly shaking their heads, waving a limp arm in the direction of their new rulers, and ambling away. I would like to picture that, but that would be a lie: they suffered horribly in every consequent invasion of the supposedly cultured West, and the continued presence of military bases on these islands makes it not at all unlikely that more is still in store for them.To be honest I find that the ultimate sadness of globalisation: increasingly there is, it seems, nowhere left to really ""get away from it all""."
196,0375700730,http://goodreads.com/user/show/53470308-muskaan-multani,3,"The Island Of The Colorblind is a Nonfiction book written by, Oliver Sacks. The first part of the book is about a medical syndrome called Achromatopsia (results in total colorblindness) on the Micronesian Atoll of Pingelap. The second half of the book is about mystery, of Lytico-Bodig disease in Guam.A neurologist travels to a Micronesian island called Pingelap, where ten percent of the population is completely colorblind, this is a rare medical syndrome called, achromatopsia. Hundreds of years ago the island was wiped out by a typhoon killing many residents, they began to repopulate, but the father of the island carried a gene for achromatopsia that eventually spread out to the population of Pingelap. Oliver Sacks is fascinated by this island and he was very excited to learn about their culture and daily lives. Sacks brought along with him a man named Knut who had been color blind since birth. Knut required a magnifying glass for close up reading and monoculars for distance reading, also he is very sensitive to light so he wore three pairs of sunglasses. Knut and Oliver Sacks discovered that the people with achromatopsia on the island required these same objects in order to see better, but the didn’t have the resources for these necessities. The two “researchers” have a great time in Pingelap and were very upset when they had to leave.In the second part of the book, Oliver Sacks travels to Guam and learns about Lytico-Bodig disease, “The disease resembles Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS), Parkinson's disease, and Alzheimer's.[3] First reports of the disease surfaced in three death certificates on Guam in 1904”. Sacks has a difficult time finding a solution to the disease with other scientists, it is very puzzling throughout the entire story for him. Sacks does have a theory that the disease could be caused by eating the fruits of the cycads, that are today known as common ferns and sage palms. The natives have to carefully prepare the fruits and wash away the alkalines. In the end, he doesn’t find a solution but he has learned a great deal of information. I would recommend this book to anyone who is interested in learning about islands and are interested in medical issues. I somewhat enjoyed this book because, while it did give a lot of interesting information, the book was difficult to follow. For example, after each paragraph the author would change the topic, there wasn’t a good flow when reading. There was also some terminology that the average reader wouldn’t know about, but there was an index at the of the book, which was helpful. Overall, it was a good book, but there are only specific people that will enjoy it. "
197,0375700730,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3915142-garrett-haynes,5,"This is my first reading of Oliver Sacks and I thoroughly enjoyed it. I love his mixture of science, mystery, medicine, wonder, awe and adventure. Sure there are times where he expresses contorted western views of the natives but it is hard to escape our own world views that are shaped by living as westerners, not as islanders. Oliver honestly expresses his musings and I appreciate that especially since many of them are so interesting. The varied content of this book was unexpected but more and more welcomed as he lands on each new island full of endemic plants and endemic diseases. It is hard not to be fascinated by the juxtaposition between the various expressions of the lytico-bodig and also the various species of cycads. Even more so by their likely but yet unprovable link. It is sad to know of the devastating effect our western nations have had on these people and their islands. Disease, oppression, slavery, murder, Destruction of their rich cultural heritage, and the Extinction of birds and plants. Our human nature is to explore and we all love stories of explorers and adventurers. Even the natives themselves ventured to these islands themselves centuries ago, likely spurred by the same desire for new worlds as the European explorers. However, they were able to integrate with the island whereas we have a tendency to consume the worlds we discover. I am not suggesting we all start living in huts again and only eating what we catch ourselves but we can learn from the natives ability to coexist with their environment rather than consume it.I have always wanted to have a more intellectual and scientific life and maybe I will grow more toward that, I hope I will. Reading a book like this stokes these desires and you can bet I will be checking out more of Ollie's books from the library. "

Full cases of color blindness (achromatopsia) are hard to come by, yet in some micronesian islands there are large percentages of full cases. He also recounts a mysterious illness on the islands that onlyaffects people who were born or visited there in the 40's. People born there after 52 did not come down with either of the two various forms it takes (neurdegenerative akin to parkinsonia).His asides on the cycads are interesting. Some have countless ways ofpropagating in very ingenious ways.Another interesting side is the love of SPAM, which was introduced in the 40's. Grocery stores have (had?) aisles of it. In a mainly seafood and vegetarian society it seemed odd to have this fixation on such a meat by-product. His one observation was that in borneo SPAM was to be seen as the closest meat product with a taste and texture to long pig, or human flesh. Pig being the second runner up. The strange note was that Micronesia doesn't have a history of cannibalism. So, eat up you SPAM lovers!"

It's really two books: one about the island (well, two) where there are large populations of achromatopes: people with no color perception at all. He describes how they live and cope, and there's lots of his personal ideas mixed in.The second half is about Guam and the strange disease that is common there, which is not unlike the post-encaphilitic parkinsonism he describes at length in Awakenings. It feels a bit like cheating: oh, so as I was checking out the nearby islands, I found this place that just happened to have a weird disease that perfectly matches my expertise! But his writing is great, the story of the strangely-named disease is fascinating, and it makes for a very satisfying book overall (especially if you've read Awakenings).Oh, and it's also about another one of his obsessions: botany, and in particular cycads. They play an important role, too. There's a beautiful epilogue of sorts that describes his experience of the jungle and the cycads that has nothing to do with the topic of the book, but is simply great.As usual, skip the million-or-so notes, they just interrupt the flow of the story.

As always, Sacks keeps the patient in the forefront in writing their case histories; one gets a sense of what it might feel to be someone with such a rare yet terrible affliction. Sack's gestalt portrait of each patient paints them organically - more than just an acronym or a collection of neurological maladies. All of this serves as a background to solving the decade long puzzle of rare neurological disorders by systematically incorporating knowledge from disparate disciplines, a feat which Sacks achieves deft zeal, one hardly feels one is reading a case study. Although I don't share the author's interest in cycads and the other plants he describes over many pages, his enthusiasm and passionate description of them is contagious. The picture he paints of the various islands traveled to in the book was equally vivid, such that I found myself wanting to visit them.

It is more than just a neurological picture of them, it is also a cultural picture of how these people cope with their sight issues. Sacks does a great job of drawing you into the story of this group of people. The second half of the book is also about a population of people living on a couple of islands in the Pacific. This group of people have a neurological disorder similar to those in Awakenings. This part of the book is more technical, and not as easy to read for a lay-person, but still interesting. "

One of his traveling companions was a Norwegian scientist, Knut Nordby, an achromatope himself. Dr. Nordby described how his rather rare condition affected his early education. In addition to complete color blindness, congenital achromatopsia causes extreme sensitivity to bright light and poor visual acuity. Dr. Nordby’s condition was diagnosed early, and since his vision was thought too poor to learn to read, he was sent to the school for the blind. But he hated Braille and used his sight to decipher the shadows on the page made by the raised bumps. He “cheated” at Braille and was caught. His teachers punished him for using his eyes to read and made him wear a blindfold in class. Dr. Nordby ran away from that school and eventually taught himself to read printed words and became a successful psychologist."

It is split into two main sections (plus a brief epilogue) both involving islands - the first half covers the titular Island of the Colorblind, Pingelap, while the second half discusses the mysterious lytico-bodig disease found among natives of Guam. As always, Sacks' writing is excellent, and I found the book interesting and readable (only occasional sloggy bits, usually found in the copious footnote entries) but ultimately I felt like it was a little bit padded and indulgent (despite the short length), and that more trim, tightly-edited versions of these stories belonged as part of a longer book like Sacks' ""Anthropologist on Mars""."

Both center around islands where the populations have surprisingly high occurrences of certain medical conditions. As the title suggests, one of those conditions colorblindness. Not standard colorblindness either, but a complete inability to see any color. The second is neurological disease with similarities to Parkinsons, ALS, and dementia. Mixed in both books, but mainly the second, is some history of plants. Mostly cycads.This was my first book by Oliver Sacks, and I think I'd happily pick up any of his other books now. I was interested because he's a neuroligist, but wary because a quick skim showed I suspected he had the type of flowery, meandering writing style that drives me batty. Turns out, he strikes a wonderful balance between story telling and science. It leans more storytelling - I could go for a dash more science - but it does make for enjoyable and interesting reading."

I felt a wave of love - for the children, for the forest, for the island, for the whole scene; I had a sense of paradise, of an almost magical reality. I thought, I have arrived. I am here at last.

Little time is spent on the actual colorblindness, which is the primary reason for picking up this book, the secondary reason was that is was by Oliver Sacks. It was misleading in that I thought that book was going to fixate on the colorblind, or at least their island, but it's only a third (roughly) of the book, we then wander to Guam to learn about a mystery disease, and then on to Rota for the cycads. At times these additional subjects were fascinating, occasionally getting bogged down in jargon -- although that was partially expected -- and at times I just reached my limit for caring, my interest for the additional subjects were not of his depth."

When he is in neurology mode, talking about the inherited color blindness of the title, or a mysterious island syndrome mimicking ALS or Parkinson's but not quite like either, the book is good, though not as compelling as Sacks' other works. But too much is the book is a sort of travelogue, and this just wasn't very interesting. It felt like he had to deliver a book to his publisher, and filled it up with somewhat pedestrian stuff. Also, like another reviewer mentioned, the footnote strategy of this book adds to the disjointed feeling. The footnotes are long and digressive; they're like mini-essays loosely related to the text.

This book reminds me of Bill Brysons A Short History Of Nearly Everything, because of the wrong tracks, solutions that aren't quite right, etc. This is how real science marches forward: not a few individuals making grand discoveries, but scores of people who try and try and try to find an answer, until somebody stands on the shoulders of a giant and finds the solution (and then somebody else refines it, and gets either all of the credit or none at all).But the ending is depressing, especially when you check when this book was written.

216,0375700730,http://goodreads.com/user/show/30281185-sajith-kumar,3,"Islands are unique in many ways. The separation guaranteed by the vastness of the sea ensures subtle changes in the language and culture of the societies inhabiting them and the mainland, even though one is an offspring of the other. Not only in sociocultural mores, the isolation brings about genetic changes in the people, animals and plants. This was observed and characterized in great detail by none other than Charles Darwin himself, by his famous voyage around the globe in HMS Beagle. The rate of changes accumulated in the genome in response to natural selection against local conditions prevailing in an island will be far greater than that on the mainland. Darwin was amazed and encouraged by the sharp evolutionary changes he observed on the Galapagos Islands, which finally led to his theory of evolution. With this in the background, we turn to this book that showcases two remote islands in the Pacific Ocean, distant thousands of miles from the continents, in which two grotesque illnesses are widely prevalent in the indigenous populations. In Pingelap, total colour-blindness is fairly common, and in Guam, a neurological disease called lytico-bodig, that exhibits symptoms of Parkinsonism and paralysis affects a section of the populace born before 1945. The author visits these islands in turn, muses on them and the probable causes. Oliver Sacks is a physician and the author of many books. Born in London and educated at Oxford, he now lives in New York where he is Professor of Neurology and Psychiatry at Columbia University.There are many places in the world where first cousin marriage is common. In many parts of India itself, this was the norm before education and better living standards threw open the door to the outside world to those languishing in fetid superstition. Science has categorically outlined the dangers of inbreeding including widespread prevalence of genetic disorders, to mention nothing about the eventual impoverishment of the gene pool. Genetic diseases are marked often by recessive genes. Since every person possesses two sets of genes inherited from the father and mother, if one copy of the gene is healthy, the recessive gene stays dormant, without causing its harmful effects. The person with one faulty gene acts as a carrier of the disease, but the ailment itself will not be expressed in his body. When too much breeding occurs between people who are closely related, the chances of an offspring getting two copies of the recessive gene heightens. The higher than normal incidence of lunacy and other genetic defects observed in Kerala’s matrilineal society of the previous centuries may be taken note of. Pingelap Atoll’s people had to pass through a natural catastrophe that forced them to resort to inbreeding as a case of necessity. This paradise-like atoll in the middle of the Pacific vastness was hit by a huge typhoon in 1775. Most of the inhabitants perished. Out of the thousand or so dwellers, around twenty, mainly from the chief’s family, survived. The population slowly picked up over the decades, but the harmful effects of inbreeding began to tell heavily on the society’s well being. The loss of colour vision, called achromatopsia, spread among the descendants. The patients lacked all sense of colour, losing the cone cells in the retina which distinguishes colour. They depend only on the rod cells, which normal people use to see in darkness. As a result, people suffering from the disorder find it difficult to fully open their eyes in bright sunlight. This is accompanied by squint. Some semblance to normal human eyes can be generated by the liberal use of dark sunglasses. There is no cure for the disease as yet. Among the general population in other parts of the world, the rate of incidence is 1 in 30,000 whereas it is an astounding 1 in 12 in Pingelap.Sacks presents another startling phenomenon from Guam Island in the Pacific, which falls under U.S. administration. It is a U.S. military base, with a large area of the island out of bounds for ordinary citizens. The indigenous people in this lovely tropical island is afflicted with a paralyzing sickness called lytico-bodig, somewhat related to encephalitis lethargica. The sufferers show symptoms of Parkinson’s disease or display extreme inability to move muscles or speak. The disease worsens progressively, and finally kills the patient. This disease affects only the indigenous people of the island. The cause of this ailment is still shrouded in mystery. The chapter offers an absorbing discussion on the probable causes of the disease. A strong contender is the cycad plant found in large numbers on the island, whose seeds are eaten by the people as a source of protein during droughts or famines. This was widely used during the Second World War when the island was under Japanese occupation and the local people were mercilessly starved. The highest incidence of the malady was on the people born during the war years when all they had to eat was the cycad seeds. After the island was retaken by American troops, matters returned to normalcy. There has not been a single case of lytico-bodig on the people born after the event. The cycad plant contains a neurotoxin that may be responsible for the deleterious effects, but elaborate preparation of the seed before consumption takes care of removing most of the toxin. Scientists posit that genetic predisposition and deficiency of minerals rich in calcium and aluminium may also explain the phenomenon. The last word has not been said yet.The book is not just about diseases and cycads alone. It narrates a really adventurous travel to the beautiful Pacific islands. To reach Pohnpei, Sacks had to undergo some anxious hours in the form of a damaged plane tyre. Many of the islands in the Pacific are controlled by U.S. military. Repairs to the plane were carried out in a military base and the passengers were grudgingly allowed to stay on the island under the watchful eyes of the soldiers – a prospect equally disliked by both parties. The author gives a thrilling description of his journeys on the islands and the heaven-like beaches ideal for swimming or snorkeling. His revulsion to military bureaucracy is evident in more than one place in the book. Guam is a pretty island, but most of the prettiest beaches are under military control. Access is granted after thorough interrogation and that too, after forcing the visitors to wait for hours. But the author has not proposed exposure to radioactivity or other military-related causes for the spread of lytico-bodig.An illuminating discussion on ancient plants like ferns and cycads that still exist in the world is also presented as a bonus. Apparently, this was facilitated by his visit to Rota Island, near Guam. This book includes a huge section of Notes that runs to about a third of the book. But they are very informative and readers don’t feel interrupted from the main story even though they have to frequently refer to these elaborate pieces of information. Nice sketches of the trees and plants are very apt to the theme. An expansive bibliography and index add to the attraction of the book. The book was first published nearly twenty years ago, and that may be why he has not included the names of those genes that cause the diseases. Not that the readers get any wiser by a cryptic acronym, but it contributes to a feeling that the malady is being studied in detail by the academia and pharma.The book is highly recommended."

I thought there would be a lot of interesting conversations with patients and notes from Sacks in which he seems to emphasize with them. But this book was really boring and formal, and sometimes the nature seemed more important to Sacks than the people he meets on his journey (1). A really spiritual atmosphere was also central, which I didn't like so much. In the end, it felt more like a travelogue than a report from a neurologist.Maybe the book was professional and informative, but it just wasn't what I hoped and/or expected. Still two stars, because the second half of the book was more interesting; there were more conversations with patients and insights in the sickness Sacks is trying to understand (2). (1) ""There was a large cantilevered bridge-ornate, gaudy, startling-spanning a gulch as the main road entered town. I had no idea of its history or function; it was as absurd, in its way, as the transplanted London Bridge in Arizona - but it looked festive, fun, as it leapt into the air, a pure effervescence of high spirits.""(2) (about ALS-patients) "".. to see all this and feel you can do nothing, absolutely nothing, to help them.

222,0375700730,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4443481-sarah-beth,3,"In this work of non-fiction, neurologist Oliver Sacks describes his visits to the Micronesian island of Pingelap and later to Guam to investigate the effects of isolation on the incidence of neurological disorders in the small, island communities. In Pingelap, he investigates the large percentage of the population who suffer from total colorblindness, relying instead on pattern and shadows. In Guam, he visits patients suffering from a mysterious neurodegenerative paralysis whose cause has not been uncovered, even as the incidence of the disease seems to have disappeared in the younger generations. It's thought that achromatopsia, or total colorblindness accompanied by extreme sensitivity to light, originated in Pingelap in 1775, when a typhoon killed 90% of the island's population, leaving most of the survivors to die of starvation since most of the plants on the island were also destroyed. Only twenty or so survived but as this small group of survivors attempted to repopulate the island, ""genetic traits previously rare began to spread, so that in the fourth generation after the typhoon a 'new' disease showed itself. The first children with the Pingelap eye disease were born in the 1820s, and within a few generations their numbers had increased to more than five percent of the population"" (37). Elsewhere in the world, the incidence is less than one in 30,000 but on Pingelap it is one in 12. The greatest effects of this disorder, on an island community that cannot seek even basic accommodations like sunglasses, are social. Most sufferers never learn to read, because they cannot see the teacher's writing on the board. Additionally, they are less likely to marry because of a wish not to pass on the disorder and they cannot work outdoors, which limits their options in an already small island economy. In Guam, the effects of the prevalent neurological disorder is much more devastating. ""A tenth of all the adult Chamorro deaths on Guam were due to the disease, and its prevalence was at least a hundred times greater than on the mainland (in some villages, like Umatac, it was over four hundred times greater). Puzzlingly, the disease affects individuals differently, with affected family members exhibiting wildly different symptoms. Some suffered from profound mental and physical slowing and profound immobility. Others had tremors and rigidity. Even more curious, younger generations no longer seem to fall victim to this curious and fatal disease. Although many theories have been postulated for its origins, including consumption of certain species of local plants, no definitive explanation has been achieved. Similarly to my conclusions after reading An Anthropologist on Mars, I wondered what the intended takeaway is for the reader other than to describe these curious island maladies before they are corrected by time and exposure to a widening genetic pool. Sacks offers no solutions or treatments for the maladies explored in this book. Instead this book reads more like a travel narrative, recounting anecdotes of curiosities encountered on his journey, than a medical book shedding light on neurological conditions. This book reads almost like a rambling conversation with Sacks about his impressions after visiting the islands. Similarly, I found the final chapter of the book, which is devoted solely to island plants, and cycads in particular, sort of random. Although cycads have been thought to cause the neurological disorder found in Guam, the chapter does not connect back to the disorder in any way. However, despite this purely descriptive and rambling nature of the book, I found the neurological disorders he explores fascinating. Only on genetically isolated islands can such genetic anomalies arise. ""But islands open up, people die or intermarry; genetic attenuation sets in, and the condition disappears. The life of such a genetic disease in an isolate tends to be six or eight generations, two hundred years perhaps, and then it vanishes, as do its memories and traces, lost in the ongoing stream of time"" (177). 3.5 Stars"

224,0375700730,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5636777-kevin,3,"Dr. Sacks travels to pacific islands in this book. it’s really more of travel log whereas other books of his could be described as medical histories which focus on neurological disorders or peculiarities, this one focuses more on the society and geography of the places than the diseases/afflictions he went there to study.as always, his writing is amiable yet descriptive but the lack of focus in this book kept me from seeing a real point other than the publishing of a memoir of his time in these places. interesting maybe but without much substance. especially since the book is really two books: one about the island of the colorblind (ie a high percentage of the population is achromatopic) and the other about an affliction or disease on Guam that mimics Parkinson’s and may be caused somehow by the prolific species of cycads on the island. apparently, this notion has been around since the 1960s but never proven beyond a doubt. Sacks went there to see what he could figure out.there exists a thin but vital underlying thread of science tribalism and territoriality in the book. Sacks notes how the medical conditions in both parts of the book attract ambitious physician-scientists looking to solve the mystery and make a name for themselves. this is especially present in the latter book on cycads where researchers are seen covering up information sources, skewing and misreporting data, and blackballing heretics from their bailiwick field because, frankly, who’s around to know better? it seems claustrophobic to attempt to practice medicine or research on this remote islands where large, determined personalities can easily dominate by controlling and projecting a carefully crafted outward image. but like i said, this was a significant but nearly ephemeral theme running through Sacks’s narrative- it was not his main purpose to expose this kind of politics in science, he was simply relating the trials and tribulations of doing research in these isolated places and painted an accurate picture.like any good scholar/journalist, Sacks adds a metric ton of notes to his work to flesh out small points he wants to make and to provide references for his ramblings. i’ve always seen the excessive use of notes (both end- and foot-) as lazy writing. if it’s so very important that you need to take up pages for these notes, why can’t you incorporate it into your narrative and be done with the notes? i always have in my own work and it makes for a much smoother and enjoyable read. having said that, i think Sacks’s writing is “lazy” only in the sense that he was driven and didn’t much care to make his way as a polished, eloquent author. he wanted to say something and he did - then he would add asides as he thought of them to deepen and enrich the model of events he was building. in other words, i don’t see him using notes as though they are expected as many scholarly writers do; he used them because he was sitting round a campfire telling stories and kept thinking of more interesting things to say. “this happened and then - I ALMOST FORGOT!- this other thing happened, too!”"
225,0375700730,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1261617-jeroen,4,"About a third of my copy of The Island of the Colour-blind is taken up by notes and the index - I think that might be a record in my collection, apart from academic works. It's tempting to say this tells us something about the writer, Oliver Sacks. In the preface he writes that after writing the book in one fell swoop, it ended up growing ""like an unruly cycad."" To keep the pristinity of the main narrative, as it were, the notes were used, and one note can sometimes go on for three or four pages.I do think it's telling of the author. What defines Sacks is not only his renowned capacity for empathy, but also the breadth of his writing, which seems to situate itself on the crossroads of literature and medicine and is in this still (perhaps surprisingly) unique. Though there are many novels that play themselves out in hospitals, as well as medical literature meant for popular consumption, these are usually written in only one of the particular idioms. Sacks seems to be special in being able to write with the narratival grasp of a novelist and the scientific eye of a doctor.This also necessarily opens him up for critique. The literary reader might find the episode on the history of the lytico-bodig disease to be overlong, whereas the neurologist might not care so much for the scene setting and elaborate description, for what we might call the gravy of narratival writing - extraskeletal, perhaps, might be a good crossdisciplinary word here.I am certainly in the former group, and found the story on achromatopsia far more interesting. The curious quality of this quote-unquote disease - full colour-blindness - is that, the way deafness can free up one's brain for extrasensitive vision, so can lack of colour. And while one shouldn't go as far as to envy the achromatopsian - a kind of parallel false yearning as the one towards an age where our media streamed in sepiatonal - the spoilt first-world brat that I am couldn't help but dream of experiencing it just for a few hours.The other attraction here is the Pacific setting, and it struck me that it must be an odd place to have been over the twentieth century. There are hardly inhabitable places in the world that are more remote, and that will consequently feel more remote, and yet these islands have continually been drawn into something that happened far away from them. This is kind of heartbreaking, but also kind of beautiful - the island as a strange palimpsest forever re-written by the busy doings of all these self-important countries, and I'd like to picture the autochthonous islanders slowly shaking their heads, waving a limp arm in the direction of their new rulers, and ambling away. I would like to picture that, but that would be a lie: they suffered horribly in every consequent invasion of the supposedly cultured West, and the continued presence of military bases on these islands makes it not at all unlikely that more is still in store for them.To be honest I find that the ultimate sadness of globalisation: increasingly there is, it seems, nowhere left to really ""get away from it all""."
226,0375700730,http://goodreads.com/user/show/53470308-muskaan-multani,3,"The Island Of The Colorblind is a Nonfiction book written by, Oliver Sacks. The first part of the book is about a medical syndrome called Achromatopsia (results in total colorblindness) on the Micronesian Atoll of Pingelap. The second half of the book is about mystery, of Lytico-Bodig disease in Guam.A neurologist travels to a Micronesian island called Pingelap, where ten percent of the population is completely colorblind, this is a rare medical syndrome called, achromatopsia. Hundreds of years ago the island was wiped out by a typhoon killing many residents, they began to repopulate, but the father of the island carried a gene for achromatopsia that eventually spread out to the population of Pingelap. Oliver Sacks is fascinated by this island and he was very excited to learn about their culture and daily lives. Sacks brought along with him a man named Knut who had been color blind since birth. Knut required a magnifying glass for close up reading and monoculars for distance reading, also he is very sensitive to light so he wore three pairs of sunglasses. Knut and Oliver Sacks discovered that the people with achromatopsia on the island required these same objects in order to see better, but the didn’t have the resources for these necessities. The two “researchers” have a great time in Pingelap and were very upset when they had to leave.In the second part of the book, Oliver Sacks travels to Guam and learns about Lytico-Bodig disease, “The disease resembles Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS), Parkinson's disease, and Alzheimer's.[3] First reports of the disease surfaced in three death certificates on Guam in 1904”. Sacks has a difficult time finding a solution to the disease with other scientists, it is very puzzling throughout the entire story for him. Sacks does have a theory that the disease could be caused by eating the fruits of the cycads, that are today known as common ferns and sage palms. The natives have to carefully prepare the fruits and wash away the alkalines. In the end, he doesn’t find a solution but he has learned a great deal of information. I would recommend this book to anyone who is interested in learning about islands and are interested in medical issues. I somewhat enjoyed this book because, while it did give a lot of interesting information, the book was difficult to follow. For example, after each paragraph the author would change the topic, there wasn’t a good flow when reading. There was also some terminology that the average reader wouldn’t know about, but there was an index at the of the book, which was helpful. Overall, it was a good book, but there are only specific people that will enjoy it. "
227,0375700730,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3915142-garrett-haynes,5,"This is my first reading of Oliver Sacks and I thoroughly enjoyed it. I love his mixture of science, mystery, medicine, wonder, awe and adventure. Sure there are times where he expresses contorted western views of the natives but it is hard to escape our own world views that are shaped by living as westerners, not as islanders. Oliver honestly expresses his musings and I appreciate that especially since many of them are so interesting. The varied content of this book was unexpected but more and more welcomed as he lands on each new island full of endemic plants and endemic diseases. It is hard not to be fascinated by the juxtaposition between the various expressions of the lytico-bodig and also the various species of cycads. Even more so by their likely but yet unprovable link. It is sad to know of the devastating effect our western nations have had on these people and their islands. Disease, oppression, slavery, murder, Destruction of their rich cultural heritage, and the Extinction of birds and plants. Our human nature is to explore and we all love stories of explorers and adventurers. Even the natives themselves ventured to these islands themselves centuries ago, likely spurred by the same desire for new worlds as the European explorers. However, they were able to integrate with the island whereas we have a tendency to consume the worlds we discover. I am not suggesting we all start living in huts again and only eating what we catch ourselves but we can learn from the natives ability to coexist with their environment rather than consume it.I have always wanted to have a more intellectual and scientific life and maybe I will grow more toward that, I hope I will. Reading a book like this stokes these desires and you can bet I will be checking out more of Ollie's books from the library. "

Full cases of color blindness (achromatopsia) are hard to come by, yet in some micronesian islands there are large percentages of full cases. He also recounts a mysterious illness on the islands that onlyaffects people who were born or visited there in the 40's. People born there after 52 did not come down with either of the two various forms it takes (neurdegenerative akin to parkinsonia).His asides on the cycads are interesting. Some have countless ways ofpropagating in very ingenious ways.Another interesting side is the love of SPAM, which was introduced in the 40's. Grocery stores have (had?) aisles of it. In a mainly seafood and vegetarian society it seemed odd to have this fixation on such a meat by-product. His one observation was that in borneo SPAM was to be seen as the closest meat product with a taste and texture to long pig, or human flesh. Pig being the second runner up. The strange note was that Micronesia doesn't have a history of cannibalism. So, eat up you SPAM lovers!"

It's really two books: one about the island (well, two) where there are large populations of achromatopes: people with no color perception at all. He describes how they live and cope, and there's lots of his personal ideas mixed in.The second half is about Guam and the strange disease that is common there, which is not unlike the post-encaphilitic parkinsonism he describes at length in Awakenings. It feels a bit like cheating: oh, so as I was checking out the nearby islands, I found this place that just happened to have a weird disease that perfectly matches my expertise! But his writing is great, the story of the strangely-named disease is fascinating, and it makes for a very satisfying book overall (especially if you've read Awakenings).Oh, and it's also about another one of his obsessions: botany, and in particular cycads. They play an important role, too. There's a beautiful epilogue of sorts that describes his experience of the jungle and the cycads that has nothing to do with the topic of the book, but is simply great.As usual, skip the million-or-so notes, they just interrupt the flow of the story.

As always, Sacks keeps the patient in the forefront in writing their case histories; one gets a sense of what it might feel to be someone with such a rare yet terrible affliction. Sack's gestalt portrait of each patient paints them organically - more than just an acronym or a collection of neurological maladies. All of this serves as a background to solving the decade long puzzle of rare neurological disorders by systematically incorporating knowledge from disparate disciplines, a feat which Sacks achieves deft zeal, one hardly feels one is reading a case study. Although I don't share the author's interest in cycads and the other plants he describes over many pages, his enthusiasm and passionate description of them is contagious. The picture he paints of the various islands traveled to in the book was equally vivid, such that I found myself wanting to visit them.

It is more than just a neurological picture of them, it is also a cultural picture of how these people cope with their sight issues. Sacks does a great job of drawing you into the story of this group of people. The second half of the book is also about a population of people living on a couple of islands in the Pacific. This group of people have a neurological disorder similar to those in Awakenings. This part of the book is more technical, and not as easy to read for a lay-person, but still interesting. "

One of his traveling companions was a Norwegian scientist, Knut Nordby, an achromatope himself. Dr. Nordby described how his rather rare condition affected his early education. In addition to complete color blindness, congenital achromatopsia causes extreme sensitivity to bright light and poor visual acuity. Dr. Nordby’s condition was diagnosed early, and since his vision was thought too poor to learn to read, he was sent to the school for the blind. But he hated Braille and used his sight to decipher the shadows on the page made by the raised bumps. He “cheated” at Braille and was caught. His teachers punished him for using his eyes to read and made him wear a blindfold in class. Dr. Nordby ran away from that school and eventually taught himself to read printed words and became a successful psychologist."

As always, Sacks' writing is excellent, and I found the book interesting and readable (only occasional sloggy bits, usually found in the copious footnote entries) but ultimately I felt like it was a little bit padded and indulgent (despite the short length), and that more trim, tightly-edited versions of these stories belonged as part of a longer book like Sacks' ""Anthropologist on Mars""."

Both center around islands where the populations have surprisingly high occurrences of certain medical conditions. As the title suggests, one of those conditions colorblindness. Not standard colorblindness either, but a complete inability to see any color. The second is neurological disease with similarities to Parkinsons, ALS, and dementia. Mixed in both books, but mainly the second, is some history of plants. Mostly cycads.This was my first book by Oliver Sacks, and I think I'd happily pick up any of his other books now. I was interested because he's a neuroligist, but wary because a quick skim showed I suspected he had the type of flowery, meandering writing style that drives me batty. Turns out, he strikes a wonderful balance between story telling and science. It leans more storytelling - I could go for a dash more science - but it does make for enjoyable and interesting reading."
235,0375700730,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1527994-nora,3,"Sacks writes a pretty scientific account of his Micronesian tour, which I guess I can't criticize. The guy's a neurologist. However, that being said, he does a phenomenal job describing the interactions he has with Pacific Islanders and how mystified he is by nature.***And in that first long moment, with the children coming out of the forest, some with their arms around each other, and the tropical luxuriance of vegetation in all directions - the beauty of the primitive, the human and the natural, tool hold of me. I felt a wave of love - for the children, for the forest, for the island, for the whole scene; I had a sense of paradise, of an almost magical reality. I thought, I have arrived. I am here at last. I want to spend the rest of my life here - and some of these beautiful children could be mine (30)."

Little time is spent on the actual colorblindness, which is the primary reason for picking up this book, the secondary reason was that is was by Oliver Sacks. It was misleading in that I thought that book was going to fixate on the colorblind, or at least their island, but it's only a third (roughly) of the book, we then wander to Guam to learn about a mystery disease, and then on to Rota for the cycads. At times these additional subjects were fascinating, occasionally getting bogged down in jargon -- although that was partially expected -- and at times I just reached my limit for caring, my interest for the additional subjects were not of his depth."

When he is in neurology mode, talking about the inherited color blindness of the title, or a mysterious island syndrome mimicking ALS or Parkinson's but not quite like either, the book is good, though not as compelling as Sacks' other works. But too much is the book is a sort of travelogue, and this just wasn't very interesting. It felt like he had to deliver a book to his publisher, and filled it up with somewhat pedestrian stuff. Also, like another reviewer mentioned, the footnote strategy of this book adds to the disjointed feeling. The footnotes are long and digressive; they're like mini-essays loosely related to the text. I gave up flipping between notes and text, and just read the notes at the end, which actually worked okay. "

246,0375700730,http://goodreads.com/user/show/30281185-sajith-kumar,3,"Islands are unique in many ways. The separation guaranteed by the vastness of the sea ensures subtle changes in the language and culture of the societies inhabiting them and the mainland, even though one is an offspring of the other. Not only in sociocultural mores, the isolation brings about genetic changes in the people, animals and plants. This was observed and characterized in great detail by none other than Charles Darwin himself, by his famous voyage around the globe in HMS Beagle. The rate of changes accumulated in the genome in response to natural selection against local conditions prevailing in an island will be far greater than that on the mainland. Darwin was amazed and encouraged by the sharp evolutionary changes he observed on the Galapagos Islands, which finally led to his theory of evolution. With this in the background, we turn to this book that showcases two remote islands in the Pacific Ocean, distant thousands of miles from the continents, in which two grotesque illnesses are widely prevalent in the indigenous populations. In Pingelap, total colour-blindness is fairly common, and in Guam, a neurological disease called lytico-bodig, that exhibits symptoms of Parkinsonism and paralysis affects a section of the populace born before 1945. The author visits these islands in turn, muses on them and the probable causes. Oliver Sacks is a physician and the author of many books. Born in London and educated at Oxford, he now lives in New York where he is Professor of Neurology and Psychiatry at Columbia University.There are many places in the world where first cousin marriage is common. In many parts of India itself, this was the norm before education and better living standards threw open the door to the outside world to those languishing in fetid superstition. Science has categorically outlined the dangers of inbreeding including widespread prevalence of genetic disorders, to mention nothing about the eventual impoverishment of the gene pool. Genetic diseases are marked often by recessive genes. Since every person possesses two sets of genes inherited from the father and mother, if one copy of the gene is healthy, the recessive gene stays dormant, without causing its harmful effects. The person with one faulty gene acts as a carrier of the disease, but the ailment itself will not be expressed in his body. When too much breeding occurs between people who are closely related, the chances of an offspring getting two copies of the recessive gene heightens. The higher than normal incidence of lunacy and other genetic defects observed in Kerala’s matrilineal society of the previous centuries may be taken note of. Pingelap Atoll’s people had to pass through a natural catastrophe that forced them to resort to inbreeding as a case of necessity. This paradise-like atoll in the middle of the Pacific vastness was hit by a huge typhoon in 1775. Most of the inhabitants perished. Out of the thousand or so dwellers, around twenty, mainly from the chief’s family, survived. The population slowly picked up over the decades, but the harmful effects of inbreeding began to tell heavily on the society’s well being. The loss of colour vision, called achromatopsia, spread among the descendants. The patients lacked all sense of colour, losing the cone cells in the retina which distinguishes colour. They depend only on the rod cells, which normal people use to see in darkness. As a result, people suffering from the disorder find it difficult to fully open their eyes in bright sunlight. This is accompanied by squint. Some semblance to normal human eyes can be generated by the liberal use of dark sunglasses. There is no cure for the disease as yet. Among the general population in other parts of the world, the rate of incidence is 1 in 30,000 whereas it is an astounding 1 in 12 in Pingelap.Sacks presents another startling phenomenon from Guam Island in the Pacific, which falls under U.S. administration. It is a U.S. military base, with a large area of the island out of bounds for ordinary citizens. The indigenous people in this lovely tropical island is afflicted with a paralyzing sickness called lytico-bodig, somewhat related to encephalitis lethargica. The sufferers show symptoms of Parkinson’s disease or display extreme inability to move muscles or speak. The disease worsens progressively, and finally kills the patient. This disease affects only the indigenous people of the island. The cause of this ailment is still shrouded in mystery. The chapter offers an absorbing discussion on the probable causes of the disease. A strong contender is the cycad plant found in large numbers on the island, whose seeds are eaten by the people as a source of protein during droughts or famines. This was widely used during the Second World War when the island was under Japanese occupation and the local people were mercilessly starved. The highest incidence of the malady was on the people born during the war years when all they had to eat was the cycad seeds. After the island was retaken by American troops, matters returned to normalcy. There has not been a single case of lytico-bodig on the people born after the event. The cycad plant contains a neurotoxin that may be responsible for the deleterious effects, but elaborate preparation of the seed before consumption takes care of removing most of the toxin. Scientists posit that genetic predisposition and deficiency of minerals rich in calcium and aluminium may also explain the phenomenon. The last word has not been said yet.The book is not just about diseases and cycads alone. It narrates a really adventurous travel to the beautiful Pacific islands. To reach Pohnpei, Sacks had to undergo some anxious hours in the form of a damaged plane tyre. Many of the islands in the Pacific are controlled by U.S. military. Repairs to the plane were carried out in a military base and the passengers were grudgingly allowed to stay on the island under the watchful eyes of the soldiers – a prospect equally disliked by both parties. The author gives a thrilling description of his journeys on the islands and the heaven-like beaches ideal for swimming or snorkeling. His revulsion to military bureaucracy is evident in more than one place in the book. Guam is a pretty island, but most of the prettiest beaches are under military control. Access is granted after thorough interrogation and that too, after forcing the visitors to wait for hours. But the author has not proposed exposure to radioactivity or other military-related causes for the spread of lytico-bodig.An illuminating discussion on ancient plants like ferns and cycads that still exist in the world is also presented as a bonus. Apparently, this was facilitated by his visit to Rota Island, near Guam. This book includes a huge section of Notes that runs to about a third of the book. But they are very informative and readers don’t feel interrupted from the main story even though they have to frequently refer to these elaborate pieces of information. Nice sketches of the trees and plants are very apt to the theme. An expansive bibliography and index add to the attraction of the book. The book was first published nearly twenty years ago, and that may be why he has not included the names of those genes that cause the diseases. Not that the readers get any wiser by a cryptic acronym, but it contributes to a feeling that the malady is being studied in detail by the academia and pharma.The book is highly recommended."

I thought there would be a lot of interesting conversations with patients and notes from Sacks in which he seems to emphasize with them. But this book was really boring and formal, and sometimes the nature seemed more important to Sacks than the people he meets on his journey (1). A really spiritual atmosphere was also central, which I didn't like so much. In the end, it felt more like a travelogue than a report from a neurologist.Maybe the book was professional and informative, but it just wasn't what I hoped and/or expected. Still two stars, because the second half of the book was more interesting; there were more conversations with patients and insights in the sickness Sacks is trying to understand (2). (1) ""There was a large cantilevered bridge-ornate, gaudy, startling-spanning a gulch as the main road entered town. I had no idea of its history or function; it was as absurd, in its way, as the transplanted London Bridge in Arizona - but it looked festive, fun, as it leapt into the air, a pure effervescence of high spirits.""(2) (about ALS-patients) "".. to see all this and feel you can do nothing, absolutely nothing, to help them.

252,0375700730,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4443481-sarah-beth,3,"In this work of non-fiction, neurologist Oliver Sacks describes his visits to the Micronesian island of Pingelap and later to Guam to investigate the effects of isolation on the incidence of neurological disorders in the small, island communities. In Pingelap, he investigates the large percentage of the population who suffer from total colorblindness, relying instead on pattern and shadows. In Guam, he visits patients suffering from a mysterious neurodegenerative paralysis whose cause has not been uncovered, even as the incidence of the disease seems to have disappeared in the younger generations. It's thought that achromatopsia, or total colorblindness accompanied by extreme sensitivity to light, originated in Pingelap in 1775, when a typhoon killed 90% of the island's population, leaving most of the survivors to die of starvation since most of the plants on the island were also destroyed. Only twenty or so survived but as this small group of survivors attempted to repopulate the island, ""genetic traits previously rare began to spread, so that in the fourth generation after the typhoon a 'new' disease showed itself. The first children with the Pingelap eye disease were born in the 1820s, and within a few generations their numbers had increased to more than five percent of the population"" (37). Elsewhere in the world, the incidence is less than one in 30,000 but on Pingelap it is one in 12. The greatest effects of this disorder, on an island community that cannot seek even basic accommodations like sunglasses, are social. Most sufferers never learn to read, because they cannot see the teacher's writing on the board. Additionally, they are less likely to marry because of a wish not to pass on the disorder and they cannot work outdoors, which limits their options in an already small island economy. In Guam, the effects of the prevalent neurological disorder is much more devastating. ""A tenth of all the adult Chamorro deaths on Guam were due to the disease, and its prevalence was at least a hundred times greater than on the mainland (in some villages, like Umatac, it was over four hundred times greater). Puzzlingly, the disease affects individuals differently, with affected family members exhibiting wildly different symptoms. Some suffered from profound mental and physical slowing and profound immobility. Others had tremors and rigidity. Even more curious, younger generations no longer seem to fall victim to this curious and fatal disease. Although many theories have been postulated for its origins, including consumption of certain species of local plants, no definitive explanation has been achieved. Similarly to my conclusions after reading An Anthropologist on Mars, I wondered what the intended takeaway is for the reader other than to describe these curious island maladies before they are corrected by time and exposure to a widening genetic pool. Sacks offers no solutions or treatments for the maladies explored in this book. Instead this book reads more like a travel narrative, recounting anecdotes of curiosities encountered on his journey, than a medical book shedding light on neurological conditions. This book reads almost like a rambling conversation with Sacks about his impressions after visiting the islands. Similarly, I found the final chapter of the book, which is devoted solely to island plants, and cycads in particular, sort of random. Although cycads have been thought to cause the neurological disorder found in Guam, the chapter does not connect back to the disorder in any way. However, despite this purely descriptive and rambling nature of the book, I found the neurological disorders he explores fascinating. Only on genetically isolated islands can such genetic anomalies arise. ""But islands open up, people die or intermarry; genetic attenuation sets in, and the condition disappears. The life of such a genetic disease in an isolate tends to be six or eight generations, two hundred years perhaps, and then it vanishes, as do its memories and traces, lost in the ongoing stream of time"" (177). 3.5 Stars"

254,0375700730,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5636777-kevin,3,"Dr. Sacks travels to pacific islands in this book. it’s really more of travel log whereas other books of his could be described as medical histories which focus on neurological disorders or peculiarities, this one focuses more on the society and geography of the places than the diseases/afflictions he went there to study.as always, his writing is amiable yet descriptive but the lack of focus in this book kept me from seeing a real point other than the publishing of a memoir of his time in these places. interesting maybe but without much substance. especially since the book is really two books: one about the island of the colorblind (ie a high percentage of the population is achromatopic) and the other about an affliction or disease on Guam that mimics Parkinson’s and may be caused somehow by the prolific species of cycads on the island. apparently, this notion has been around since the 1960s but never proven beyond a doubt. Sacks went there to see what he could figure out.there exists a thin but vital underlying thread of science tribalism and territoriality in the book. Sacks notes how the medical conditions in both parts of the book attract ambitious physician-scientists looking to solve the mystery and make a name for themselves. this is especially present in the latter book on cycads where researchers are seen covering up information sources, skewing and misreporting data, and blackballing heretics from their bailiwick field because, frankly, who’s around to know better? it seems claustrophobic to attempt to practice medicine or research on this remote islands where large, determined personalities can easily dominate by controlling and projecting a carefully crafted outward image. but like i said, this was a significant but nearly ephemeral theme running through Sacks’s narrative- it was not his main purpose to expose this kind of politics in science, he was simply relating the trials and tribulations of doing research in these isolated places and painted an accurate picture.like any good scholar/journalist, Sacks adds a metric ton of notes to his work to flesh out small points he wants to make and to provide references for his ramblings. i’ve always seen the excessive use of notes (both end- and foot-) as lazy writing. if it’s so very important that you need to take up pages for these notes, why can’t you incorporate it into your narrative and be done with the notes? i always have in my own work and it makes for a much smoother and enjoyable read. having said that, i think Sacks’s writing is “lazy” only in the sense that he was driven and didn’t much care to make his way as a polished, eloquent author. he wanted to say something and he did - then he would add asides as he thought of them to deepen and enrich the model of events he was building. in other words, i don’t see him using notes as though they are expected as many scholarly writers do; he used them because he was sitting round a campfire telling stories and kept thinking of more interesting things to say. “this happened and then - I ALMOST FORGOT!- this other thing happened, too!”"
255,0375700730,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1261617-jeroen,4,"About a third of my copy of The Island of the Colour-blind is taken up by notes and the index - I think that might be a record in my collection, apart from academic works. It's tempting to say this tells us something about the writer, Oliver Sacks. In the preface he writes that after writing the book in one fell swoop, it ended up growing ""like an unruly cycad."" To keep the pristinity of the main narrative, as it were, the notes were used, and one note can sometimes go on for three or four pages.I do think it's telling of the author. What defines Sacks is not only his renowned capacity for empathy, but also the breadth of his writing, which seems to situate itself on the crossroads of literature and medicine and is in this still (perhaps surprisingly) unique. Though there are many novels that play themselves out in hospitals, as well as medical literature meant for popular consumption, these are usually written in only one of the particular idioms. Sacks seems to be special in being able to write with the narratival grasp of a novelist and the scientific eye of a doctor.This also necessarily opens him up for critique. The literary reader might find the episode on the history of the lytico-bodig disease to be overlong, whereas the neurologist might not care so much for the scene setting and elaborate description, for what we might call the gravy of narratival writing - extraskeletal, perhaps, might be a good crossdisciplinary word here.I am certainly in the former group, and found the story on achromatopsia far more interesting. The curious quality of this quote-unquote disease - full colour-blindness - is that, the way deafness can free up one's brain for extrasensitive vision, so can lack of colour. And while one shouldn't go as far as to envy the achromatopsian - a kind of parallel false yearning as the one towards an age where our media streamed in sepiatonal - the spoilt first-world brat that I am couldn't help but dream of experiencing it just for a few hours.The other attraction here is the Pacific setting, and it struck me that it must be an odd place to have been over the twentieth century. There are hardly inhabitable places in the world that are more remote, and that will consequently feel more remote, and yet these islands have continually been drawn into something that happened far away from them. This is kind of heartbreaking, but also kind of beautiful - the island as a strange palimpsest forever re-written by the busy doings of all these self-important countries, and I'd like to picture the autochthonous islanders slowly shaking their heads, waving a limp arm in the direction of their new rulers, and ambling away. I would like to picture that, but that would be a lie: they suffered horribly in every consequent invasion of the supposedly cultured West, and the continued presence of military bases on these islands makes it not at all unlikely that more is still in store for them.To be honest I find that the ultimate sadness of globalisation: increasingly there is, it seems, nowhere left to really ""get away from it all""."
256,0375700730,http://goodreads.com/user/show/53470308-muskaan-multani,3,"The Island Of The Colorblind is a Nonfiction book written by, Oliver Sacks. The first part of the book is about a medical syndrome called Achromatopsia (results in total colorblindness) on the Micronesian Atoll of Pingelap. The second half of the book is about mystery, of Lytico-Bodig disease in Guam.A neurologist travels to a Micronesian island called Pingelap, where ten percent of the population is completely colorblind, this is a rare medical syndrome called, achromatopsia. Hundreds of years ago the island was wiped out by a typhoon killing many residents, they began to repopulate, but the father of the island carried a gene for achromatopsia that eventually spread out to the population of Pingelap. Oliver Sacks is fascinated by this island and he was very excited to learn about their culture and daily lives. Sacks brought along with him a man named Knut who had been color blind since birth. Knut required a magnifying glass for close up reading and monoculars for distance reading, also he is very sensitive to light so he wore three pairs of sunglasses. Knut and Oliver Sacks discovered that the people with achromatopsia on the island required these same objects in order to see better, but the didn’t have the resources for these necessities. The two “researchers” have a great time in Pingelap and were very upset when they had to leave.In the second part of the book, Oliver Sacks travels to Guam and learns about Lytico-Bodig disease, “The disease resembles Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS), Parkinson's disease, and Alzheimer's.[3] First reports of the disease surfaced in three death certificates on Guam in 1904”. Sacks has a difficult time finding a solution to the disease with other scientists, it is very puzzling throughout the entire story for him. Sacks does have a theory that the disease could be caused by eating the fruits of the cycads, that are today known as common ferns and sage palms. The natives have to carefully prepare the fruits and wash away the alkalines. In the end, he doesn’t find a solution but he has learned a great deal of information. I would recommend this book to anyone who is interested in learning about islands and are interested in medical issues. I somewhat enjoyed this book because, while it did give a lot of interesting information, the book was difficult to follow. For example, after each paragraph the author would change the topic, there wasn’t a good flow when reading. There was also some terminology that the average reader wouldn’t know about, but there was an index at the of the book, which was helpful. Overall, it was a good book, but there are only specific people that will enjoy it. "
257,0375700730,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3915142-garrett-haynes,5,"This is my first reading of Oliver Sacks and I thoroughly enjoyed it. I love his mixture of science, mystery, medicine, wonder, awe and adventure. Sure there are times where he expresses contorted western views of the natives but it is hard to escape our own world views that are shaped by living as westerners, not as islanders. Oliver honestly expresses his musings and I appreciate that especially since many of them are so interesting. The varied content of this book was unexpected but more and more welcomed as he lands on each new island full of endemic plants and endemic diseases. It is hard not to be fascinated by the juxtaposition between the various expressions of the lytico-bodig and also the various species of cycads. Even more so by their likely but yet unprovable link. It is sad to know of the devastating effect our western nations have had on these people and their islands. Disease, oppression, slavery, murder, Destruction of their rich cultural heritage, and the Extinction of birds and plants. Our human nature is to explore and we all love stories of explorers and adventurers. Even the natives themselves ventured to these islands themselves centuries ago, likely spurred by the same desire for new worlds as the European explorers. However, they were able to integrate with the island whereas we have a tendency to consume the worlds we discover. I am not suggesting we all start living in huts again and only eating what we catch ourselves but we can learn from the natives ability to coexist with their environment rather than consume it.I have always wanted to have a more intellectual and scientific life and maybe I will grow more toward that, I hope I will. Reading a book like this stokes these desires and you can bet I will be checking out more of Ollie's books from the library. "
258,0375700730,http://goodreads.com/user/show/174365-kurtbg,3,"Drawn by an interest in studying the lives of people with complete color blindness and a love for cycads (flora dating back to ""prehistoric times), Oliver Sacks recounts his visit to the islands of Micronesia.Sacks delvers into how people with color (or for him being british, colour) blindness live. Full cases of color blindness (achromatopsia) are hard to come by, yet in some micronesian islands there are large percentages of full cases. He also recounts a mysterious illness on the islands that onlyaffects people who were born or visited there in the 40's. People born there after 52 did not come down with either of the two various forms it takes (neurdegenerative akin to parkinsonia).His asides on the cycads are interesting. Some have countless ways ofpropagating in very ingenious ways.Another interesting side is the love of SPAM, which was introduced in the 40's. Grocery stores have (had?) aisles of it. In a mainly seafood and vegetarian society it seemed odd to have this fixation on such a meat by-product. His one observation was that in borneo SPAM was to be seen as the closest meat product with a taste and texture to long pig, or human flesh. Pig being the second runner up. The strange note was that Micronesia doesn't have a history of cannibalism. So, eat up you SPAM lovers!"
259,0375700730,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5929851-robert-kosara,4,"Good book, with lots of what Sacks does best: telling stories. It's really two books: one about the island (well, two) where there are large populations of achromatopes: people with no color perception at all. He describes how they live and cope, and there's lots of his personal ideas mixed in.The second half is about Guam and the strange disease that is common there, which is not unlike the post-encaphilitic parkinsonism he describes at length in Awakenings. It feels a bit like cheating: oh, so as I was checking out the nearby islands, I found this place that just happened to have a weird disease that perfectly matches my expertise! But his writing is great, the story of the strangely-named disease is fascinating, and it makes for a very satisfying book overall (especially if you've read Awakenings).Oh, and it's also about another one of his obsessions: botany, and in particular cycads. They play an important role, too. There's a beautiful epilogue of sorts that describes his experience of the jungle and the cycads that has nothing to do with the topic of the book, but is simply great.As usual, skip the million-or-so notes, they just interrupt the flow of the story. Luckily, they're at the end of the book, so they don't get in the way at all."

As always, Sacks keeps the patient in the forefront in writing their case histories; one gets a sense of what it might feel to be someone with such a rare yet terrible affliction. Sack's gestalt portrait of each patient paints them organically - more than just an acronym or a collection of neurological maladies. All of this serves as a background to solving the decade long puzzle of rare neurological disorders by systematically incorporating knowledge from disparate disciplines, a feat which Sacks achieves deft zeal, one hardly feels one is reading a case study. Although I don't share the author's interest in cycads and the other plants he describes over many pages, his enthusiasm and passionate description of them is contagious. The picture he paints of the various islands traveled to in the book was equally vivid, such that I found myself wanting to visit them. Perhaps not his most interesting nor beautifully written book, but still a worthwhile read."
261,0375700730,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1109651-holly,3,"2009 #42: This book is by Oliver Sacks, a neurologist who also wrote the non-fiction book Awakenings that the Robert DeNiro & Robbin Williams book is based on. The first half of the book is a study of a group of natives to islands in the Pacific where around 10% of the population is colorblind. It is more than just a neurological picture of them, it is also a cultural picture of how these people cope with their sight issues. Sacks does a great job of drawing you into the story of this group of people. The second half of the book is also about a population of people living on a couple of islands in the Pacific. This group of people have a neurological disorder similar to those in Awakenings. This part of the book is more technical, and not as easy to read for a lay-person, but still interesting. "
262,0375700730,http://goodreads.com/user/show/46722444-olga-werby,5,"In the book “The Island of the Colorblind,” Dr. Oliver Sacks describes his adventures through a series of islands in Micronesia, which have an unusually high percentage of congenital achromatopsia (sever colorblindness) among the population. One of his traveling companions was a Norwegian scientist, Knut Nordby, an achromatope himself. Dr. Nordby described how his rather rare condition affected his early education. In addition to complete color blindness, congenital achromatopsia causes extreme sensitivity to bright light and poor visual acuity. Dr. Nordby’s condition was diagnosed early, and since his vision was thought too poor to learn to read, he was sent to the school for the blind. But he hated Braille and used his sight to decipher the shadows on the page made by the raised bumps. He “cheated” at Braille and was caught. His teachers punished him for using his eyes to read and made him wear a blindfold in class. Dr. Nordby ran away from that school and eventually taught himself to read printed words and became a successful psychologist."
263,0375700730,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6732556-joe-silber,3,"Fairly different from other books by Sacks that I have read; it contains (in addition to the medical studies and mysteries that you would expect) island travelogue, botany, and a touch of autobiography, all written in Sacks' familiar warm, literate style. It is split into two main sections (plus a brief epilogue) both involving islands - the first half covers the titular Island of the Colorblind, Pingelap, while the second half discusses the mysterious lytico-bodig disease found among natives of Guam. As always, Sacks' writing is excellent, and I found the book interesting and readable (only occasional sloggy bits, usually found in the copious footnote entries) but ultimately I felt like it was a little bit padded and indulgent (despite the short length), and that more trim, tightly-edited versions of these stories belonged as part of a longer book like Sacks' ""Anthropologist on Mars""."

Both center around islands where the populations have surprisingly high occurrences of certain medical conditions. As the title suggests, one of those conditions colorblindness. Not standard colorblindness either, but a complete inability to see any color. The second is neurological disease with similarities to Parkinsons, ALS, and dementia. Mixed in both books, but mainly the second, is some history of plants. Mostly cycads.This was my first book by Oliver Sacks, and I think I'd happily pick up any of his other books now. I was interested because he's a neuroligist, but wary because a quick skim showed I suspected he had the type of flowery, meandering writing style that drives me batty. Turns out, he strikes a wonderful balance between story telling and science. It leans more storytelling - I could go for a dash more science - but it does make for enjoyable and interesting reading."

I felt a wave of love - for the children, for the forest, for the island, for the whole scene; I had a sense of paradise, of an almost magical reality. I thought, I have arrived. I am here at last.

Little time is spent on the actual colorblindness, which is the primary reason for picking up this book, the secondary reason was that is was by Oliver Sacks. It was misleading in that I thought that book was going to fixate on the colorblind, or at least their island, but it's only a third (roughly) of the book, we then wander to Guam to learn about a mystery disease, and then on to Rota for the cycads. At times these additional subjects were fascinating, occasionally getting bogged down in jargon -- although that was partially expected -- and at times I just reached my limit for caring, my interest for the additional subjects were not of his depth."

When he is in neurology mode, talking about the inherited color blindness of the title, or a mysterious island syndrome mimicking ALS or Parkinson's but not quite like either, the book is good, though not as compelling as Sacks' other works. But too much is the book is a sort of travelogue, and this just wasn't very interesting. It felt like he had to deliver a book to his publisher, and filled it up with somewhat pedestrian stuff. Also, like another reviewer mentioned, the footnote strategy of this book adds to the disjointed feeling. The footnotes are long and digressive; they're like mini-essays loosely related to the text. I gave up flipping between notes and text, and just read the notes at the end, which actually worked okay. "

While the cause(s) have never been determined, the prevalence seems to be diminishing over time.The pieces are well written and interesting, and probably a higher rating, but for whatever the book did not have that magic that brings me to give more stars."

This book reminds me of Bill Brysons A Short History Of Nearly Everything, because of the wrong tracks, solutions that aren't quite right, etc. This is how real science marches forward: not a few individuals making grand discoveries, but scores of people who try and try and try to find an answer, until somebody stands on the shoulders of a giant and finds the solution (and then somebody else refines it, and gets either all of the credit or none at all).But the ending is depressing, especially when you check when this book was written.

276,0375700730,http://goodreads.com/user/show/30281185-sajith-kumar,3,"Islands are unique in many ways. The separation guaranteed by the vastness of the sea ensures subtle changes in the language and culture of the societies inhabiting them and the mainland, even though one is an offspring of the other. Not only in sociocultural mores, the isolation brings about genetic changes in the people, animals and plants. This was observed and characterized in great detail by none other than Charles Darwin himself, by his famous voyage around the globe in HMS Beagle. The rate of changes accumulated in the genome in response to natural selection against local conditions prevailing in an island will be far greater than that on the mainland. Darwin was amazed and encouraged by the sharp evolutionary changes he observed on the Galapagos Islands, which finally led to his theory of evolution. With this in the background, we turn to this book that showcases two remote islands in the Pacific Ocean, distant thousands of miles from the continents, in which two grotesque illnesses are widely prevalent in the indigenous populations. In Pingelap, total colour-blindness is fairly common, and in Guam, a neurological disease called lytico-bodig, that exhibits symptoms of Parkinsonism and paralysis affects a section of the populace born before 1945. The author visits these islands in turn, muses on them and the probable causes. Oliver Sacks is a physician and the author of many books. Born in London and educated at Oxford, he now lives in New York where he is Professor of Neurology and Psychiatry at Columbia University.There are many places in the world where first cousin marriage is common. In many parts of India itself, this was the norm before education and better living standards threw open the door to the outside world to those languishing in fetid superstition. Science has categorically outlined the dangers of inbreeding including widespread prevalence of genetic disorders, to mention nothing about the eventual impoverishment of the gene pool. Genetic diseases are marked often by recessive genes. Since every person possesses two sets of genes inherited from the father and mother, if one copy of the gene is healthy, the recessive gene stays dormant, without causing its harmful effects. The person with one faulty gene acts as a carrier of the disease, but the ailment itself will not be expressed in his body. When too much breeding occurs between people who are closely related, the chances of an offspring getting two copies of the recessive gene heightens. The higher than normal incidence of lunacy and other genetic defects observed in Kerala’s matrilineal society of the previous centuries may be taken note of. Pingelap Atoll’s people had to pass through a natural catastrophe that forced them to resort to inbreeding as a case of necessity. This paradise-like atoll in the middle of the Pacific vastness was hit by a huge typhoon in 1775. Most of the inhabitants perished. Out of the thousand or so dwellers, around twenty, mainly from the chief’s family, survived. The population slowly picked up over the decades, but the harmful effects of inbreeding began to tell heavily on the society’s well being. The loss of colour vision, called achromatopsia, spread among the descendants. The patients lacked all sense of colour, losing the cone cells in the retina which distinguishes colour. They depend only on the rod cells, which normal people use to see in darkness. As a result, people suffering from the disorder find it difficult to fully open their eyes in bright sunlight. This is accompanied by squint. Some semblance to normal human eyes can be generated by the liberal use of dark sunglasses. There is no cure for the disease as yet. Among the general population in other parts of the world, the rate of incidence is 1 in 30,000 whereas it is an astounding 1 in 12 in Pingelap.Sacks presents another startling phenomenon from Guam Island in the Pacific, which falls under U.S. administration. It is a U.S. military base, with a large area of the island out of bounds for ordinary citizens. The indigenous people in this lovely tropical island is afflicted with a paralyzing sickness called lytico-bodig, somewhat related to encephalitis lethargica. The sufferers show symptoms of Parkinson’s disease or display extreme inability to move muscles or speak. The disease worsens progressively, and finally kills the patient. This disease affects only the indigenous people of the island. The cause of this ailment is still shrouded in mystery. The chapter offers an absorbing discussion on the probable causes of the disease. A strong contender is the cycad plant found in large numbers on the island, whose seeds are eaten by the people as a source of protein during droughts or famines. This was widely used during the Second World War when the island was under Japanese occupation and the local people were mercilessly starved. The highest incidence of the malady was on the people born during the war years when all they had to eat was the cycad seeds. After the island was retaken by American troops, matters returned to normalcy. There has not been a single case of lytico-bodig on the people born after the event. The cycad plant contains a neurotoxin that may be responsible for the deleterious effects, but elaborate preparation of the seed before consumption takes care of removing most of the toxin. Scientists posit that genetic predisposition and deficiency of minerals rich in calcium and aluminium may also explain the phenomenon. The last word has not been said yet.The book is not just about diseases and cycads alone. It narrates a really adventurous travel to the beautiful Pacific islands. To reach Pohnpei, Sacks had to undergo some anxious hours in the form of a damaged plane tyre. Many of the islands in the Pacific are controlled by U.S. military. Repairs to the plane were carried out in a military base and the passengers were grudgingly allowed to stay on the island under the watchful eyes of the soldiers – a prospect equally disliked by both parties. The author gives a thrilling description of his journeys on the islands and the heaven-like beaches ideal for swimming or snorkeling. His revulsion to military bureaucracy is evident in more than one place in the book. Guam is a pretty island, but most of the prettiest beaches are under military control. Access is granted after thorough interrogation and that too, after forcing the visitors to wait for hours. But the author has not proposed exposure to radioactivity or other military-related causes for the spread of lytico-bodig.An illuminating discussion on ancient plants like ferns and cycads that still exist in the world is also presented as a bonus. Apparently, this was facilitated by his visit to Rota Island, near Guam. This book includes a huge section of Notes that runs to about a third of the book. But they are very informative and readers don’t feel interrupted from the main story even though they have to frequently refer to these elaborate pieces of information. Nice sketches of the trees and plants are very apt to the theme. An expansive bibliography and index add to the attraction of the book. The book was first published nearly twenty years ago, and that may be why he has not included the names of those genes that cause the diseases. Not that the readers get any wiser by a cryptic acronym, but it contributes to a feeling that the malady is being studied in detail by the academia and pharma.The book is highly recommended."
277,0375700730,http://goodreads.com/user/show/75006997-mo,2,"2,4 stars. After reading 'The Man Who Mistook His Wife For A Hat' by this writer, I had really high expectations for this book. I thought there would be a lot of interesting conversations with patients and notes from Sacks in which he seems to emphasize with them. But this book was really boring and formal, and sometimes the nature seemed more important to Sacks than the people he meets on his journey (1). A really spiritual atmosphere was also central, which I didn't like so much. In the end, it felt more like a travelogue than a report from a neurologist.Maybe the book was professional and informative, but it just wasn't what I hoped and/or expected. Still two stars, because the second half of the book was more interesting; there were more conversations with patients and insights in the sickness Sacks is trying to understand (2). (1) ""There was a large cantilevered bridge-ornate, gaudy, startling-spanning a gulch as the main road entered town. I had no idea of its history or function; it was as absurd, in its way, as the transplanted London Bridge in Arizona - but it looked festive, fun, as it leapt into the air, a pure effervescence of high spirits.""(2) (about ALS-patients) "".. to see all this and feel you can do nothing, absolutely nothing, to help them.

282,0375700730,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4443481-sarah-beth,3,"In this work of non-fiction, neurologist Oliver Sacks describes his visits to the Micronesian island of Pingelap and later to Guam to investigate the effects of isolation on the incidence of neurological disorders in the small, island communities. In Pingelap, he investigates the large percentage of the population who suffer from total colorblindness, relying instead on pattern and shadows. In Guam, he visits patients suffering from a mysterious neurodegenerative paralysis whose cause has not been uncovered, even as the incidence of the disease seems to have disappeared in the younger generations. It's thought that achromatopsia, or total colorblindness accompanied by extreme sensitivity to light, originated in Pingelap in 1775, when a typhoon killed 90% of the island's population, leaving most of the survivors to die of starvation since most of the plants on the island were also destroyed. Only twenty or so survived but as this small group of survivors attempted to repopulate the island, ""genetic traits previously rare began to spread, so that in the fourth generation after the typhoon a 'new' disease showed itself. The first children with the Pingelap eye disease were born in the 1820s, and within a few generations their numbers had increased to more than five percent of the population"" (37). Elsewhere in the world, the incidence is less than one in 30,000 but on Pingelap it is one in 12. The greatest effects of this disorder, on an island community that cannot seek even basic accommodations like sunglasses, are social. Most sufferers never learn to read, because they cannot see the teacher's writing on the board. Additionally, they are less likely to marry because of a wish not to pass on the disorder and they cannot work outdoors, which limits their options in an already small island economy. In Guam, the effects of the prevalent neurological disorder is much more devastating. ""A tenth of all the adult Chamorro deaths on Guam were due to the disease, and its prevalence was at least a hundred times greater than on the mainland (in some villages, like Umatac, it was over four hundred times greater). Puzzlingly, the disease affects individuals differently, with affected family members exhibiting wildly different symptoms. Some suffered from profound mental and physical slowing and profound immobility. Others had tremors and rigidity. Even more curious, younger generations no longer seem to fall victim to this curious and fatal disease. Although many theories have been postulated for its origins, including consumption of certain species of local plants, no definitive explanation has been achieved. Similarly to my conclusions after reading An Anthropologist on Mars, I wondered what the intended takeaway is for the reader other than to describe these curious island maladies before they are corrected by time and exposure to a widening genetic pool. Sacks offers no solutions or treatments for the maladies explored in this book. Instead this book reads more like a travel narrative, recounting anecdotes of curiosities encountered on his journey, than a medical book shedding light on neurological conditions. This book reads almost like a rambling conversation with Sacks about his impressions after visiting the islands. Similarly, I found the final chapter of the book, which is devoted solely to island plants, and cycads in particular, sort of random. Although cycads have been thought to cause the neurological disorder found in Guam, the chapter does not connect back to the disorder in any way. However, despite this purely descriptive and rambling nature of the book, I found the neurological disorders he explores fascinating. Only on genetically isolated islands can such genetic anomalies arise. ""But islands open up, people die or intermarry; genetic attenuation sets in, and the condition disappears. The life of such a genetic disease in an isolate tends to be six or eight generations, two hundred years perhaps, and then it vanishes, as do its memories and traces, lost in the ongoing stream of time"" (177). 3.5 Stars"

284,0375700730,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5636777-kevin,3,"Dr. Sacks travels to pacific islands in this book. it’s really more of travel log whereas other books of his could be described as medical histories which focus on neurological disorders or peculiarities, this one focuses more on the society and geography of the places than the diseases/afflictions he went there to study.as always, his writing is amiable yet descriptive but the lack of focus in this book kept me from seeing a real point other than the publishing of a memoir of his time in these places. interesting maybe but without much substance. especially since the book is really two books: one about the island of the colorblind (ie a high percentage of the population is achromatopic) and the other about an affliction or disease on Guam that mimics Parkinson’s and may be caused somehow by the prolific species of cycads on the island. apparently, this notion has been around since the 1960s but never proven beyond a doubt. Sacks went there to see what he could figure out.there exists a thin but vital underlying thread of science tribalism and territoriality in the book. Sacks notes how the medical conditions in both parts of the book attract ambitious physician-scientists looking to solve the mystery and make a name for themselves. this is especially present in the latter book on cycads where researchers are seen covering up information sources, skewing and misreporting data, and blackballing heretics from their bailiwick field because, frankly, who’s around to know better? it seems claustrophobic to attempt to practice medicine or research on this remote islands where large, determined personalities can easily dominate by controlling and projecting a carefully crafted outward image. but like i said, this was a significant but nearly ephemeral theme running through Sacks’s narrative- it was not his main purpose to expose this kind of politics in science, he was simply relating the trials and tribulations of doing research in these isolated places and painted an accurate picture.like any good scholar/journalist, Sacks adds a metric ton of notes to his work to flesh out small points he wants to make and to provide references for his ramblings. i’ve always seen the excessive use of notes (both end- and foot-) as lazy writing. if it’s so very important that you need to take up pages for these notes, why can’t you incorporate it into your narrative and be done with the notes? i always have in my own work and it makes for a much smoother and enjoyable read. having said that, i think Sacks’s writing is “lazy” only in the sense that he was driven and didn’t much care to make his way as a polished, eloquent author. he wanted to say something and he did - then he would add asides as he thought of them to deepen and enrich the model of events he was building. in other words, i don’t see him using notes as though they are expected as many scholarly writers do; he used them because he was sitting round a campfire telling stories and kept thinking of more interesting things to say. “this happened and then - I ALMOST FORGOT!- this other thing happened, too!”"
285,0375700730,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1261617-jeroen,4,"About a third of my copy of The Island of the Colour-blind is taken up by notes and the index - I think that might be a record in my collection, apart from academic works. It's tempting to say this tells us something about the writer, Oliver Sacks. In the preface he writes that after writing the book in one fell swoop, it ended up growing ""like an unruly cycad."" To keep the pristinity of the main narrative, as it were, the notes were used, and one note can sometimes go on for three or four pages.I do think it's telling of the author. What defines Sacks is not only his renowned capacity for empathy, but also the breadth of his writing, which seems to situate itself on the crossroads of literature and medicine and is in this still (perhaps surprisingly) unique. Though there are many novels that play themselves out in hospitals, as well as medical literature meant for popular consumption, these are usually written in only one of the particular idioms. Sacks seems to be special in being able to write with the narratival grasp of a novelist and the scientific eye of a doctor.This also necessarily opens him up for critique. The literary reader might find the episode on the history of the lytico-bodig disease to be overlong, whereas the neurologist might not care so much for the scene setting and elaborate description, for what we might call the gravy of narratival writing - extraskeletal, perhaps, might be a good crossdisciplinary word here.I am certainly in the former group, and found the story on achromatopsia far more interesting. The curious quality of this quote-unquote disease - full colour-blindness - is that, the way deafness can free up one's brain for extrasensitive vision, so can lack of colour. And while one shouldn't go as far as to envy the achromatopsian - a kind of parallel false yearning as the one towards an age where our media streamed in sepiatonal - the spoilt first-world brat that I am couldn't help but dream of experiencing it just for a few hours.The other attraction here is the Pacific setting, and it struck me that it must be an odd place to have been over the twentieth century. There are hardly inhabitable places in the world that are more remote, and that will consequently feel more remote, and yet these islands have continually been drawn into something that happened far away from them. This is kind of heartbreaking, but also kind of beautiful - the island as a strange palimpsest forever re-written by the busy doings of all these self-important countries, and I'd like to picture the autochthonous islanders slowly shaking their heads, waving a limp arm in the direction of their new rulers, and ambling away. I would like to picture that, but that would be a lie: they suffered horribly in every consequent invasion of the supposedly cultured West, and the continued presence of military bases on these islands makes it not at all unlikely that more is still in store for them.To be honest I find that the ultimate sadness of globalisation: increasingly there is, it seems, nowhere left to really ""get away from it all""."

Hundreds of years ago the island was wiped out by a typhoon killing many residents, they began to repopulate, but the father of the island carried a gene for achromatopsia that eventually spread out to the population of Pingelap. Oliver Sacks is fascinated by this island and he was very excited to learn about their culture and daily lives. Sacks brought along with him a man named Knut who had been color blind since birth. Knut required a magnifying glass for close up reading and monoculars for distance reading, also he is very sensitive to light so he wore three pairs of sunglasses. Knut and Oliver Sacks discovered that the people with achromatopsia on the island required these same objects in order to see better, but the didn’t have the resources for these necessities. The two “researchers” have a great time in Pingelap and were very upset when they had to leave.In the second part of the book, Oliver Sacks travels to Guam and learns about Lytico-Bodig disease, “The disease resembles Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS), Parkinson's disease, and Alzheimer's.[3] First reports of the disease surfaced in three death certificates on Guam in 1904”. Sacks has a difficult time finding a solution to the disease with other scientists, it is very puzzling throughout the entire story for him. Sacks does have a theory that the disease could be caused by eating the fruits of the cycads, that are today known as common ferns and sage palms. The natives have to carefully prepare the fruits and wash away the alkalines. In the end, he doesn’t find a solution but he has learned a great deal of information. I would recommend this book to anyone who is interested in learning about islands and are interested in medical issues. I somewhat enjoyed this book because, while it did give a lot of interesting information, the book was difficult to follow. For example, after each paragraph the author would change the topic, there wasn’t a good flow when reading. There was also some terminology that the average reader wouldn’t know about, but there was an index at the of the book, which was helpful. Overall, it was a good book, but there are only specific people that will enjoy it. "
287,0375700730,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3915142-garrett-haynes,5,"This is my first reading of Oliver Sacks and I thoroughly enjoyed it. I love his mixture of science, mystery, medicine, wonder, awe and adventure. Sure there are times where he expresses contorted western views of the natives but it is hard to escape our own world views that are shaped by living as westerners, not as islanders. Oliver honestly expresses his musings and I appreciate that especially since many of them are so interesting. The varied content of this book was unexpected but more and more welcomed as he lands on each new island full of endemic plants and endemic diseases. It is hard not to be fascinated by the juxtaposition between the various expressions of the lytico-bodig and also the various species of cycads. Even more so by their likely but yet unprovable link. It is sad to know of the devastating effect our western nations have had on these people and their islands. Disease, oppression, slavery, murder, Destruction of their rich cultural heritage, and the Extinction of birds and plants. Our human nature is to explore and we all love stories of explorers and adventurers. Even the natives themselves ventured to these islands themselves centuries ago, likely spurred by the same desire for new worlds as the European explorers. However, they were able to integrate with the island whereas we have a tendency to consume the worlds we discover. I am not suggesting we all start living in huts again and only eating what we catch ourselves but we can learn from the natives ability to coexist with their environment rather than consume it.I have always wanted to have a more intellectual and scientific life and maybe I will grow more toward that, I hope I will. Reading a book like this stokes these desires and you can bet I will be checking out more of Ollie's books from the library. "

Full cases of color blindness (achromatopsia) are hard to come by, yet in some micronesian islands there are large percentages of full cases. He also recounts a mysterious illness on the islands that onlyaffects people who were born or visited there in the 40's. People born there after 52 did not come down with either of the two various forms it takes (neurdegenerative akin to parkinsonia).His asides on the cycads are interesting. Some have countless ways ofpropagating in very ingenious ways.Another interesting side is the love of SPAM, which was introduced in the 40's. Grocery stores have (had?) aisles of it. In a mainly seafood and vegetarian society it seemed odd to have this fixation on such a meat by-product. His one observation was that in borneo SPAM was to be seen as the closest meat product with a taste and texture to long pig, or human flesh. Pig being the second runner up. The strange note was that Micronesia doesn't have a history of cannibalism. So, eat up you SPAM lovers!"
289,0375700730,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5929851-robert-kosara,4,"Good book, with lots of what Sacks does best: telling stories. It's really two books: one about the island (well, two) where there are large populations of achromatopes: people with no color perception at all. He describes how they live and cope, and there's lots of his personal ideas mixed in.The second half is about Guam and the strange disease that is common there, which is not unlike the post-encaphilitic parkinsonism he describes at length in Awakenings. It feels a bit like cheating: oh, so as I was checking out the nearby islands, I found this place that just happened to have a weird disease that perfectly matches my expertise! But his writing is great, the story of the strangely-named disease is fascinating, and it makes for a very satisfying book overall (especially if you've read Awakenings).Oh, and it's also about another one of his obsessions: botany, and in particular cycads. They play an important role, too. There's a beautiful epilogue of sorts that describes his experience of the jungle and the cycads that has nothing to do with the topic of the book, but is simply great.As usual, skip the million-or-so notes, they just interrupt the flow of the story. Luckily, they're at the end of the book, so they don't get in the way at all."
290,0375700730,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8770377-aaron,3,"Sacks seamlessly weaves travelogue, ethnobiology, athropology, neuroscience, history and botany into a compelling tale of isolated islands of fascinating illnesses; achromatopsia, Lytico-bodig, ALS-PDC. As always, Sacks keeps the patient in the forefront in writing their case histories; one gets a sense of what it might feel to be someone with such a rare yet terrible affliction. Sack's gestalt portrait of each patient paints them organically - more than just an acronym or a collection of neurological maladies. All of this serves as a background to solving the decade long puzzle of rare neurological disorders by systematically incorporating knowledge from disparate disciplines, a feat which Sacks achieves deft zeal, one hardly feels one is reading a case study. Although I don't share the author's interest in cycads and the other plants he describes over many pages, his enthusiasm and passionate description of them is contagious. The picture he paints of the various islands traveled to in the book was equally vivid, such that I found myself wanting to visit them. Perhaps not his most interesting nor beautifully written book, but still a worthwhile read."
291,0375700730,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1109651-holly,3,"2009 #42: This book is by Oliver Sacks, a neurologist who also wrote the non-fiction book Awakenings that the Robert DeNiro & Robbin Williams book is based on. The first half of the book is a study of a group of natives to islands in the Pacific where around 10% of the population is colorblind. It is more than just a neurological picture of them, it is also a cultural picture of how these people cope with their sight issues. Sacks does a great job of drawing you into the story of this group of people. The second half of the book is also about a population of people living on a couple of islands in the Pacific. This group of people have a neurological disorder similar to those in Awakenings. This part of the book is more technical, and not as easy to read for a lay-person, but still interesting. "
292,0375700730,http://goodreads.com/user/show/46722444-olga-werby,5,"In the book “The Island of the Colorblind,” Dr. Oliver Sacks describes his adventures through a series of islands in Micronesia, which have an unusually high percentage of congenital achromatopsia (sever colorblindness) among the population. One of his traveling companions was a Norwegian scientist, Knut Nordby, an achromatope himself. Dr. Nordby described how his rather rare condition affected his early education. In addition to complete color blindness, congenital achromatopsia causes extreme sensitivity to bright light and poor visual acuity. Dr. Nordby’s condition was diagnosed early, and since his vision was thought too poor to learn to read, he was sent to the school for the blind. But he hated Braille and used his sight to decipher the shadows on the page made by the raised bumps. He “cheated” at Braille and was caught. His teachers punished him for using his eyes to read and made him wear a blindfold in class. Dr. Nordby ran away from that school and eventually taught himself to read printed words and became a successful psychologist."
293,0375700730,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6732556-joe-silber,3,"Fairly different from other books by Sacks that I have read; it contains (in addition to the medical studies and mysteries that you would expect) island travelogue, botany, and a touch of autobiography, all written in Sacks' familiar warm, literate style. It is split into two main sections (plus a brief epilogue) both involving islands - the first half covers the titular Island of the Colorblind, Pingelap, while the second half discusses the mysterious lytico-bodig disease found among natives of Guam. As always, Sacks' writing is excellent, and I found the book interesting and readable (only occasional sloggy bits, usually found in the copious footnote entries) but ultimately I felt like it was a little bit padded and indulgent (despite the short length), and that more trim, tightly-edited versions of these stories belonged as part of a longer book like Sacks' ""Anthropologist on Mars""."
294,0375700730,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4414163-drew,4,"This is essentially two books. Both center around islands where the populations have surprisingly high occurrences of certain medical conditions. As the title suggests, one of those conditions colorblindness. Not standard colorblindness either, but a complete inability to see any color. The second is neurological disease with similarities to Parkinsons, ALS, and dementia. Mixed in both books, but mainly the second, is some history of plants. Mostly cycads.This was my first book by Oliver Sacks, and I think I'd happily pick up any of his other books now. I was interested because he's a neuroligist, but wary because a quick skim showed I suspected he had the type of flowery, meandering writing style that drives me batty. Turns out, he strikes a wonderful balance between story telling and science. It leans more storytelling - I could go for a dash more science - but it does make for enjoyable and interesting reading."
295,0375700730,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1527994-nora,3,"Sacks writes a pretty scientific account of his Micronesian tour, which I guess I can't criticize. The guy's a neurologist. However, that being said, he does a phenomenal job describing the interactions he has with Pacific Islanders and how mystified he is by nature.***And in that first long moment, with the children coming out of the forest, some with their arms around each other, and the tropical luxuriance of vegetation in all directions - the beauty of the primitive, the human and the natural, tool hold of me. I felt a wave of love - for the children, for the forest, for the island, for the whole scene; I had a sense of paradise, of an almost magical reality. I thought, I have arrived. I am here at last. I want to spend the rest of my life here - and some of these beautiful children could be mine (30)."
296,0375700730,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7506541-courtney,3,"It's a mix of narrative and factual account, I mostly enjoyed it, but found that I wanted more information on somethings and less on others.It's interesting (most of the time), yet dense, but I feel that it was misleading. Little time is spent on the actual colorblindness, which is the primary reason for picking up this book, the secondary reason was that is was by Oliver Sacks. It was misleading in that I thought that book was going to fixate on the colorblind, or at least their island, but it's only a third (roughly) of the book, we then wander to Guam to learn about a mystery disease, and then on to Rota for the cycads. At times these additional subjects were fascinating, occasionally getting bogged down in jargon -- although that was partially expected -- and at times I just reached my limit for caring, my interest for the additional subjects were not of his depth."
297,0375700730,http://goodreads.com/user/show/27000109-harpoon,2,"A somewhat disjointed book with some interesting spots. When he is in neurology mode, talking about the inherited color blindness of the title, or a mysterious island syndrome mimicking ALS or Parkinson's but not quite like either, the book is good, though not as compelling as Sacks' other works. But too much is the book is a sort of travelogue, and this just wasn't very interesting. It felt like he had to deliver a book to his publisher, and filled it up with somewhat pedestrian stuff. Also, like another reviewer mentioned, the footnote strategy of this book adds to the disjointed feeling. The footnotes are long and digressive; they're like mini-essays loosely related to the text. I gave up flipping between notes and text, and just read the notes at the end, which actually worked okay. "
298,0375700730,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2336639-kathleen,3,"The author visits islands in Micronesia where the isolated indigenous population has a high incidence of colorblindness. Those affected are acutely sensitive light and have good night.The book also contains ""The Cycad Island"", an account of visiting Guam and neighboring islands. The local populations has a tendency to develop neurological disease during midlife. Sacks is a fan of cycad trees, the fruits of which have been implicated as a possible cause of the disease. While the cause(s) have never been determined, the prevalence seems to be diminishing over time.The pieces are well written and interesting, and probably a higher rating, but for whatever the book did not have that magic that brings me to give more stars."
299,0375700730,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4604900-myrren,4,"Sacks is a wonderful writer, who has managed to install more of a sense of wonder at the possibilities (and limitations) of science in me than my teachers have. This book reminds me of Bill Brysons A Short History Of Nearly Everything, because of the wrong tracks, solutions that aren't quite right, etc. This is how real science marches forward: not a few individuals making grand discoveries, but scores of people who try and try and try to find an answer, until somebody stands on the shoulders of a giant and finds the solution (and then somebody else refines it, and gets either all of the credit or none at all).But the ending is depressing, especially when you check when this book was written.
