0,0814758169,http://goodreads.com/user/show/16160897-warpdrive,5,"Highly entertaining and thoroughly compelling, this little gem represents a semi-technical but comprehensive and mathematically accurate elucidation of the famous (and so often misused and misunderstood) Godel's meta-mathematical results concerning the limits of provability in formal axiomatic theories.Being relatively short, this book does not expand on the important correspondences and similarities with the concepts of computability originally introduced by Turing (in theory of computability, particularly in the theory of recursive functions, there is a fundamental theorem stating that there are semi-decidable sets (sets which can be effectively generated), that are not fully decidable. In fact, this is nothing but the Godel's first theorem expressed in computational terms. As expressed beautifully by Chaitin, uncomputability is the deeper reason for incompleteness).Moreover, there are a couple of areas there there is really a bit of too much hand-waving (for example, I would have loved a much more detailed treatment of the critical “Correspondence Lemma”, and of fundamental concepts such as that of “model” of a theory), but I must say that this book achieves the remarkable result of condensing the core of Godel's theorems in a succinct but very readable, approachable, meaningful and informative way, even including important technical details that allow the user to get a better understanding than what normally offered by most other semi-technical books on the subject. The reader can get, for example, a quite good appreciation of the genius of Godel's approach, who understood that mathematics is a universal medium for the embedding of patterns or structure of any sort, so that statements seemingly about numbers alone can in fact encode statements about other universes of discourse, including meta-mathematics itself. Godel managed thus to achieve what the authors call the “arithmetization of meta-mathematics” whereby a meta-mathematical statement about formal expressions, and their typographical relations to one another, may be construed as a mathematical statement about the corresponding Godel numbers and their arithmetical relations to one another: meta-mathematics is therefore faithfully mapped into the domain of integers and their properties. And it is precisely by using this fundamental result that Godel could demonstrate his celebrated theorems. Godel's incompleteness theorems are about formal provability in a finitistic sense within a specific class of formal systems, rather than about ""provability"" in an informal sense, or even about provability in mathematics in general. Moreover, while there are several global properties that a formal system may have (such as completeness, consistency, and the existence of an effective axiomatization), the incompleteness theorems only show that systems which contain a “sufficient amount of arithmetic” cannot possess all three of these properties at the same time. In particular, it is important to highlight that, far from stating that every system is or will be found inconsistent, Godel’s incompleteness theorems merely place limits on what consistent systems can prove (including the intriguing matter of their own consistency, of course). I want here to digress a little from the specific contents of this book, and I want to take the opportunity to dispel at least a couple of the many misconceptions about Godel's theorems: the idea that Godel's theorems imply that there are mathematical truths that are not “reachable”, or that it is likely that an inconsistency will be found within the most widely adopted current formal systems, or the preposterous concept that Godel's theorems imply significant deficiencies in the epistemological power of mathematics:- firstly, the most “popular” formal systems (such as ZFC and PA - the former being the Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory with Axiom of Choice, the latter referring to Peano Arithmetic), are ""effectively generated"" (that is, their set of theorems is a “recursively enumerable” sets, which means that there exists a computer program that could enumerate all the theorems of the system without listing any statements that are not theorems). This implies that all theorems of formal theorems such as ZFC and PA are “reachable”, in a sense, even if not necessarily in a finite amount of time. Given a formal system such as PA or ZFC, the relationship between the axioms and the theorems of the theory is perfectly mechanical and deterministic, and in theory recursively enumerable by a computer program. Actually, this is one of the pre-requisites for the applicability of Godel's incompleteness theorems - secondly, the Godel incompleteness theorems must also be put in their correct overall context: while any post-modernism-bent reader can mention Godel's incompleteness theorems (with more or less accuracy), not many are aware of the important Gentzen's proof of consistency of formal systems such as PA, achieved using the (admittedly non finitistic, therefore not satisfying Hilbert's original stipulation of his aims) principle of transfinite induction. Metamathematical arguments establishing the consistency of formal systems such as ZFC have been devised not just by Gentzen, but also by other researchers. For example, we can prove the consistency of ZFC by assuming that there is an inaccessible cardinal. But, of course, Godel's theorems imply that this can't be turned into a proof inside ZFC itself, because ZFC can't prove the hypothesis that there is an inaccessible cardinal. In general terms, we can't prove the consistency of any sufficiently powerful given formal system from within such system. - thirdly, not many are aware of the Godel's completeness theorem. This important result states that any (first-order) theorem which is true in all models of a theory must be logically deducible from that theory, and vice versa (for example, in abstract algebra any result which is true for all groups, must be deducible from the group axioms). - last but not least: the ultimate confirmation that formal systems such as ZFC provide a consistent and normally sufficiently powerful formal system able to generate adequate mathematical structures for the satisfactory representation of the patterns ultimately characterizing the physical world, is available in the very experimental results of the physical sciences, as famously condensed by Wigner in his treatise about the “unreasonable effectiveness of mathematics”. This is, of course, not an absolute apriori proof of consistency, as originally dreamt by Hilbert, but it is quite an important consideration that should not be forgotten either. - we should also bear in mind that nothing prevents from adding more axioms and enriching a theory so to represent an ever-increasing set of mathematical truths. This is actually what happened historically, when more sophisticated theories such as ZFC developed out of the naive set theories initially proposed by set theorists. The fact that there are number-theoretical truths which can not be formally demonstrated within a single given formal system (in other words, you can't put all mathematical truths in one single formal axiomatic system), does NOT mean that there are truths which are forever incapable of becoming known, or that some sort of mystic human intuition must replace cogent, rigorous proof. And we should also bear in mind that, realistically speaking, it is safe to say that 99% of contemporary mathematics follows from a small, stable subset of ZFCConsidering all the above, it is my strong view that, rather than proving any supposed epistemological limitations of mathematics, Godel's theorems actually clearly highlight the infinite, inexhaustible richness of the patterns, structures and truths that mathematics can offer – structures and patterns that are also reflected in, and can faithfully represent, the inner core of physical reality. Mathematics is, informationally speaking, infinitely powerful - it can't be compressed into a limited, finite set of axioms from which all the mathematical truths can be derived.Anyway, going back to this remarkable book, I think that it is one of the best not-fully-technical available treatments of these seminal theorems: it is very highly recommended to any reader provided with some basic background knowledge of logic and set theory, and willing to explore these theorems to some good level of detail. It is not complete and a bit dated in parts, but an excellent treatise nevertheless, fully deserving a 5-star rating."
1,0814758169,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1651956-riku-sayuj,4,"This Statement is False.How can anyone wrap oneself around that ancient paradox? A true statement whose unprovability resulted precisely from its truth!With this self-undermining formula as his hammer, Godel knocked down the fortress of Principia Mathematica (PM), so painstakingly constructed by Russell and Whitehead.He also showed that his method applied to any system whatsoever that tried to accomplish the goals of Principia Mathematica. In effect, then, Godel destroyed the hopes of those who believed that mathematical thinking is capturable by the rigidity of axiomatic systems, and thus were mathematicians, logicians, and philosophers pushed headlong into a mysterious newly found chasm irrevocably separating “provability” from “truth”.The Heart of Godel’s Argument: The Formal K.O.(i) Godel constructed a formula G of PM that represents the meta-mathematical statement: ‘The formula G is not demonstrable using the rules of PM’.— This formula thus ostensibly says of itself that it is not demonstrable.(ii) Godel also showed that G is demonstrable if, and only if, its formal negation (not) G is demonstrable.However, if a formula and its own negation are both formally demonstrable, then PM is not consistent. Accordingly, if PM is consistent, neither G nor (not) G can be formally derivable from the axioms. In short, if PM is consistent, then G is a formally undecidable formula.(iii) Godel showed that though G is not formally demonstrable, it nevertheless is a true arithmetical formula.(iv) Since G is both true and formally undecidable (within PM), PM must be incomplete. In other words, we cannot deduce all arithmetical truths from the axioms and rules of PM. We are thus compelled to recognize a fundamental limitation concerning the power of formal axiomatic reasoning. For anyone inclined to believe that the essence of mathematics (or any other science) is purely formal axiomatic reasoning, this must come as a shocking revelation.Godel’s paper is notoriously difficult. Forty-six preliminary definitions, together with several important preliminary propositions, must be mastered before the main results are reached. But, as we can see (I have tried to faithfully use phrasings from the book throughout this ‘review’), this superb presentation provides the lay reader with just enough material to get an idea about the central argument and its beauty.Also, this is the book that inspired a teenaged Douglas R. Hofstadter to write his epic opus. For that alone, it is worth a read."

That, of course, means their contradictions will not be provable, either. So, in a word, the sentences, even though correctly built, will be INDEPENDENT OF the set of axioms. They are neither false nor true in the system. They are INDEPENDENT (cannot stress this enough). We want axioms to be independent of each other, for instance. That's because if an axiom is dependent on the other axioms, it can then be safely removed from the set and it'll be deduced as a theorem."
3,0814758169,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1175951-matt,4,"I don't read much math these days, so when I do read it, it's a little like climbing a steep wall following a winter of sitting in front of a computer. You discover a lot of soreness in muscles you scarcely remember you ever had in the first place.The long and the short of it is that once upon a time, I sorta understood Godel's incompleteness theorem, and after this modest reading, I sorta understand it again. Success!More importantly for me, it was fun to try to connect neurons in my poor fuzzy brain, and for a math aficionado, entering a world where it's assumed that conclusions are merely the logical consequences of initial assumptions and nothing more is a bit like diving into mom's meatloaf -- familiar and comforting.Godel's theorem itself is supposedly the big revelation that upset the 19th century mathematics apple cart. As the authors explain, his proof showed that ""no final systematization of many important areas of mathematics is attainable,"" a potentially unsettling proposition. But it may be a somewhat comforting assertion. Who would want to have it all figured out anyway? And gravity still works, and the sun still comes up every day, so I think we'll all get by.As for its readability, math forever has a big problem in that it's *designed* to simplify reason, so when it itself becomes very complex, it can be difficult to impart. By the same reasoning, if you try to simplify a very complex proof, leaving out a lot of the messy details while trying to explain the rest in plain English, you're necessarily going to miss a lot and there will be important details that are missing.In this book, the concepts are simplified and the details are left out. On the plus side, it's pretty readable for a math book, and the main conclusions are pretty easy to follow. On the minus side, there will necessarily be points to question. They do have a lot of footnotes, which offers some middle ground."
4,0814758169,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1843184-szplug,4,"My thanks to AC for convincing me to take the plunge and purchase this little gem: who'd have thought that one-hundred-and-thirteen pages of mathematical logic could have been so entertainingly informative? It was little touches like the chess analogy for describing the relationship between mathematics and metamathematics, the placing of the Richard paradox in terms that were more pellucid than the valiant effort attempted by Rebecca Goldstein, and the tricky, but effective, explanation of how Gödel Numbers were mapped, and how they were further configured to perform their quite amazing feat of transposing metamathematical statements about the formal mathematical calculus into the formulas of the calculus itself. What's more, the appendix led me to dive into the slippery spaghetti of a more in-depth examination of the principles of logical inference and tautologies in absolute proofs. A wonderful book, one which I am surprisingly happy to have read. Perhaps now I'm ready for DFW's tour of infinity!A nifty bit of enlightenment was the discovery of how those endless hours spent typing out Javascript, VBScript, and ActionScript actually represented my own forays into a (much) more modest and elementary form of the logic that comprises the mathematical form wielded so expertly and shatteringly by the Mighty Gödel. I believe it went some ways towards allowing me a clearer understanding of what Nagel and Newman were saying - though they did a magnificent job all on their own of making the entire affair intelligible to this math-rusty reader."
5,0814758169,http://goodreads.com/user/show/19902817-sam-ritchie,5,"Other reviews here do an excellent job of going over the book's subject matter. I'd encountered the proof before in ""Gödel, Escher, Bach"" - this book gives a really deep, clear dive into the main thrust of Gödel's proof that it's not possible to write an absolute proof of consistency for a formal system that can describe number theory inside that theory itself. (The book will teach you what everything in that phrase means, so don't be scared!)Here's my more personal review.I'm a functional programming guy that studied mechanical engineering. I've had exposure to a bunch of applied math, but pure math, and proof in particular, have always scared me. I've been trying to deal with this by reading about abstract algebra, category theory, working through blog posts and tutorials... none of this has really caught. I have better context for what it means to ""study math"", but I'm still nervous.""Gödel's Proof"" was one of the first books in my fall ""Learn Math"" program. All my ""attempts"" at getting into higher level math and proofs have failed due to skimming. It's hard to go deep into a result without context, of course, but it's also hard to rack up a list of dozens of definitions, try to wade through them on Wikipedia, and end up far from the original goal.I was inspired by Cal Newport's pitch on the benefits of deep, methodical study of a small topic. As a computer science graduate student, he went out and bought an expensive lab notebook, and each week does a deep, deliberate reading of a single paper and lays out its conclusions in his own words in his notebook.This book seemed a perfect place to start. The authors take a really difficult paper, expand the discussion out to a hundred pages or so, and provide all the context you need to wrap your head around the main arguments.It took me a couple of days, but the process was immensely rewarding. My recommendation for this book is to take it slow, work through it with a notebook in hand, and try to restate the core conclusions of each chapter as you move through. Some areas I thought I'd understood before this book:- What a ""formal system"" is- What it means for a system to be ""sufficiently powerful""- What the hell the phrase ""foundational crisis of mathematics"" really means;- How mechanical theorem provers work, and why it's a reasonable goal to try and write software that can assist with and verify proofs- What phrases like ""theorem"", ""proof"", ""demonstration"", ""decidable"", ""complete"" etc really MEAN when discussing formal systems.I read ""The Little Prover"" (https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2...) right before ""Gödel's Proof"". If you want some practice in using a language like Scheme to play with some of the concepts of formal proof, and try to implement a language like Principia Mathematica, I'd recommend cracking ""Little Prover"" next.Overall a mindbending, self-contained book that delivers the goods if you take the time to read it over a few sessions."
6,0814758169,http://goodreads.com/user/show/16591302-ali-reda,5,"The Book is the best to explain Godel's Proof of the Incompleteness Theorem.Gödel showed that Principia, or any other system within which arithmetic can be developed, is essentially incomplete. In other words, given any consistent set of arithmetical axioms, there are true arithmetical statements that cannot be derived from the set.Godel showed that it is impossible to give a meta-mathematical proof of the consistency of a system comprehensive enough to contain the whole of arithmetic—unless the proof itself employs rules of inference in certain essential respects different from the Transformation Rules used in deriving theorems within the system. Such a proof may, to be sure, possess great value and importance. However, if the reasoning in it is based on rules of inference much more powerful than the rules of the arithmetical calculus, so that the consistency of the assumptions in the reasoning is as subject to doubt as is the consistency of arithmetic, the proof would yield only a specious victory: one dragon slain only to create another.A few examples will help to an understanding of Hilbert’s distinction between mathematics (i.e., a system of meaningless signs) and meta-mathematics (meaningful statements about mathematics, the signs occurring in the calculus, their arrangement and relations). Consider the expression: 2 + 3 = 5 This expression belongs to mathematics (arithmetic) and is constructed entirely out of elementary arithmetical signs. On the other hand, the statement ‘2 + 3 = 5’ is an arithmetical formula asserts something about the displayed expression. The statement does not express an arithmetical fact and does not belong to the formal language of arithmetic; it belongs to meta-mathematics, because it characterizes a certain string of arithmetical signs as being a formula. if we wish to say something about a word (or other linguistic sign), it is not the word itself (or the sign) that can appear in the sentence, but only a name for the word (or sign). According to a standard convention we construct a name for a linguistic expression by placing single quotation marks around it. Our text adheres to this convention. It is correct to write: Chicago is a populous city. But it is incorrect to write: Chicago is tri-syllabic. To express what is intended by this latter sentence, one must write: ‘Chicago’ is tri-syllabic. Likewise, it is incorrect to write: x = 5 is an equation. We must, instead, formulate our intent by: ‘x = 5’ is an equation.Godel devised a method of representation such that neither the arithmetical formula corresponding to a certain true meta-mathematical statement about the formula, nor the arithmetical formula corresponding to the denial of the statement, is demonstrable within the calculus. Since one of these arithmetical formulas must codify an arithmetical truth, yet neither is derivable from the axioms, the axioms are incomplete. Gödel’s method of representation also enabled him to construct an arithmetical formula corresponding to the meta-mathematical statement ‘The calculus is consistent’ and to show that this formula is not demonstrable within the calculus. It follows that the meta-mathematical statement cannot be established unless rules of inference are used that cannot be represented within the calculus, so that, in proving the statement, rules must be employed whose own consistency may be as questionable as the consistency of arithmetic itself. Gödel established these major conclusions by using a remarkably ingenious form of mapping. Since every expression in the calculus is associated with a (Gödel) number, a meta-mathematical statement about expressions and their relations to one another may be construed as a statement about the corresponding (Gödel) numbers and their arithmetical relations to one another. In this way meta-mathematics becomes completely “arithmetized.” Each metamathematical statement is represented by a unique formula within arithmetic; and the relations of logical dependence between meta-mathematical statements are fully reflected in the numerical relations of dependence between their corresponding arithmetical formulas which contain Godel Numbers. As if it was the mapping between Geometry and Algebra using a Cartesian system of coordinates."
7,0814758169,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8452002-david-olmsted,5,"This book is one of those rare creations in which its clarity and succinctness of presentation highlights the most important concepts. Even if one is not interested in the theory itself the first half of the book is a must read by anyone dealing with mathematics or interested in the nature of truth. It ultimately describes the 1931 paper Kurt Godel published in German entitled “On Formally Undecidable Propositions of Principia Mathematica and Related Systems”. The “Principia Mathematica” was the 1913 monumental 3 volume work by Alfred North Whitehead and Bertrand Russell which was thought to have placed the foundations of mathematics on a firm non-intuitive foundation using a logic based axiomatic strategy. Godel showed that this strategy cannot be used to demonstrate internal consistency, that the mathematics so derived is not always without contradiction even though that may actually be the case. Consistency is just not provable by this sort of strategy."

10,0814758169,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5724695-chayan-ghosh,4,"How do I come up with a fair review for this book, without having my judgement clouded by the genius of Godel? On one hand I am speechless by the ingenuity of the proof devised by Godel and what it signifies, while on the other I am disappointed with the authors for how insufficiently the legend's mind has been probed and represented in these pages. For a book named Godel's Proof, this one barely scratches the surface.On the plus side, it was a very involved and difficult topic, and it was a bold undertaking by the authors to present it in a form consumable by the layman. They painstakingly laid the groundwork, chapter by chapter, assuming no prior knowledge in mathematical logic on part of the reader. Before plunging into the crux of the Proof, the context is presented in an elaborated and easy to understand way. This part of the book is a priceless gem for any newbie to the discipline of formal logic in deductive systems. Laudable is also the mathematical rigor maintained throughout, despite the requirement of keeping it friendly and comprehensible.On the negative, it barely met the expectations that I set out with. I sat through the earlier pages, consuming the wonderfully comprehensive background, only to find a fleeting glimpse at the actual proof. It is at best a superficial walk-through that doesn't even follow Godel's original line of reasoning.Though disappointed, I guess I will solace my mind that this 'succinct' account of the theorems did somewhat prepare me to tackle the actual work of Godel ;)"

15,0814758169,http://goodreads.com/user/show/16624009-mengsen-zhang,4,"If you have watched the movie “Inception” and thought it was not bad, then there is a higher chance that you will like this book. I would also give this book another name: “Gödel’s Trick in two parts, Part 2: proof by inception”. An imaginary “Part 1” refers to what has been omitted, i.e. the proof of why the correspondence between activities in different levels of inception is guaranteed to be valid. However, this point does not at all undermine the fact that this is a great and fun book, and a must-read for lay readers like me to find an entry point to the original proof. So I will talk about the fun part first and the omission last. Below are all my interpretations of the text which may not be true due to personal limitations.What is it all about? Gödel’s proof is the proof against something, so that we must first understand the “something” and what property of it poses an interesting question. This “something” was elaborately introduced in the first half of the book: the agenda of Principia Mathematica (PM), to formalize/assimilate all mathematics into logic, where every truth statement can be expressed within PM can be deduced according to the Rules of Inference from the axioms, i.e. PM would be complete. To prove against it is to show that PM is incomplete, e.g. to find a true statement expressed within PM that is not deducible from the axioms. This idea of a proof include two key pieces: (1) this statement, say “s”, cannot be deduced from PM axioms, and (2) s must at the same time be true within PM. First, how can we prove a statement without deduction from the axioms? The example shown in Gödel’s proof is, in my word, “proof by unprovability”. Let s=“s cannot be deduced from PM axioms.”. If s is provable in PM, it is the same as saying “s can be deduced from PM axioms”, which is a formal negation of s, and hence created a contradiction. If s is not provable in PM, then it is saying that “s cannot be deduced from PM axioms”, which just proved s. Well, this is my version of blatant oversimplification of the solution to (1) by cheating, since, for example, “provable” belongs to the language of meta-mathematics and does not belong to PM, then s is not in PM. Even if we pretend that s is in PM, we cannot deal with (2), meaning we cannot show s is true by a similar way of cheating.However, even though PM does not speak the language of meta-mathematics, it does speak about numbers. Then what about translating meta-mathematical statements into arithmetical statements? That’s what he did. The object of meta-mathematical statements are PM formula, and the object of arithmetical statements are numbers. Therefore, we must map PM formulas onto numbers, and thus close of self-referential loop. Okay, then follows the most exciting part of Gödel’s trick, so no more spoiler - you must read the book. As mentioned at the beginning, part of the trick was omitted from the text. We said we would map formula to numbers (Gödel numbers to be exact), and yes there are some arithmetic truth can be said about these numbers (e.g. they can be factored into prime numbers). But how do these arithmetic relationship corresponds to properties of formula, especially, the property that we are most interested in, “provable”? This is addressed in the “Correspondence Lemma”, that every primitive recursive truth typed down as a string of symbols is a theorem of PM (deducible from axioms of PM). “Provable” happen to be primitive recursive (but I intuited that “unprovable” may not be”), and that is what really closed the loop. The omission was perhaps coming from the authors’ good intention to reduce the complexity of the proof for lay readers, but some logical holes created this way were really hard to leap over, especially for lay readers. The authors suggested in the text “we shall accept on faith” for this matter, but well, literally, it’s a leap of faith. Anyhow, I cannot yet fully wrap my mind around this proof due to limited intelligence and/or limited material presented by the authors. If I become more math-savvy one day, I will definitely read the original proof for satisfaction.The final suggestion from me is that you shall read every footnote and appendix if you are not very familiar with all the details of formal logic and don’t want to miss any important logical link. Have fun!"
16,0814758169,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2794644-nathan-glenn,4,"This book is about a revolutionary mathematical paper by Kurt Godel. Godel showed that general mathematical statements could be represented using plain ol' numbers, and through this statement-to-number mapping proved that there will always exist an infinite number of true mathematical statements that are not provable using mathematical reasoning, no matter how many new rules one adds. This holds within any axiomatic system which encompasses the whole of number theory.The book dumbs down the proof quite a bit, and provide mathematical background for the lay reader, along with interesting intellectual history.The discussion of the proof's significance was especially interesting to me, since it dealt with computer vs. human intelligence. The original author of the book claims that Godel's proof shows that human intelligence is unattainable by a computer, since computers are themselves simply use axiomatic systems to perform more and more advanced operations. James Newman, the editor/updater, says that this is an ironically incorrect conclusion, because 1) Godel's proof shows that numbers can be used to represent any statement from any system (including whatever humans use), and 2) computers can do more than just produce true statements for proofs.I tend to agree with the original author, however. I feel I may not have understood Newman's points, because 1) Godel's paper showed only that numbers could be used to represent number theory and certain meta-mathematical statements, not other forms of reasoning such as human intellect. The crux of the paper is the demonstration of a statement that we, as humans, know to be true, but which cannot be proven true through number theory; and 2) no matter what probabilistic/cognitive model is created in a computer, the computer still follows a fixed set of axioms. The difference is only that different values are set as ""true"" or ""false""; in other words, we might think of the deterministic output given by piece of software as the ""true"" statement which the program ""slavishly"" produces.No doubt we can do lots of awesome things with computers, even modeling aspects of human behavior, but I don't believe in the possibility of a human computer, and Newman's argument did nothing to change my mind."
17,0814758169,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3657860-bob-finch,4,"I have pondered Gödel's famous proof since first hearing of it, but I could never manage the original paper. This compact, enlightening little gem shines a bright light on that remarkable piece of work, and on logical thinking in general. In a stunning surprise to the the status quo, Gödel shook the foundations of mathematics by demonstrating it to be incomplete or inconsistent. Hofstadter's edition with his excellent forward is particularly helpful for understanding the continued impact of Gödel more than 70 years on. The authors walk the reader through Gödel's argument with clarity; however, it is not a quick read and demands close attention by the reader, especially one like me lacking a background in logic. It is also rife with footnotes that, while expanding on key concepts, can be lengthy distractions from the main flow. Nevertheless, the reward of perseverance is satisfaction in beginning to understanding a complex, multilayered argument with profound meaning. I say 'beginning' because I returned almost immediately to the book's beginning to better grasp concepts that the authors had built upon. Perhaps someday, after a few more readings of this, I will actually tackle Gödel's original."
18,0814758169,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5952398-ed,4,"I recommend this book for readers who want a clear and concise introduction to Godel's proof. The book will be especially useful for readers whose interests lie primarily in mathematics or logic, but who do not have very much prior knowledge of this important proof. Readers with broader interests, who would like to explore the larger implications of the proof for science or philosophy, may be disappointed that the book ends where it does. Godel's Incompleteness Theorem is cited by many scholars who question some of the fundamental assumptions of science. Just to give one example, it figures prominently in Robert Rosen's argument that a computing machine is an inadequate model for an organism. It is relevant to the question of whether everything that nature does can be understood as a computation, as Wolfram and many others have maintained. This book would have been more exciting if it had delved into a few of these discussions. Instead the authors wrap it up quickly with a brief ""concluding reflections"" chapter, as if they had a deadline to meet or a severe space limitation to conform to. That may leave some readers understanding the logic of the proof, but saying ""so what?"" "

Both times I was too far in the weeds to really glean the huge importance of his work. This book does incredible justice to the intellectual masterpiece Gödel constructed, and it does so in a very incisive way. It also places his work in the context of the mathematic research at the time which gives it much more meaning. I found this book fairly easy to read with the notable exception of a few paragraphs towards the end which became very meta and hard to track. Aside from this, I think this book is very accessible to those with a moderate background in mathematics and for those, I highly recommend!It's also fairly short, and overall a wonderful glimpse into the delightfully perplexing world of logic and metamathematics.

Gödel, at the age of 25, was able to prove that any consistent formal system able to model basic arithmetic is incomplete. In other words, there exists an infinite amount of facts of number theory that are true, but impossible to prove. This shocking result somehow resonates with many aspects of the human condition. There are numbers no computer program can calculate, facts of science we cannot prove and things us humans cannot understand. Ironically, a complete understanding of Gödel's results seems to be outside my reach.Yet, Gödel was able to clearly see what none had seen before him. Gödel struggled his entire life with mental instability, anxiety and obsessive behaviour, and he died from starvation when he refused to eat food not made by his wife, at the fear of being poisoned. Nevertheless, his results and insights will in all likelihood stand the test of time, and be remembered as landmark achievements.Trying to catch a glimpse of what Gödel saw is an awe-inspiring experience, and I would reccomend it to anyone interested in mathematics, logic and the limits of the human mind as well as computers."

Godel's Incompleteness Theorems are some of the most mind-boggling creations of human thought that have profound implications for  more human thought.  ""Godel's Proof"" is excellent in that the author provides a relevant background to the proof and its implications, starting with a buildup on the concepts of consistency and meta-mathematics, into the arithmetization of meta-mathematics (a mouthful) in order to supplement a background for the proof by Godel. Nagel and Newman also provide a great background in logic--as someone who already has a background in logical statements, the description of logical symbols surely felt helpful as a review, and can be beneficial for those with limited logic experience. Even the appendices, which cover Peano's axioms, quantifiers, and tautology were thorough, and the author also made sure to provide relevant footnotes for any new definitions they had built themselves. While I do agree with other reviews that certain lemmas or models are a bit hand-wavey, this allows for a more concise text that is clear for any reader, and ultimately allows the text to be inclusive for a variety of audiences. It is an astounding exposition of the proof and its consequences, and I would surely recommend this text to anyone broadly interested in philosophy and mathematics and the intricate weaving of the two disciplines."

It is one of the great limitative results of twentieth century thought, in some ways similar to Heisenberg's Uncertainty Principle.This monograph is highly recommended IF you are very interested in the foundations of mathematics, or of thought, or of computation, AND you are willing to take the time to follow a fairly abstruse mathematical argument. The actual proof is too complex for all but specialists in mathematics, but this gives a really good outline of the proof, excellent explanatory background, and the way that the actual argument is laid out is accessible to a thoughtful person who is good at mathematics but not a mathematician, who is willing to put in the effort.So my stars are a rating with this particular reader in mind.If someone wants to have a simple non-technical outline of the proof, and its significant impact on intellectual history, there are excellent books that do that very satisfactorily."
31,0814758169,http://goodreads.com/user/show/119485-kirill,2,"'Unsatisfying' is the best way to describe my experience with this book. The main goal of the book was to relieve some gloomy misconceptions about what the theorem had implied for the future of artificial intelligence in the first half of 20th century. The issue has lost its edge since, perhaps, in part due to popular accounts like this, and certainly due to the fact that a lot of what was ""future"" of computers in the 1950s has already played itself out. The result was a very practical, even if not romantic view of how we interact with powerful machines. AI is just not an issue in the age of search engines and social networks. And the classic science fiction AI applications -- computers that talk to you -- took the form of Siri, which recognizes enough voice commands to be a fun tool for hawking cell phone contracts, and various application-specific accessibility tools. I suspect the book would have been a good initial guide to actually working through the logic of the proof. There really is no substitute for doing the work to get satisfaction out of simply understanding a mathematical construction. But of course I had no intention of doing that. Maybe intention, but no will. "

Beautifully written, simple enough (although simple is not the right word for one of the most mind blowing concepts in mathematical philosophy), and balanced between abstract analysis of the outcome and detailed explanation of the process to get there.Talking about the Godel Theorem itself, it is the ultimate elegy to the non-finiteness of reality under both physical and logical perspectives. It is a demonstration of the endless journey on which, without choice, we are embarked. It demonstrates the certainty that there will always be wonder and amazement for the creative mind, as we all dance together with the universe in an ethereal waltz in the self-aware contemplation of ourselves. It reminds us that self-awareness is at any level of reality and not limited to the living minds. God, in other words, cannot but exist, and we are living right inside it, as others live in us."
33,0814758169,http://goodreads.com/user/show/27172446-woflmao,5,"Gödel proved that a formal system that includes the arithmetic of the natural numbers necessarily contains true statements that cannot be proved by means of the formal system itself. This book gives a wonderful sketch over Gödel's result. It starts with a introduction to the history of formal logic, the motivations behind it and the difficulties in formulating it. Nagel carefully explains the difference between the statements in a formal system and statements about a formal system. Propositional logic is introduced as a simple example, and it is shown that propositional logic is complete and correct. Propositional logic, however, does not contain the arithmetic of the integers. For any formal system containing this arithmetic, Gödel numbers can be used to construct for any statement about the system a statement within the system. This idea is explained very well, and subsequently it is used to sketch Göldel's proof of incompleteness. A little experience with formal logic is certainly helpful for reading this book, but even without it a little extra effort can make this into a fascinating read."

It is aimed at non-mathematicians, but provides a detailed and very understandable walk-through of Godel's 1931 paper on the incompleteness of any axiomatic system that is powerful enough to represent the basic structure of arithmetic.This is a fascinating book. Having labored through the original proof of the incompleteness theorem years ago, I expected that this book would be either too high-level to be of any use, or too low-level to be easily comprehended. But Nagel and Newman do a splendid job of explaining exactly how Godel's proof works, without bogging down in too many definitions, lemmas, etc.If you are interested in the foundations of mathematics, or just want to know more about possibly the most philosophically profound theorem of mathematics, this is the book for you."

This was a more mathematical treatment than hers, but probably about the same as in Gödel, Escher, Bach: An Eternal Golden Braid. I did appreciate the fact that they covered the Gödel numbering (or at least a fairly close and simplified version of it) to allow the reader to feel assured that a unique formula of Principia Mathematica resulted in a unique Gödel number. They do leave the reader to accept certain steps in the proof, but oh well. I could've gone for something a little more rigorous. Might be a good, brief intro to his proof if you haven't been exposed before. If you want more of a biography, try Incompleteness; if you don't mind investing a little more time, I'd recommend Gödel, Escher, Bach instead."

A view that like all other religious beliefs, I always find fascinating and imaginative, but can never get myself to believe as objective truth.Then they start arguing for a fundamental difference between computers and the human mind and the indubitable supremacy of the latter.

Thus I spent time in airports and on trains puzzling mightily over such sentences as ""If (if p then r) then [if (if q then r) then (if (either p or q then r)]"" and while I ""get"" this particular one, many was the time when I could only follow the nested clauses so far before I was completely lost in the maze; and, fractal-like, this goes for each step, each chapter, and the book as a whole. I vaguely understand the aim of Russell and Whitehead to remove all meaning from mathematics and look at it only as a formal system, but I have no idea why they would want to; I can understand the process by which Gödel numbers are derived (and how they can be ""decoded"" into the statements they come from) but not how they are ""put back into"" the Principia system (which has strictly speaking no numbers); I can understand ""if p or p then p"" as a tautology (though I do not know what purpose there could be for such a statement) but I do not at all understand ""if p then p or q"" as one. I could go on and on and on with the things I did not understand, and felt of a certainty that even if I had the best tutors on hand to ask questions of I would never understand; I suppose it proves that I am not, after all, included in the class of ""every educated person with an interest in mathematics, logic, and philosophy"" for whom, according to the inner flap, this book makes accessible a difficult subject. Despite its carefully not assuming any prior knowledge, its clarity and step-by-step procedure towards the proof, I am far, far too dumb for it. (I did appreciate the authors frequently pretending their student was not so dull as I am: ""the careful reader may here object,"" they say, and go on to explain some objection that I myself would not in fact have made; or say ""Readers will have little difficulty in seeing"" something which in fact I have the greatest difficulty in seeing.)Yet! Somehow! I do actually feel as though, despite not understanding even 20% of the steps to get there, I basically grasp what Gödel was arguing and how he argued it. Sort of! I might be able to, very vaguely, explain it to someone else. Maybe!

I did read it in two days so I went through it quite quickly for the level of focuses needed to fully grasp concepts. In all I got the main gist of this incredible proof. It pretty much states that with the formal systems of math we have that hinge off of axioms and rules to create theorems (such as in PM) are not complete, meaning that there are truths within these systems that we know to be true but cannot be proven through the axiom, theorem method. Such a system is said to be incomplete. The theorem also tells that a system is either ""incomplete or inconsistent"" meaning that if it is incomplete, we can't prove everything in that systems including if it is consistent (a statement and its converse are both true)!! This is an example of the systems incompleteness. So there is always a chance that the system is inconsistent! (We'd rather have a system be incomplete than inconsistent). One final note is that the proof does not eliminate the possibility that there is a complete and consistent system that is not mirrored with Principia Mathematica (PM). However, no one today has a clear idea of what that would look like. The proof just shows that they way we think right now has some flaws. New invention and discovery await.This means that the world of numbers we live in is not the truest form of the world we live in. There is a greater system of reasoning out there that does not use numbers!!!"

His proof shook the very grounds on which mathematics and logic stood at the time.This short book explains, in nontechnical terms, what that means and how did Gödel formally prove that. The first part of the book lays the foundation and defines the terms and will go very quickly. The second part constitutes the meat of the book. I found myself slowing down and often flipping back and forth. I imagine the way in which I flipped back and forth is the same way a mathematician looking at the actual proof in mathematical notation would scan the proof back and forth as she goes over it. The book is concise and extremely well written.I’ve been vaguely familiar with Gödel’s theorem and proof for a while from readings and watching videos online. I’d watched a few more videos on YouTube a couple of months before reading the book. After reading the book, everything else online now sound like a watered-down, second-hand account of what was in the book. Understanding the proof, even at the level described in the book for a non-mathematician like me, was very insightful. This perhaps single piece of insight is the point of the entire book.If you’re not a mathematician but are at all interested in mathematics, computability, or formal logic, get the book and read it.

The book claims as its aim to demonstrate the essential parts of Gödel's argument in a way that is accessible to non-specialists. I think that this aim was mostly achieved, though I think it would still be a little dense for many. However, the only mathematical/logical concept (beyond basic reasoning available to everyone) used which is not explained in the text is the concept of proof by contrapositive (a concept easy enough to understand, but to which I was not formally introduced until I began studying mathematics--essentially, the idea that P implies Q is logically equivalent to not Q implies not P), so it is certainly readable by anyone motivated to do the work necessary for understanding.I found the exposition to be very enlightening. I certainly understand Gödel incompleteness much better, as well as its historical motivation, assumptions, and limits, although this was certainly only an introduction. I was especially fascinated by watching the author follow the historical progression of logic from its roots and tie Gödel's ideas to ideas going as far back as Euclid. I also liked the Concluding Reflections section, where Gödel incompleteness is linked to the question of whether human consciousness can be explained in terms of physical and chemical processes. I had not considered this before."

I was not disappointed.The authors make Gödel's proof digestible without compromising the mathematical rigor. Through easy-to-follow explanations in the first 2/3rds of the book, the read is prepped with all the terminology needed to dive into the proof. Then, the authors take the reader straight into Gödel's mind by breaking down his proof into five or so parts.

You won't have the full proof, just an idea because there's way too many details to understand it completely. And you'd need a PhD in math besides.The reason you have to read this book 2 or 3 times is because the authors use complex sentence structures and parenthetical asides. Simply put, it is difficult to read. I was re-reading sentences multiple times just to get the gist of the meaning. And much of the book has footnotes that traverse pages. (Maybe just write a separate book for the footnotes?) Reading this book was a slog.If you find another book about Gödel's proof written by a popular science author, read that book instead.

Then I’d read, “we must conclude that if arithmetic is consistent it’s constitency cannot be established by any meta-mathematical reasoning that can be represented within the formalism of arithmetic!” Which apparently got Nagel and Newman very fired up, but just left me grateful that at least the pages of the 1958 edition smelled really good."

Said simply, it states that a fully formal system will always have the range of information about itself be either inconsistent or incomplete, barring using self-referential statements which ""go outside"" the system, so to speak.It does not mean that we cannot have a full theory of everything, but it does place a very distinct, if interesting, limitation of the possibilities of logical thought. Highly recommended to everyone, regardless of if you like math or not, for the sheer beauty of the concepts this book holds."
57,0814758169,http://goodreads.com/user/show/112224843-maaz-muhammad,4,"Godel’s incompleteness theorems, which state that in any axiomatic system, there are true statements expressible in that axiomatic system and yet can’t be proven in that system, stands out as a watershed moment of 20th century mathematics, and indeed in mathematics and logic as a whole. This book is an attempt to explain this in a less technical manner, although I will say that a first-year undergraduate level of mathematical knowledge is needed to understand even this watered down argument. As someone who thoroughly enjoys mathematics and has some background in it, but not enough to reach the full depths of logic and meta-mathematics that Godel’s work employs, I found the book to be quite the interesting and understandable explanation of the reasoning behind Godel’s theorems."
58,0814758169,http://goodreads.com/user/show/51772290-james-porter,4,"A cogent and well-written introduction to a subject that's always been deeply fascinating to me. I think I'll have to read it another time or two to really grasp the argument. I'd love to read a longer, more detailed book that covers the same stuff, but spends more time on all of it—setting up the historical context (e.g. motivations for Hilbert's program), covering the mathematical particulars of Gödel's proofs amd related results more rigorously, and also delving a bit more into the philosophy of mathematics (what is finitism really, what do we mean by negation, what justifies the proof techniques used in meta-mathematics, etc.). Basically—this book was great, I want more!"
59,0814758169,http://goodreads.com/user/show/55130220-aleksander,4,"Puts the incompleteness theorems in context, and also explains them without using too many mathematical formulas. You do have to keep a lot of new concepts in your mind at the same time, especially at the end when it all comes together; but you don't have to know anything but arithmetic to follow the plot (although having a mathematically oriented mind obviously helps).I feel like the conclusion could have summarized the consequences of Gödel's paper a little better, as I feel I have read better explanations of them on Quora and Stackexchange. But I definitely understand the motivation behind and the basic structure of the proof much better after having read this book."
60,0814758169,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1800600-nathan,4,"A small book, though I hesitate to call it a quick read. Already having some understanding of Gödel's Incompleteness Theorems from reading ""Gödel, Escher, Bach"", I felt reasonably prepared for this, and I was. However, that preparedness carries with it my experience in formal mathematics as an undergraduate. I find it hard to believe this would be nearly as easy without it.All that said, I marvel that something so involved as Gödel's theorems could be described so elegantly and so eloquently in such a short space. For those interested, take your time and meditate on the material, and its far-reaching implications."

Heck, I didn't even realize that the curry-howard correspondence is best interpreted as `meta-` relations until I was, estimate, over two hundred hours into grinding functional programming!

267,0814758169,http://goodreads.com/user/show/56926561-ameya,5,"Had read parts of this book before . The material is complex enough to warrant another reading of it . But this prepares well for the next Book I had in mind - Godel, Escher and Bach . "
268,0814758169,http://goodreads.com/user/show/63205826-nicol-s,4,"The actual explanation of the proofs were still a bit hard to follow to me, but the chapters prior give great insights into formal logic."
269,0814758169,http://goodreads.com/user/show/82351125-eric,5,"Very good as an introduction. It leaves out a few details, but as an introduction that’s to be expected. The bibliography at the back gives a good starting point for how to fill in those gaps."
270,0814758169,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1800600-nathan,4,"A small book, though I hesitate to call it a quick read. Already having some understanding of Gödel's Incompleteness Theorems from reading ""Gödel, Escher, Bach"", I felt reasonably prepared for this, and I was. However, that preparedness carries with it my experience in formal mathematics as an undergraduate. I find it hard to believe this would be nearly as easy without it.All that said, I marvel that something so involved as Gödel's theorems could be described so elegantly and so eloquently in such a short space. For those interested, take your time and meditate on the material, and its far-reaching implications."
271,0814758169,http://goodreads.com/user/show/96817251-quinn-dougherty,4,"Gödel is one of those things you need to repeatedly expose yourself to from as many different angles as possible. I've been slowly accruing my proof-writing and programming capacity while also grinding all sorts of math, and finding as many plain-english stories about (in)completeness as I can get my hands on. Heck, I didn't even realize that the curry-howard correspondence is best interpreted as `meta-` relations until I was, estimate, over two hundred hours into grinding functional programming! So, this is a good book. It's lighter than doing the hard parts of logic textbooks, but heavier than the easy parts. I'm *just last week* starting GEB"
272,0814758169,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3142930-doug,5,"I finished but I'm going to have to go through it again. It's a very short ride through some thorny material that has been simplified -- but with annotations on those simplifications. Two good quotes on the conclusions: ""There is no immediate prospect of replacing the human mind by robots."" & ""Given a definite problem, a machine of this type [axiomatic] might be built for solving it; but no one such machine can be built for solving every problem."" I know quite a few AGI proponents who probably disagree. This one is on the side of humans. "
273,0814758169,http://goodreads.com/user/show/62681565-alistair-bartonn,5,"A fairly accessible account of one of the more revolutionary ideas in mathematics. Beyond the account of the proof - interesting on its own - I think the book provides a pretty good account of how this idea should (and more importantly shouldn't) shape your conception of math/the world, and might also help refine one's view of the epistemology of math. The one (minor) exception is how it deals with computers (understanding incompleteness as what separates man from machine) which is understandable given the age of the book."
274,0814758169,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2459103-ogi-ogas,5,"My ratings of books on Goodreads are solely a crude ranking of their utility to me, and not an evaluation of literary merit, entertainment value, social importance, humor, insightfulness, scientific accuracy, creative vigor, suspensefulness of plot, depth of characters, vitality of theme, excitement of climax, satisfaction of ending, or any other combination of dimensions of value which we are expected to boil down through some fabulous alchemy into a single digit.If you want to understand Godel's Incompleteness Theorem, this is as good as it gets."
275,0814758169,http://goodreads.com/user/show/42921058-chris-power,4,"Does a good job of providing a 10,000 ft view of the concepts underlying Godel's proof and the main steps of the proof itself. All of the really rigorous stuff is (thankfully to this reader) left out. Even with the simplifications and the very helpful footholds and guideposts that the authors provide, it is still a challenge to get to the level of understanding required to be able to explain it to someone else. It may be just as difficult to find someone who would indulge me enough to allow me to try to explain it to them. Needless to say, I have more work ahead on both fronts."
276,0814758169,http://goodreads.com/user/show/53313130-josef,5,"I have long wondered what Godels proof demonstrated, and this short book has helped me understand it. The author very patiently explains the necessary fundamental prerequisites and makes sure to repeatedly clarify difficult points in different contexts to make them more understandable. The book is quite dense, but I give 5 stars for making such an advanced mathematical topic understandable for mere mortals. "
277,0814758169,http://goodreads.com/user/show/14734538-roberto-rigolin-f-lopes,5,"We are in 1931, some clever people like Hilbert, Russell and Whitehead have been trying to put mathematics on solid foundations. But a young guy called Gödel just constructed a proof stating that all consistent systems are incomplete. Then if mathematics has no contradictions (consistent), it cannot be composed by theorems (incomplete). Therefore, it is impossible to validate mathematics using mathematics. Damn, this kid just shocked the whole scientific community. How on earth someone proof that ALL consistent systems within the whole universe of possible systems are incomplete? This book will give you some clues. If you want to see and hear it, read GEB by Douglas Hofstadter."
278,0814758169,http://goodreads.com/user/show/47389832-gage-hoefer,4,"Wonderful expository text that explains Gödel's incompleteness theorems. I already had a background in mathematical logic so I didn't find most of the text all that intimidating- however, I don't think it's necessary to have any sophisticated mathematical background before reading this essay. Nagel does a great job of taking the reader, regardless of familiarity, step by step through Gödel's seminal proof. "
279,0814758169,http://goodreads.com/user/show/28199587-karl-hallbj-rnsson,4,"A very clear and cogent exposition of Gödel's revolutionary argument. The last parts took me a long time to understand (and I'm still not quite sure I fully grasp the contents) but the payoff was getting a firmer grasp of the formal argument itself instead of the condensed soundbite-stuff you always get when Gödel is discussed (and without the infinite digressions and musings of Hofstadter's magnum opus, GEB). A great book — and one which I'll definitely be reading multiple times"
280,0814758169,http://goodreads.com/user/show/30741838-ian-boyd,4,"An excellent summarization of an incredible result. The great thing about this work is, alongside gaining deep insights of the logical structure of the proof, the reader gains an understanding of the truly mammoth implications of Gödel's work to pure math and beyond. Furthermore, due to the authors's nearly reverential tone, their is an implication that this is truly a groundbreaking and extremely difficult proof."
281,0814758169,http://goodreads.com/user/show/72204726-henry-cooksley,4,"A wonderful short book on Gödel's incompleteness theorems; beginning to grasp the implications of these will change the way you think about the limits of human reasoning within formal (logical and mathematical) systems. When I tried reading this a few years ago the second half made little sense to me; now with a little bit more knowledge, it's shocking and satisfying like a good psychological thriller."
282,0814758169,http://goodreads.com/user/show/98979504-youn-s-kamel,5,"This book shattered my worldview. Before reading it, my ubderstanding of Godel's incompletness theorems had been shallow. Through this accessible and moderately technical book, I feel like my grasp of Godel's work has taken another dimension. The epistemological implications of his work are colossal. This book is great to understand how formal logic functions, and tells the history of deductive reasoning from Euclid and Aristotle to Godel. Truly a great work of vulgarization."
283,0814758169,http://goodreads.com/user/show/20262189-tristan,3,"This book probably would have been 4 stars had I been a bit more patient and put greater effort into understanding it. It is one of the more difficult books I've read, so I was thankful for its short length. The authors did work at walking readers into the proof with baby-steps, and perhaps one day I'll revisit it after watching some Youtube primers."
284,0814758169,http://goodreads.com/user/show/106683151-andrew-kondraske,4,"An incredibly confounding concept summarised as cleanly and briefly as possible. The book expends little effort contemplating the consequences of Godel's theorem. There is very little traditional 'math' in the book, but some experience or skills in logical reasoning will go a long way to making sense of the book. I found it helpful to reread some passages multiple times and very slowly."
285,0814758169,http://goodreads.com/user/show/41912303-vil-m-zouhar,4,"A guide through the gist of Gödel's proof. Some parts could be left out to make it more clear to the reader, but overall it was a walk I will never forget. Prior knowledge of the mathematical crisis in early 20th century is required, though."
286,0814758169,http://goodreads.com/user/show/21120599-lupin,2,"I gave this book a low score because I was too stupid to understand it.That might not sound like a very good reason, but if the intent of the book is to make Godel's Proof understandable to an idiot like me, then it seems reasonable."
287,0814758169,http://goodreads.com/user/show/77555133-wei-gao,5,"As long as you understand Cantor's diagonalization, you know where it leads to from very early on. But there's still an ""aha"" moment when Gödel's formalization of the problem finally lands. The intuition answers more wonders than I expected. Fortunate discovery, fortunate read."
288,0814758169,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5486088-seamusin,2,Generally well-written but not sure who the audience is; offers some mathematical depth but not enough
289,0814758169,http://goodreads.com/user/show/34783479-charles,5,"Really good overview, excited to read Gödel's original work now."
290,0814758169,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2746469-isaac-roberts,4,"If like me, you found ""Über formal unentscheidbare Sätze der Principia Mathematica und verwandter Systeme I"" to be either too abstract or too German, consider this exercise in hand-holding."
291,0814758169,http://goodreads.com/user/show/58083499-tinytim-timea,5,"A really nice way of making such an important ""discovery"" accesible to math-outsiders. If this would be thought in schools instead of the usual dreary lessons..."
292,0814758169,http://goodreads.com/user/show/51557600-josh,5,A delightful ride through the essential features Kurt Gödel's famous paper.
