0,1862077355,http://goodreads.com/user/show/28825839-stephie-williams,3,"This book is an attempt to explain, at least where at all possible, the seven mathematical millennium problems, which the Clay Foundation in 2000 offered a one million dollar prize for the solving of each problem. They are in order of presentation in the book: The Riemann Hypothesis, Yangs-Mill Theory and the Mass Gap Hypothesis, The P vs. NP Problem, The Navier-Stokes Equation, The Poincare Conjecture, The Birch and Swinnerton-Dyer Conjecture, and The Hodge Conjecture.The Riemann Hypothesis involves complex analysis and if proven true would solve the pattern of the primes. The Yang-Mills Theory and the Mass Gap Hypothesis involves quantum physics and its solution would be a big help to both mathematicians and physicists. The P vs. NP Problem involves computational complexity. If P can be shown to be the same as a certain class of NP, than it would be a big boost to solving complex problems by computer computation like the traveling salesman problem, which is the solution to the shortest route of an itinerary. If not, than we will have to settle for approximate solutions. The Navier-Stokes Equation involves fluid dynamics and if solved would help in things like airplane design. It would also have a bearing on Chaos Theory. The Poincare Conjecture involves topology, which studies what stays the same in a particular geometry after twisting or stretching, but not tearing. The last two are beyond even Keith Delvin’s ability to explain, as he fully admits, so I will not even attempt describing them.The book was okay, and I did learn something about these difficult mathematical problems. Delvin is a good expositor for the knowledgeable reader. I may have lost some of my interest for mathematical books aimed at the general reader, except books dealing with infinity, which is why I said the book was just okay. However, I am still very attracted to the philosophy of mathematical books; these books are not in the general readership category.My recommendation is for those who have an interest in mathematics, whatever your level of competency. If you know next to nothing, you will probably be lost most of the time; if you have some type of mathematical expertise, you should do just fine, I think, even in areas of mathematics were you might not know a whole lot. For those of you who are somewhere in between, you will probably get lost at times like I did."
1,1862077355,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8660547-ka-yap,3,"I read this book long ago. This is probably as close as one can get to give a light overiview of the seven problems recognised by the clay institute for a million dollar prize. The author here takes up an impossible task of explaining these problems to a lay audience. Even if he didn't entirely succeed in this, this book can be used to spark someone's interest for deeper study. Worth the read at least for the chapters on Riemann hypothesis and the P vs NP problem."
2,1862077355,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2952451-binit,3,"This book is an introduction to the 7 math problems designated by the Clay Mathematical Institute as ""Millenium"" problems and carry an award of 1 million dollars each. The problems are mathematically dense and I was able to follow in part perhaps that first four descriptions. The 5th and 6th were tough (I basically simply read through the 6th) and the 7th was completely impossible to understand. Though I think it is the nature of these problems and not a shortcoming in the author. But still it was good quick read."
3,1862077355,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4269925-john,5,A very inspirational book. Now I know what math problems I should start solving.
4,1862077355,http://goodreads.com/user/show/30325322-devin-nicole,4,"Whew, exceptionally difficult. The Millennium Problems remain the most difficult and important unsolved mathematical problems of the modern day (with the exception of the Poincare Conjecture, which was proved). Devlin does a nice job breaking down some absurdly abstract mathematics, although my math degree still had to do a lot of heavy lifting (and I still struggled with a a lot of the math). This probably isn't the best introduction for someone with no math background, but I am content with the knowledge that I can at least give a general explanation of each of the seven problems."
5,1862077355,http://goodreads.com/user/show/656942-david,3,"At the beginning of the twentieth century, David Hilbert gave a talk in which he posed 23 problems in mathematics. The solutions -- or attempted solutions -- to these problems became a major part of the story of mathematics in the twentieth century. At the start of the twenty-first century, the Clay Math Institute posed seven problems to serve as a similar challenge for another century of mathematical research. Keith Devlin, a writer of popular mathematics and the ""math guy"" on NPR's ""All Things Considered,"" undertook the challenge of describing these challenge problems to a general audience.The problem with this book is that Devlin tries to explain this cutting edge of mathematics to a really general audience. The explanation is too great a challenge. Devlin tries to lay out the basic setting of each of the problems, to discuss a little of the origins of each problem and why each problem is hard and interesting. But some of these problems are hard to even describe, and too often Devlin is reduced to saying that the problems are hard, important, and interesting without convincingly showing that the problems are hard, important, and interesting.I liked the book. I don't think I could do better. And still I was disappointed at the end."
6,1862077355,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7882235-dan,4,"A whirlwind tour of seven of the most important and difficult unsolved problems in mathematics today (actually, one of them, the Poincaré Conjecture, has been solved since the book was written).As an introduction, I think the book does a good job of imparting the general idea of each of the problems, even the Hodge Conjecture which in its full glory is well past my ability to comprehend without a few years of study. I recommend this book as a good starting point for getting an overall understanding of these problems.There are other accessible books devoted to at least some of the problems and they would be good follow-on reading. For the Poincaré Conjecture try _Poincaré's Prize_ (George Szpiro) and for the Riemann Hypothesis try _Prime Obsession_ (John Derbyshire)."
7,1862077355,http://goodreads.com/user/show/31945-conrad,2,"Yeah, you just TRY explaining superalgebras to nonspecialists in a small paperback book! I give them two stars for effort, but overall this book's a wash."
8,1862077355,http://goodreads.com/user/show/58127609-rod-innis,2,"I have included in my review a couple of quotes and my comments on them. Much of the book is very hard to understand for a non-mathematician. He does give some insight into his worldview as the following quotes demonstrate. Pages 179 & 180""In four dimensions the bottle would not have to pass through itself. To the person in the street, an object that exists in four-dimensional space doesn’t really exist of course, but this trivial objection does not deter the mathematician. After all everyone “knows” that negative numbers do not have square roots, but that did not prevent mathematicians from developing the complex numbers and, moreover, using them in practical applications. (He does not mention any practical applications) Much of the immense power of mathematics comes from the fact that we can use it to investigate objects that are beyond our conception in living creatures in a three-dimensional world."" (Are they investigating real objects or imaginary ones? What is the value (power?) in investigating imaginary objects which do not exist.)page 184""There is no mathematical reason to stop at three dimensions. You can write down equations that determine manifolds of 3, 4,5, 6, or any number of dimensions. Once again, these considerations turn out to be more than idle speculation. The mathematical theories of matter that physicists are currently working on view the universe we live in as having 11 dimensions. According to these theories, we are directly aware of three of those dimensions, and the others manifest themselves as various physical features such as electromagnetic radiation and the forces that hold atoms together."" (We are only able to be aware of three dimensions but because mathematicians can write equations using any number of dimensions, we are to somehow accept them as real? When authors invent things in science stories we call that science fiction. Perhaps we should call the same thing done in math “math fiction”!)"
9,1862077355,http://goodreads.com/user/show/81914868-deepak-kumar,4,"It is a book that attempts to explain the 7 Millennium problems ( which can be called ""extremely difficult unsolved mathematical problems for the Humankind"") by using more words and less mathematics. Out of those 7 problems, fortunately, One (The Poincare Conjecture) has been solved by Grigori Perelman(who rejected the $1 million prize) in 2006. Did I said ""$1 million""? Yes, apart from achieving the satisfaction of solving an ""unsolved"" math problem, Clay Mathematics Institute offers $1 million prize to the solver(s).This book starts with the basics, introduces the history, and formulate the problems in a layman language. If you just want to know where the frontier of modern mathematics currently lie, this book could be your possible start. However, if you hold or are working towards a (post)graduate degree in Mathematics, you may prefer to visit the website( http://www.claymath.org/millennium-pr... ) directly."
10,1862077355,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6161999-steve-gross,2,I don't think the author is a very good explainer.
11,1862077355,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7349312-andrew-y,4,The last two chapters shattered my delusion of being an amateur mathematician but the first five were pretty dope. 
12,1862077355,http://goodreads.com/user/show/75255552-ethan-gollings,5,Simplistic enough to attract many but complex enough to inspire the passionate mathematician.
13,1862077355,http://goodreads.com/user/show/71595-robert,3,Nice enjoyable survey.Even managed to make things The Birch and Swynerton-Dyer conjecture seem somewhat understandable.Not so much the Hodge conjecture though.
14,1862077355,http://goodreads.com/user/show/42505057-p,4,Quite good summaries of complex mathematical problems. It was a pleasant read.
15,1862077355,http://goodreads.com/user/show/487578-bryan,3,"The Millennium Problems are seven problems in mathematics identified by the Clay Mathematics Institute as being particularly difficult and important. A one million dollar prize is offered for the solution of each problem. The awards have something of a precursor going back to 1900 when David Hilbert posed 23 problems of importance to mathematics. Almost all the Hilbert problems have been solved. Only one problem from Hilbert's list makes it onto the Millennium Problems: The Riemann Hypothesis.The author does a good job of trying to make the problems understandable to the layman. But it's a difficult task. The evolution of mathematics and physics forces the cutting edge to be further and further removed from intuition and experience. The first five problems are not too bad. I could get the overall picture. But by problem six, it was starting to read like Greek. Problem seven is so difficult to explain that the author spends several paragraphs explaining and apologizing for how difficult the problem is to explain. He is not kidding. I would have done just as well to have read the sentences backward. "
16,1862077355,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5935582-dan-cohen,3,"Hmmm, Devlin takes on a tricky task in this book, as some of the problems described are so hard to describe (let alone solve!) that he admits that even he does not understand the problem. Having said that, he does an excellent job with some of the problems, such as the Riemann Hypothesis, and the introductory material in each chapter giving the mathematical (and physics) background is very good. He also provides biographical snippets for some of the mathematicians mentionned which helps to keep the book flowing. Worth a read."
17,1862077355,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4723937-j,3,"You have to appreciate Devlin's gumption in attempting to explain the hardest problems in the mathematical world to regular joes and janes, and he does a pretty good job. But there's no getting around the fact that he pretty much punts on the last two. I mean, he *sort of* tries, but he pretty much tells the reader that it's too complicated to explain. I hoped for at least a little more attempt."
18,1862077355,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10220978-sam-poole,2,"Devlin tries and for that he deserves Praise. The seven millennium problems are described as simply as possible, which is still too complicated for most folks (the last two chapters sent my head spinning and were the reason I took so long to finish this!). An interesting look at complex algebra and complex systems and a fun behind the scenes glance at the histories and culture of mathematicians. Try it out but be warned, it's a challenge."
19,1862077355,http://goodreads.com/user/show/55036860-pedro,5,Interesting read. A bit outdated if you read it in 2016 (as already one of the problems has been solved)but generally well written and complete. The author does a great job at simplifying a lot of the mathsand transmits pretty well the spirit of each problem. The book is not dense by any means and has a lot of background information regarding the history of each problem. I recommend it to anyone that is interested in math and math history.
20,1862077355,http://goodreads.com/user/show/62282689-tony-alleven,4,Well explained summary of the 7 unsolved millennium problems in mathematics. Each of these problems has a $1M prize for solving. Good luck to anyone on the Hodge Conjecture. 
21,1862077355,http://goodreads.com/user/show/381403-gwendolyn,3,"good but goes into too much detail...the diagrams are handy though. i would recommend to only read the first chapter and intro then if you want to read about a certain problem, to read that, rather than read it like a normal book."
22,1862077355,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1813018-geoffrey-lee,2,"Not too much ""meaningful"" information is given on the subject. Also, the author makes an error when attempting to explain cohomology in the chapter on the Hodge conjecture (he has the definition for exact and closed differential forms switched)."
23,1862077355,http://goodreads.com/user/show/168143-steven,2,"Some of the areas are fairly difficult to explain and I thought the author did a decent job providing some idea what these mathematical questions are about. Still, I thought he could have been more thorough with some of them, 3.5 stars."
24,1862077355,http://goodreads.com/user/show/23098490-ayoub-makroz,4,"Clear explanation of the most sophisticated and important problems of modern mathematics. It focuses more on the importance and history of the problem, rather than the technical side. It gives also the implications of having a solution for every problem. Great Book !"
25,1862077355,http://goodreads.com/user/show/308763-arlette,4,Challenging for non-mathematicians but mind-stretching.
26,1862077355,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3706540-marshaferz,3,"Ultimately I didn't get a whole lot of this, but I enjoyed trying. The writing is quite clear even though the subject matter isn't always..."
27,1862077355,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4315672-clark-lyons,5,This book really explains each one of the millenium problems in a way that is easy to understand. It was very informative.
28,1862077355,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7187953-steven,4,All but the final two problems make good book fodder. The rest are just too arcane to make a nice story.
29,1862077355,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1532635-chris-kemp,3,"Interesting book for one who has an interest in, and a little knowledge of, math. Skip the last chapter and a half if you are not a professional mathematician."
