0,0142004820,http://goodreads.com/user/show/573268-etta-mo,5,"i've now read this book twice and all i can say is that leroi has a rare skill; he is able to present dense scientific facts in a way that borders on poetic. his fascination with genetics is apparent in the loving detail with which he writes. i particularly loved the way he started each section with a tale from the annals of history, giving a very personal voice to each of the ""disorders"" he describes. "
1,0142004820,http://goodreads.com/user/show/244331-ryan,4,"It took a little while to get into this book. What I thought would be the most interesting mutations - like conjoined twins - were actually the least, which is perhaps why the author chose to put that chapter first. Honestly, the most compelling studies were of things that are not as obvious mutations, like size, skin color or aging. The scientific jargon can get a little intense at times, but it eases up as the book continues, and is worth slogging through. The author treats the subject manner with true humanity - managing to really present cases and histories without seeming exploitative, and explaining not only the what, but truly the why.I can't explain it, but somewhere along the way this book completely hooked and invaded my mind. It changed the way that I looked and thought about things around me. I'm not sure if there's a tangible explanation. This book is just elegant. It makes you realize the beauty and delicacy of the human genome."
2,0142004820,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4161819-rebecca,5,"All my life, I have groaned inside (and sometimes outside) whenever someone spoke about the ""miracle"" of giving birth. How miraculous is it, I would ask cynically (and overly confident of my cleverness), if flies and jellyfish do it? In fact, it's only one of the most basic functions living organisms perform, along with eating and pooping. After reading this book, however, and learning about so many things that can happen during gestation that will render the fetus unviable, I am truly amazed, first, that organisms are born with such basic similarities to other members of their species and, second, that they are born at all. I must admit that reproduction is, indeed, miraculous. Don't get me wrong, my horror at pregnancy has not lessened, especially after reading about the coat of hair fetuses grow at five months and then shed a few weeks later. (And I thought defecating while trying to push the fetus out was horrifying!)Read more . . ."
3,0142004820,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7013687-lo,5,"Trigger warnings!There are some things in here that aren't in your average book on genetics, so I'm going to make a little list of things to watch out for if you read this. If I've missed anything, let me know and I'll add it. The book as a whole is not offensive at all, see my note after the list. - fetal development and ways it can go wrong... This is discussed AT LENGTH, and it's not a bad thing, but I could imagine this being a TERRIBLE read if you're pregnant or have been lately.- discussion of research done on animals... It's not condoned by the author necessarily, but I can picture some of my vegan friends being really upset by some of the details of surgery on fetal rabbits or the many, many things done to mice to advance understanding of genetics.- super squeamish people will find parts of this uncomfortable, and there are a few disturbing photos... the absolute minimum of this is included, it's much less sensational than any other ""cabinet of curiosities"" type work, and the cool things you learn make it worthwhile. It's much less intense than a trip to the Mutter museum. But there were a couple of points where even I thought ""oh, god, that's... ugh,"" and I am not easily grossed out. When I was 12, I asked a doctor if I could have local anesthetic and watch my own wrist surgery.- racial stuff... handled in a pretty classy way by the author, but anything that discusses the history of genetics research is going to include some uncomfortable moments. This includes brief Nazi stuff, and other historical ""people did that to PEOPLE?"" moments.The most impressive thing about this book (to me, but there are many positive qualities on display) is how the author includes anything that will further the text, but nothing else. If I wrote this, there would be way too many digressions about the life stories of the ""mutants"" and scientists involved and it'd be an Erik Larson style 700 pages. If most scientists wrote this, it probably wouldn't include such a diversity of research and case studies and/or be so clear and plainly but eloquently written. Rarely is opinion mentioned, which is refreshing in writing on genetics; Nazi experiments on siblings, however, are appropriately called out as horrifying. It's impressive that this can be so illuminating and provocative without offending. As for what's great about this book, I hardly know where to begin. You'd be better served by reading it than the lengthy thoughts it inspired. If you read it on its own, you will find it fascinating if at times a little dry, and you will learn a lot about how genes make people. If, on the other hand, you have a background studying biology, evolution, genetics, biochemistry, or related fields, you will find it connects lots of dots and illuminates a big picture in a really satisfying way. Or at least, that was my experience. And if you make a habit of reading pop books about biology and science, you will probably (like most people here) be amazed how well crafted it is compared to anything like it. "
4,0142004820,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4339777-mark,4,"Near the end of this book the author pulls out the quote per molto variare la natur e bella--Nature's beauty is its variety--and it could be a motto for the book itself. Given that most of the book is about the human body developing dramatic abnormalities, usually during development, beauty is an odd word. I found some accounts difficult to read. But the ability for human biology to survive and sometimes prosper in so many different forms was just amazinga.The book is a discussion of various conditions that have very visible effects--dwarfism, giantism, Siamese twins, people with no hands or feet, people with hands and feet but no arms and legs, people covered with more hair than Chewbacca, and so on. Some are fatal at birth, some at a young age, but most are not. A surprising (to me) number of people founded lines still prospering today--so a Chinese sailor missing the top his skull and clavicles founded a line that has several hundred descendants with the same symptoms.If the existence of a whole family sharing such an unusual trait makes you wonder if scientists can do some sort of genetic analysis and figure something out about how genes interact with the body, well, answering that is the book's main concern. (Spoiler alert: Yes.) Most of the discussion is on gene expression and signalling pathways, in more detail than I expected. I'd call it roughly a Scientific American level of discussion. I'm not well qualified to judge the scientific soundness but in the small number of cases I knew anything at all Leroi seems to have done a good job presenting both conclusions and uncertainty.The title--presumably picked by the publisher--is misleading though, as many problems are teratogenic or even nutritional and hove nothing to do with genetics. (Thalidomide and iodine deficiency induced issues, for example.) I don't begrudge ""Mutant"" for eye catching value but throwing in ""genetic"" in the subhead continues the annoying trend in popular science writing of implying everything biological is genetic."
5,0142004820,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6948752-barbara,3,"If you are interested in biology in general, and genetics in particular, this is a must read. The science is explained with just enough detail to make it accessable to the average reader with a modest scietific background. The premis of the book is that we are all mutants, to one degree or another. The relatively small percentage of genetic mutations that cause catastrophic deformities are the focus of the early part of the book. At all times, the author treats those who have genetic mutations and deformity with respect, and there is no ""sensationalism"" that a book like this could have so easly degenerated into. Much of the material deals with the less obvious mutations that give the human race its great variety."
6,0142004820,http://goodreads.com/user/show/42112318-hanna-rehnstrom,3,"Okay, this ended up being a long review. Judging by the title I was afraid the contents were going to be wildly insensitive, and was glad to find that wasn’t the case. Throughout the book Leroi points out the absurdity in how humans throughout history have felt the need and right to categorize and label one another based on superficial appearance. This book is filled with historical perspective that is interesting to read about. Especially the section about Mengele and the horrors his “test subjects” had to endure in Auschwitz, simply due genetic mutations that manifest themselves as something outwardly visible, as opposed to the plethora of (scientifically) equally interesting genetic mutations that affect the inside of the body - or in fact nothing at all. However, I found the book to be somewhat monotonous. It often – not always, but often enough to get repetitive - follows a set pattern for each genetic variation: 1. Set the scene historically (repeatedly with a somewhat lengthy description of name-dropped white men going into “uncivilized territory” to find this “new human species” they think they’ve discovered and subsequently paying to purchase one of these individuals, often children, and take home to study in the safety and comfort of Europe)2. Discuss the discrimination, superstition and exoticism people with this particular variation have had to endure3. Further give historical perspective on several incorrect theories proposed as the cause 4. Finally reveal the biology behind the mutation, followed by philosophical musings (or ramblings), and onto the next one. Which in itself is pretty interesting. But… being a one-book-at-a-time kind of gal, I recognize that this book may not have been for stretch reading, and would have been more excited to read about yet another mutation if I hadn’t just done so many, many times previously without catching a break with another book. The author overall does an exceptional job of showing respect towards the individuals carrying genetic mutations. Only a few times I found myself bristling at – well, lack of social awareness and historical perspective, really. Which is quite impressive for a book so saturated with both. I also found it slightly irritating that Leroi kept dropping words in other languages without translating, leaving whole sentences lost on me. The writing style was pretty pretentious at times. I don’t know, perhaps I’m just miffed that I don’t know any French. "
7,0142004820,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1301544-megan,3,"The subject of this book cannot help but be interesting, and it has enough real science to actually feel as though you're going in depth into the topic of genetic anomalies. At a certain point, though, the voice slipped from that of a narrator leading the reader through interesting historical individuals and their accompanying genetics differences--such as conjoined twins and gigantism--into something more akin to a curious scientist dabbling in anthropology. By the end he's wondering whether, despite the obvious and acknowledged social and culture dangers of investigating the genetics of race, it would be worth satisfying our curiosity about it after all? I found myself feeling vaguely uncomfortable at certain points; his complete bafflement at the fact that a male pseudohermaphrodite would be attracted to women despite being raised as a girl would have been charming were it not so ignorant as to basic understandings of sexual attraction. He talked about male pattern baldness and cures for it, but never talked about female hirsutism except to mention that men don't find it attractive. He discussed red hair in the context of how attractive redheaded women are. His discussion of the history of the clitorus took place entirely out of the actual social context of the medical establishment's history of suppression and denial of women's sexuality. I don't know if I was being overly sensitive or just dealing with yet another male author unaware of his sexist world view and lack of familiarity with modern ideas about sexuality and gender. 2003 was not that long ago.Overall, an interesting and educational book, but I don't really like the author very much."
8,0142004820,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9707627-cj,1,"This has to be one of the most boring books I've read in a long time.I'm fascinated by mutations, evolution, DNA etc, and even spent last semester cutting and making recombinant DNA, but this book just bored me to tears.For people just looking for a 'freakshow' or whatever, look elsewhere, this book is not full of pictures, and isn't geared towards that type of crowd anyways, it's geared towards people (like myself) who are fascinated with how DNA works, and how errors in DNA can happen through translation and transcoding.This book is also full of very technical terms, that not everybody is going to understand, so if you haven't take some Biology courses, you're going to need to start googling some of the terms."
9,0142004820,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1622905-chip,4,"4.5. Extremely interesting look at mankind, what is ""normal"", and what is not. Chapters include: embryos, limbs, skeletons, growth, gender, skin and even aging (e,g,, mutations resulting in accelerated aging; query whether issues related to/resulting from aging are in fact the result of mutations not breed out of us by natural selection due to them, by definition, only becoming issues after people have typically already had children). Even the epilogue, focusing on ""racial"" variances and beauty, is fascinating. Won (justifiably) several awards."
10,0142004820,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2579781-paul,4,"This book was very interesting and thought-provoking and mostly avoids the worst excesses of popular science (though it indulges them somewhat). It sets out a fuzzy but definition of mutation and goes into a lot of detail about many topics related to the variation seen among humans - both one-off aberrations and some things that have become characteristic of lines of descent (ranging from small families to wide-spread characteristics).This book has an interesting style in that it is jam-packed with the kind of literary, artistic and mythical allusions that you'd expect more from someone in the humanities than from someone in the sciences. I generally find that sort of thing irritating or pretentious - it's bad enough when a literature professor does it and it usually borders on insufferable from a scientist - but for whatever reason it didn't bother me in this book (though I'm not sure I'd want to listen to too many interviews with the author...)Probably the greatest sin in this book is that, fairly early on, Leroi postulates something called the ""calculator of fate"" that makes decisions about how long bones or whatever should be and it was intensely annoying to me. The problem with this is that he is doing the annoying popular science thing of dumbing down a term (I don't even know what the scientific term for ""calculator of fate"" is - something I failed to learn because he has weirdly bowdlerized it in this way) but also he did so in a horribly pretentious way. From then on I was very prepared to hate this book, but it got a lot better after that, so we can chalk it up to a lapse in judgement.One note of warning: this book will definitely make you want to go to the Hunterian Museum in London. Coincidentally, I finished reading this on a plane to London, so I was every excited to visit this museum only to find out that it is closed for four years for upgrades or repairs or something! So if you're reading this earlier than 2021, be prepared for disappointment (and maybe look into visiting the Mutter museum in Philadelphia instead).4 of 5 stars"
11,0142004820,http://goodreads.com/user/show/549698-nathan,5,"Life is beautiful, but the process of creating life involves variation and some of those variations have horrified and fascinated people through history. This book alternates historical with contemporary understanding of mutants, to powerful effect. A book purely of ancient misconceptions (heh) of science gets dull quickly. A book purely of how we understand biology to work also gets dull quickly. The author's explanation of historical understanding, and the elegant science writing makes this book much easier to read than it could have been.The science writing makes its subject fascinating: the ballet dance of cells, the chemical flows of choreography, the cause-and-effect of markers, signals, and receptors. The historical accounts of scientific investigation into mutants from 1600s-modern times uncovers our mixed feelings towards mutants, the unpleasant treatment of people by scientists/anatomists, and the giant opaque fog of ignorance through which which we shine the weak lamp of science and claim understanding.Some notes:* Deformity taken as mark of divine displeasure* ""Des monstres"" by Ambroise Pare in 1500s marks first earthly (non-supernatural) cause of deformity (pregnant woman looking at something ugly, theory of maternal impressions).* teratology = science of monsters* Pseudodoxia Epidemica, or enquiries into the very many received tenents and commonly presumed truths (1646) by Sir Thomas Browne, the mythbusters of his day: that the feathers of a dead kingfisher always indicate which way the wind is blowing, that the legs of badgers are shorter on one side than another, etc.* William Harvey in 1642 was allowed to dissect deer the king had shot, so saw progress month by month of deer embryos. ""I saw long since a foetus, the magnitude of a peascod cut out of the uterus of a doe, which was complete in all its members & I showed this pretty spectacle to our late King and Queen. It did swim, trim and perfect, in such a kind of white, most transparent and crystalline moysture (as if it had been treasured up in some most clear glassie receptacle) about the bignesse of a pigeon's egge, and was invested with its proper coat."" Author of this book says: ""The King apparently followed Harvey's investigations with great interest, and it is a poignant thought that when Charles I was executed, England lost a monarch with a taste for experimental embryology, a thing not likely to occur again soon.""* William Harvey's ""De generatione animalium"" (1651) cover showed Zeus holding egg, egg with slogan ""Ex Ovo Omnia"" (from the egg, all).* ""mutations alter the meaning of genes""* ""each new embryo has about a hundred new mutations that its parents did not have ... about four will alter the meaning of genes by changing amino acid sequence of proteins, three of which will be harmful""* Ritta and Christina Parodi, conjoined twins. Parents prevented by Parisian authorities from exhibiting the girl(s), had to live in poverty, died at eight months. Body then heavily contested, eventually dissected in the big amphitheatre of Museum of Natural History. Made reputations.* ""Australian Aborigines inscribed a memorial to a dicephalus (two heads one body) conjoined twin on a rock that lies near what are now the outskirts of Sydney."" (1300BC)* ""In a Kentish parish, loaves of bread in the shape of two women locked together side by side are distributed to the por every Easter Monday, a tradition, it is said, that dates from around the time of the Norman conquest and that commemorates a bequest made by a pair of conjoined twins who once lived there.""* la querelle des monstres -- the quarrel of the monsters -- was over explanations for deformations: was it God's beautiful mysterious work, or were they accidents? ""If bodies were clocks, then there seemed to be a lot of clocks around that were hardly to the Clockmaker's credit"". Preformationism (egg holds entire embryo writ small, containing its own eggs which contain ...) vs epigenesis (order emerges spontaneously after fertilisation).* Sir Thomas Browne called the womb ""the obscure world""* conjoined twins feature inverted organs in the twin: heart on the right, etc. 1 in 8500 infants are born without a twin but with their organs inverted. Most famous was ""an old soldier who died at Les Invalides in 1688. Obscure in life -- just one of the thousands who, at the command of Louis XIV, had marched across Flanders, besieged Valenciennes and crossed the Rhine to chasten German princelings -- he achieved fame in his death when surgeons opened his chest and found his heart on the right. In the 1600s Parisians wrote doggerel about him; in the 1700s he featured in the quarelle des monstres debate; in the 1800s he became an example of 'developmental arrest', the fashionable theory of the day. Were he to appear on an autopsy slab today, he would hardly be famous, but would simply be diagnosed as having a congenital disorder called 'Kartagener's syndrome'.""* Kartaganer's people are sterile and with poor sense of smell: cilia and sperm are driven by molecular motors that don't function because one of their proteins is encoded by a gene that is affected in Kartagener's.I'm not up to page 60 and I'm abandoning this note taking. The book is fascinating, the writing is gently evocative, clear, and engaging. [update on finishing]The book is exquisitely crafted: evocative writing and elegant construction. By alternating between the outlandish history (where it's okay to marvel at freaks, as our predecessors did), and the contemporary science (so beautifully described as to make us marvel at the details of miracle of life without feeling, as with so many biological science fact books, that there's so many details and so few principles that it's all dispassionate stamp-collecting), Lerois has created that rare thing: science writing that is both good science and good writing."
12,0142004820,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9078855-rachel,4,"[Book Review] Mutants: On the Forms, Varieties and Errors of the Human Body by Armand Marie LeroiWhere do I start. This is definitely one of the more fascinating and weird books I’ve ever read. If you enjoy reading about conjoined twins, hermaphrodite types, people with missing body parts (eg. cyclops, or too many parts eg. a three boobed woman), the Elephant Man, dwarfism, albinism, piebaldism, then this book is for you. The many illustrations throughout the book shed light on the variances of the human body.Seeing the words ang mo and Singapore appear in the same sentence in this book did not fail to amuse. I also learned about myxedematous cretins; people with growth and developmental delay due to congenital hypothyroidism, resulting in them being in their 20s and still pretty much resembling toddlers.I‘d borrowed this intriguing book from a friend back in secondary school and read it then, but only actually got my own copy late last year (it turned out to be autographed). Memorable parts of the book did jump out at me nonetheless.Mutants was an intelligent, enjoyable and eye-opening read about genetic mutations, disorders, and the amazing varieties of human bodies and body parts. The book truly felt like a jurisprudence class, biology class, bioethics class, Latin class, French class, medicine class, sociology class, history class and geography class all rolled into one.As the author muses, “Each new embryo has about a 100 mutations that its parents did not have. These new mutations are unique ... acquired while these cells were in the ... gonads and were not present when the embryo’s parents were themselves embryos. Of these 100 mutations, about 4 will alter the meaning of genes by changing the amino acid sequences of proteins. And of these 4 content-altering mutations, about 3 will be harmful. ... No one completely escapes this mutational storm ... Who, then, are mutants? There can be only one answer, and it is one that is consistent with our everyday experience of the normal and the pathological. We are all mutants. But some of us are more mutant than others.”"
13,0142004820,http://goodreads.com/user/show/259202-audacia-ray,3,"I'm not a dumb lady. But science hasn't really ever been my thing (which is why it's funny that I teach my human sexuality course in a biology department). I've been wanting to read more science stuff but also a little apprehensive about it, so a book about genetic mutations with a cover as awesome as this one was just what I needed. There were pieces of the book that lost me a little bit in their attention to scientific detail, but overall the writing was sharp and often funny, as well as thoroughly thought provoking. The line between mutation and evolution is a thin one indeed, and that's just a piece of what made this book so intriguing. If you want to just dip into this book, you can totally read a chapter here and there. There isn't really a big thread through the whole book, so no reason to feel obligated to read cover to cover. Except that you just might want to read all of it - I did.My absolute favorite chapter was the one about skin (""A Fragile Bubble""). Leroi teases out fascinating threads about race, culture, and the meaning of hair through this chapter. Plenty of food for thought. The reason I didn't give the book more than three stars is that the chapter about sex made me kind of furious. There is some really beautiful writing in the chapter about intersex conditions, plus some great historical illustrations. But the underpinings of the chapter are fucked up: Leroi keeps using the word ""gender"" to mean the biological manifestation of reproductive organs. No. No. NO. Ugh - I really don't understand how competent (though I guess that's questionable) writers/researchers mix up sex and gender, especially in the biological context. Though there has been some (inconclusive) research about the link between gender identity and biological sex (the latter is the combination of hormones, chromosomes, and genitals - so the identified sex at birth doesn't always correspond to biology), gender is an innate sense of being, NOT explicitly biological. Point being, Leroi keeps writing ""gender"" when he should be using the word ""sex"" - and it made me want to scream. It also seems like he couldn't really flex his head around issues of queer identities and orientations, which is a pity in an otherwise pretty awesome book. "
14,0142004820,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7413967-karen,5,"Every once in a while I come across a science book by accident that are absolutely incredible. This is one such book. I teach physiology and pathophysiology at a university in Utah, but I always am looking for good books on genetics. I liked the way the author approached this from a different and less straight-forward point. In using people with differences such as children with one eye that we call 'cyclops' and explaining how things go wrong in the genes, Leroi provides an excellent illustration of what needs to go right in the body in order to achieve an acceptable two eyes in the normal face. How it fails, brings on the cyclops condition. I always mix history with my teaching about the body, because in neuroscience (my background) you learn the more ways you connect information to multiple parts of the brain through using stories, humor, etc the more likely the students are to remember what they are learning. That's what this book provides. Usually genetics can be a very long-winded and difficult thing to understand. But books like this makes much of this information available to everyone in a different format. I had to laugh with another reviewer who stated if her textbooks were like this she would actually read them. This is so true about textbooks, and I've been saying this for years. People who write textbooks, write them for their peers and not for the students!"
15,0142004820,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3205057-anita-dalton,5,"I am decidedly a liberal arts kind of woman. I managed to cram enough science into my head to make it (barely) through college and then promptly forgot all of it. Much science seems like magic to me, a sentiment that makes me sound really dumb, but I’m okay with that (though I do need to mention that I understand how magnets work). So it was a little bit of a shock when I realized this was not a book about carny folk and old side-show acts that featured “freaks.” I was intimidated by the book and put off reading it.When I finally picked this book up and gave it a try, it was a marvel at how accessible this book made biology and genetics to a non-science person like me. Moreover, it was an engrossing book, as well. Biology in the micro is a dramatic thing and as Leroi makes the science clear enough that even I can understand it, he shows the drama that takes place in our genetic code. I wish this book, clear and elegant, had been my college biology text. I sure would have enjoyed the class a lot more. Read my entire review here."
16,0142004820,http://goodreads.com/user/show/848951-katia,5,"This was a fantastic book about the neverending variations in human genetics. Although the subject matter could have come across as prurient or voyeuristic in another author's hands, Leroi treats each case with dignity and class. The actual ""mutants"" are not the focus of this book - instead, it is an in-depth examination of the scientific basis of each mutation and the variability that makes us all human. Highly recommended for both scientists and laymen...best science book I've read since A Short History of Nearly Everything by Bill Bryson."
17,0142004820,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10804323-andy,5,"This is a beautifully written elucidation on the effects of variations in the development of the human body. It is by turns technical, philosophical, moving and terrifying, given that the small variations in proteins, cells and enzymes driven by genetic variation can have such startling effects.I came away from this book with a renewed awe about the complexity of life and the incredible details and hazards of an individual human being built successfully in the womb: the amazing thing for me is not that mutations occur and cause damaging variations, but that out of the immense complexity and the vast odds we can emerge viable, functioning organisms at all. Life is a miracle that we mostly take for granted."
18,0142004820,http://goodreads.com/user/show/21291606-joan-concilio,3,"There is a lot of truly fascinating information here about embryology and genetics, and some of the examples of the ""mutants "" of the past are exceptionally well done. I was expecting more story and less scientific paper, which is why I'm only rating it three stars, for being a bit dense to read in some parts. (I rate myself no slouch in the science department, so if I say it's dense, I really mean it.) But I have to be clear that it's a great piece of work on this topic and well worth the effort."
19,0142004820,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3032005-courtney,5,"This is a great book for someone with a little bit of background in genetics, or possibly none at all. Leroi is fabulous at describing the biological processes that result in a variety of mutations. I took issue with the chapter on sex and gender, which treats those with mutations related to sex and gender as freaks to be pitied, while the rest of the book is much more respectful of genetic variation."

Definitely a little too technically scientific for a non biologist as myself and I did skip over some parts, but the mutations were so interesting, I persisted. Don't read if you're pregnant or wanting to be, I think this would give some people nightmares. It does me feel that life is a miracle though, when so much can go wrong in the creation of it. "
21,0142004820,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4079088-sharon-ryan,5,"I bought this book because of my interest in the old sideshow/freakshow culture and wanted to learn more about the how and why these things happen. I feel it promotes critical thinking, and now especially with wild propaganda photos running rampant on the internet and social media, and increases one's ability to distinguish between fact and undocumented, un-researched, ""shocking"" propaganda posts."
22,0142004820,http://goodreads.com/user/show/241439-beth,5,"This is a beautifully written book that examines western societies' understanding of genetic mutation, balancing historical interpretation through a lens of faith with modern science that was interesting enough to make me angry when I got interrupted while reading.

25,0142004820,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4356381-troy,3,A very interesting look at mutations and genetics. Lots of cool anecdotes throughout the book which adds greatly to the understanding of the various mutations that are discussed. The topics are discussed in a manner which is respectful while still being intriguing and insightful.

27,0142004820,http://goodreads.com/user/show/207567-julie,2,I pretty much read this for the grotesque factor. Had some decent history and genetic information but I was trying to get to the gross stuff and skimmed over it.

31,0142004820,http://goodreads.com/user/show/17410260-ashley,3,"Best for: People with a strong science background but who maybe stopped studying it after high school or early college, so still get most of the basics but want some more specifics.In a nutshell: Exploration of the causes of different genetic mutations in humans.Line that sticks with me: N/AWhy I chose it: I was in a science and technology bookstore and the topic caught my interest.Review: What causes our genes to act up? Why are some twins conjoined? Why do some people grow to be three feet tall, while others are much taller? Why are some covered in hair? This book seeks to explain, as the subheading suggests, “genetic variety and the human body.” On paper, this book should have been great for me. It’s non-fiction and it involves medical issues. It has interesting illustrations. But I found parts of it to be a challenge to read, and it’s mostly because it’s over my head. The book has what appears to be accurate information, and author Leroi has obviously done a ton of research into the topic. But it feels more like a well-written text for a 200-level college course than a book that someone who hasn’t taken biology in well over 20 years can easy absorb.That said, there were parts that were quite fascinating. I found the vignettes of individuals who had the particular genetic profiles being discussed in a given chapter to be interesting. Nearly all are about people from centuries past (I don’t recall any contemporary ones), I suppose perhaps to avoid creating some challenges for people who are still alive. I’m still unsure about the title. I think I associate the word with the X-men now, or with something negative, when in reality the genetic differences Leroi discusses are often value neutral. Leroi has the challenge of walking the line between sensationalizing the lives of people who were often, in the past, treated poorly and providing information about what, at a cellular level, brings these genetic difference about. To that end, I think both the title and the cover miss the mark a bit.If the book sounds interesting but you’re hesitant because you think it might be too full of jargon for you, I suggest skipping the chapter on Limbs. I think that was the wordiest for me, and the least interesting. It’s also where I almost gave up, but I’m glad that I pushed through to finish it."
32,0142004820,http://goodreads.com/user/show/18840302-adelyne,4,"(+) A beautiful account of how mutations cause disease, interlaced with historical accounts which gave the book a nice flow.(+) Nicely chosen examples, typically one per chapter, which addresses a specific theme. The historical description of the examples, often complete with pictures, provided a nice touch which made the book less dry to read.(+) Chapters are balanced and structured in a similar manner for each theme. (-) A bit more long winded than it needed to be, but this is coming from someone who is more used to scientific writing which is more direct.Overall: A beautiful account and a nice book to read, one of the best public science books covering genetic mutations that I’ve read. It is one that you need to sit down and read an entire chapter at a time – I tried reading bits and pieces on a commute and it was quite hard to put the story together. The chapters are relatively independent of one another, although there is the odd reference made to previous themes, and cover topics of general interest so should be accessible to all. Quality between the chapters is very consistent – there wasn’t any particular chapter I particularly liked or hated as can be the case with these sorts of formats. The writing is a bit too long winded for my liking, but an excellent read nonetheless. 4.5 stars (4 as Goodreads doesn’t have half stars and it didn’t quite appeal to me sufficiently to get a 5). "
33,0142004820,http://goodreads.com/user/show/22979587-abby-goldsmith,5,"If textbooks were written like this, I would seek them out! Although this book is not just about biochemistry and genetics. It's also an engagement with history and anthropology, all packaged together in what is basically a narrative op-ed about a field of science which clearly fascinates this author and his intended audience. Trigger warnings are appropriate. This book contains descriptions of inhumane experiments on humans and on laboratory animals. (The depictions are addressed with sensitivity, and are not gratuitous or graphically detailed.)I consider myself pretty well-read and well-educated, yet this book surprised me with quite a lot of factoids which I had never stumbled across. I'd expected a dry run-through of things I already knew; a book that would put me to sleep at night. Instead, I found myself up late and turning pages. I found myself cross-referencing with internet searches to learn more. The mutations and polymorphisms covered at length include: Embryonic development and the results of errors in that early development, size and skeletal structure, skin and pigmentation, sex and gender, and aging."
34,0142004820,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5961369-christopher-donaghue,5,"This is one of those books that I am simply so sad to see end. So sad, indeed, that I emailed the author last night asking if there was any chance of seeing an updated version coming out soon. He said no :'(History, science, and the history of science. The trifecta. I would recommend this book highly to everybody, but I would also suggest that it would have much more meaning to people with a mild familiarity (which is all I have, in the case of the latter) with genetics and embryology, for such terminology as ""recessive"" and ""primitive streak"" may be quite alien to laymen. But that is not to say that it is not still a very accessible book for the lay population, for such vocabulary is only a small part of the overall book."
35,0142004820,http://goodreads.com/user/show/38003262-regina-cattus,3,"I kept thinking ""and now it'll get onto the main part"" and then kept being a little underwhelmed. My own expectations for the book aside, it had a lot of interesting medical enigmas and their explanations, with an unsurprisingly high frequency of acronyms and scientific concepts. I was mostly okay with these since I am a biologist, and I was ridiculously pleased with myself every time a recognised when he was referencing to an earlier gene or part of the embryo. It does progress logically from embryology to gerontology and the various mistakes in-between. I would especially recommend this half wry half dry work out nonfiction to trainee doctors etc who have just been introduced to the complex science of embryology."
36,0142004820,http://goodreads.com/user/show/28424883-caity,3,"I’ve had this book for a while and have really been looking forward to it. It is essentially a non-fiction book focussing on varieties of genetic mutations and notable cases of these mutations throughout history. Armand Marie Leroi has a beautiful writing style and explains things beautifully. HOWEVER. It had a surprising amount of focus on ancient philosophy, religion, mythology, and other similar topics. Don’t get me wrong, I’m fascinated by these things, I just wasn’t expecting so much of it to feature in this book. I expected it to focus more on the cases of mutations and their explanations.Still enjoyed it though and will potentially revisit when I’m more in the mood for it."
37,0142004820,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2946583-gwen---chew-digest-books--,4,"Fascinating and intensive. I will not lie, this is deep genetic and embryonic science that can get pretty wordy and boring if you aren't ready for it. I was expecting something lighter, not circus freak light, but not as filled with scientific morsels as it was and that took me a chapter to get into as well as remember my last related Biology classes. (It's been a minute...or an hour...or a couple of decades!)Once I got into the dense reading, it was energizing to learn more about mutations and how far scientists have come since I've studied the basics; it's light-years. Overall this is a very respectful and informative read."
38,0142004820,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3417175-mentalexotica,3,If you are not of a scientific gent be patient with yourself and this book. It does test your ability to comprehend unfamiliar terms and contexts. But if you persevere you are likely to be richly rewarded with stories that are both fantastical and macabre while being stunningly scientific. Personally I was lost at several points which led me to abandon the book time and again. Only to return to it with a deep breath and new resolve. I have not been successful but I do see the value of this knowing had I been consistent. Leroi writes with a poetic rare to non-fiction and brings the dead to life. Pun unintended.
39,0142004820,http://goodreads.com/user/show/22562696-quinn-strange,5,"Every once in a while I read a science book. This had been on my wish list since May 2014 and I am SO glad I finally got to it. It maybe some pretty involved subject matter but it’s the opposite of dry. It’s understandable, fun, even often funny, and the (awesome) personality of the author shines through, which is so rare in nonfiction. If this guy was my teacher I would have loved biology class. You should also know that his subjects are treated with nothing less than total kindness and respect. I loved every word of it. 10/10. "
40,0142004820,http://goodreads.com/user/show/63839854-blake,5,"Leroi's work is basically a storybook of genetic marvels and conundrums that humans have encountered through the ages, buttressed by the contemporary data in the relevant fields of genetics, anatomy, pathology, and others. He explains terms and concepts very well for non-specialists, but anyone, specialist or not, can enjoy this if they have even an inkling of interest in the subject. All in all, awesome."
41,0142004820,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4811363-dejah-thoris,4,"Excellent reading and incredibly enlightening if you can follow the detailed science of teratology. Unfortunately, there's not much biographical or cultural information about the most common mutations, so I would only recommend this book for hard science readers. I have gained a greater appreciation of the pro-life stance, however, after finishing it."

55,0142004820,http://goodreads.com/user/show/59392924-jenna-hill,4,"The book I have read for my independent non-fiction reading book is Mutants by Armand Marie Leroi. This book is about multiple studies and research on genetic mutations. It tells stories of people with genetic mutations and scientists who study genetics. The book explains how the genetic mutations occur and how it affects the person who has the genetic mutations.	I would recommend this book if someone has an interest in biology or science in general. I liked that the book went into detail on how the mutations had taken place and that it gave stories that showed the mutations and how it had affected the people. I didn’t like that it had got boring during some parts of the book, but overall if you do like biology you will be interested in this book."

But then I took anatomy and physiology and realized I have a spectacularly crappy memory and I was never going to make it in med school. I never lost my interest, though, and I love this book so much for its layman's approach to the topic. The explanations as to why the human body sometimes goes off track in development are absolutely fascinating and easy to follow. I would love nothing more than to read a dozen books like this by the same author. My second favorite nonfiction read of 2016."
57,0142004820,http://goodreads.com/user/show/26152209-willy,5,"A beautifully written account of human embryology, human genetics, and human variety/diversity. This might be the best-written popular science book I've ever read.The author describes Siamese twins, gigantism from pituitary tumors, dwarfism from a variety of conditions, all kinds of abnormalities of development that result in varying limb placement and number, and the more subtle genetic disorders that strike in old age. Then the more prosaic human variety that goes unnoticed-- the thousands of polymorphisms that people differ by, variations in skin tone and height among different populations, differences in limb proportions, immunological differences that are remnants of powerful natural selection for or against certain pathogens. All of the fascinating examples that the author depicts are used as case studies on human developmental biology, population genetics, and everything that must go right for a functioning human being to be born and develop. More than that, the social context of the people who suffered from such disorders is described in great detail and with wonderful style. You can get a sense of the fascination, fear, and disgust that people from many cultures held for those who were obviously different. We read about the prized role of the Italian Castrati, whose castration and subsequent peculiarities (among them the preservation of a pre-pubescent voice) shed light upon the various roles of testosterone in human development. Then the darkly humorous fate of a woman from a family that were all extremely hairy-- ""By then she was a mature woman who looked much like her father, long since dead. Silky hair flowed over her face, leaving only her eyes and lips exposed...She had married- Bagydaw's [the King] successor, perhaps out of intellectual curiosity, had offered a reward to any man who would have her"". The book, though it is often grim, has a number of funny passages: On anthropology's long history of questionable classification:""Pale and proud of it, nineteenth-century European anthropologists typically ordered humanity by skin color. Perhaps unsurprisingly, scholar from elsewhere have often seen matters differently...Chinese anthropologist made maps showing which of the world's people were or were not hairy...Qing commentators also compared European visitors to macaques, a pleasant tradition that persists in Singapore, where foreigners are still called...'red-haired ape'""On questionable evolutionary explanations for Albinism' high frequency in relation to it's suspected high fitness cost: ""Some geneticists have suggested that one reason for the high frequency (1 in 200) of albinism among the Hopi Indians of Arizona is that albino men, excused from working in the fields, stay at home and therefore dally among the women. But the evidence for this seems to rest on the charms of one old Hopi gentleman who was reputed to have fathered more than a dozen illicit children.""On the advantages of height:“There have been forty-three US presidents, and forty of them have been taller than the average American male...Voters actively choose height as well: forty of the forty-three election-winners have been taller than their closest rivals”On population differences in height, from both genetic and environmental factors:“The enormous differences among people from around the globe show that the size we are is very malleable.” The author references the various ‘Pygmy’ (where Pygmy refers to groups of people that whose men, are, on average, about 4’11 feet tall), groups that are found all over the world, from Africa to islands of the Indian Ocean and the South China Sea. One of the more mysterious things about those groups is that they are not especially closely related to each other. The Mbuti from the Congo, the Andamanese from the Philippines,and various shorter groups of people in New Guinea are not at all that closely related. They are also not the result of any single mutation, and don’t have any of the features associated with most kinds of dwarfism-- modified limb proportions, joints issues, etc. The author covers such a huge variety of interesting topics that it’s hard to do justice to the book’s breadth. It ranges fro how sex is determined in humans and birds, the tradeoffs of aging, reproduction, and growth, the fascinating ways people can be different from each other, the beautiful and intricate dance of developmental biology, and much more. "
58,0142004820,http://goodreads.com/user/show/47169658-rachel,2,"This book has the potential to be so good, but is lost in the finer workings of genes. I think the authors best part of the book is when he speaks about people who suffer from the different afflictions. Unfortunately, he does not stick to this long and slips right back to DNA and genes. I feel like I could do some experiments on salamanders or chickens by the field guide he proved."
59,0142004820,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2031057-ugh,4,"This is at times an uncomfortable read, as it approaches its subject of human developmental biology through specific examples of what can go wrong when genetic abnormalities occur, complete with pictures. However, although the descriptions are unflinching, as they have to be in any serious scientific book, they're never gratuitous, and the tone of these parts is scholarly but compassionate. None but the most sensitive of readers should avoid this on those grounds.That said, I would rather have read the science without the context of the examples, as it's when Leroi unfurles the explanation for the attribute just illustrated that things really get interesting (the descriptions of foetal development in particular). However, no publisher would have given the nod to that book, as there's nothing unique about it, and so instead of having the facts in an easily digested narrative form I'd have had to dig around in scientific journals and sift the findings of interest from the muddying data and scientific jargon, and that just wouldn't have happened.So I liked the tone if not the approach, and the topics are very interesting, although most of them were fairly familiar from the days I used to spend trying not to fall asleep at the back of biochemistry lecture halls. What stops this book being great rather then merely rather good, my personal squeamishness aside, is simply that there isn't quite enough of that hardcore science content. I'm not saying that Leroi went too far in making this accessibile to the layman - not at all - but simply that I came away wanting a lot more of what I'd really liked, and I think that by the time you reach the end of a non-fiction book you really ought to be just about sick of the subject for the time being if it's done its job thoroughly. Mutants is tough going at times, but it didn't provoke any sick feelings, and in this sense that's just a little disappointing."
