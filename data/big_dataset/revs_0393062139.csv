0,0393062139,http://goodreads.com/user/show/175635-trevor,5,"If I’d read this about five years ago this would have been quite a different review. Don’t get me wrong, after reading her Delusions of Gender there is nothing, NOTHING Ms Fine could do that I wouldn’t think was potentially god-like. Delusions is an amazing book and you ought to read it first, before this one, in fact, before just about any other book. It is a necessary book in ways this one isn’t. I mean that kindly – but there are lots of other books on this topic, many at least as good, but there are no other books I’ve read on how gender is constructed in our societies from a scientific perspective that hold a candle to Delusions of Gender. Like I said, it is a must read.Now, a couple of weeks ago I found out that the Milgram experiments were involved in, well, what some people might call ‘data manipulation’ and to such an extent that it really calls into question the entire import of these experiments to social science. This is a worthwhile link to have a wee look at:http://theconversation.com/milgram-wa...It seems we are not quite as likely to be Nazi prison guards as was originally assumed, and I, for one, am rather pleased this is the case. We humans are capable of the most god-awful abuses and nastinesses – and worse – but I am much happier knowing that such unthinking ‘follow the leader’ behaviours aren’t nearly as all-pervasive as Milgram seemed to show. We may not have cause for much hope about humanity, but utter despair may yet prove to be somewhat of an over-reaction too.The part of this book, then, that must be read with the above article in mind is the part that deals with Milgram. One of the things that is repeatedly said in this book is that we are pretty hopeless at knowing our own true motivations. We get fooled far too often and often by ourselves. Part of the reason for this is that we have limited ways in which our bodies can respond to inputs. She talks about her sweaty palms while being nervous, for example – but also racing hearts and shortage of breath, that sort of thing. The problem arises, not so much in ‘real’ life, but rather in psychological tests where your emotions can be manipulated in certain ways without your conscious knowledge and then, when you are asked to explain why you might be feeling a certain way, the shrink can smugly smile knowing they are right and you are wrong. My favourite example isn’t in this book, but the couple of examples given here are interesting too. My favourite is about people who are hypnotised and told that when they wake up they won’t remember anything about what has been said to them, but when someone says “chicken” they will fall to the ground. They are then woken up (or whatever one does when one brings hypnotised people back from being hypnotised) and the conversation starts. It is going along nicely until someone says that they had a chicken sandwich for lunch and the stooge – I mean, psychology assessment victim/subject/object of derision – finds themselves on the ground. So far, the script has gone pretty much as the writer intended. But now comes the interesting bit. They ask said stooge/victim why they are on the floor. Not a completely unreasonable question in normal circumstances. What very rarely happens is that said stooge says, “Frig, no idea – I must be completely nuts”. Rather, they generally come up with a ‘reason’ for what, we can only assume, must seem even to them like completely inexplicable behaviour. They’ll say something like, ‘I’ve been thinking of getting some new carpet and …” or “Oh, sorry, I felt a little faint for a second there” or “Jesus, where did you get those shoes?”. The point is, as with all such stories, there is a clear cause and there is a clear effect and only the expert can tell you which is which.And there is my problem with this stuff. One of the questions she asks a few times during the book is basically, how can you know you are in a relationship that you ought to be in when all of us are so crap at understanding our true motivations for doing anything? In another recent review I talked about something a writer said about the difference between modernism and post-modernism. Modernism is based on the idea of radical doubt – it is the Sherlock Holmes perspective. Bad shit has gone down, there’s even a body to prove it, and someone is responsible for the dead body – there is a knife in its back, someone put it there. But they aren’t letting on that they did it and so it is up to Holmes, trusting no one, doubting everything, to try to figure out what happened and why. There is one truth, he is standing outside this particular world and looking in, and he will find that one true truth using all of his powers of pure deduction. Post-modernism is more like Phillip Marlow, the Phillip Marlow in the Singing Detective that is. The story is far too complicated, the teller is drugged and incoherent, they are involved up to their eyeballs in the story so that there is no ‘outside’ from which to look in, there isn’t one truth, the truth is relational and depends on who you are in the story and who you have spoken to and what you already know and what you have guessed, and the secrets you are keeping and the secrets no one is tell you, and the stuff you aren’t sure of, and also and mostly who you like and who you can’t stand. The truth isn’t one thing, it is very much situated and depends on endless very personal accidents. It isn’t that the truth isn’t ‘objective’, it is just that it is ‘relative’. So, while I do see that there is a causal relationship between the guy being hypnotised and someone saying chicken and him ending up on the ground, I’m not nearly so sure this means the ‘truth’ of this situation is the god-like perspective of the shrink. Yep, when you get to set up the rules of the game you get to see ‘causality’ – but in life you don’t get this perspective or to set up the rules in quite that same way. So, how are we going to use this particular piece of evidence of human frailty? If it is just to tell us that we are all stuffed in the head, well, you know, that isn’t really news to most of us. The problem with such experiments is that they reinforce the idea that there is a single ‘truth’ and that somehow we must go looking for that. But that is exactly the wrong lesson here. A much better lesson is that we are self-interested pricks and spend far too much time finding ways to protect our rather delicate egos. That, actually, can mostly be a good thing, but sometimes it is a really, really bad thing. Like when we ‘don’t try’ to do something well so we can have an excuse for failure (well, I didn’t really try). But there are very few things about us that are unequivocally good or bad. The problem is that everything is situated, it only makes sense from within the situation, and as such it is really hard to offer general advice when we live in the particular.That said, the bits of this that I really liked were the bits I’ve been obsessing over for nearly a decade now. Firstly, stereotype threat. Short version – people live down to the expectations of the social stigmas they are confined within. Stereotypes matter because they do damage to people by stuffing them in boxes they struggle to get back out of. This book provides as good a summary of stereotype threat as anything else I’ve read – although, really, read Claude Steele’s book. He’s the guy who did much of the original research into this and his book is at least as easy a read as this one.This book is a bit more jokey than Delusions of Gender – I really don’t mind that, I quite like people being amusing and there were a couple of times when she even made me laugh. But, I suspect some people might find this a bit off-putting. The stereotype is that serious books need to be serious – more’s the pity, I think, but you’ve been warned, this book might amuse you.Now, I can hear you already – McCandless, you’ve whinged about the book the whole way through your review and yet you’ve given it five stars – what is going on? Well, I still think this is a really interesting book and despite my reservations about what these sorts of books can really tell us or the help they can really provide us, these are still interesting experiments and they, surely, tell us something about what it is to be human. And if reading a book like this gets you to not be a racist shit – even once – that’s got to be a good thing. Even if it only makes you pause before being racist, even that is a good thing.Like I said, if you haven’t read a book like this before, this is a pretty good place to start. Other books you might find interesting are on my ‘Behavioural Economics’ shelf."
1,0393062139,http://goodreads.com/user/show/220791-lena,5,"I’ve come to see this book as a handy little owner’s manual for anyone with a brain. In an entertaining and highly readable style, Cordelia Fine has synthesized a host of cognitive research to show that our minds often give us a much more distorted picture of reality than any of us would imagine. Our brains, it seems, are masters of self-deception, engaging in a whole host of hidden activities designed to protect both our fragile egos and our pre-existing beliefs. While there are benefits to be gained from these distortions, Fine also spells out in detail the price that we pay when we allow our brain to keep us comfortably insulated from information that might otherwise change our minds. In one particularly compelling example, Fine discusses how a doctor discovered that the standard pre-natal practice of giving x-rays to pregnant women doubled the risk that the fetus would go on to develop childhood cancer. Her findings, however, were completely dismissed for decades and millions of children were unnecessarily exposed to x-rays while advocates of the procedure vigorously denied her claims. The techniques these doctors used to defend x-rays in the face of mounting evidence against them shows just how dangerous these self-deceptions can be, not just to us personally, but also to humanity as a whole. While generally light in tone, Fine’s book is very comprehensive in that each chapter outlines a specific technique of distortion used in the brain, discusses the research used to discover that process, and talks about the impact of that technique in everyday life. In “The Deluded Brain,” Fine reveals research that shows how we will rewrite personal history in order to fit with our expectations. This chapter has major implications for anyone who has ever spent a lot of money on self-help. In “The Immoral Brain,” Fine reveals the part of us that is programmed to blame others for their misfortunes so that we might feel less fear that those same misfortunes could befall us. This chapter goes a long way towards explaining how die-hard believers in “The Secret” could adopt the morally reprehensible position that the victims of the 9/11 terrorist attacks “attracted” their misfortune through their own negative thinking. While it can be disturbing to realize just how far removed from reality we often are, Fine also provides information on how we can use our brains’ natural tendencies to overcome some of its more damaging handicaps. Her examination of how disciplined dieters transcend temptation and how those who work with the disadvantaged combat the brain’s natural inclination towards bigoted stereotypes show that we do not, in fact, have to be at the mercy of our unconscious processes. At a time when the national debate on controversial issues often seems to be more about who can shout the loudest than genuinely trying to come to an understanding of opposing positions, I think pretty much everyone could benefit from reading this book."
2,0393062139,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1662632-richard,4,"As my friend Lena writes in her review of this book:""I’ve come to see this book as a handy little owner’s manual for anyone with a brain. In an entertaining and highly readable style, Cordelia Fine has synthesized a host of cognitive research to show that our minds often give us a much more distorted picture of reality than any of us would imagine.""I'd agree. Furthermore, it is a nice introductory text to anyone curious about this exploding field of ""Popular Cognition"" (is there a magazine yet?). The author, despite her PhD in Psychology, writes in a casual and breezy manner. While I think the dust-cover blurb describing this as ""rip-roaringly funny"" is a bit hyperbolic, the prose is definitely amusing—in a way. She seemed a bit like a more restrained version of Mary Roach; some of that same silliness, and plentiful use of her husband as a long suffering foil for her wit, but not descending to Roach's often juvenile depths.Those who have already read extensively on this topic might not find much new here, though. On the other hand, the book will be easy to breeze through compared to those tomes that investigate the neurochemical or philosophical aspects of how these crazy brains of ours work. Fine provides plenty of resources via her endnotes, but focuses on the ""what's strange about this picture?"" and leaves the ""why does it work like that?"" for other authors.She splits her book into eight chapters:» The Vain Brain: For a softer, kinder reality» The Emotional Brain: Sweaty fingers in all the pies» The Immoral Brain: The terrible toddler within» The Deluded Brain: A slapdash approach to the truth» The Pigheaded Brain: Loyalty a step too far» The Secretive Brain: Exposing the guile of the mental butler» The Weak-willed Brain: The prima donna within» The Bigoted Brain: ""Thug... tart... slob... nerd... airhead""And so she covers the various ways the brain 
mind
 
brain
 refuses to do what a rationalist might expect it to be doing. There were a few surprises—my personal favorite cognitive bias, the 
availability heuristic
, was never covered, which is a tragedy: it is such a fun and important phenomena. A few other cognitive biases were mentioned haphazardly in the ""deluded"" section; this makes sense, since they are way we innocently misapprehend what our senses tell us. But pathological psychiatric delusions were also covered in that chapter. That highlights their similarities, but does disservice to the kind of simply-plain-wrong thinking the brain is wired for. That our unreasoning behavior upon exposure to the word ""free"" (see Predictably Irrational) has roots akin to the Capgras delusion is important, but popular culture and mass media entertainment mean that the former has ramifications that deserve a lot more attention. I guess this just isn't the book for it, but it would have been nice to see more attention paid to how a lack of rationality deals very poorly with a consumer culture.A few highlights:You probably already knew this, but: first, you give a group of school children a fake test, then arbitrarily choose a few of those students as showing more ""intellectual potential"". Tell the teacher which ones did well, and those students will magically start doing better. You don't need to tell the students themselves: the teacher will start treating them differently, and that in combination with the student's response will be sufficient (p. 113).More on schoolkids: a group of students were provided with training on how to solve a difficult math problem. Half of 'em got a clear and helpful video presentation, the other half got one that was deliberately confusing which left them floundering. No surprise that the second half did less well; also, probably not much of a surprise that they blamed themselves. They concluded they were simply inept with numbers. Bigger surprise: the lack of confidence persisted even after the researchers showed them the difference between the two videos and explained the trick. Even three weeks later, their lack of confidence left them less interested than their counterparts in signing up for similar math classes (p. 117).Or: ""a woman’s expectations for how her relationship will turn out, for example, may ‘create her own reality’"": if she feels anxious about her partner's commitment and is preoccupied with the possibility of rejection, she will often behaving more cantankerously when minor conflicts do arise. According to one study, the relationships of these ""rejection-sensitive women"" were nearly three times more likely to fail, even in comparison to women who were of equal health and happiness (p. 114. Sound sexist? Sorry—that seems to be the way the studies Fine cited were set up).If someone were to tell you ""Congressman Smith has never been accused of pedophilia"", would that make you more likely to believe the opposite? Sure: if your mental capacity is being taxed, leaving you too distracted to consider the impact of the ""never"", your brain will happily lump together the congressman and the accusation without regard to the actual truth-value of the statement. So pre-trial publicity is often harmful to the reputation of the accused regardless of the facts (p. 122).If you want to manipulate your fellow players in a game Trivial Pursuit, trigger their ""schemas"" beforehand. This is the network of concepts that relate to one another in a kind of web. Say ""rice"" and the concept of ""Asian"" will be closer to consciousness; say ""elderly"" even if people don't think ""forgetful"", the idea will be more likely to be put into play by the subconscious. When a schema is about a group of people, we call it a stereotype, but from the brain's point of view it is just a way of saving time and energy. So talk to your own teammates before the game starts and off-handedly mention words like ""professor""; chat separately with the other team and talk about the ""Dumb and Dumber"" movies, or Jim Varney, or even Alzheimer's. Don't let any of them know what you're doing: folks that know their schemas are being activated will discount them (p. 137).OK, one more issue. Fine mentions this only briefly at 144ff, but I've got a bee in my bonnet.In the past few decades neurologists have discovered the puzzling fact that they can detect the beginnings of decisions in the brain before the person themselves has made the decision.In the archetypal example: the subject is told to tap one of their fingers on the table at any time in the next minute or so, and to carefully note the position of a clock hand when they've decided what to do.We would expect: brain activity starts peaking somewhere in the ""consciousness"" portions of the brain a tiny but significant amount of time before the person thinks ""now!"", followed by some kind of trickling of brain activity towards the movement portions of the brain (motor cortex), which then tells the finger to move.But the researchers can see the decision being made in the brain up to one-third of a second before the person claims they even made it!So what we get: a kind of brain activity now called the ""readiness potential"" is seen which indicates what decision has been made, then a bit later the conscious mind says ""Now!"", and then the motor cortex starts to get involved.So is this a big deal? Well, it has been for some folks. Some psychologist/philosophers have decided that we have no free will, because the conscious mind isn't doing the choosing (see here and here). From Wikipedia: ""Libet's experiments suggest that unconscious processes in the brain are the true initiator of volitional acts, and free will therefore plays no part in their initiation."" Apparently the late Libet and his buddies think there is something else in our brains besides ""us"" making our decisions. I don't know about you, but I consider ""me"" to include the whole triad—id, ego and superego. The fact that my consciousness is more of a back-seat narrator than the actual driver comes as something of a surprise, but the driver is still somewhere up there in my gray matter. Libet simply got confused because he has faith in the reality of ""consciousness"" as an ontological primitive. Geez, its stuff like this that makes one think that scientists have no common sense.Excellent book. Read it. "
3,0393062139,http://goodreads.com/user/show/223837-nicky,3,"If you've read much on the subject, this doesn't really bring anything new to the table, but it's presented in a readable, well-organised format, meticulously footnoted, and adopts a pretty light tone. If you're anything like me, you'll smile in recognition of some of the things she says -- in the middle of describing the brain's unreliability, Fine points out that precisely in line with what she's saying, your brain is probably insisting you're different. It doesn't apply to you. You'd ignore the researcher in the obedience to authority experiments, you can see through your brain's attempts to make you believe you're better than you are.(And if you're honest, you'll admit at this point that you do want to think you're different. My favourite bit was putting some of this together. For example, when it talked about experiments where people were told that extroverts do better at something, they went through their memories and pulled out only ones that corresponded with an extroverted image of themselves. On the other hand, I ruefully thought about all the ways I am a hopeless introvert -- thereby illustrating one of the brain's ways of protecting itself from failure, by providing myself with an excuse, i.e. 'if I'm less successful, it's because I'm not extroverted'.)Not revelatory, but pretty fun."
4,0393062139,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3089816-ash-moran,5,"This is a fantastic little book. It's split into six chapters, each of which covers an aspect of how the brain deceives your conscious mind about how it works. It's astonishing just how subtle and well-engineered the deception is. One set of ideas I'd never seen before was about brain ""schemas"", or closely related concepts that get ""filed away"" together. The ways these can be triggered, and the effect they have on our decision making, may have a profound impact on how our lives play out.Beyond the psychology content, this book is a great read because it's incredibly funny from start to finish. The author never fails to point out the irony or absurdity of the situations research has uncovered. But as she hints, you have to let the brain's attempts to deceive you continue, or you might well go insane. As such, a dose of humour is more than welcome."
5,0393062139,http://goodreads.com/user/show/75791892-caleb-abraham,4,"A fascinating account of how we think we think. At times, what the author reveals about our unconscious brain activity is disconcerting to say the least. However, she does not fall into a ""disresponsabilisation"" attitude. Rather, she shows that through realising how our unconscious brain works, we can strive to counter our psychological sins and biases."
6,0393062139,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11717318-brian,3,"A Mind of Its Own: How Your Brain Distorts and Deceives is a book about how the human mind is error-riddled, slapdash, and barely adequate to its task. Unable to deal with the reality that terrible things happen for no reason and with no way to anticipate them, we assume that anyone suffering from misfortunate must have done something to deserve it. Before an unlikely disaster we are willing to give people the benefit of the doubt, but afterwards we believe that of course they should have prepared for the miniscule chance that the bridge would collapse and that they're negligent in the extreme for not doing so. Our lives are mostly influenced by chance and the actions of other people, but when asked, we confidently assert that our successes are the result of our own hard work and good sense. What's more, when things go wrong for us we believe that it's the result of external circumstances impeding our actions, but when they go wrong for other people we breezily assume that it's due to their personality flaws.Emotions poison all our attempts to think rationally or critically about anything. Indeed, people who have suffered specific damage to the emotional centers of their brains are incapable of making decisions, and will spend hours agonizing over what tie to wear in the morning or whether to eat their spaghetti with only a fork or with a fork and a spoon. We give more consideration to the decisions and opinions of people we like and less to those of people we dislike, regardless of the content of those opinions. We frequently transfer our feelings from one subject to something completely unrelated. Indeed, the physical symptoms of arousal are the same regardless of the cause, and its up to the brain to interpret it based on our emotional state, which is laughably prone to errors.Our opinions change on a dime, and we're liable to like something when it's called by one name and then turn around and dislike it when it's called another. Statements are easily believable no matter their content, and even a blatant denial of something will stick in our memory and may end up leaving us more likely to believe the inverse of the denial. We resort to stereotypes at the drop of a hat, and even seeing words related to the stereotype in a totally unrelated context can make us racist or sexist toward our fellows in subsequent interactions.Finally, you who are reading this are at least 65% likely to murder an innocent in cold blood merely because a man in a lab coat told you it was necessary. And despite everything previously mentioned, we think that we're more reasonable, less gullible, more capable, and less culpable than others.I could go on.Also, I'm naturally a pessimist, so of course the message I took from the book is one of a fundamental human incompetence and depravity. It's close enough to what I believed anyway that my brain took the easy way out of just confirming my existing prejudices instead of bothering to actually update the schema I use to look at the world.Okay, that whole section was a bit flippant, but it is a pretty good summary of the book. The thing is, though, I basically felt the whole time I was reading A Mind of Its Own that it was just a more colloquial and less unified version of Thinking, Fast and Slow. Fine has a much breezier writing style with a lot more anecdotes, but it's less referential. Sure, there are plenty of footnotes, but one thing that annoyed me the whole time I was reading was that she never used the actual name for most of the psychological concepts she talks about. She mentions how people assume their own flaws are due to external causes but others' are due to internal ones without ever saying the words fundamental attribution error, for example. The closest she comes is mentioning the belief in a just world without ever adding hypothesis to the end of it.Thinking, Fast and Slow also does a better job of explaining why all this occurs in the first place, whereas A Mind of Its Own reads more like a eulogy for the concept of the rational thinker, which I think is another reason I preferred it. The former has a hypothesis about the workings of the brain that binds the whole book together and which Kahneman keeps returning to as he writes, but the latter is mostly just a list of everything that's wrong with you that you might not even have known about. They cover a lot of the same ground, but Thinking, Fast and Slow provides a structure for it all and A Mind of Its Own is just a bullet-pointed list.A Mind of Its Own isn't a bad book, but if you have to read one book about the cognitive distortions our brain throws up every day, read Thinking, Fast and Slow instead."
7,0393062139,http://goodreads.com/user/show/216284-mark,4,"You may have a much more humble opinion about your free will and ability to control your thoughts, emotions and direction in life after you read this book, which shares some of the same concepts as ""Blink"" in its examination of how many of our cognitive and emotional processes are hidden from us or ones that we deceive ourselves about. Dr. Fine is a first-time author with a good knack for describing the many psychological experiments she cites and a good sense of humor that emerges in family stories she inserts."
8,0393062139,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5847899-patrick,3,"[3.5]I found this an easy enough read although there was not a great deal in here that I hadn't read somewhere else, at some point, before. Which is not necessarily a criticism of the book as such – after all, the vast majority of non-fiction books are not about subjects that nobody else has ever written about before, and the theme of what we don't realise or recognise about our own brains worked well enough (on the subject of which, I rather liked her throwaway remark late on in the book about the difference between people who 'treat their body as a temple' and those who regard it as 'primarily a hotel for their brain'.)Nagging away in the background, though, I kept thinking 'what about the replicability crisis in psychology though?' How many of the experiments that she refers to in her book would stand up if someone tried to repeat them? And the trouble is, I don't really have the time or the energy to start trying to find out the answer to that question myself. I have a dim memory of having at some point read that some of the work around 'implicit bias' and prejudice didn't stand up to scrutiny but maybe I'm not remembering that correctly. Or maybe the studies I read about are not the ones that Fine is citing in her chapter on 'the Bigoted Brain'. And perhaps that points to a more fundamental issue which is that many of the kinds of experiments described in the book are enormously open to interpretation. Often, such social psychology experiments involve a kind of toy-town simplification of the real world, and knowing exactly what to make of the results us difficult. Even assuming that they are not enormously sensitive to context (an underlying problem with a lot of this research is that so many of the study subjects are WEIRD - Western, educated, industrialized, rich and democratic – and that the studies do not necessarily replicate when other subjects are used.But perhaps I'm being too negative about a book which I actually found rather interesting and which provides plenty food for thought even if it may be that not everything in it would necessarily stand up to close scrutiny. The idea that the human mind has biases of perception and what, in the software world, would be called 'bugs' seems perfectly plausible. And an optimism bias and a tendency to see the world in a self-serving way are almost certainly ones where the evidence stacks up. The old saw that most people think they are better than average drivers is doubtless true, and few people see themselves as the villains of their own stories..."
9,0393062139,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5161060-amy-alice,4,"Really enjoyed this book! Such a fantastic look at some of the ways that the brain has of surviving, and how that's not actually a true portalrayal of reality. Particularly chilling was the ""bigoted brain"" chapter that talked about how much our brains love a stereotype and the impact this has on even the most liberal of people. Like. No-one is safe. However it does offer hope in how we can over come it, although it takes a lot of brain training. And with the other traits of our brains (we assume we are better at things than the average person for example) it's quite humbling and eye opening. Only reason I didn't give 5/5 was because I found some of the chapters quite similar."
10,0393062139,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5492423-sara-sutliff,2,"Very ""pop"" psychology. This book was assigned in my psychology graduate class, Cognitive and Affective Behavior. As a grad school bog, it's honestly a little boring, as we know most of what Ms. Fine is talking about (how many times can you read about the same experiment?). But I doubt it was ever supposed to be used in this kind of setting. For someone interested in psychology, I'm sure this book is very informative. Ms. Fine's writing style is very refreshing from the usual psychology jargon we have to muddle though. She uses real life experiences as examples of our brain functions. "
11,0393062139,http://goodreads.com/user/show/104026247-melissa,2,"I did not like this book. I’ve read plenty of psychology books in my time, and this one is my least favorite thus far. The concepts, content, and ideas in the book are interesting. However, the writing style of the author leaves much to be desired. I found myself not wanting to pick up the book and read, and when I did, it felt like a chore. I’m glad I finally finished it. I wouldn’t recommend this book to anyone. That’s just my opinion. "
12,0393062139,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6768643-amy-rhoda-brown,4,"This is a terrific little book about some of the numerous ways the brain takes the wheel and relieves our conscious minds of the work of making decisions, passing judgement, and evaluating ourselves. Fine is a meticulous researcher and there are plenty of references, but the writing is fun and breezy.However, I wouldn't say this book is an easy read. It's written in a particularly English style that I find hard to characterize, but that relies on a large vocabulary and convoluted linguistic circumlocutions. It a lot of fun to read for those of us who are adept at English, but I imagine it's exhausting for the rest of the world.Here's an example: ""For scratch the surface of the moral judgments of mature adulthood, and the visceral inequities worthy of the passionate toddler can be plainly seen. Carelessly unattuned to the cicumstances of others, we can be as quick to conclude 'naughty Greta' as any stripling magistrate."" Basically it sounds like it's written by Moira from Schitt's Creek."
13,0393062139,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3226609-the-angry-lawn-gnome,3,"Bluntly, this one was a mixed bag. The stories and examples were amusing, though they did start to get to be a bit too much by the end of the book. I suppose what bothered me most was that there's seemingly no place for any actual thing such as objectivity according to her beliefs. We can do things to rein in the worst excesses of our ""butler"" (the unconscious), but as best I can tell per Fine we can never fully break free from it. I suppose I could have lived with that, if she had stopped there, perhaps concluding that all cognition should be treated as having ""proceed with caution"" signs, and all unconscious behaviors as at least occassionally subjected to a rigorous examination. Unfortunately, she does not confine herself in such a way. In fact, she seems to out and out disregard the above when it is inconvenient, or perhaps wishes to push a certain agenda. As in, she'll make claims like such and such was a ""well-designed psychology experiment,"" of course when it conformed what I took to be her beliefs. Could an experiment be ""well-designed"" if it did NOT confirm a closely held belief? And, anyway, how can she be so glibly confident in her ability to separate wheat from chaff in the first place? We're never told, or actually, what we're told is that this is exactly what we should NOT be doing. So, what can I say? By turns this one was amusing, though-provoking, irritating, hypocritical, preachy and at times downright arrogant. I don't regret reading it, and in fact learned more than I thought I would. Some of her examples were silly, but they also put things in terms a layman could understand. But... I still can't imagine I'll pick anything up by her again. My teeth can only take so much grinding in the face of hypocrisy."

That could be because it’s true, but more likely it’s because your brain is a tricksy organ of deceit. It lies to you so as to protect your delicate ego every minute of the day. It’s doing it right now … admit it, at this very moment you’re thinking to yourself “It just so happens I am one of those people who is smarter, funnier, more clever, better looking, more talented and more moral than the average person”. That’s your brain. It’s a lying liar and it’s telling you what you want to hear. Or maybe it tells you what you need to hear. If you woke up every morning to the realization that you are, in fact, a mediocre schlub with middling intelligence, an unexceptional personality and pedestrian job performance you’d probably stick your head in the oven (no doubt realizing too late, with your middling intelligence, that it was electric, not gas). A deceptive brain probably serves to protect us from despair, makes life more endurable and gets us to try new things.Of course, on the downside, it allows horribly repugnant human beings to have great self-esteem and makes those with the most despicable, demonstrably wrongheaded ideas lodged in their skulls absolutely confident as to their correctness (a quick glance at the on-line comments to any political news article will relieve you of any doubts on this point). This is why science, critical thinking and an ability to impartially weigh evidence are so important. These techniques provide the means by which we can avoid the pitfalls of having deceitful brains (as well as to avoid the lying brains of others). In A Mind of Its Own: How Your Brain Distorts and Deceives Cordelia Fine, psychologist and Associate Professor at Melbourne Business School describes some of the ways our brains fool us into believing things that just aren’t so. The topics Fine discusses in the book include:Your brain makes you feel good about yourself by elevating your successes and making excuses for your failures. Your mood effects your behavior and judgement (as anyone who has ever hit ‘send’ on an e-mail written in a pique of anger well knows). No surprise here. On the positive side, evidence shows that emotions also play a key role in decision making.Our emotions play a role in our moral perceptions. We judge people and things we like less harshly than those we don’t. Your brain re-writes history to fit expectations.Your brain seeks out evidence that supports pre-existing beliefs and discounts evidence that contradicts those beliefs (confirmation bias).It’s willpower is depleted by difficult tasks. Fine does a decent job summarizing some of the scientific results that has come from studying human behavior, albeit at a very high level. Overall the book was interesting, but lacking in depth or details. "

But, we really need to be aware of the fact that every single person is unconsciously biased in many ways and change our entire conversation about race/gender/etc. We can't get anywhere unless we acknowledge that ALL of us, every single person, has some unconscious bias and we ALL need to address it within ourselves.

40,0393062139,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1677868-steven-peterson,4,"This is a breezily and wittily written book on an important subject--the quirkiness of the brain and its functioning that often leads us to distort ""reality"" and deceive ourselves. It refers to a wide range of literature, such as that on cognitive ""heuristics,"" shortcuts that we use to make decisions--and many of which lead us to rather strange conclusions. One of these heuristics which Cordelia Fine mentions at some length is the so-called ""fundamental attribution error."" Here, one explains one's defective decisions in terms of forces or circumstances outside ourselves; when others do the same thing, we attribute their behavior to motives or laziness or some other internal characteristic. In other words, we cut ourselves lots of slack. This error is mentioned over and over in the book, to good effect. She begins the book with a sly way of expressing her thesis (page 2): "". . .the truth of the matter. . .is that your unscrupulous brain is entirely undeserving of your confidence. It has some shifty habits that leave the truth distorted and disguised."" This book might be considered in concert with Linden's recent book, ""The Accidental Mind,"" in which he argues that the brain, as a result of the evolutionary process, is not any example of excellent engineering. Fine's book plays with the same thesis in a different way. Some may be skeptical because of the writing style. However, whether she is describing Milgram's experiment or other research of which I am familiar, she does so in a way that reflects pretty accurately my understanding of those pieces of research. Hence, I appreciate the fact that she has made accessible to a broader audience important scientific research. One example of how we delude ourselves that she mentioned a couple times: those who support President Bush ignore the evidence that there were no WMDs and believe that the U.S. actually found them; those who oppose the President observe that there were no WMDs and the war was based on erroneous assumptions. Whatever your political views, the findings that she mentions clearly indicate that evidence isn't very relevant when one's emotions and feelings are at stake. We'll often distort ""reality"" to fit with what we want to believe. And our brain is a key part of such intriguing results. For those familiar with the brain and cognitive psychology and related fields, this won't tell you a whole lot that is new, but it sure is fun to read. For those who are not so well acquainted with the literature, this is a pleasant way of becoming more familiar with important work that is ongoing. "
41,0393062139,http://goodreads.com/user/show/619124-rich,3,"Overall, a well written tour of the many curious ways we deceive ourselves. Fine writes in a casual personable style that engagingly presents the broader implications of scientific studies for the ways we see and mis-see ourselves, others, and the world around us.Perhaps the most misleading aspect of the book is the way various studies are presented as the ""mind"" vs. the ""us"": the self is deceived by the mind; the self is served by a 'mental butler'; the self is at the mercy of the brain. Never does the mind deceive itself, it deceives 'you'. The subtitle of the book, ""How your brain distorts and deceives"" seems to have an implied ""you"" at the end, rather than an ""itself"". The structure of the book and it's chapter titles reinforce this; your vain brain deceives you, your emotional brain deceives you, your immoral brain deceives you, etc. The book is clearly conceived to show ""what your brain is doing behind your back"". I understand why Fine might have chosen this way of writing for rhetorical effect, but very unfortunately, this way of writing implicitly endorses the discredited notion of a Homonculus; a separate 'self' that oversees or is influenced by what goes on in the mind or brain. For a book trying to share the latest in brain science with a popular audience, this is a serious flaw. The book would have benefited greatly if Fine had leaned less heavily on this metaphor or included a section explaining how it IS merely metaphor.This does not mean that I did not enjoy the book or find it informative, however. There have been many popular books published in the last few years covering similar ground (Nudge, Kludge, Sway, Predictably Irrational, How We Decide, et al.). This book is a good addition to the field, even if not the best of the lot.For me, one of the best aspects of the book is the thoroughness of it's notes. While other popularizations have been better written, they have been somewhat lighter on their references to primary materials, whereas Fine carefully references her sources. That alone guarantees that I'll be pulling this one from the shelf more often than the others in the future."
42,0393062139,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1020983-benjamin,3,"In A Mind of Its Own: How Your Brain Distorts and Deceives, psychologist Cordelia Fine examines a wide range of empirical evidence suggesting that one's behavior is often greatly influenced by one's unconscious mind. A classic example involves showing subjects a variety of words, several of which are associated with the elderly (""wrinkled,"" ""retired,"" etc.). The subjects never consciously recognize a theme, and yet they walk more slowly (re: more elderly-like) after the experiment is complete than do subjects who are not exposed to these geriatric-related terms. Presumably, priming these subjects to think subconsciously about the elderly causes them to emulate, to some degree, elderly behavior.As fascinating as this research may be, this is all material that has been covered equally well in a variety of other books, from Malcolm Gladwell's Blink to Jonah Lehrer's vastly superior How We Decide. For that reason, there is little to recommend Fine's tome in particular. Not that the book is without strengths. Foremost among them is the straightforward organization of content, with chapters like ""The Deluded Brain,"" ""The Weak-Willed Brain,"" and ""The Bigoted Brain"" clearly demarcating the kinds of research that will be discussed therein. That being said, any advantage the book’s organization may hold is offset by Fine’s writing. The author is so determined to win over her audience that the first several chapters are virtually drowning in whimsy. The relentless and cloying cutesiness of Fine’s prose is almost unbearable, though, thankfully, it tapers off quite a bit as the volume continues."
43,0393062139,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1068763-grace,3,"Cordelia Fine's ""A Mind of its Own: How Your Brain Distorts and Deceives"" is an easy to read account of the myriad ways the human brain functions without us, the owners of these brains, realizing what it is doing. Fine discusses various aspects of the brain's personality (so to speak): the vain brain, the emotional brain, the immoral brain, the deluded brain, the pigheaded brain, the secretive brain, the weak-willed brain, and the bigoted brain. All of her arguments are well documented with various research experiments and easy to understand definitions of psychiatric or social psychologist terminology. She goes to great lengths in order to present this material with easily understandable examples and easily accessible prose. I thought her research and explanations were lacking in one particular area - very rarely did she discuss the parts of the brain these actions were taking place in, nor did she go to any great lengths to connect the actions of the brain to the geography and physiology of the brain itself. As this is a scientific book geared to the non-scientifically inclined, it would have been helpful if she had added these pieces to the overall brain puzzle. Sure, it is a book geared to the average person, and maybe that was her reason for leaving it out. But if the person didn't have an interest in the brain, he or she wouldn't have picked up her book in the first place, which makes me feel as though she underestimated the intelligence and the desire to learn of her intended audience.

There are many chapters that caught my eye such as, ""The Vain Brain."" This chapter dealt with what we think and what we do when we are influenced by self indulging thoughts and showed me patterns and experiments to prove it. This book in summary was an interesting read because it helped me understand my brain and the logic that goes through my decisions when influenced by emotions.I would recommend this book to anyone interested in how their brain works. It is also just a very interesting read and thought provoking. The author Ms. Fine is a mastermind with combining humor, wit, and hard facts.

More alarming is our brain's vulnerability to the information around us and the way it is presented to us at a given time. The book is a quick and dirty guide to mental heuristics and cognitive biases. Recommended for those who want to start taking people's brains apart (not in the Hannibal Lecter kind of way). Fine writes with humor — a great help when you're squishing a lifetime load of vanity. The squishing is not pointless. Fine offers quite a few solutions to our brain's shortcomings.

Cordelia Fine gives the layman an easy-to-read interpretation of conttemporary research, focusing on the brain's tactics at distorting perception in favor of coddling the ego. She uses a lot of personal anecdotes and some cheeky maneuvering to relate the findings to everyday life and keep people who hate reading entertained. I'm not sure (especially after having absorbed the information Fine presents) whether she backed off of this reader-pampering over the course of the book, or if I simply got used to it as I read it. Fine saved her most interesting findings for the second half of the book, and having never taken a college psychology course, I was intrigued to learn that yes, subliminal messaging does seem to effective. Other observations, such as the fact that bad weather makes people think their lives are worse than they really are, are hardly revelations. All in all, nothing profound here, but some interesting nuggets. And it's always useful to be reminded that our minds like to take shortcuts when it comes to finding truth. I try to stay on my toes when it comes to understanding the world, so this was a useful refresher."

However, Fine does have her own approach, and a winning style, so this is a book I have no hesitation in recommending.In fact, it's one of those which you wish everyone would read - especially 'conviction' politicians, preachers, and anyone convinced of the inherent rightness of their own opinions and view of the world. In a short and snappy (but evidenced and well-referenced) way, Fine demonstrates the ways in which we are deceived by our own brains. We protect our own egos; ignore evidence that doesn't support our opinions; invent evidence that does; take decisions for arbitrary and irrelevant reasons; and have more prejudices than we might like to think. All in all, our brains (for all their wondrous talents) are flawed and imperfect - and we'd do better to appreciate that.This book is a quick easy read which helps everyone to do that."

Although our minds are incredible, they are also at times incredulous. Each chapter provides convincing evidence (and amusing self  disclosures) exposing how--in the service of protecting our egos, core beliefs, and illusion that life really makes sense--our minds can be vain, emotional, immoral, deluded, pigheaded, secretive, weak-willed, bigoted, and vulnerable. (But, in line with the findings, we all think that these traits certainly do not apply to each of us as they do the general population!) Although most of the book exposes the dark side of the brain, Cordelia does sprinkle in some suggestions and techniques for taming some of of the mind's mind-blowing methods. Quite an entertaining, delightful, and mind-altering journey through our all-too-human ways of thinking!"

This is not the kind of book I normally read, but from a research perspective (writing character based fiction) I'm very interested in how the brain controls our thoughts and reactions.However, I believe the editor may have tactically stepped in to pull the strongest chapters to the front as these seemed to be the chapters which held the most weight, offered the most insightful neuro-scientific explanations and firmly set the tone for this book which essentially aims to explain that the reason our brain distorts and deceives is because it's for our own good, i.e. primal survival. No good will come to a person who doesn't think the best of himself or fight off threats which come in the yukky forms of rejection, insult and self-doubt.While the research is interesting, there are just too many, too similar examples to wade through and this left my brain aching and Fine's points over-laboured."

She presents her chapters on the different aspects of conscious and unconscious thinking in clever titles like these: ""The Vain Brain,"" ""The Immoral Brain,"" ""The Delusional Brain,"" ""The Pigheaded Brain,"" and even, ""The Vulnerable Brain."" Because she summarizes many psychological experiments by presenting them anecdotally or by relating them in common terms, her book flows well and can be absorbed easily. I think, as an aside, that it could be used as supplemental reading for an introductory psychology course.I will try to take the information that I gained from my reading and not be too discouraged about how fickle, unreliable and vulnerable my brain really is because I think (but am not sure) that I am better prepared to recognize when I am being hoodwinked...by my own thinking."

This is a smoothly-written collection and sorting-out of the psychological research of decades to create a picture of what we know about how our brains work. It turns out that a lot of things that we think we know about ourselves, we really don't have good reason for believing. I can't really do justice to the book in this short review except to say that the work that Fine writes about here is absolutely fascinating. Anyone who wants to acheive better self-knowledge, better knowledge of what others are doing, or better knowledge about the world more generally should read this book. Our brains often lead us astray, and to some extent this is unavoidable, but these are also effects that can be at least partially mitigated by better self-knowledge. And whether it can or can't be, it's still fascinating to know how things work and our best guesses at why. "

This particular one offers an inventory of the many ways in which we all fall victim to vanity, weakness of will, emotionality and biased stereotypes of races or genders (at one point my own ethnic group, the Scots, come in for some negative stereotyping). Chapter after chapter, I could not repress a grimace of recognition as yet another of my failings was exposed. Although the book devastates all our illusions of free will, rationality and impartiality, it does show that if we face up to our psychological weaknesses and confront them honestly, we can influence our unconscious (which actually is in charge) to align a bit better with our consciousness of right and wrong. I can't imagine anyone for whom this book would be irrelevant: even saints would have to admit that there's more to their mind than they might care to admit. "

Fine writes in an accessible chatty style like you're having tea with your best friend and she just happens to know several behavioral science experiments that explain why you can't lose that weight or feel a little down when it's rainy. Fortunately, each chapter features notes that link to weighty citations for those interested in her background material. But for those who'd rather just read about how their brain has been deceiving them for years, each of the eight chapters covers a different facet of the brain making for a fun and thorough read with a scientific basis. (The Vain Brain, The Emotional Brain, The Immoral Brain, The Deluded Brain, The Pigheaded Brain, The Secretive Brain, The Weak-Willed Brain, The Bigoted Brain, The Vulnerable Brain) Definitely a book I'd recommend to the layperson interested in psychology though I would've liked a little more neuroscience.

54,0393062139,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1414667-vicky,5,"So far ""A mind of its own"" is an amazing book that shows how irrationally we behave in our everyday life. The question is how far we can trust our brain or understand our thoughts. Cordelia Fine talks about the Emotional Brain, Vain Brain, Deluded Brain, Secretive Brain, Weak-willed brain and the Bigoted Brain and all of them are the same one that you have to cope with. With a lot of experiments to support her ideas the author proves that often we are not aware of what had influenced our behaviour and motivated our opinions. Our decision-making process is often based on a lot of stereotypes and delusions. The book does give us some hope of self-mastery - we have to train our brain into replacing unwanted and destructive thoughts. The author says that it is our duty to be alert of numerous influences that affect our decisions."

It could be just me. But I found myself struggling to understand the author's points. In each chapter, the high level ideas are clear: they are in the titles. But two things make it hard to understand the lower level paragraphs or sentences. One is the unnecessarily long, complicated sentence structures. This is fine in an academic paper, but isn't the best for a popular book. The other is the unnecessary humours, which aren't conceived in a way that helps readers understand. Instead, I often find myself struggling to digest the humours, wondering why they are supposed to be funny. This puts an extra, unnecessary layer.The content/topic is fascinating though, and very eye-opening. I really regret to give the 3 stars."
56,0393062139,http://goodreads.com/user/show/36409320-allie-s,4,"A Mind of its Own is about the brain and how it affects what we do. It's really interesting, especially if you have a fascination with the brain like I do. You learn a lot about how your brain affects you. You'll be nodding your head, laughing, and saying, ""I do that too!""The way the author talks makes you connect with the book. It's not just a book with a bunch of facts. She talks about her personal experiences with the different topics she talks about, and what she thinks about them.I love psychology, so someone who also loves it would highly enjoy this book. The words tend to be a bit SAT level, but if you're preparing for taking that test, it'll be great. But if you are one to read books with smaller words, this is probably not for you.It's a truly amazing book and has lots of interesting information on the brain. I highly recommend it to any fellow psychology nerds. "
57,0393062139,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1070673-margaret,3,"I like the way Cordelia Fine writes, but I'm finding the book a bit disjointed. But perhaps it's just because my brain is being over-emotional, or maybe my subconscious is telling me to put the book down and go to sleep. I'll have to finish it to find out what's really going on between my ears, though!...Just finished. I enjoyed the case studies, but I wished there were more...umph. I don't know. I'd read it again, if there weren't eleventy-bajillion other books to read, because I feel like I missed something. Ah well. If you're interested in social psychology but need something a little on the light side, this book is perfect for you. Not so fluffy as to be useless, but not so scholarly as to put you to sleep."
58,0393062139,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3098288-marc-johnson,5,"I really enjoyed this book, before reading it I had gained fragments of knowledge about how our brain works and some of the ideas talked about. The structure of the book makes it very easy to read, her style of telling lots of small stories backed up by references to research or events helps with the understanding of each idea. At times the book feels contradictory, particular when talking about how we form opinions, however I feel this demonstrates the complexity of our brains behaviour in different contexts and how subtle differences can make large differences to our perception.I thoroughly recommend this book to anyone who is interested in how our brains behave, it is fascinating to see how much happens to change our perception of reality without us being consciously aware."
59,0393062139,http://goodreads.com/user/show/12002028-feral,5,"It was very insightful with regards to the arcane and partially intrisic behaviors people relish most of the time without knowing, it makes one spare time to cross examine himself and interiorly castigate himself; Not disappointingly she did elicit my own interpretations on how people love deluding themselves or blindly embracing some ways...Perhaps paradoxically, my only worry while I was reading it was to know if she herself in spite of clearly knowing the variables in the equation of human behavior, would sometimes lure herself ""I already understand why I do this"" if she'd be dogmatic about something sometime.That set aside it was an mind sharpener that I'd ask anyone who's arrogant or filled with prideful delusions to read."
