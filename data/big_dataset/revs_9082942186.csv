0,9082942186,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3536004-jenna,4,"You know that person who's always so happy no matter what? Maybe it's the colleague who is bright and cheery at 8:00 every Monday morning when everyone else is struggling just to open their eyes and get their third cup of coffee down? Or that really annoying person who always urges you to look on the bright side. Oh, your arm fell off? No worries, you have another! Oh, your second arm fell off too? Well, just think of all the fun you're going to have learning how to use your feet to open doors, feed yourself, and wipe your own ass!I don't know about you, but those kinds of people are just far too optimistic for me. If you're one of those people, well, maybe you can learn to tone it down a bit when you find yourself living in the real world with other human beings.Humankind: A Hopeful History is the book equivalent of that overly optimistic person.Author Rutger Bregman is certain the human species is inherently good. Most people, deep down, are really good people who care about others and want to help everyone and treat each other fairly.Growing up, I thought the exact opposite. Most people were bad and not to be trusted. Then, as an adult, I started seeing good in people. Maybe I didn't trust most people, but I let myself believe that there are a lot of genuinely good people in the world and maybe even there are more good than bad.Then along came trump and showed me how mistaken I was. Even some people I thought were good went to his side, ignoring the harm he does to minorities and even relishing in his hatred and cruelty towards them. After that, along came Covid-19. Now we really see how many people care absolutely nothing about their fellow human beings. They do not care if they pass the virus on to others, some of whom might die, because they just don't like wearing a mask. (That is at least many Americans. The fact that other countries impose steep fines for not wearing a mask makes me think that it's not just Americans who are that self-centered, and others would go without too if not for those fines.)Yes, they are actually okay with being inadvertently responsible for someone else's death so that they don't have to be inconvenienced.  My faith in the inherent goodness of most human beings has plummeted. I'm eager to know what Mr. Bregman would have to say today. Would he write the same book? Probably. So let's get to it.Mr. Bregman starts with the premise that people are basically good and then pulls up all these studies to ""prove"" his point. Most of the studies he talks about are ones I've come across in other books, but he claims the exact opposite results. Who is correct in their conclusions? I would like to believe Mr. Bregman is, but I rarely did.He seems to cherry pick the things that support his premise while throwing out everything that goes against it. He also makes some wild assertions such as, ""Basically, our ancestors were allergic to inequality"".  He's talking about our hunter gatherer ancestors and makes the claim that for most of human history, people lived in a veritable Paradise. That mythological Garden of Eden. Everyone got along, sharing, and doing their part, and kissing, and hugging, and singing Kumbaya, and being the very best of friends.He even goes so far as to claim that babies in hunter gatherer societies were different! When talking about a study that shows human infants have a clear preference for those most like them, he tells us that it just wasn't so for most of human history. He offers not one iota of proof for this, just assures us that babies today who are born into big, anonymous cities are different than babies that were born in the forest with a small tribe of other human beings.At times it was like reading a religious apologist. That said, it was enjoyable to read this book. It's interesting. It's written well. Even if I disagree with most of Bregman's conclusions, the book encouraged me to think about things in a different way.I think the author is correct in his assertion that the media shows us the negative and leaves out the positive. I accept his conclusion that most people would find it difficult to take the life of another human being --IF they had to do it face-to-face. We see with the pandemic that many, many people really do not care what happens to anyone besides themselves or at least outside their own circle of close family and friends. They are okay with being responsible for someone's death even if they wouldn't pull out a gun and shoot someone.That doesn't make me feel very optimistic about humanity.I believe Mr. Bregman is correct -- the stats support it -- we live in the safest era, with far fewer people dying from violence inflicted by another than at any other time during civilization.I just can't share his optimistic conclusion that humans are basically good and caring people. Some are, some aren't. It's almost amusing how he runs around in circles trying to explain away such atrocities as the Holocaust in a world where just about everyone is good. It's like arguing for a benevolent creator who purposely created such things as cancer in children and parasitic wasps that lay their eggs inside caterpillars, slowly and horrifically murdering them as the baby wasps eat their way out.Maybe I'm cynical, which Bregman assures us is lazy. He asserts that, ""If you believe most people are rotten, you don't need to get worked up about injustice. The world is going to hell anyway"". I disagree. The more injustice I see in the world, the more I realise how much work there is to be done and the more I wish to be able to do something about it.If we ignore all the very real suffering humans inflict upon each other and other living creatures, we don't see where change needs to be made and we don't take responsibility for trying to bring about change. Mr. Bregman's ideas seem lazy to me. For instance.... his solution for racism? Just let racists hang out with people of color. While not coming out and directly saying that people of color are responsible for eliminating racism, that is what he is implying. Why should people of color have to hang out with people who hate them (or LGBQT+ with people who hate us) in order to change their minds? It is not minorities who should shoulder the responsibility for change. I had to deduct a star from the rating for that BS.He blows off hatred of minorities by saying it wouldn't exist if we lived in small bands of people and yet at the same time among people who are very unlike us. Yeh, I don't understand that either.So, my conclusion is that humans are capable of both good and bad. We are capable of love and kindness and compassion but also capable of the opposite. There is no neat and tidy way to account for war and genocide while claiming people are mostly all good. We are complicated. Life is complicated. It's a big grey area; human nature doesn't come in black and white, all good or all bad. Do I recommend the book? Absolutely. I'm glad I read it, even if it didn't succeed in changing my mind. "

Even so, it's the perfect time for a healthy dose of optimism and if there's anything this book does well it's showing how hope and positivity can breed more. So go forth and be the good you want to see in the world. You might just inspire others to do the same.ARC via Netgalley"
2,9082942186,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1045774-mehrsa,5,"To be honest, I picked up this book to hate-read it. I thought it would be more Pinker and and that Lars guy saying how everything is better now and will everyone just shut up sort of stuff. But I actually really loved the book--that is, I loved the first 2/3rds of the book. The last 1/3rd was way too cute and optimistic for my cold cynical heart. The book is not making the claim that Pinker is making. The book is a point by point debunking of a Hobbsian worldview and the sham ""studies"" and stories that have upheld it. This is important because this bleak worldview has led us into bad policies and behaviors because we assume that if the police state was slackened, there would be absolute mayhem and murder in the streets. That is just not true."
3,9082942186,http://goodreads.com/user/show/51783460-elzinus,3,"Bregmans book is immensely populair at this moment in Holland. The central thesis is clear from the title, freely translated: Most people are OK. Bregmans, is a journalist and historic from Holland who gained fame by explicitering the need for tax reforms at Davos. In this book he argues that most people are OK in two different ways.1. By summarizing study results that proof our good nature, that is, an preference for social cooperative behaviour and aversion to violence2. Secondly by trashing exemplary research into the dark human nature and present examples that show the good nature of humansFor me his thesis is ridiculous. In our daily life we approach most people like they are OK. We don’t distrust our colleagues when they asked for help and there are always people standing up in public transport to free a seat for those who need it. These are the kind examples he gives of good behaviour.Still, maybe this is not the kind of behaviour Bregmans wants to talk about. In the beginning of the book he states (from an personal email of a university teacher) that 97% of people belief that we are inclined to act fully in self-interest in panic situations.However for this argument the research he presents is less convincing. This is because the ‘proof’ of our good nature falls mostly in the category ‘a la café’ and because he is not able to explicate these results in an synthesized framework.Secondly because by trashing the research methods of i.e. Zimbardo’s prison experiment (where splitting up a group into prisoners and guards results into violence) he claims to prove that people are not inclined to show bad behavior. This however, is false reasoning, since the results of the Zimbardo experiment where always a presentation of how the context can make people bad. This is still standing, even if the researches (career driven lying pricks) where pushing for escalation. They where just a power structure within the context.As Rutger Bregman states he hopes to follow Bentrand Russel’s maxim to never get distracted by what he believes. It is a pity that he doesn’t live up to this. As he states in the preface, his goal in this book is not to prove that people are angels, more that we have an preference for te good (p.31). He fails to do this because:- He fails to make proper conclusions but merely summarizes a lot of research (which is interesting for sure!). But not explicitly derive the conclusion that this means ‘we’ are inclined to do the good in panic situations- This leaves him with the meaningless proposition that most people are (most of the time) OK. What do you mean OK? When are we not OK? What does this mean for our OKness in general? (This defect of the book was, for me, compensated by the last couple of chapters where the question is no longer the prove of the central thesis, but how vitreous behavior can be stimulated)- The question of evil is never a question of quantity but of quality. One person starting a fight in a bar can ruin the night for 30 OK-people. Magnifying the good intentions of the rest is not the point here. He does not address this but talks as if bad an good are leveled in equal measure. For example, the good behavior of (a lot) of people during WO II does not lessen the fact of the Holocaust.It is noteworthy that this book is so popular. Why so? De meeste mensen deugen is written in a way that makes you feel like a marathon runner. You just kill the thing in a few hours, and this made me feel good indeed.But this cannot be the only reason. What got my attention is the dualism created in the book between we (the 99%) and the leaders, scientist and politicians (the 1%). The most people are OK, but leaders… oef, the chances are high that they are psychopaths. In this way this book is a warm blanket that works as a sedative. We don’t have to feel guilty, because we are inclined to the good.[1]So, should you read this book? I think so. Rutger Berman is a great collector of research and is able to summarize the information so you can read it with ease. On the other hand, be aware that this book is an ideological pamphlet and the results of most research can be interpreted in multiple ways. So, practice benevolence, but not everything is OK and not only the powerful are evil._________[1] This is ideology and false with our direct experience. Though we think most people are OK we all now some examples where somebody is (as we say in Holland) ‘licking up, and kicking down’. Or for me growing up with brothers. I showed virtuous behavior, as well as evil sadistic behaviour to my younger brothers (not something i am proud about)."

An idealist can be right her whole life, and still be dismissed as naive. This book is intended to change that. Because what seems unreasonable, unrealistic, and impossible today, can turn out to be inevitable tomorrow. It is time for a new realism. It is time for a new view of humankind.
With the subtitle “A Hopeful History”, Humankind is exactly the kind of optimistic read I think I needed right now. With so much negative going on, I keep hearing, “What do you expect? People are the worst, a plague on the Earth!” And not only does that not solve anything, but it's so fatalistic as to suggest that nothing short of total human extinction could solve anything. With this new review of human history, Rutger Bregman not only busts a bunch of myths (and especially those based on social science experiments) about how rotten we humans are at the core, but by adding in stories of human decency and exploring some better ways of setting up entrenched institutions, Bregman shines a light on a more hopeful way forward. If the “nocebo effect” (If we believe most people can't be trusted, that's how we'll treat each other, to everyone's detriment) is as powerful as Bregman suggests, then a book like this that proves that humans are not basically evil is the first step towards building the society that works better for everyone. Just what I needed. (Note: I read an ARC from NetGalley and passages quoted may not be in their final forms.)
There is a persistent myth that by their very nature, humans are selfish, aggressive, and quick to panic. It's what Dutch biologist Frans de Waal likes to call “Veneer theory”: the notion that civilization is nothing more than a thin veneer that will crack at the merest provocation. In actuality, the opposite is true. It's when crisis hits – when the bombs fall or the floodwaters rise – that we humans become our best selves.
For most of this study, Bregman reviews what famous thinkers, philosophers, social psychology researchers, and recent pop historians have written; often finding source material that contradicts what we've been led to believe their evidence shows. Bregman starts with the opposite philosophical poles of Hobbes (“The man who asserted that civil society alone could save us from our baser instincts”) and Rousseau (“Who declared that in our heart of hearts we're all good” and that “'civilization' is what ruins us”). Bregman decidedly comes out on the side of Rousseau (and from more recent times, on the side of Yuval Noah Harari of Sapiens fame), who all believe that the dawn of agriculture was the downfall of happy human co-existence (and Bregman even takes issue with Steven Pinker and his hopeful books about how violence has decreased over time because, according to Bregman, there's zero evidence to support the widely accepted idea that nomadic/hunter-gatherer societies were anything but peaceful). To counter the dim, but popular, view of uncontrolled humanity in William Golding's Lord of the Flies, Bregman recounts the true story of a group of six Tongan boys who survived on a deserted island for over a year by creating a totally egalitarian society; to dispute the notion that men are jingoistic warmongers, he shares the incredible stats about how few soldiers in the major wars actually fired their weapons; to try and explain why it was the comparatively weak and smaller brained Homo sapiens who survived out of several competing hominids in prehistory, Bregman uses a recent study on the domestication of foxes to suggest that it came down to “survival of the friendliest”. If nothing else, Humankind is a fascinating and wide-ranging collection of stories.
I'm going to be honest. Originally, I wanted to bring Milgram's experiments crashing down. When you're writing a book that champions the good in people, there are several big challengers on your list. William Golding and his dark imagination. Richard Dawkins and his selfish gene. Jared Diamond and his demoralizing tale of Easter Island. And of course Philip Zimbardo, the world's most well-known psychologist. But topping my list was Stanley Milgram. I know of no other study as cynical, as depressing, and at the same time as famous as his experiments at the shock machine.
So, not only does Bregman confront Golding, Diamond, and Dawkins (actually, although I had never heard this, apparently Dawkins has disavowed his early notion of the “selfish gene”), but Bregman also spends a lot of the book writing about Zimbardo's Stanford Prison Experiment and Milgram's shock experiments. I remember learning about Zimbardo and Milgram in more than one Psych course – as they both demonstrated something fundamentally awful and important about us humans – but I don't remember ever being told that Zimbardo was basically a fraud who manipulated his process and his results (but sure loved the fame that followed) and it hasn't become commonly known that while, yes, test subjects under Milgram were convinced to administer ever-increasing levels of painful shocks to unseen confederates of the experimenter, the results are much more nuanced than that (for example, subjects uniformly refused to continue if they were ordered to administer the shock instead of being encouraged to do it for the good of the experiment; believing that they were being helpful caused most to continue, against their own better natures, in the name of doing something good for society at large). Apparently, these experiments are still being taught because they seem to confirm what we all know – that people are just this thin veneer of civilisation away from brutality – and that's why we don't trust each other, and that's why we allow our governments to use lethal force against other countries and our own fellow citizens.Myths are so insidious. I remember reading somewhere recently something like, “What do you think that dude on Easter Island was thinking as he cut down his island's last tree? Could he not see that he was literally cutting down his own civilisation?” This was written in the context of climate change – and why are humans so self-interested as to continue to do those specific things that will lead to our own doom – so it was fascinating to me to read here that, although deforestation is the accepted explanation for the collapse of the Easter Island society, Bregman didn't need to dig too deeply into the evidence to discover that the islanders didn't cut down their vast forests (as Malcolm Gladwell reported and which everyone then accepted as fact) to the very last tree, but that an invasive tree rat was carried to Easter Island on Peruvian slave ships: slavers took the healthiest people and unknowingly left the rats (which had no natural predator on the island) and of course their civilisation collapsed. Other myths that deserve to be broken: The “bystander effect”. We've probably all heard about the murder of Kitty Genovese – killed on the doorstep of her NYC apartment building while thirty-some people watched and figured someone else would call the cops – but it turns out that her murder didn't happen that way (and when someone tried to correct the official account, the leading article's writer at The New York Times refused, saying that positive details would ruin the story). Also, the “broken windows” theory of crime control: Sure, the stats for serious crime went down when this practise was adopted in NYC, but it turns out that undue pressure was put on beat cops to make massive arrests for small misdemeanors and to discourage the reporting of major crimes (and apparently it was Zimbardo, once again, who did the one flawed experiment that served as the basis for this theory?) And also the notion that mass incarceration is the only way to deal with criminals because softer rehab options don't work (the sociologist who inspired this practise, Robert Martinson, eventually killed himself when he saw how his conclusions were applied; apparently, this former civil rights activist wanted to prove that all punishment was ineffective and “everyone would realize prisons were pointless places and should all be shut down”.)And why these myths matter today: As Bregman notes, the broken window strategy for policing is a racist system:
Data show that a mere 10 percent of people picked up for misdemeanors are white. Meanwhile, there are black teens that get stopped and frisked on a monthly basis – for years – despite never having committed an offense. Broken windows has poisoned relations between law enforcement and minorities, saddled untold poor with fines they can't pay, and also had fatal consequences, as in the case of Eric Garner, who died in 2014 while being arrested for allegedly selling loose cigarettes.
In an earlier story, Bregman recounts the immediate aftermath of Hurricane Katrina – when, despite terrible newstories of opportunistic murders, rape, and looting – it turns out that most residents acted with “courage and charity”. Even so, first responders were also hearing the stories of a city in chaos – the thin veneer had been breached and 72,000 troops were called in – and “on Danziger Bridge on the city's east side, police opened fire on six innocent, unarmed African Americans, killing a seventeen-year-old boy and a mentally disabled man of forty”. The myths we tell ourselves about human nature matter, and more insidiously, we shouldn't allow the myths perpetuated by trauma-hungry media (or other entrenched institutions) form the entirety of our perceived reality.
Could this be the thing that the Enlightenment – and, by extension, our modern society – gets wrong? That we continually operate on a mistaken model of human nature? We saw that some things can become true merely because we believe in them – that pessimism becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy. When modern economists assumed that people are innately selfish, they advocated policies that fostered self-serving behavior. When politicians convinced themselves that politics is a cynical game, that's exactly what it became. So now we have to ask: Could things be different? Can we use our heads and harness rationality to design new institutions? Institutions that operate on a wholly different view of human nature? What if schools and businesses, cities and nations expect the best of people instead of presuming the worst?
In the last section of Humankind, Bregman tells the stories of various institutions (a factory, a school, a healthcare service, a prison, a municipal government) that found ways to do away with bureaucracy and middle managers, and instead, empowered individuals to follow in the direction of their own instincts and motivation. His examples sound Utopian – if you treat people like they're good and smart enough to do things right, they will – but they don't sound universally applicable; still, it was hopeful to end on such an optimistic note. Maybe we'll get there.I wrote about a lot here, but the book contains even more stories, experiments, and busted myths. I suppose because it contains so much, Bregman couldn't follow every strand out to my full satisfaction, and I found some of his quirks annoying (and especially, after suggesting we thrived through survival of the friendliest, Bregman continually refers to humanity as “Homo puppy”; dumb), but the good far outweighs the quibblesome; four stars is a rounding up."
5,9082942186,http://goodreads.com/user/show/45941903-lou,5,"Rutger Bregman returns with one of the most anticipated nonfiction titles of the year. What makes this such a fantastic read is that it is equal parts fascinating and informative; many such books can be dry and tedious but Humankind avoids those pitfalls by employing a highly readable writing style to entice you to carry on turning the pages well into the night. At its heart, this is a book about human nature and on the whole is optimistic about life. I found it different from what I would usually read as I am quite the cynic and it has taught me interesting anecdotal tidbits I will remember. Highly recommended. Many thanks to Bloomsbury Publishing for an ARC."
6,9082942186,http://goodreads.com/user/show/44595752-t,5,"Some books reach you at the right time and this book did exactly that. To be fair, the right time for a book offering a hopeful, optimistic view of humankind to reach me wasn’t that small of a window – I’ve been noticing how I, an usually optimistic person in my day-to-day-life, have become increasingly cynical when it comes to my fellow humans. And… can you blame me, in this economy, this pandemic, this global climate crisis, this political turmoil, etc. etc. etc.?Just like I know you can’t blame me for losing hope in humanity, I also know there are many who feel the same, so I can’t be thankful enough for Bregman and his (almost suspicious) optimism to come around the corner with this book and the many receipts that show that, yes, humanity has a questionable record, no reason in denying that but, contrary to what has sadly become popular belief, most of us are actually pretty ok – even more than ok. There are good people – and they’re not the exception. And there’s definitely enough of a reason to keep hope alive.
""Remember that cynicism is just another word for laziness. It's an excuse not to take responsibility. Because if you believe most people are rotten, you don't need to get worked up about injustice. The world is going to hell either way.""
In Humankind: A Hopeful History, Bregman discusses many of the studies in psychology that seemed to have cemented the idea that humanity is pretty much a lost cause. That, if briefly left to our own devices, we turn ugly and mean. As it turns out, many of these studies were rigged or forged to suit a certain preferred narrative. If a study proves that people are kind of ok, where’s the controversy in that? Where’s the exposure, the fame, the renown? Ah, but prove that people are just one step away from turning into savages – there’s a headline. But it’s not only scholars and their rigged studies that Bregman discusses. He also mentions real-life events that corroborated this pessimistic view of people. Turns out, what the media had reported wasn’t all that close to the truth. And not necessarily because they didn’t have all the facts, but rather because some facts got in the way of the narrative that has become the most suitable narrative, that with the highest shock value, and were quickly dismissed and forgotten.
“But the people behind Facebook, Twitter and Google know you well. They know what shocks and horrifies you, they know what makes you click. They know how to grab your attention and hold it so they can serve you the most lucrative helping of personalised ads.”
But more than Bregman’s argument about there being hope for humankind, what I appreciate most of this book is the way his optimism and drive to see things in a better light rubbed off on me. As I mentioned earlier, I’ve become more and more cynical and, while some people may have come to terms with or even like being that way, I don’t. I didn’t know just how much I wanted to fight that growing cynicism until I started reading this book and could feel that desire to believe in a better, kinder world rekindle. Perhaps my eagerness to believe Bregman’s arguments has clouded my judgement, and I know this whole review may sound too sugary, but whatcha gonna do.Bregman starts his book by saying that, at its core, this is about a radical idea. That idea isn’t just that people are pretty decent. Because if his radical idea holds true and if we allow us to believe it, if we approach others trying to believe the best instead of the worst, if our default shifts from distrust to trust, if we behave towards those around us as if we expected them to be decent, even good, even nice, they may in turn start to behave in a decent, even good, even nice way. This is a form of the Pygmalion Effect, a phenomenon wherein high expectations lead to improved performance. Unsurprisingly, the contrary also holds true. Expect the worst of someone, and you may be unknowingly helping to make the worst become true.
""It's also one of the insidious mechanisms behind racism, because when you're subjected to low expectations, you won't perform at your best, which further diminishes other's expectations and further diminishes your performance.""
Sure, not everyone will prove to be a sweetheart or a genius in disguise, and one person expecting the best of others won't turn our world into a Disney musical. But Bregman says, and I want to believe him, that there’s more to gain than to lose in adopting a more positive set of mind. And wouldn't it be nice to go around expecting not a scowl but a smile and giving one in turn?"
7,9082942186,http://goodreads.com/user/show/13298726-michael-perkins,5,"Humankind is a wonderfully iconoclastic book. The book is fluidly written and I have learned a ton. My favorite book of the year so far.Podcast interview with the author. What I find persuasive here is that other countries are operating on different assumptions, better assumptions than we are in the U.S., and getting much better results. We always make excuses for why we can't change, say to implement true gun safety. We cling too readily to our cynicism, when maybe we are looking at the world all wrong. This captures best the flavor of the book than I could in a written review.https://pitchforkeconomics.com/episod...---------------“TO BE HOPEFUL in bad times is not just foolishly romantic. It is based on the fact that human history is a history not only of cruelty, but also of compassion, sacrifice, courage, kindness.What we choose to emphasize in this complex history will determine our lives. If we see only the worst, it destroys our capacity to do something. If we remember those times and places—and there are so many—where people have behaved magnificently, this gives us the energy to act, and at least the possibility of sending this spinning top of a world in a different direction.And if we do act, in however small a way, we don’t have to wait for some grand utopian future. The future is an infinite succession of presents, and to live now as we think human beings should live, in defiance of all that is bad around us, is itself a marvelous victory.” ― Howard Zinn"
8,9082942186,http://goodreads.com/user/show/47593908-tine-putzeys,3,"Once again, I'm in doubt about the number of stars to give this book. I wanted to give it many many stars, I really did, because I like the premise that most people are inherently good. This has been my gut feeling for a long time, even if I get all kinds of opposite signals from the media and the f*ckers stealing my phone and breaking into my house. Bergman does give us some great examples of people being awesome and lovely anecdotes for me to casually throw into random conversations. And if I look at the reviews it's getting, I see many people are loving it and saying it helped ""restore their faith in humanity"" or that it's a good antidote to their cynicism. Which is great and I think this was the explicit aim of the author. So in that sense, good book.You can argue about style. Yes it's written like an irritating click-baity internet piece, but then again, the author writes mainly for a digital audience, so that's probably what he's used to. If your target is the general population, the worst thing you could do is write in a dusty academic style. It won't wint prizes for its literary prose, but does that matter if everyone is reading it?However, the main flaw is the same as most of these feel good books: what the f*ck do I do now. Bregman gets a small amount of bonus points, because he has the 10 rules epilogue, which gives you some guidance on how to use the content, but it seems to be too small-scale to matter. Assuming the premise is correct and most people are inherently good, we still fall victim to our circumstances and the systems we live in. He briefly touches on this sometimes, like referring to how the wonderful Agora school could be shut down if it doesn't perform up to the educational standards in the country. And then he goes on to the next topic. Same for the rebels in the Columbian jungle. Now that they have returned to celebrate Christmas with their mother, the jungle is now taken over by drug lords and extreme right groups. Just leaving that hanging there and on to the next topic. SO WHAT NOW, my brain keeps screaming at me. In the end, I think stars should represent how valuable the book was to me, no the general population. How much I liked reading it and how much I got from it and I can't in earnest give it four stars with my brain still screaming at me. Thank you mr. Bregman for the lovely anecdotes and for 'proving' my gut feeling about people is right, but I can only give you 3 stars."
9,9082942186,http://goodreads.com/user/show/27362230-rhian-pritchard,5,"This book has taken me nearly two months to read, not because it was difficult to read (it’s not, it’s beautifully written and translated) but because the ideas required quite so long to process fully. I don’t know if anyone has spoken to me in the last two months and NOT had me recommend this book to them wholeheartedly, even when I was only about a hundred pages in. It is like reading a book that confirms and reinforces, through meticulous research, discussion and sourcing, a secret truth I have wanted to believe, deep down, all along. But it took these two months, and I imagine much longer still, to begin dismantling the ideas society has ingrained in me. I can’t write a good review of this book because it would essentially mean rewriting the book. I have nothing to add, nothing further to discuss. I just want to put it in people’s hands and let it change their lives. And I believe Rutger Bregman is right - it is easy to be a cynic, to scoff and scorn kindness. It’s hard to be kind because it means taking responsibility - it means believing that your actions are worthwhile, when it is easier to believe that there is no point in trying, the world’s fucked anyway. I dare you to believe that it’s not true. I dare you to be an optimist - or as Rutger Bregman would have it, a realist. This is a challenging book to read. It does not shy away from the darker sides of humanity. But it is ultimately hopeful, and the more people begin to change their minds and believe that humans are not inherently bad, the better. "

Hmm, could that be the case with his book and his ""research""? He seems to want to sell his idea so (too) badly that he foregoes any scrutiny or nuance. There are a lot more points of criticism and I did start to write them all down, but my list was getting too long so I stopped. Besides, there are some excellent reviews already (be it in Dutch):Bou's reviewLieke's reviewDaniëlle's reviewAmber's reviewI mean, I can understand that people like this book, the optimistic message and I hope that some will be positively influenced (so therefore I give it 1.5 stars, rounding it up to 2). I suspect though that this will be the case mainly for the people who already have a positive view of the world and people. It is just too positive and not enough nuanced to be convincing for those who aren't convinced already."

12,9082942186,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5754022-eddie-clarke,4,"Four stars. In the philosophical stand-off between Hobbes (human life is a war of all against all, papered over with the thinnest veneer of civilisation) and Rousseau (we were born noble savages and civilisation has corrupted us) Bregman comes down decisively in favour of Rousseau.Such a flattering premise makes the book very enjoyable to read, at least in the first half.The weakness of the book is that it is a string of nicely written and presented anecdotes/episodes/debunkings and then like a butterfly Bregman wafts on to the next flower in the field without really developing a coherent argument. In the end, despite disclaiming the ‘self-help’ genre he nevertheless ends with 10 rules for individual living.He is clearly a highly intelligent academic and throughout the book appears completely aware of the political implications of what he is up to (notably, he mentions conflicts with his German publishers over the message of this book). The second half covers contemporary societal issues - schools, prisons, countries in conflict - where his avoidance of political engagement becomes alarmingly apparent (and his engagement in each issue therefore feels superficial). He resolutely draws back from drawing any fundamental political conclusions, which leaves a syrupy aftertaste. (He does mention he likes Richard Curtis films.)But there is a tremendous amount of interesting and original research entertainingly presented. There is more than enough here to inspire your own thinking. Recommended."
13,9082942186,http://goodreads.com/user/show/31506695-david-wineberg,5,"Rutger Bregman set himself a really high-barrier task in his book Humankind. He wants to prove that Man is actually not violent, or bellicose, but peaceful, helpful and kind. To do it, he went back to all those famous, landmark social science studies we’ve all grown up believing. They show unequivocally that Man is selfish, self-centered, violent and wallowing in it. Bregman shows them to be faulty, false, staged or just plain bogus. It makes for an eye-opening journey readers will not soon forget. And he does it with style.Readers will recognize the studies, like the Stanley Milgram electric shock study and the Stanford Prison study. He even goes after the Kitty Genovese murder case and Lord of the Flies. Bregman goes back to research not just the study or the book, but the author and the author’s own notes. He uses an absolutely delightful structure. He describes the study, book or story, giving it all the credit it has always claimed, seemingly case closed, no argument possible. Then he starts researching, going back to original documents, and where possible, original participants. The story starts to crumble, and he ends up shaming the originators of the bogus findings. It makes a for a lively read of a very serious problem with Man: not violence, but fraud.Man bites dog doesn’t sell as well as dog bites man. So newspapers focus on the sensational negatives, and don’t bother correcting stories when they prove false. Hollywood is all over sensationalism, mostly in the form of violence and gore. Everyone is always at war, always in a personal fight. Doesn’t matter if it’s Genghis Khan, Vikings or pilgrims. So viewers come to believe that they are accurate, that it is reality. That’s the way it always has been. That’s the way Man is.For example, Bregman cites the Easter Island story. For centuries, it has been “known” that Easter Islanders raped the island and went to war with each other, finally eating each other as cannibals when the island could no longer support them all. It’s a classic that is in constant use to demonstrate Man’s selfish inhumanity to Man and total disregard for nature, not to mention the tragedy of the commons (which Bregman dismantles separately). Only it never happened. Going back to the original ship captain’s logs, he shows that Easter Islanders were not just peaceful, they were thriving: joyously open and healthy. Not only did they not fight, they didn’t even know what weapons were. (The Dutch sailors showed them, mowing them down, then later enslaved them and left them with Plague.) In the famous Stanley Milgram experiment, volunteers electrocuted people, almost to death. It was supposedly the answer to why Nazis could exterminate people so readily. But Milgram hid the fact that more than half the subjects believed his shock machine was fake, so it didn’t matter how high a shock they administered. And it only came out much later that Milgram’s assistant continually harassed the subjects into shocking the victim. The results were therefore not definitive in any way. Or even valid. But the study lives on as a foundational document and seminal moment in social science.Similarly, the Stanford Prison Study proved that jailers plus prisoners will always lead to violence, causing the entire justice system to apply stricter rules that caused (and continue to cause) totally unnecessary violence in prisons. The truth is the researcher forced the violence by making it a we/them setup (with him leading the we as the warden), forcing the guards to be aggressively obnoxious, and imposing odious arbitrary and humiliating rules on the prisoners to get them to rebel. Literally millions of Americans have suffered as a result of this landmark study. Meanwhile, in modern prisons in Norway, prisoners and guards live, work and play together, help each other in tasks, and prisoners leave ready to rejoin society at a higher level. It costs the state less, and recidivism is a fraction of the American rate. The author of the Stanford study lived off it his entire life, rising to the highest levels in psychology, never admitting what his notes showed was bogus science.In the infamous Kitty Genovese murder, a New York woman screamed for help as she was being stabbed to death, while 38 witnesses did nothing. She died in the hallway of her apartment building in Queens, alone. This story went global, and demonstrated how inhuman humans had become in big cities, reverting to savage animals who couldn’t bother even to lift a phone to help.Bregman went back and found that two people had called the police immediately, before the second attack took place, but the police never sent anyone. They decided Genovese must be drunk (it was 3:30 am). And she didn’t die alone. A woman in her building immediately rushed to her and cradled her in her arms until she died. Lastly, two men stopped a robber carrying a tv out of a house in broad daylight shortly thereafter, disabling his truck so he couldn’t get away. These two good neighbors turned out to have caught the Genovese murderer, but that was never reported either. No, it was preferable to leave the sensational story of uncaring New Yorkers and an unsolved murder fill the media forever after. Cities breed uncaring, leering animals remains the takeaway, despite the facts.Even Lord of the Flies, which has long proven how beastly human children will be when left on their own, turns out to be bogus. This novel, read by every schoolchild in the country for 60 years, was written by William Golding, a man who professed Nazi sympathies, and had a worldview of violence and hatred. He made no pretense of it being scientific, but it has become key to the canon of innate violence in Man regardless. It fits our worldview, so it has become truth.Bregman found a real case of Lord of the Flies, in which half a dozen kids on Tonga stole a boat and ended up shipwrecked on an island called ‘Ata in the 1960s. It took hard digging, but he tracked down the captain (now 90) of the boat that rescued them and got the whole story. After year, the boys were in excellent shape, finely toned, well organized, and now lifelong friends. Any time there was a disagreement on the island, the antagonists had to go to different ends to cool off, and had to shake hands and apologize when they came back. Wouldn’t make nearly as good a film as Lord of the Flies. And no one has ever heard of it outside Australia, where it has been forgotten. Meanwhile, Lord of the Flies is mandatory reading.It’s not the common man, it’s his leaders that embody this evil nature. “Dictators and despots, governors and generals—they all too often resort to brute force to prevent scenarios that exist only in their own heads, on the assumption that the average joe is ruled by self-interest, just like them.” Bregman finds the farther one is from the front line, the easier it is to espouse violence.There are lovely stories of how men find ways not to fight. Ninety percent of the muskets collected after the Battle of Gettysburg were loaded, often with two or more balls, as men used any excuse not to fire their weapons, pretending to be reloading rather than rushing into battle. At Christmas in 1914, Germans and Brits celebrated together, singing carols to each other from their trenches and then meeting to exchange gifts, play football, and carouse. To the point where the generals had to reinforce orders not to fraternize with the enemy. What enemy? “From Troy to Waterloo and from Korea to Vietnam, few armies have fought without the aid of intoxicants, and scholars now even think Paris might not have fallen in 1940 had the German army not been stoked on thirty-five million methamphetamine pills (a.k.a. crystal meth, a drug that can cause extreme aggression),” Bregman says. As for guerilla organizations. he cites Erica Chenoweth who found that more than 50 percent of nonviolent campaigns were successful, as opposed to 26 percent of the militant ones. The primary reason, Chenoweth established, is that more people join nonviolent campaigns. On average over eleven times more. Turns out violence is way less appealing to ordinary people, even under duress. Man is a domesticated animal, the finding of Richard Wrangham, from his excellent, groundbreaking book called the Goodness Paradox which I reviewed here: https://medium.com/the-straight-dope/... As with other such beasts, from dogs to cattle, Man is smaller than his wild version the Neanderthal, and has much gentler features. Mostly, he is more peaceable and friendly than the wild species, just like with all domesticated animals. For us to have built this false collection of violent attributes, Bregman says, must simply be wrong.Before modern times, tribes raised children together, partied with other tribes, shared food, and owned nothing. It was the rise of agriculture, the ownership of land and tools that started the route to wealth, inequality, protection of assets, selfishness and constant warring, Bregman says. He extends the argument to capitalism, which he says was imposed from above. He says the Adam Smith version is wrong: “Now it turns out that this view is completely upside down. Our natural inclination is for solidarity, whereas the market is imposed from on high. Take the billions of dollars pumped in recent decades into frenzied efforts to turn healthcare into an artificial marketplace. Why? Because we have to be taught to be selfish.” Bregman’s quest here was recognized three thousand years ago by Aesop. One of his fables was about the sun and the wind. They spotted a man in a cloak, walking along. The wind bet the sun he could get the cloak off the man. He blew and blew as hard as he could, and with every gust, the man clutched his cloak to him even tighter. Then the sun took his turn. With the wind dying down, the sun came out, the birds went back to singing, and the air became welcoming and pleasant. The man took his cloak off himself.Not much has changed in 3000 years. Co-operation works better than force, no matter what binge-tv series present. And that’s how people actually operate.We owe Rutger Bregman a debt of thanks for unearthing the truth behind these long-held frauds, and for starting to clear the air about human nature. It’s a lovely, lively, uplifting and scientifically important book.David Wineberg"

Life is way more nuanced, and all that he tries to deny is just fact. Face it, don't try to blame the most ridiculous stuff, which most of the time was contradicting his own premise; that most people are good."

Bregman discusses the fundamental nature of humankind and presents evidence of goodness. Many times I did feel as if it was too good to be true. But until I can disprove any of his claims and the proofs he accompanies them with, I will be believing in the goodness that is present in each of us."

Most people are okay, and if I didn’t already feel that way, Bregman sure as hell convinced me with this book. It’s basically hours of meditation and therapy and insights from dozens of self-help books, all wrapped up into one cogent, eloquently written text. If I had to name one drawback, though, it would be that the book could be about 1/3 shorter and 1/3 less anecdotal. Contrary to Harari, Bregman underestimates his reader’s intelligence at times, endlessly chewing on every piece of information, working a point until you feel exhausted by the repetition and slow pace. Yes, I remember that you’ve already mentioned this in a previous chapter. No, there’s no point in repeating that yet again. Maybe that’s one of the typical pitfalls of an academic trying to entertain his audience, when in fact he should be doing what he’s best at: educate them. Challenge them. Maybe I’m just spoiled by Harari’s more intricate, more mature writing style and insights.So for that, four stars. Still, I’d recommend this book to anyone. I feel like we need it."

what if our negative ideas about human nature are actually a form of pluralistic ignorance? could our fear that most people are out to maximize their own gain be born of the assumption that that's what others think? and then we adopt a cynical view when, deep down, most of us are yearning for a life of more kindness and solidarity?
on one hand, dutch historian rutger bregman's new book, humankind: a hopeful history, is a thoughtful, engaging, wittily written effort. on the other, it reads as an anecdotal, feel-good magical thinking polemic trying its best to prove a premise settled upon in advance (for which the necessary corroborative evidence was then collected after the fact). while many of bregman's debunkings (the stanford prison experiment, the milgram shock experiment, easter island, lord of the flies, etc.) are compelling in their own right, to then use them as a foundational argument that people are better than they seem is rather specious.inevitably, human beings are indeed far kinder and altruistic than governments, corporations, or other dogmatic institutions would have you believe. thus, kudos to bregman for dispelling so many of the beliefs that have persisted not only popularly, but also in fields like social psychology. the argument that hey, people really aren't that evil or bad, just gullible and stupid is rather cold comfort, however. presuming that, in fact, humans are wired for kindness, beneficence, compassion, etc. (which does seem to be backed by considerable evidence), would a widespread understanding of such a point radically upend the world as we know it? or does it simply assuage our frustrations, pessimism, and/or latent guilt?if an alien anthropologist descended upon our planet some century or millennium hence to discover anthropogenic climate change ravished the living world, or that the sixth extinction annihilated millions of species, or that rapacious capitalism turned the earth into a ruinous hellscape, or that some egomaniacal autocrat launched nuclear weapons... what might they conclude? that with all evidence to the contrary, the so-called most intelligent creatures on the planet destroyed not only themselves but lifeforms of all kinds despite their natural inclination for cooperation and kindness? perhaps a more trenchant take on humanity's psychological makeup would have delved a bit more deeply into how it is we're so adept at destroying ourselves, other humans, non-humans, and ecosystems alike.inherent kindness or not, we've made a royal mess. to consider human's innate goodness while glossing over the ravages of capitalism, colonialism, empire, climate change, genocide, slavery, patriarchy, warfare, and the like seems, frankly, a sugar pill still too bitter to swallow. (rutger himself, however, seems like a charming fellow and his takes on many issues, including ubi, taxation, work, social progress, are most commendable. and his clash with perennial moron tucker carlson is required viewing.)*translated from the dutch by elizabeth manton (bregman's utopia for realists)"

We are not savages hidden beneath a thin veneer of civilization as cynics and controllers would have us believe.

We have a strong preference for those who are like us and are easily turned against the ""other."" But we are also quick to help when given the chance.Bregman refutes the studies and most famous incidents of evil in clear, logical prose explaining how we are able to do horrendous things to each other and why these events are aberrations rather than the norm. Too often the scandalous news gets the headlines and the corrections are never reported. It is a compelling read that is a breath of fresh air amidst the doom and gloom all around us."

21,9082942186,http://goodreads.com/user/show/57263951-nacho-santos,5,"Humankind: A Hopeful History By Rutger BergmanIt’s been almost 2 months since I last finished a book. This book is a great comeback to this lost momentum.I believe this is the next required read. To me it is as essential as Sapiens by Yuval Noah Harari. It breaks down so many of the beliefs we hold true and debunks them in such an understanding way. For example, did you know the Stanford prison experiment was pushed by Zimbardo to be that way? Or the Nobel winning prize book, the lord of the flies is an unclear depiction of human nature. This book tackles what we think about human nature, specifically, how in the back of our minds we think everyone is selfish or only in it for themselves, with stories and clear logic. I learned that beliefs regarding the “evilness” of human nature is false. Bergman showed me time and time again, we are good. Today, our culture never pushes that idea. We heard of the Stanford prison experiment but we haven’t heard of the dozens of others that tried to confirm it? The ones where that result never happened, where the prisoners actually had a smoke with the guards. What more, the Stanford prison experiment laid the foundation for what the prison system and mentality is today. We do not know most of the stories that debunk these “facts” because they apparently aren’t “news worthy”. It is a “nocebo”, when we believe something false and then that information actually makes up the world we are in, being detrimental to all of us. We haven’t heard of the Christmas truce of 1914. During WW1 when British, German, and French soldiers in the trenches were each expecting a surprise attack on Christmas Day, the British heard choirs of Germans singing. It was a life changing moment for all of them during a time where they were supposed to be killing one another. Following that, the French and British sang carols out in the dark night, they then all met up going through no mans land, the space they have been sacrificing their lives to keep. These are only a few of the stories mentioned, yet they are so essential. We are reminded to “think as carefully about what information you feed your mind as you do about the food you feed your body.” Remember, social media and the news is not a real picture of the world we are in. Look outside, talk to a friend, and you’ll find that people, the world, is better than what our culture makes it seem to be.5 ⭐️"
22,9082942186,http://goodreads.com/user/show/21106268-eric-van-der-toorn,5," De meeste mensen deugen (Rutger Bregman) I’m going to be honest here, I never expected to be putting a Dutch book on this list. Not because I can’t read Dutch (I have a good grasp of the intricacies of the Dutch language as a native), but because I had grown to hate Dutch literature in all of its forms over the years in high school where I was forced to read and analyze literature that I intensely disliked, which took away my interest. ""Is this the best that Dutch literature can offer me,"" is the thought that recurred time and again. My prime example, by virtue of its still-living memory, is not a particularly horrific one but a work that started off great. ’Het Leven in een dag’ is a novel that describes how life could look like if we were to live in a world that where lifespans where compressed to a single day, and everything was about ’firsts,’ from the first time you saw the sun rise to the first time you had sex. Firsts were also lasts however, and most things could never happen again (we conveniently exclude things like breathing and thinking). In this world, heaven is a single moment where ’everything’ happens, and hell is the endless repetition (or ’Earth’ for those less religiously inclined) The concept is quite interesting and sets one to thinking about how the repetition of events makes them lose a lot of their magic. The plot of the story was that of a typical romance with an interesting plan: Have more sex by going to hell. In our world the reverse is usually preached, but I like this version more to be completely honest. The plan to go to hell by murdering someone and getting executed succeeds and our main character finds himself on Earth and looks around for his girl.Then, to completely gore the entire thought process that the first two-thirds of the book stimulate one too, the main character is recruited by the man he killed to become, of all things, a prostitute. The following few scenes are just raunchy depictions of the things he is all but forced to participate in, my ’favourite’ being where he has an orgy while skydiving, laid out in explicit detail.I realise that I have in the process of wanting to rant about it written an entire review, so I’ll now start talking about the book that (after a lot of stimulation from my dad and it being suggested by a lady I met while traveling) I reluctantly started listening to and now am determined to finish to the end, though I sometimes have to bite through some reluctance.The book starts off discussing how humanity is perceived, from a philosophical perspective. The age-old question that Bregman wishes to touch upon once again (and hopefully answer) is whether civilization - rules, order, and leadership - is a boon to humanity, a requirement for proper treatment of others, or a poison that has only eroded the basic human decency that is inherent to all of us.Bregman wants to approach this topic, which is prone to being quite subjective, as scientifically as possible. I believe he did a remarkable job, though the book is named after his opinion, which is that humans are inherently decent. He starts by analyzing our behaviour without civilization, through pre-historical findings, current tribes, and stories where civilization got a ’fresh start’ - a la The Lord of the Flies - then continues onto social psychological conclusions that are widely known but deeply controversial, to finish with how things should change if the worldview that most people are decent would be implemented, and what would be the effect. In the conclusion he briefly describes 10 lessons he’s learned over his research.In his efforts to sound rational and scientific he has done quite well, though some parts of the book leave me wondering whether he sufficiently defuses the arguments against human cruelty being non-inherent. One thing that I feel he skirts about unwilling to actually dive into is the belief that civilization is responsible for all that is cruel. He repeatedly paints the civilized world as the ’evil’ guy, with its colonization and slavery practices, through the comparisons feel more like comparing apples to oranges. I would’ve enjoyed it if he’d mentioned more cases where one civilization compared to another. Are leaders always the people with the most hate for eachother? How does this work in rebellions? How should we look at people that commit not violent crime but horrible deeds like paedophilia? These are just some of the questions that the book neglected to touch upon in what felt like an effort to not get into the intricate debates surrounding those topics.To conclude my review, this book has made a significant impact on how I perceive the world in terms of how people are, baring some of the resolutions that I felt are intuitive, and with that allowing me to become more resolved in their veracity. On the other hand, it is like an opening move at a debate, where the response and the ensuing persuasive efforts still have to follow. And I am looking forward to see the arguments from both sides."

25,9082942186,http://goodreads.com/user/show/18791611-shivam-kimothi,3,"Bergman says that our pessimistic view of humanity is a placebo. The placebo effect states that things have the potential to be true if we believe in them. He says that we have been made to believe that humans are motivated by self-interest and are inherently evil. By whom? By the psychologists who are motivated by selfish reasons and are seeking prestige and acclaim by proving so. And because we are made to believe this, we think it is true.The book puts forward a radical idea: that humans, deep down, are decent. Bergman supports this claim by debunking most of the social experiments that promote the selfish nature of humans. He debunks lord of the flies, the Stanford prison experiment, the eastern island experiment, and many more such experiments. This part constitutes most of the book. I didn't like it.If humans are so good, then why do we fight? Why are there so many wars and genocides? He believes it's because of empathy. Oxytocin, the love hormone, not only enhances affection for friends, but it also intensifies aversion to strangers. The mechanism that makes us the kindest species, also makes us the cruelest species on the planet.The last part of the book is flat out tedious. It's too radical of an idea to be believed so easily. But it sure does ignite a spark. It makes you question your beliefs. You should read this book because it promotes an optimistic view of life, a life filled with kind and humble people.  "

If you also have been following his journalism, and especially if you attended his book promo tour (in October 2019 in The Netherlands), you won't hear a whole lot of new things. Even if you have been following him for that long, it doesn't matter. Because this book sparks joy, generates an incredible amount of energy and trust in humanity.

27,9082942186,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5109654-marks54,5,"I am giving this book five stars because it was very stimulating and engaging around its central idea - that we should assume good about the people we encounter and give the benefit of the doubt to others. The author has written a book about a simple idea that proves to be very complex. The idea concerns the initial assumptions we make about the goodness or lack of goodness of other human beings as a basis for our action. Do we assume that other people are good (and trustworthy) or do we assume that they are not? Are we living in a veritable jungle where we are competing to the death with others or do we start out more sociable and welcoming (and trusting) of others? Is civilization based on a veneer of humanity that will easily disappear under stress or is our humanity more robust and instances of inhumanity what are more engineered? These sorts of questions and the assumptions that go with them in some form or another are behind much of what we do and how we live. They are behind theories of capitalism and marketplace competition. They are behind how we treat other people and whether their background and characteristics and origins matter to us or not. They influence how we think about politics, how we behave at work, how we interact with the police and the courts, how we process political slogans. They are behind how wars break out and how they are won or lost. They are even behind our religious beliefs. I have read a lot in history and political theory and the issue in this book is Nothing less than the current state of the debate between Rousseau and Hobbes. The author drops a lot of names in book but also seems to have done his homework. If you are not up to speed on the background for some of these chapters, I would recommend have a device handy to check when you have questions.Sound a bit much? Perhaps, but perhaps you might read this book to see if you agree. I was surprised by how thoughtful and how learned the book is. Mr. Bregman is a Dutch public intellectual of sorts and this book is a research based but a multi-disciplinary examination of how these ideas of been accepted or rejected, how they have been researched and promoted, and how they have changed over time. When I say “research based” I do not mean that Mr. Bregman has done the original research himself but more that he has looked at what researchers have found out about a topic. ...and then he digs even deeper to see if the findings have stood up over time and how the promotion of research findings has been consistent with what the researchers and their studies have actually found. He has certainly done his homework. The result is a breath taking tour of how some basic ideas can turn up all over the intellectual map - even in discussions of how to tame Siberian foxes.Why five stars and not four? I am familiar with most of the cases Bregman raises in the book and appreciate that sorting our these assumptions is complex and nuanced. There are not a lot of simple answers. What I loved about the book was how the author dug into particular illustrative chapters and showed that the research was famous and why it was famous (famous studies by Zimbardo and Milgram, for example). But then, he continues to push further and show how replications worked out, how the researchers’ later work fared, and what the backstory for various studies actually was. This is extraordinarily valuable and should be the process that anyone uses in familiarizing themselves with a research area. Unfortunately, it is time consuming to do the real homework and as a result, it is a chore to really complete the due diligence that is needed on even a simple topic.This is not a specialized research book. Mr. Bregman is aiming for an engaged and educated audience but also a general interest audience. The book reads as if he wanted to figure out the questions for himself and then communicate what he found. This is infrequently done in any publications especially those meant for relatively wider trade book audiences. I commend the author for taking the time to do this and I highly recommend the book."

The translation is available to ""wish for"" on NetGalley, to be published 2 June 2020.I read (and watched) Lord of the Flies by William Golding so long ago, I have only an overall sense of how repulsed I was. I remember it as being about a bunch of English schoolboys stranded on a desert island and how they become ruthless savages. It is often required reading in schools, and I imagine it makes for lively classroom discussions.So I was fascinated to see this recent Guardian article about some real boys who faced a similar situation in 1966, a decade after the book came out. They were Tongan castaways. They had a completely different outcome. We'd all do well to learn how they did it.https://www.theguardian.com/books/202... The article ends saying, ""This is an adapted excerpt from Rutger Bregman’s Humankind, (Humankind: A Hopeful History) translated by Elizabeth Manton and Erica Moore. A live streamed Q&A with Bregman and Owen Jones takes place at 7pm on 19 May 2020."" I assume that's via the Australian Guardian, but I don't know. He's an interesting speaker and was in Australia discussing his much talked-about Utopia for Realists: How We Can Build the Ideal World."

And, even if I don’t ascribe to all Bregman was exploring, it was absolutely the most thought provoking book I have read this year. According to Bregman the change from being Hunter Gatherers to Agrarian was the beginning of Humanities problems not the advent of our “civilization” but of our downfall. We are made for connection and interaction but the rise of cities, then country’s made us distrusting and insular. And no, he doesn’t proscribe going back to being hunter gatherers. I recommend to anyone who wants to think deeply about humanity and our role in this world and how we as individuals can and should make a difference. "

So many interesting studies and stories in here that help to reaffirm the basic goodness of people.It reflects highly on the author that he is able to criticize his earlier work and strive to do better. As should we all.
34,9082942186,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6044031-jayati-deshmukh,5,"This book is like a ray of hope in the current times of global pandemic, inter-community disruptions, natural disasters and more. All of us need to be reminded in the intrinsic goodness of the humankind, even though sometimes it might be hard to see. The core idea of this book is that humans in general are kind and trustworthy. And the author builds on this idea throughout the book across diverse aspects like education, business, government and more.The book has many interesting and well researched case studies like the real life version of the fictional story from Lord of the Flies. What might have happened on the Easter Island than the usually believed story of war, mass destruction and cannibalism. There is also an in-depth analysis on some of the expected questionable events / experiments like the Stanford Prison experiment, Milgram’s shock machine experiment and Catherine Susan Genovese’s murder in NYC. In all these cases, an alternate picture based on detailed research is presented which completely changes the point of view. The models of our day-to-day systems will be very different and enriching when they are built from a trustful point of view rather that the existing models which are usually distrustful by default. There are interesting examples where the application of these principles has brought remarkable change. Management, of example in a top down manner with strict way of doing things can be counter productive. There is an interesting example of Blok’s model of management where small teams are given full autonomy which has been very successful and created a win-win situation for the company as well as the employees. As the author say, “Because nothing is more powerful than people who do something because they want to do it.”Further, education is looked at from the opposite of current day industrial / factory model. Importance of play, where the children are left free to experiment and explore is highlighted. Agora model of education which give a lot of autonomy to kids to design their own learning paths is presented which builds much more well-rounded individuals. “You can’t teach creativity,’ writes psychologist Peter Gray, ‘all you can do is let it blossom.”Next example shows how cities and governments might look like when then are run autonomously using participatory models of governance. There is also an interesting discussion of the Elinor Ostrom’s model of the commons countering Hardin’s tragedy of the commons. Finally, the author gives examples where even in the most complex scenarios like handling prisoners, controlling police or even wars, it is possible to bring a positive change with models based on trust and compassion. Being kind in not easy. As it is mentioned towards the end of the book, “To believe people are hardwired to be kind isn’t sentimental or naive. On the contrary, it’s courageous and realistic to believe in peace and forgiveness.” Also this strategy won’t be successful in 100% scenarios, however as the author says, “ accept and account for the fact that you’ll occasionally be cheated. That’s a small price to pay for the luxury of a lifetime of trusting other people.”This book is powerful and can change the way we perceive the world. It also presents numerous examples where a culture of trust, autonomy, goodness and compassion can build much better systems. This book restores hope in humankind and shows a way where we can be the change we want to see in the world, by being kind!"
35,9082942186,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6571378-luke,5,"This was a wonderful book!While reading I was doubting if I wanted to give it 4 or 5 stars. The reasons for giving it 4 stars being that a). Bregman writes in quite an informal way - sometimes bordering on slang - and b). makes very 'out there' statements which at times seem to be written just to shock., both of which I found to be slightly aggravating. However, I found that I got used to this as I progressed and that the content of the book outweighs these reasons by far. To me it was very surprising how Bregman manages to discuss themes, current affairs and human behaviour in a completely new and innovative way while being 'realistic' and using excellent resources (and let me tell you, if there is one thing that irks me greatly, it is a lack of- or untrustworthy resources). The value of the book in this regard is in my opnion both the way that Bregman dares to discuss them so fearlessly, thereby breaking old taboos and clearing space for new ideas, and the nuanced way he seems to do so (once you get used to the slightly jovial use of language, that is). I recognized many of the studies that Bregman debunks and was just afghast once I realized how religiously they are being teached at our schools and universities when learning about our Western history and society. Take Zimbardo's Standford Prison Experiment for example, or Miligrams shock experiment, both are studies that were very formative when learning about human behaviour during both my social and nursing education. Like I said, this book opened some doors for me and broke a lot of old thought patterns I ddn't realize I had. It made me feel inspired, uncomfortable and hopeful at the same time. I am very happy it will be released in the English language in may 2020... this way I can recommend it not only to my Dutch speaking friends, but to my English speaking ones as well ;)"
36,9082942186,http://goodreads.com/user/show/62488403-ben,5,"Why should cynicism be synonymous with realism? Bregman deconstructs our views on human nature, and the way these views underpin our sociopolitical institutions. With his defence of human decency, a tendency toward peace, and a sense of community, he builds hope. Despite occasionally feeling disorganized, this book should be required reading - especially for those who question whether people are fundamentally good."
37,9082942186,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1838124-bart-van-loon,4,"I really enjoyed this book - or collection of essays if you wish - by Bregman. I am very happy to have some of my misconceptions in social psychology set right (the shock-experiment, the Stanford prison experiment, the murder of Kitty Genovese, etc...). It was also refreshing to see somebody bluntly oppose great thinkers like Pinker and Gladwell and join the ""new realism""-ranks of Harari. I found this new history of mankind very compelling and interesting to read.However, I also agree with most of the criticism online: sometimes the author's writing betrays a pedantic desire to have an exclusive right to the truth, and from time to time he even reverts to fallacies he elsewhere condemns. I also found the very large font size, big margins and huge chapter headings in this edition and the sensationalist style overall somewhat negatively impact my taking his obviously hard work seriously.Still, he has me convinced that people indeed are inherently good and the subtitle ""a new history of mankind"" is not exaggerated for this book."
38,9082942186,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4877957-denise,3,"Bregman espouses the theory that people are fundamentally good and we should all act according to that assumption, thus making the world a far better place. It's a nice theory, optimistic, uplifting, bound to give you the warm and fuzzies. If you buy it. Which I don't. I went into this book with a healthy (though Bregman might disagree) dose of scepticism, and I came out with said scepticism firmly intact. That's not to say I think the book a load of nonsense - on the contrary, Bregman makes many good points and offers plenty of examples to back them up. It's certainly thoughtprovoking and makes one question one's assumptions. It's also, however, entirely too biased and black and white if you ask me. For every ""people are good at heart"" example he cites, one could find one supporting the opposite - but anything that doesn't fit Bregman's preconceived notions is disregarded. Call me cynical, but to me this oversimplified view is both unrealistic and naive."
39,9082942186,http://goodreads.com/user/show/115057071-anthony-weir,1,"Many human beings may be 'nicer' than we might imagine, but we are also much more stupid and subservient than Bregman allows. The famous Tongan boys were co-operative and mutually self-supporting because they came from a congenial Tongan culture very different from the competitive and status-obsessed one of the boys in ""Lord of the Flies"". We are only as good as our culture and our leaders - and, crucially, our peers - allow us to be. Status, like Power, corrupts, and we are, largely, the slaves of power and the status it confers. Collaborators with tyranny (as Bregman must know) tend to vastly outnumber dissidents and resistants. There are exceptions (such as the Danes in World War Two) but they only prove the rule. "

42,9082942186,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11365134-zo,4,"In this book, Rutger Bregman gives an answer the age-old question 'is human nature good or evil'. Verdict: humans have a natural tendency for kindness. He questions why this answer is often met with scoffs and skepticism, and challenges the view that it is more realistic to view humanity as bad once you remove the veneer of civilization. To do so, he puts into questions popular psychological and sociological theories, common myths and beliefs, and often succeeds at completely undoing them. He collects a good number of studies, experiments and stories that provide evidence that it may in fact be more realistic to expect people to do good. He then explores what this shift in perspective might mean for school, democracy, and the corporate world. I'm so glad this book exists. I've been finding it difficult in recent months, if not years, to keep optimistic about humanity and the future, so it's been great to be reminded why it's worth it to be optimistic. This books is well argued and is well-referenced. I also can't emphasize enough how easy it was to read. I was taken in from the beginning and had trouble putting the book down at times. I also like that the author doesn't wave off the fact that humans can be cruel and instead, acknowledges, and integrates that fact into his argument. Because the author tries to include many dimensions and presents his argument in a very digestible way, some sections lacked a bit in depth, especially in the final chapters. However, that's what bibliographies are for and I'm looking forward to reading the work of some of the researchers mentioned. After enjoying this book and Utopia for Realists: How We Can Build the Ideal World, which both present real possible ways the world could be improved if we just open our minds to the possibilities, I'm looking forward to reading his next books."

I read a review (which maybe I shouldn’t have) saying this would be the next “must-read” book such as Sapiens - I guess my rating is influenced by what I expected vs what I got. All that aside, I did enjoy reading this and discovering different aspects/perspectives of famous studies, stories, or news that have warped my view of the world. “Interacting with strangers is something we have to learn, preferably starting from childhood. Best of all would be if every young person could travel like Abraham Biljoen did in his college days. Mark Twain figured that out as early as 1867, observing that ‘travel is fatal to prejudice, bigotry and narrow-mindedness’. This is not to say we need to change who we are. Quite the opposite. Among the most notable findings to come out of contact science is that prejudices can be eliminated only if we retain our own identity. We need to realize it’s okay that we’re all different - there’s nothing wrong with that. We can build strong houses for our identities, with sturdy foundations. Then we can throw open the doors.”"
44,9082942186,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8332449-rimjhim-roy,5,"This is a book that wants you to believe that in spite of the outright, everyday terribleness that we are surrounded by, people are fundamentally decent. We're a species oriented to kindness and goodness; that it is the systems around us, systems that govern us, systems that feed us information, that take the view that humans need extrinsic motivation and are terrible that have made us so terrible. He takes on case after terrible case in human history to tear it down and show us flawed assumptions and make us believe that only if we look under the surface, humans are actually created for cooperation.To be honest, I found this to be a difficult book to read. I do believe that humans are fundamentally decent and honest, yet I faced a lot of mental resistance to the central premise. I took extensive notes and had my own ""Yes, but"" caveats to his theories. But the author does a really good job of at least convincing me that if we just treat people with the idea that they are fundamentally decent and motivated and build systems around it, it will be a self fulfilling prophecy.Would recommend reading to at least help us imagine a different world."
45,9082942186,http://goodreads.com/user/show/61150437-xerxia,5,"It isn't often I can say that a book has left me profoundly changed, but I can here.This book is essentially a meta analysis of decades worth of psychology, anthropology and sociology studies, woven together into a narrative to prove the author's thesis. It delves deeply into all of the ways humanity has been painted as inherently bad, via war, criminology, education, and religion to name a few, and then sets out to prove them all flawed. And if that sounds boring, let me assure you that it is not. Yes, it's well researched and supported, but it's tied together in a beautiful story of hope. The author's underlying message, that people are fundamentally good, is hard to digest in our current reality. But his hopefulness is infectious, and beautiful. It's not the hope of a naive person, it's a rational and thoughtful hope. And a powerful message."

Seriously though, I don't know that this theory adequately explains the terrible choices and acts of inhumanity committed by human kind, on each other and on creatures we share this planet with. I am also not quite sure that the main take I have from this book is what Bregman would have intended.. Friends are a really bloody awful idea and make us act like vicious arseholes all too frequently. I will mull it over and hopefully come to some less depressing conclusions."
47,9082942186,http://goodreads.com/user/show/67610833-john-crippen,3,"The feel good hit of the summer for me. Bregman debunks the veneer theory by reanalyzing the classic experiments and arguments supporting it. If you've been irritated or upset by the constant stream of bad news about human nature coming out over the last fifty years (he does also take some deeper dives into history, particularly to look at the effects of the agricultural revolution), then you should read this. He misses the mark on some of his criticisms (Dawkins really was talking about genes, not humans), but his overall message is important and important to talk about as a society: Hobbes was wrong, Rousseau was right, humans are naturally kind. Thanks to Shal for the recommendation. "
48,9082942186,http://goodreads.com/user/show/21106388-grace,3,"While I really really enjoyed some parts of this book, I think it wasn’t completely fleshed out. It just felt hard to connect some of the ideas. The stories were great and I loved hearing different sides, but there were some obvious thoughts he sought to dismantle, with no facts to back up his opinion. There were definitely some facts in here, but also some over arching opinions. While I enjoyed the last hundred pages or so, it wasn’t my favorite I’ve read."
49,9082942186,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2497661-jeanne,0,"I take issue with this author's handling of the story of Tongan men in an article for the Guardian. For more information see this article by an actual Tongan: https://thespinoff.co.nz/atea/17-05-2...This author turning a very complex story and culture into Feel Good Clickbait White Savior story, makes me question the lens of the other stories in this book and who profits when white authors treat other people's stories (especially those of indigenous people) like a salad bar. Picking and choosing what they like to produce a book that likely is intended to only comfort those who already benefit a great deal from the pain suffering of others. I'm not against optimism, I am against it when it involves exploitation and mythmaking at the expense of marginalized people."
50,9082942186,http://goodreads.com/user/show/109172989-briana,5,"A book built on the premise that most people are inherently alright. It goes through the biological changes and advantages of being kind to one another, then debunks common misinterpretations of popular studies, like the Stanford Prison experiment, and finally gives a few examples of how we can utilise our natures to make the world a better place, citing the Norwegian vs American prison systems and alternative education systems. The chapter on NYPD's 'broken windows' philosophy is particularly pertinent today.It does gloss over 'the solution to racism!' happily by saying we'd all be better if we just mixed a bit more. It's clearly written by an author who has never had the pressure of representing their token minority or experienced aggression for being the odd one out.Easy to read and it makes you feel smart."

It looks at the true meaning of humankind & how the vast majority of humans are kind and good natured despite the cynical view that we can’t trust anyone.I absolutely devoured this book and highlighted so much (via kindle) and I would love a physical copy to reread! I feel like it’s something that everyone could read over and over again and take something new from it.It’s truly brilliant and opens us up to a hope for the future while also being honest about how society is and how it can seem like we’re all alone but we’re not!"

So much here that I already believed in my heart of hearts. So much that is easy to forget when faced with our media, the occasional sociopath in business, and the division among us. But with this book Bregman reminds me what I believe. "
53,9082942186,http://goodreads.com/user/show/67574581-david-franklin,4,"An entertaining book which succeeds in persuading us that we are kind at heart. Bregman is right to take on Lord of the Flies, and to challenge Hobbes’ contention that we are all savages in a state of nature. His exploration of empathy as a double-edged sword gives us a helpful framework with which to understand the polarisation we see today. The book is an easy read: Bregman is good at connecting with his audience, and his use of examples throughout is excellent. Where the book struggles is with the gap between ‘we are kind at heart’ and ‘we must design institutions that reflect our kindness’. Bregman may well be right that it is civilization’s fault that we end up with Machiavellian leaders. But we are here now, and civilization has more going for it than against it. He cites a few examples of participatory democracy and self-directed teams, but they are more of a curiosity than a convincing case for change. The reader is left slightly in the dark about how Bregman would go about redesigning institutions for the better.While the writing is persuasive, he over-uses the ‘I used to think X, but then I found Y and it shocked me’ device. There’s also one bit where he admits: “I’m going to be honest. Originally, I wanted to bring Milgram’s experiments crashing down”, which is not a good starting point for an unbiased examination. That said, his honesty, like much of the book, is refreshing. Four stars for being a great read, and for fighting back against the false idea that the cynics are always right."

There is an interesting example of Blok’s model of management where small teams are given full autonomy which has been very successful and created a win-win situation for the company as well as the employees. As the author say, “Because nothing is more powerful than people who do something because they want to do it.”Further, education is looked at from the opposite of current day industrial / factory model. Importance of play, where the children are left free to experiment and explore is highlighted. Agora model of education which give a lot of autonomy to kids to design their own learning paths is presented which builds much more well-rounded individuals. “You can’t teach creativity,’ writes psychologist Peter Gray, ‘all you can do is let it blossom.”Next example shows how cities and governments might look like when then are run autonomously using participatory models of governance. There is also an interesting discussion of the Elinor Ostrom’s model of the commons countering Hardin’s tragedy of the commons. Finally, the author gives examples where even in the most complex scenarios like handling prisoners, controlling police or even wars, it is possible to bring a positive change with models based on trust and compassion. Being kind in not easy. As it is mentioned towards the end of the book, “To believe people are hardwired to be kind isn’t sentimental or naive. On the contrary, it’s courageous and realistic to believe in peace and forgiveness.” Also this strategy won’t be successful in 100% scenarios, however as the author says, “ accept and account for the fact that you’ll occasionally be cheated. That’s a small price to pay for the luxury of a lifetime of trusting other people.”This book is powerful and can change the way we perceive the world. It also presents numerous examples where a culture of trust, autonomy, goodness and compassion can build much better systems. This book restores hope in humankind and shows a way where we can be the change we want to see in the world, by being kind!"

72,9082942186,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11365134-zo,4,"In this book, Rutger Bregman gives an answer the age-old question 'is human nature good or evil'. Verdict: humans have a natural tendency for kindness. He questions why this answer is often met with scoffs and skepticism, and challenges the view that it is more realistic to view humanity as bad once you remove the veneer of civilization. To do so, he puts into questions popular psychological and sociological theories, common myths and beliefs, and often succeeds at completely undoing them. He collects a good number of studies, experiments and stories that provide evidence that it may in fact be more realistic to expect people to do good. He then explores what this shift in perspective might mean for school, democracy, and the corporate world. I'm so glad this book exists. I've been finding it difficult in recent months, if not years, to keep optimistic about humanity and the future, so it's been great to be reminded why it's worth it to be optimistic. This books is well argued and is well-referenced. I also can't emphasize enough how easy it was to read. I was taken in from the beginning and had trouble putting the book down at times. I also like that the author doesn't wave off the fact that humans can be cruel and instead, acknowledges, and integrates that fact into his argument. Because the author tries to include many dimensions and presents his argument in a very digestible way, some sections lacked a bit in depth, especially in the final chapters. However, that's what bibliographies are for and I'm looking forward to reading the work of some of the researchers mentioned. After enjoying this book and Utopia for Realists: How We Can Build the Ideal World, which both present real possible ways the world could be improved if we just open our minds to the possibilities, I'm looking forward to reading his next books."

I read a review (which maybe I shouldn’t have) saying this would be the next “must-read” book such as Sapiens - I guess my rating is influenced by what I expected vs what I got. All that aside, I did enjoy reading this and discovering different aspects/perspectives of famous studies, stories, or news that have warped my view of the world. “Interacting with strangers is something we have to learn, preferably starting from childhood. Best of all would be if every young person could travel like Abraham Biljoen did in his college days. Mark Twain figured that out as early as 1867, observing that ‘travel is fatal to prejudice, bigotry and narrow-mindedness’. This is not to say we need to change who we are. Quite the opposite. Among the most notable findings to come out of contact science is that prejudices can be eliminated only if we retain our own identity. We need to realize it’s okay that we’re all different - there’s nothing wrong with that. We can build strong houses for our identities, with sturdy foundations. Then we can throw open the doors.”"
74,9082942186,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8332449-rimjhim-roy,5,"This is a book that wants you to believe that in spite of the outright, everyday terribleness that we are surrounded by, people are fundamentally decent. We're a species oriented to kindness and goodness; that it is the systems around us, systems that govern us, systems that feed us information, that take the view that humans need extrinsic motivation and are terrible that have made us so terrible. He takes on case after terrible case in human history to tear it down and show us flawed assumptions and make us believe that only if we look under the surface, humans are actually created for cooperation.To be honest, I found this to be a difficult book to read. I do believe that humans are fundamentally decent and honest, yet I faced a lot of mental resistance to the central premise. I took extensive notes and had my own ""Yes, but"" caveats to his theories. But the author does a really good job of at least convincing me that if we just treat people with the idea that they are fundamentally decent and motivated and build systems around it, it will be a self fulfilling prophecy.Would recommend reading to at least help us imagine a different world."

It delves deeply into all of the ways humanity has been painted as inherently bad, via war, criminology, education, and religion to name a few, and then sets out to prove them all flawed. And if that sounds boring, let me assure you that it is not. Yes, it's well researched and supported, but it's tied together in a beautiful story of hope. The author's underlying message, that people are fundamentally good, is hard to digest in our current reality. But his hopefulness is infectious, and beautiful. It's not the hope of a naive person, it's a rational and thoughtful hope. And a powerful message."

I am also not quite sure that the main take I have from this book is what Bregman would have intended.. Friends are a really bloody awful idea and make us act like vicious arseholes all too frequently. I will mull it over and hopefully come to some less depressing conclusions."

Bregman debunks the veneer theory by reanalyzing the classic experiments and arguments supporting it. If you've been irritated or upset by the constant stream of bad news about human nature coming out over the last fifty years (he does also take some deeper dives into history, particularly to look at the effects of the agricultural revolution), then you should read this. He misses the mark on some of his criticisms (Dawkins really was talking about genes, not humans), but his overall message is important and important to talk about as a society: Hobbes was wrong, Rousseau was right, humans are naturally kind.

The chapter on NYPD's 'broken windows' philosophy is particularly pertinent today.It does gloss over 'the solution to racism!' happily by saying we'd all be better if we just mixed a bit more.

83,9082942186,http://goodreads.com/user/show/67574581-david-franklin,4,"An entertaining book which succeeds in persuading us that we are kind at heart. Bregman is right to take on Lord of the Flies, and to challenge Hobbes’ contention that we are all savages in a state of nature. His exploration of empathy as a double-edged sword gives us a helpful framework with which to understand the polarisation we see today. The book is an easy read: Bregman is good at connecting with his audience, and his use of examples throughout is excellent. Where the book struggles is with the gap between ‘we are kind at heart’ and ‘we must design institutions that reflect our kindness’. Bregman may well be right that it is civilization’s fault that we end up with Machiavellian leaders. But we are here now, and civilization has more going for it than against it. He cites a few examples of participatory democracy and self-directed teams, but they are more of a curiosity than a convincing case for change. The reader is left slightly in the dark about how Bregman would go about redesigning institutions for the better.While the writing is persuasive, he over-uses the ‘I used to think X, but then I found Y and it shocked me’ device. There’s also one bit where he admits: “I’m going to be honest. Originally, I wanted to bring Milgram’s experiments crashing down”, which is not a good starting point for an unbiased examination. That said, his honesty, like much of the book, is refreshing. Four stars for being a great read, and for fighting back against the false idea that the cynics are always right."

I did enjoy the way he criticised these old totemic studies that have shaped our views to an alarming degree - I can only hope the studies supporting Bregman’s views received the same level of scrutiny...

All of us need to be reminded in the intrinsic goodness of the humankind, even though sometimes it might be hard to see. The core idea of this book is that humans in general are kind and trustworthy. And the author builds on this idea throughout the book across diverse aspects like education, business, government and more.The book has many interesting and well researched case studies like the real life version of the fictional story from Lord of the Flies. What might have happened on the Easter Island than the usually believed story of war, mass destruction and cannibalism. There is also an in-depth analysis on some of the expected questionable events / experiments like the Stanford Prison experiment, Milgram’s shock machine experiment and Catherine Susan Genovese’s murder in NYC. In all these cases, an alternate picture based on detailed research is presented which completely changes the point of view. The models of our day-to-day systems will be very different and enriching when they are built from a trustful point of view rather that the existing models which are usually distrustful by default. There are interesting examples where the application of these principles has brought remarkable change.

Verdict: humans have a natural tendency for kindness.

To do so, he puts into questions popular psychological and sociological theories, common myths and beliefs, and often succeeds at completely undoing them. He collects a good number of studies, experiments and stories that provide evidence that it may in fact be more realistic to expect people to do good. He then explores what this shift in perspective might mean for school, democracy, and the corporate world. I'm so glad this book exists. I've been finding it difficult in recent months, if not years, to keep optimistic about humanity and the future, so it's been great to be reminded why it's worth it to be optimistic.

For more information see this article by an actual Tongan: https://thespinoff.co.nz/atea/17-05-2...This author turning a very complex story and culture into Feel Good Clickbait White Savior story, makes me question the lens of the other stories in this book and who profits when white authors treat other people's stories (especially those of indigenous people) like a salad bar. Picking and choosing what they like to produce a book that likely is intended to only comfort those who already benefit a great deal from the pain suffering of others. I'm not against optimism, I am against it when it involves exploitation and mythmaking at the expense of marginalized people."

It goes through the biological changes and advantages of being kind to one another, then debunks common misinterpretations of popular studies, like the Stanford Prison experiment, and finally gives a few examples of how we can utilise our natures to make the world a better place, citing the Norwegian vs American prison systems and alternative education systems. The chapter on NYPD's 'broken windows' philosophy is particularly pertinent today.It does gloss over 'the solution to racism!' happily by saying we'd all be better if we just mixed a bit more. It's clearly written by an author who has never had the pressure of representing their token minority or experienced aggression for being the odd one out.Easy to read and it makes you feel smart."

But with this book Bregman reminds me what I believe. "
113,9082942186,http://goodreads.com/user/show/67574581-david-franklin,4,"An entertaining book which succeeds in persuading us that we are kind at heart. Bregman is right to take on Lord of the Flies, and to challenge Hobbes’ contention that we are all savages in a state of nature. His exploration of empathy as a double-edged sword gives us a helpful framework with which to understand the polarisation we see today. The book is an easy read: Bregman is good at connecting with his audience, and his use of examples throughout is excellent. Where the book struggles is with the gap between ‘we are kind at heart’ and ‘we must design institutions that reflect our kindness’. Bregman may well be right that it is civilization’s fault that we end up with Machiavellian leaders. But we are here now, and civilization has more going for it than against it. He cites a few examples of participatory democracy and self-directed teams, but they are more of a curiosity than a convincing case for change. The reader is left slightly in the dark about how Bregman would go about redesigning institutions for the better.While the writing is persuasive, he over-uses the ‘I used to think X, but then I found Y and it shocked me’ device. There’s also one bit where he admits: “I’m going to be honest. Originally, I wanted to bring Milgram’s experiments crashing down”, which is not a good starting point for an unbiased examination. That said, his honesty, like much of the book, is refreshing. Four stars for being a great read, and for fighting back against the false idea that the cynics are always right."

And after reading this, I am not convinced the truth about human nature is quite as heart-warming as Bregman presents, but I think it’s an argument that needs to be made and fortunately, he is capable of *some* nuance. I did enjoy the way he criticised these old totemic studies that have shaped our views to an alarming degree - I can only hope the studies supporting Bregman’s views received the same level of scrutiny... It is an easy, engaging read, especially the first two thirds. As is often the case with thinkers, the parts about how to actually implement their excellent ideas are the weakest link in the chain."

As should we all.
124,9082942186,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6044031-jayati-deshmukh,5,"This book is like a ray of hope in the current times of global pandemic, inter-community disruptions, natural disasters and more. All of us need to be reminded in the intrinsic goodness of the humankind, even though sometimes it might be hard to see. The core idea of this book is that humans in general are kind and trustworthy. And the author builds on this idea throughout the book across diverse aspects like education, business, government and more.The book has many interesting and well researched case studies like the real life version of the fictional story from Lord of the Flies. What might have happened on the Easter Island than the usually believed story of war, mass destruction and cannibalism. There is also an in-depth analysis on some of the expected questionable events / experiments like the Stanford Prison experiment, Milgram’s shock machine experiment and Catherine Susan Genovese’s murder in NYC. In all these cases, an alternate picture based on detailed research is presented which completely changes the point of view. The models of our day-to-day systems will be very different and enriching when they are built from a trustful point of view rather that the existing models which are usually distrustful by default. There are interesting examples where the application of these principles has brought remarkable change. Management, of example in a top down manner with strict way of doing things can be counter productive. There is an interesting example of Blok’s model of management where small teams are given full autonomy which has been very successful and created a win-win situation for the company as well as the employees. As the author say, “Because nothing is more powerful than people who do something because they want to do it.”Further, education is looked at from the opposite of current day industrial / factory model. Importance of play, where the children are left free to experiment and explore is highlighted. Agora model of education which give a lot of autonomy to kids to design their own learning paths is presented which builds much more well-rounded individuals. “You can’t teach creativity,’ writes psychologist Peter Gray, ‘all you can do is let it blossom.”Next example shows how cities and governments might look like when then are run autonomously using participatory models of governance. There is also an interesting discussion of the Elinor Ostrom’s model of the commons countering Hardin’s tragedy of the commons. Finally, the author gives examples where even in the most complex scenarios like handling prisoners, controlling police or even wars, it is possible to bring a positive change with models based on trust and compassion. Being kind in not easy. As it is mentioned towards the end of the book, “To believe people are hardwired to be kind isn’t sentimental or naive. On the contrary, it’s courageous and realistic to believe in peace and forgiveness.” Also this strategy won’t be successful in 100% scenarios, however as the author says, “ accept and account for the fact that you’ll occasionally be cheated. That’s a small price to pay for the luxury of a lifetime of trusting other people.”This book is powerful and can change the way we perceive the world. It also presents numerous examples where a culture of trust, autonomy, goodness and compassion can build much better systems. This book restores hope in humankind and shows a way where we can be the change we want to see in the world, by being kind!"
125,9082942186,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6571378-luke,5,"This was a wonderful book!While reading I was doubting if I wanted to give it 4 or 5 stars. The reasons for giving it 4 stars being that a). Bregman writes in quite an informal way - sometimes bordering on slang - and b). makes very 'out there' statements which at times seem to be written just to shock., both of which I found to be slightly aggravating. However, I found that I got used to this as I progressed and that the content of the book outweighs these reasons by far. To me it was very surprising how Bregman manages to discuss themes, current affairs and human behaviour in a completely new and innovative way while being 'realistic' and using excellent resources (and let me tell you, if there is one thing that irks me greatly, it is a lack of- or untrustworthy resources). The value of the book in this regard is in my opnion both the way that Bregman dares to discuss them so fearlessly, thereby breaking old taboos and clearing space for new ideas, and the nuanced way he seems to do so (once you get used to the slightly jovial use of language, that is). I recognized many of the studies that Bregman debunks and was just afghast once I realized how religiously they are being teached at our schools and universities when learning about our Western history and society. Take Zimbardo's Standford Prison Experiment for example, or Miligrams shock experiment, both are studies that were very formative when learning about human behaviour during both my social and nursing education. Like I said, this book opened some doors for me and broke a lot of old thought patterns I ddn't realize I had. It made me feel inspired, uncomfortable and hopeful at the same time. I am very happy it will be released in the English language in may 2020... this way I can recommend it not only to my Dutch speaking friends, but to my English speaking ones as well ;)"
126,9082942186,http://goodreads.com/user/show/62488403-ben,5,"Why should cynicism be synonymous with realism? Bregman deconstructs our views on human nature, and the way these views underpin our sociopolitical institutions. With his defence of human decency, a tendency toward peace, and a sense of community, he builds hope. Despite occasionally feeling disorganized, this book should be required reading - especially for those who question whether people are fundamentally good."
127,9082942186,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1838124-bart-van-loon,4,"I really enjoyed this book - or collection of essays if you wish - by Bregman. I am very happy to have some of my misconceptions in social psychology set right (the shock-experiment, the Stanford prison experiment, the murder of Kitty Genovese, etc...). It was also refreshing to see somebody bluntly oppose great thinkers like Pinker and Gladwell and join the ""new realism""-ranks of Harari. I found this new history of mankind very compelling and interesting to read.However, I also agree with most of the criticism online: sometimes the author's writing betrays a pedantic desire to have an exclusive right to the truth, and from time to time he even reverts to fallacies he elsewhere condemns. I also found the very large font size, big margins and huge chapter headings in this edition and the sensationalist style overall somewhat negatively impact my taking his obviously hard work seriously.Still, he has me convinced that people indeed are inherently good and the subtitle ""a new history of mankind"" is not exaggerated for this book."
128,9082942186,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4877957-denise,3,"Bregman espouses the theory that people are fundamentally good and we should all act according to that assumption, thus making the world a far better place. It's a nice theory, optimistic, uplifting, bound to give you the warm and fuzzies. If you buy it. Which I don't. I went into this book with a healthy (though Bregman might disagree) dose of scepticism, and I came out with said scepticism firmly intact. That's not to say I think the book a load of nonsense - on the contrary, Bregman makes many good points and offers plenty of examples to back them up. It's certainly thoughtprovoking and makes one question one's assumptions. It's also, however, entirely too biased and black and white if you ask me. For every ""people are good at heart"" example he cites, one could find one supporting the opposite - but anything that doesn't fit Bregman's preconceived notions is disregarded. Call me cynical, but to me this oversimplified view is both unrealistic and naive."

We are only as good as our culture and our leaders - and, crucially, our peers - allow us to be. Status, like Power, corrupts, and we are, largely, the slaves of power and the status it confers.

I did enjoy the way he criticised these old totemic studies that have shaped our views to an alarming degree - I can only hope the studies supporting Bregman’s views received the same level of scrutiny... It is an easy, engaging read, especially the first two thirds. As is often the case with thinkers, the parts about how to actually implement their excellent ideas are the weakest link in the chain."

154,9082942186,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6044031-jayati-deshmukh,5,"This book is like a ray of hope in the current times of global pandemic, inter-community disruptions, natural disasters and more. All of us need to be reminded in the intrinsic goodness of the humankind, even though sometimes it might be hard to see. The core idea of this book is that humans in general are kind and trustworthy. And the author builds on this idea throughout the book across diverse aspects like education, business, government and more.The book has many interesting and well researched case studies like the real life version of the fictional story from Lord of the Flies. What might have happened on the Easter Island than the usually believed story of war, mass destruction and cannibalism. There is also an in-depth analysis on some of the expected questionable events / experiments like the Stanford Prison experiment, Milgram’s shock machine experiment and Catherine Susan Genovese’s murder in NYC. In all these cases, an alternate picture based on detailed research is presented which completely changes the point of view. The models of our day-to-day systems will be very different and enriching when they are built from a trustful point of view rather that the existing models which are usually distrustful by default. There are interesting examples where the application of these principles has brought remarkable change. Management, of example in a top down manner with strict way of doing things can be counter productive. There is an interesting example of Blok’s model of management where small teams are given full autonomy which has been very successful and created a win-win situation for the company as well as the employees. As the author say, “Because nothing is more powerful than people who do something because they want to do it.”Further, education is looked at from the opposite of current day industrial / factory model. Importance of play, where the children are left free to experiment and explore is highlighted. Agora model of education which give a lot of autonomy to kids to design their own learning paths is presented which builds much more well-rounded individuals. “You can’t teach creativity,’ writes psychologist Peter Gray, ‘all you can do is let it blossom.”Next example shows how cities and governments might look like when then are run autonomously using participatory models of governance. There is also an interesting discussion of the Elinor Ostrom’s model of the commons countering Hardin’s tragedy of the commons. Finally, the author gives examples where even in the most complex scenarios like handling prisoners, controlling police or even wars, it is possible to bring a positive change with models based on trust and compassion. Being kind in not easy. As it is mentioned towards the end of the book, “To believe people are hardwired to be kind isn’t sentimental or naive. On the contrary, it’s courageous and realistic to believe in peace and forgiveness.” Also this strategy won’t be successful in 100% scenarios, however as the author says, “ accept and account for the fact that you’ll occasionally be cheated. That’s a small price to pay for the luxury of a lifetime of trusting other people.”This book is powerful and can change the way we perceive the world. It also presents numerous examples where a culture of trust, autonomy, goodness and compassion can build much better systems. This book restores hope in humankind and shows a way where we can be the change we want to see in the world, by being kind!"
155,9082942186,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6571378-luke,5,"This was a wonderful book!While reading I was doubting if I wanted to give it 4 or 5 stars. The reasons for giving it 4 stars being that a). Bregman writes in quite an informal way - sometimes bordering on slang - and b). makes very 'out there' statements which at times seem to be written just to shock., both of which I found to be slightly aggravating. However, I found that I got used to this as I progressed and that the content of the book outweighs these reasons by far. To me it was very surprising how Bregman manages to discuss themes, current affairs and human behaviour in a completely new and innovative way while being 'realistic' and using excellent resources (and let me tell you, if there is one thing that irks me greatly, it is a lack of- or untrustworthy resources). The value of the book in this regard is in my opnion both the way that Bregman dares to discuss them so fearlessly, thereby breaking old taboos and clearing space for new ideas, and the nuanced way he seems to do so (once you get used to the slightly jovial use of language, that is). I recognized many of the studies that Bregman debunks and was just afghast once I realized how religiously they are being teached at our schools and universities when learning about our Western history and society. Take Zimbardo's Standford Prison Experiment for example, or Miligrams shock experiment, both are studies that were very formative when learning about human behaviour during both my social and nursing education. Like I said, this book opened some doors for me and broke a lot of old thought patterns I ddn't realize I had. It made me feel inspired, uncomfortable and hopeful at the same time. I am very happy it will be released in the English language in may 2020... this way I can recommend it not only to my Dutch speaking friends, but to my English speaking ones as well ;)"
156,9082942186,http://goodreads.com/user/show/62488403-ben,5,"Why should cynicism be synonymous with realism? Bregman deconstructs our views on human nature, and the way these views underpin our sociopolitical institutions. With his defence of human decency, a tendency toward peace, and a sense of community, he builds hope. Despite occasionally feeling disorganized, this book should be required reading - especially for those who question whether people are fundamentally good."
157,9082942186,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1838124-bart-van-loon,4,"I really enjoyed this book - or collection of essays if you wish - by Bregman. I am very happy to have some of my misconceptions in social psychology set right (the shock-experiment, the Stanford prison experiment, the murder of Kitty Genovese, etc...). It was also refreshing to see somebody bluntly oppose great thinkers like Pinker and Gladwell and join the ""new realism""-ranks of Harari. I found this new history of mankind very compelling and interesting to read.However, I also agree with most of the criticism online: sometimes the author's writing betrays a pedantic desire to have an exclusive right to the truth, and from time to time he even reverts to fallacies he elsewhere condemns. I also found the very large font size, big margins and huge chapter headings in this edition and the sensationalist style overall somewhat negatively impact my taking his obviously hard work seriously.Still, he has me convinced that people indeed are inherently good and the subtitle ""a new history of mankind"" is not exaggerated for this book."
158,9082942186,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4877957-denise,3,"Bregman espouses the theory that people are fundamentally good and we should all act according to that assumption, thus making the world a far better place. It's a nice theory, optimistic, uplifting, bound to give you the warm and fuzzies. If you buy it. Which I don't. I went into this book with a healthy (though Bregman might disagree) dose of scepticism, and I came out with said scepticism firmly intact. That's not to say I think the book a load of nonsense - on the contrary, Bregman makes many good points and offers plenty of examples to back them up. It's certainly thoughtprovoking and makes one question one's assumptions. It's also, however, entirely too biased and black and white if you ask me. For every ""people are good at heart"" example he cites, one could find one supporting the opposite - but anything that doesn't fit Bregman's preconceived notions is disregarded. Call me cynical, but to me this oversimplified view is both unrealistic and naive."
159,9082942186,http://goodreads.com/user/show/115057071-anthony-weir,1,"Many human beings may be 'nicer' than we might imagine, but we are also much more stupid and subservient than Bregman allows. The famous Tongan boys were co-operative and mutually self-supporting because they came from a congenial Tongan culture very different from the competitive and status-obsessed one of the boys in ""Lord of the Flies"". We are only as good as our culture and our leaders - and, crucially, our peers - allow us to be. Status, like Power, corrupts, and we are, largely, the slaves of power and the status it confers. Collaborators with tyranny (as Bregman must know) tend to vastly outnumber dissidents and resistants. There are exceptions (such as the Danes in World War Two) but they only prove the rule. "

162,9082942186,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11365134-zo,4,"In this book, Rutger Bregman gives an answer the age-old question 'is human nature good or evil'. Verdict: humans have a natural tendency for kindness. He questions why this answer is often met with scoffs and skepticism, and challenges the view that it is more realistic to view humanity as bad once you remove the veneer of civilization. To do so, he puts into questions popular psychological and sociological theories, common myths and beliefs, and often succeeds at completely undoing them. He collects a good number of studies, experiments and stories that provide evidence that it may in fact be more realistic to expect people to do good. He then explores what this shift in perspective might mean for school, democracy, and the corporate world. I'm so glad this book exists. I've been finding it difficult in recent months, if not years, to keep optimistic about humanity and the future, so it's been great to be reminded why it's worth it to be optimistic. This books is well argued and is well-referenced. I also can't emphasize enough how easy it was to read. I was taken in from the beginning and had trouble putting the book down at times. I also like that the author doesn't wave off the fact that humans can be cruel and instead, acknowledges, and integrates that fact into his argument. Because the author tries to include many dimensions and presents his argument in a very digestible way, some sections lacked a bit in depth, especially in the final chapters. However, that's what bibliographies are for and I'm looking forward to reading the work of some of the researchers mentioned. After enjoying this book and Utopia for Realists: How We Can Build the Ideal World, which both present real possible ways the world could be improved if we just open our minds to the possibilities, I'm looking forward to reading his next books."

I read a review (which maybe I shouldn’t have) saying this would be the next “must-read” book such as Sapiens - I guess my rating is influenced by what I expected vs what I got. All that aside, I did enjoy reading this and discovering different aspects/perspectives of famous studies, stories, or news that have warped my view of the world. “Interacting with strangers is something we have to learn, preferably starting from childhood. Best of all would be if every young person could travel like Abraham Biljoen did in his college days. Mark Twain figured that out as early as 1867, observing that ‘travel is fatal to prejudice, bigotry and narrow-mindedness’. This is not to say we need to change who we are. Quite the opposite. Among the most notable findings to come out of contact science is that prejudices can be eliminated only if we retain our own identity. We need to realize it’s okay that we’re all different - there’s nothing wrong with that. We can build strong houses for our identities, with sturdy foundations. Then we can throw open the doors.”"
164,9082942186,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8332449-rimjhim-roy,5,"This is a book that wants you to believe that in spite of the outright, everyday terribleness that we are surrounded by, people are fundamentally decent. We're a species oriented to kindness and goodness; that it is the systems around us, systems that govern us, systems that feed us information, that take the view that humans need extrinsic motivation and are terrible that have made us so terrible. He takes on case after terrible case in human history to tear it down and show us flawed assumptions and make us believe that only if we look under the surface, humans are actually created for cooperation.To be honest, I found this to be a difficult book to read. I do believe that humans are fundamentally decent and honest, yet I faced a lot of mental resistance to the central premise. I took extensive notes and had my own ""Yes, but"" caveats to his theories. But the author does a really good job of at least convincing me that if we just treat people with the idea that they are fundamentally decent and motivated and build systems around it, it will be a self fulfilling prophecy.Would recommend reading to at least help us imagine a different world."

It delves deeply into all of the ways humanity has been painted as inherently bad, via war, criminology, education, and religion to name a few, and then sets out to prove them all flawed. And if that sounds boring, let me assure you that it is not. Yes, it's well researched and supported, but it's tied together in a beautiful story of hope. The author's underlying message, that people are fundamentally good, is hard to digest in our current reality. But his hopefulness is infectious, and beautiful. It's not the hope of a naive person, it's a rational and thoughtful hope. And a powerful message."

I am also not quite sure that the main take I have from this book is what Bregman would have intended..

All of us need to be reminded in the intrinsic goodness of the humankind, even though sometimes it might be hard to see. The core idea of this book is that humans in general are kind and trustworthy. And the author builds on this idea throughout the book across diverse aspects like education, business, government and more.The book has many interesting and well researched case studies like the real life version of the fictional story from Lord of the Flies. What might have happened on the Easter Island than the usually believed story of war, mass destruction and cannibalism. There is also an in-depth analysis on some of the expected questionable events / experiments like the Stanford Prison experiment, Milgram’s shock machine experiment and Catherine Susan Genovese’s murder in NYC. In all these cases, an alternate picture based on detailed research is presented which completely changes the point of view. The models of our day-to-day systems will be very different and enriching when they are built from a trustful point of view rather that the existing models which are usually distrustful by default. There are interesting examples where the application of these principles has brought remarkable change. Management, of example in a top down manner with strict way of doing things can be counter productive. There is an interesting example of Blok’s model of management where small teams are given full autonomy which has been very successful and created a win-win situation for the company as well as the employees. As the author say, “Because nothing is more powerful than people who do something because they want to do it.”Further, education is looked at from the opposite of current day industrial / factory model. Importance of play, where the children are left free to experiment and explore is highlighted. Agora model of education which give a lot of autonomy to kids to design their own learning paths is presented which builds much more well-rounded individuals. “You can’t teach creativity,’ writes psychologist Peter Gray, ‘all you can do is let it blossom.”Next example shows how cities and governments might look like when then are run autonomously using participatory models of governance. There is also an interesting discussion of the Elinor Ostrom’s model of the commons countering Hardin’s tragedy of the commons. Finally, the author gives examples where even in the most complex scenarios like handling prisoners, controlling police or even wars, it is possible to bring a positive change with models based on trust and compassion. Being kind in not easy. As it is mentioned towards the end of the book, “To believe people are hardwired to be kind isn’t sentimental or naive. On the contrary, it’s courageous and realistic to believe in peace and forgiveness.” Also this strategy won’t be successful in 100% scenarios, however as the author says, “ accept and account for the fact that you’ll occasionally be cheated. That’s a small price to pay for the luxury of a lifetime of trusting other people.”This book is powerful and can change the way we perceive the world. It also presents numerous examples where a culture of trust, autonomy, goodness and compassion can build much better systems. This book restores hope in humankind and shows a way where we can be the change we want to see in the world, by being kind!"
185,9082942186,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6571378-luke,5,"This was a wonderful book!While reading I was doubting if I wanted to give it 4 or 5 stars. The reasons for giving it 4 stars being that a). Bregman writes in quite an informal way - sometimes bordering on slang - and b). makes very 'out there' statements which at times seem to be written just to shock., both of which I found to be slightly aggravating. However, I found that I got used to this as I progressed and that the content of the book outweighs these reasons by far. To me it was very surprising how Bregman manages to discuss themes, current affairs and human behaviour in a completely new and innovative way while being 'realistic' and using excellent resources (and let me tell you, if there is one thing that irks me greatly, it is a lack of- or untrustworthy resources). The value of the book in this regard is in my opnion both the way that Bregman dares to discuss them so fearlessly, thereby breaking old taboos and clearing space for new ideas, and the nuanced way he seems to do so (once you get used to the slightly jovial use of language, that is). I recognized many of the studies that Bregman debunks and was just afghast once I realized how religiously they are being teached at our schools and universities when learning about our Western history and society. Take Zimbardo's Standford Prison Experiment for example, or Miligrams shock experiment, both are studies that were very formative when learning about human behaviour during both my social and nursing education. Like I said, this book opened some doors for me and broke a lot of old thought patterns I ddn't realize I had. It made me feel inspired, uncomfortable and hopeful at the same time. I am very happy it will be released in the English language in may 2020... this way I can recommend it not only to my Dutch speaking friends, but to my English speaking ones as well ;)"
186,9082942186,http://goodreads.com/user/show/62488403-ben,5,"Why should cynicism be synonymous with realism? Bregman deconstructs our views on human nature, and the way these views underpin our sociopolitical institutions. With his defence of human decency, a tendency toward peace, and a sense of community, he builds hope. Despite occasionally feeling disorganized, this book should be required reading - especially for those who question whether people are fundamentally good."
187,9082942186,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1838124-bart-van-loon,4,"I really enjoyed this book - or collection of essays if you wish - by Bregman. I am very happy to have some of my misconceptions in social psychology set right (the shock-experiment, the Stanford prison experiment, the murder of Kitty Genovese, etc...). It was also refreshing to see somebody bluntly oppose great thinkers like Pinker and Gladwell and join the ""new realism""-ranks of Harari. I found this new history of mankind very compelling and interesting to read.However, I also agree with most of the criticism online: sometimes the author's writing betrays a pedantic desire to have an exclusive right to the truth, and from time to time he even reverts to fallacies he elsewhere condemns. I also found the very large font size, big margins and huge chapter headings in this edition and the sensationalist style overall somewhat negatively impact my taking his obviously hard work seriously.Still, he has me convinced that people indeed are inherently good and the subtitle ""a new history of mankind"" is not exaggerated for this book."
188,9082942186,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4877957-denise,3,"Bregman espouses the theory that people are fundamentally good and we should all act according to that assumption, thus making the world a far better place. It's a nice theory, optimistic, uplifting, bound to give you the warm and fuzzies. If you buy it. Which I don't. I went into this book with a healthy (though Bregman might disagree) dose of scepticism, and I came out with said scepticism firmly intact. That's not to say I think the book a load of nonsense - on the contrary, Bregman makes many good points and offers plenty of examples to back them up. It's certainly thoughtprovoking and makes one question one's assumptions. It's also, however, entirely too biased and black and white if you ask me. For every ""people are good at heart"" example he cites, one could find one supporting the opposite - but anything that doesn't fit Bregman's preconceived notions is disregarded. Call me cynical, but to me this oversimplified view is both unrealistic and naive."
189,9082942186,http://goodreads.com/user/show/115057071-anthony-weir,1,"Many human beings may be 'nicer' than we might imagine, but we are also much more stupid and subservient than Bregman allows. The famous Tongan boys were co-operative and mutually self-supporting because they came from a congenial Tongan culture very different from the competitive and status-obsessed one of the boys in ""Lord of the Flies"". We are only as good as our culture and our leaders - and, crucially, our peers - allow us to be. Status, like Power, corrupts, and we are, largely, the slaves of power and the status it confers. Collaborators with tyranny (as Bregman must know) tend to vastly outnumber dissidents and resistants. There are exceptions (such as the Danes in World War Two) but they only prove the rule. "

192,9082942186,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11365134-zo,4,"In this book, Rutger Bregman gives an answer the age-old question 'is human nature good or evil'. Verdict: humans have a natural tendency for kindness. He questions why this answer is often met with scoffs and skepticism, and challenges the view that it is more realistic to view humanity as bad once you remove the veneer of civilization. To do so, he puts into questions popular psychological and sociological theories, common myths and beliefs, and often succeeds at completely undoing them. He collects a good number of studies, experiments and stories that provide evidence that it may in fact be more realistic to expect people to do good. He then explores what this shift in perspective might mean for school, democracy, and the corporate world. I'm so glad this book exists. I've been finding it difficult in recent months, if not years, to keep optimistic about humanity and the future, so it's been great to be reminded why it's worth it to be optimistic. This books is well argued and is well-referenced. I also can't emphasize enough how easy it was to read. I was taken in from the beginning and had trouble putting the book down at times. I also like that the author doesn't wave off the fact that humans can be cruel and instead, acknowledges, and integrates that fact into his argument. Because the author tries to include many dimensions and presents his argument in a very digestible way, some sections lacked a bit in depth, especially in the final chapters. However, that's what bibliographies are for and I'm looking forward to reading the work of some of the researchers mentioned. After enjoying this book and Utopia for Realists: How We Can Build the Ideal World, which both present real possible ways the world could be improved if we just open our minds to the possibilities, I'm looking forward to reading his next books."

I read a review (which maybe I shouldn’t have) saying this would be the next “must-read” book such as Sapiens - I guess my rating is influenced by what I expected vs what I got. All that aside, I did enjoy reading this and discovering different aspects/perspectives of famous studies, stories, or news that have warped my view of the world. “Interacting with strangers is something we have to learn, preferably starting from childhood. Best of all would be if every young person could travel like Abraham Biljoen did in his college days. Mark Twain figured that out as early as 1867, observing that ‘travel is fatal to prejudice, bigotry and narrow-mindedness’. This is not to say we need to change who we are. Quite the opposite. Among the most notable findings to come out of contact science is that prejudices can be eliminated only if we retain our own identity. We need to realize it’s okay that we’re all different - there’s nothing wrong with that. We can build strong houses for our identities, with sturdy foundations. Then we can throw open the doors.”"
194,9082942186,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8332449-rimjhim-roy,5,"This is a book that wants you to believe that in spite of the outright, everyday terribleness that we are surrounded by, people are fundamentally decent. We're a species oriented to kindness and goodness; that it is the systems around us, systems that govern us, systems that feed us information, that take the view that humans need extrinsic motivation and are terrible that have made us so terrible. He takes on case after terrible case in human history to tear it down and show us flawed assumptions and make us believe that only if we look under the surface, humans are actually created for cooperation.To be honest, I found this to be a difficult book to read. I do believe that humans are fundamentally decent and honest, yet I faced a lot of mental resistance to the central premise. I took extensive notes and had my own ""Yes, but"" caveats to his theories. But the author does a really good job of at least convincing me that if we just treat people with the idea that they are fundamentally decent and motivated and build systems around it, it will be a self fulfilling prophecy.Would recommend reading to at least help us imagine a different world."
195,9082942186,http://goodreads.com/user/show/61150437-xerxia,5,"It isn't often I can say that a book has left me profoundly changed, but I can here.This book is essentially a meta analysis of decades worth of psychology, anthropology and sociology studies, woven together into a narrative to prove the author's thesis. It delves deeply into all of the ways humanity has been painted as inherently bad, via war, criminology, education, and religion to name a few, and then sets out to prove them all flawed. And if that sounds boring, let me assure you that it is not. Yes, it's well researched and supported, but it's tied together in a beautiful story of hope. The author's underlying message, that people are fundamentally good, is hard to digest in our current reality. But his hopefulness is infectious, and beautiful. It's not the hope of a naive person, it's a rational and thoughtful hope. And a powerful message."

Seriously though, I don't know that this theory adequately explains the terrible choices and acts of inhumanity committed by human kind, on each other and on creatures we share this planet with. I am also not quite sure that the main take I have from this book is what Bregman would have intended.. Friends are a really bloody awful idea and make us act like vicious arseholes all too frequently. I will mull it over and hopefully come to some less depressing conclusions."
197,9082942186,http://goodreads.com/user/show/67610833-john-crippen,3,"The feel good hit of the summer for me. Bregman debunks the veneer theory by reanalyzing the classic experiments and arguments supporting it. If you've been irritated or upset by the constant stream of bad news about human nature coming out over the last fifty years (he does also take some deeper dives into history, particularly to look at the effects of the agricultural revolution), then you should read this. He misses the mark on some of his criticisms (Dawkins really was talking about genes, not humans), but his overall message is important and important to talk about as a society: Hobbes was wrong, Rousseau was right, humans are naturally kind. Thanks to Shal for the recommendation. "

It just felt hard to connect some of the ideas. The stories were great and I loved hearing different sides, but there were some obvious thoughts he sought to dismantle, with no facts to back up his opinion. There were definitely some facts in here, but also some over arching opinions. While I enjoyed the last hundred pages or so, it wasn’t my favorite I’ve read."

For more information see this article by an actual Tongan: https://thespinoff.co.nz/atea/17-05-2...This author turning a very complex story and culture into Feel Good Clickbait White Savior story, makes me question the lens of the other stories in this book and who profits when white authors treat other people's stories (especially those of indigenous people) like a salad bar. Picking and choosing what they like to produce a book that likely is intended to only comfort those who already benefit a great deal from the pain suffering of others.

It goes through the biological changes and advantages of being kind to one another, then debunks common misinterpretations of popular studies, like the Stanford Prison experiment, and finally gives a few examples of how we can utilise our natures to make the world a better place, citing the Norwegian vs American prison systems and alternative education systems. The chapter on NYPD's 'broken windows' philosophy is particularly pertinent today.It does gloss over 'the solution to racism!' happily by saying we'd all be better if we just mixed a bit more. It's clearly written by an author who has never had the pressure of representing their token minority or experienced aggression for being the odd one out.Easy to read and it makes you feel smart."

I feel like it’s something that everyone could read over and over again and take something new from it.It’s truly brilliant and opens us up to a hope for the future while also being honest about how society is and how it can seem like we’re all alone but we’re not!"

But with this book Bregman reminds me what I believe. "
203,9082942186,http://goodreads.com/user/show/67574581-david-franklin,4,"An entertaining book which succeeds in persuading us that we are kind at heart. Bregman is right to take on Lord of the Flies, and to challenge Hobbes’ contention that we are all savages in a state of nature. His exploration of empathy as a double-edged sword gives us a helpful framework with which to understand the polarisation we see today. The book is an easy read: Bregman is good at connecting with his audience, and his use of examples throughout is excellent. Where the book struggles is with the gap between ‘we are kind at heart’ and ‘we must design institutions that reflect our kindness’. Bregman may well be right that it is civilization’s fault that we end up with Machiavellian leaders. But we are here now, and civilization has more going for it than against it. He cites a few examples of participatory democracy and self-directed teams, but they are more of a curiosity than a convincing case for change. The reader is left slightly in the dark about how Bregman would go about redesigning institutions for the better.While the writing is persuasive, he over-uses the ‘I used to think X, but then I found Y and it shocked me’ device. There’s also one bit where he admits: “I’m going to be honest. Originally, I wanted to bring Milgram’s experiments crashing down”, which is not a good starting point for an unbiased examination. That said, his honesty, like much of the book, is refreshing. Four stars for being a great read, and for fighting back against the false idea that the cynics are always right."

It also presents numerous examples where a culture of trust, autonomy, goodness and compassion can build much better systems. This book restores hope in humankind and shows a way where we can be the change we want to see in the world, by being kind!"

The reasons for giving it 4 stars being that a). Bregman writes in quite an informal way - sometimes bordering on slang - and b). makes very 'out there' statements which at times seem to be written just to shock., both of which I found to be slightly aggravating. However, I found that I got used to this as I progressed and that the content of the book outweighs these reasons by far. To me it was very surprising how Bregman manages to discuss themes, current affairs and human behaviour in a completely new and innovative way while being 'realistic' and using excellent resources (and let me tell you, if there is one thing that irks me greatly, it is a lack of- or untrustworthy resources). The value of the book in this regard is in my opnion both the way that Bregman dares to discuss them so fearlessly, thereby breaking old taboos and clearing space for new ideas, and the nuanced way he seems to do so (once you get used to the slightly jovial use of language, that is). I recognized many of the studies that Bregman debunks and was just afghast once I realized how religiously they are being teached at our schools and universities when learning about our Western history and society. Take Zimbardo's Standford Prison Experiment for example, or Miligrams shock experiment, both are studies that were very formative when learning about human behaviour during both my social and nursing education.

Verdict: humans have a natural tendency for kindness. He questions why this answer is often met with scoffs and skepticism, and challenges the view that it is more realistic to view humanity as bad once you remove the veneer of civilization. To do so, he puts into questions popular psychological and sociological theories, common myths and beliefs, and often succeeds at completely undoing them. He collects a good number of studies, experiments and stories that provide evidence that it may in fact be more realistic to expect people to do good. He then explores what this shift in perspective might mean for school, democracy, and the corporate world. I'm so glad this book exists. I've been finding it difficult in recent months, if not years, to keep optimistic about humanity and the future, so it's been great to be reminded why it's worth it to be optimistic. This books is well argued and is well-referenced. I also can't emphasize enough how easy it was to read. I was taken in from the beginning and had trouble putting the book down at times. I also like that the author doesn't wave off the fact that humans can be cruel and instead, acknowledges, and integrates that fact into his argument. Because the author tries to include many dimensions and presents his argument in a very digestible way, some sections lacked a bit in depth, especially in the final chapters. However, that's what bibliographies are for and I'm looking forward to reading the work of some of the researchers mentioned. After enjoying this book and Utopia for Realists: How We Can Build the Ideal World, which both present real possible ways the world could be improved if we just open our minds to the possibilities, I'm looking forward to reading his next books."

I read a review (which maybe I shouldn’t have) saying this would be the next “must-read” book such as Sapiens - I guess my rating is influenced by what I expected vs what I got. All that aside, I did enjoy reading this and discovering different aspects/perspectives of famous studies, stories, or news that have warped my view of the world. “Interacting with strangers is something we have to learn, preferably starting from childhood. Best of all would be if every young person could travel like Abraham Biljoen did in his college days. Mark Twain figured that out as early as 1867, observing that ‘travel is fatal to prejudice, bigotry and narrow-mindedness’. This is not to say we need to change who we are. Quite the opposite. Among the most notable findings to come out of contact science is that prejudices can be eliminated only if we retain our own identity. We need to realize it’s okay that we’re all different - there’s nothing wrong with that. We can build strong houses for our identities, with sturdy foundations. Then we can throw open the doors.”"
224,9082942186,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8332449-rimjhim-roy,5,"This is a book that wants you to believe that in spite of the outright, everyday terribleness that we are surrounded by, people are fundamentally decent. We're a species oriented to kindness and goodness; that it is the systems around us, systems that govern us, systems that feed us information, that take the view that humans need extrinsic motivation and are terrible that have made us so terrible. He takes on case after terrible case in human history to tear it down and show us flawed assumptions and make us believe that only if we look under the surface, humans are actually created for cooperation.To be honest, I found this to be a difficult book to read. I do believe that humans are fundamentally decent and honest, yet I faced a lot of mental resistance to the central premise. I took extensive notes and had my own ""Yes, but"" caveats to his theories. But the author does a really good job of at least convincing me that if we just treat people with the idea that they are fundamentally decent and motivated and build systems around it, it will be a self fulfilling prophecy.Would recommend reading to at least help us imagine a different world."

It delves deeply into all of the ways humanity has been painted as inherently bad, via war, criminology, education, and religion to name a few, and then sets out to prove them all flawed. And if that sounds boring, let me assure you that it is not. Yes, it's well researched and supported, but it's tied together in a beautiful story of hope. The author's underlying message, that people are fundamentally good, is hard to digest in our current reality. But his hopefulness is infectious, and beautiful. It's not the hope of a naive person, it's a rational and thoughtful hope. And a powerful message."

I am also not quite sure that the main take I have from this book is what Bregman would have intended.. Friends are a really bloody awful idea and make us act like vicious arseholes all too frequently. I will mull it over and hopefully come to some less depressing conclusions."

Bregman debunks the veneer theory by reanalyzing the classic experiments and arguments supporting it. If you've been irritated or upset by the constant stream of bad news about human nature coming out over the last fifty years (he does also take some deeper dives into history, particularly to look at the effects of the agricultural revolution), then you should read this. He misses the mark on some of his criticisms (Dawkins really was talking about genes, not humans), but his overall message is important and important to talk about as a society: Hobbes was wrong, Rousseau was right, humans are naturally kind. Thanks to Shal for the recommendation. "

For more information see this article by an actual Tongan: https://thespinoff.co.nz/atea/17-05-2...This author turning a very complex story and culture into Feel Good Clickbait White Savior story, makes me question the lens of the other stories in this book and who profits when white authors treat other people's stories (especially those of indigenous people) like a salad bar.

The chapter on NYPD's 'broken windows' philosophy is particularly pertinent today.It does gloss over 'the solution to racism!' happily by saying we'd all be better if we just mixed a bit more.

233,9082942186,http://goodreads.com/user/show/67574581-david-franklin,4,"An entertaining book which succeeds in persuading us that we are kind at heart. Bregman is right to take on Lord of the Flies, and to challenge Hobbes’ contention that we are all savages in a state of nature. His exploration of empathy as a double-edged sword gives us a helpful framework with which to understand the polarisation we see today. The book is an easy read: Bregman is good at connecting with his audience, and his use of examples throughout is excellent. Where the book struggles is with the gap between ‘we are kind at heart’ and ‘we must design institutions that reflect our kindness’. Bregman may well be right that it is civilization’s fault that we end up with Machiavellian leaders. But we are here now, and civilization has more going for it than against it. He cites a few examples of participatory democracy and self-directed teams, but they are more of a curiosity than a convincing case for change. The reader is left slightly in the dark about how Bregman would go about redesigning institutions for the better.While the writing is persuasive, he over-uses the ‘I used to think X, but then I found Y and it shocked me’ device. There’s also one bit where he admits: “I’m going to be honest. Originally, I wanted to bring Milgram’s experiments crashing down”, which is not a good starting point for an unbiased examination. That said, his honesty, like much of the book, is refreshing. Four stars for being a great read, and for fighting back against the false idea that the cynics are always right."

I did enjoy the way he criticised these old totemic studies that have shaped our views to an alarming degree - I can only hope the studies supporting Bregman’s views received the same level of scrutiny... It is an easy, engaging read, especially the first two thirds. As is often the case with thinkers, the parts about how to actually implement their excellent ideas are the weakest link in the chain."

As should we all.
244,9082942186,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6044031-jayati-deshmukh,5,"This book is like a ray of hope in the current times of global pandemic, inter-community disruptions, natural disasters and more. All of us need to be reminded in the intrinsic goodness of the humankind, even though sometimes it might be hard to see. The core idea of this book is that humans in general are kind and trustworthy. And the author builds on this idea throughout the book across diverse aspects like education, business, government and more.The book has many interesting and well researched case studies like the real life version of the fictional story from Lord of the Flies. What might have happened on the Easter Island than the usually believed story of war, mass destruction and cannibalism. There is also an in-depth analysis on some of the expected questionable events / experiments like the Stanford Prison experiment, Milgram’s shock machine experiment and Catherine Susan Genovese’s murder in NYC. In all these cases, an alternate picture based on detailed research is presented which completely changes the point of view. The models of our day-to-day systems will be very different and enriching when they are built from a trustful point of view rather that the existing models which are usually distrustful by default. There are interesting examples where the application of these principles has brought remarkable change. Management, of example in a top down manner with strict way of doing things can be counter productive. There is an interesting example of Blok’s model of management where small teams are given full autonomy which has been very successful and created a win-win situation for the company as well as the employees. As the author say, “Because nothing is more powerful than people who do something because they want to do it.”Further, education is looked at from the opposite of current day industrial / factory model. Importance of play, where the children are left free to experiment and explore is highlighted. Agora model of education which give a lot of autonomy to kids to design their own learning paths is presented which builds much more well-rounded individuals. “You can’t teach creativity,’ writes psychologist Peter Gray, ‘all you can do is let it blossom.”Next example shows how cities and governments might look like when then are run autonomously using participatory models of governance. There is also an interesting discussion of the Elinor Ostrom’s model of the commons countering Hardin’s tragedy of the commons. Finally, the author gives examples where even in the most complex scenarios like handling prisoners, controlling police or even wars, it is possible to bring a positive change with models based on trust and compassion. Being kind in not easy. As it is mentioned towards the end of the book, “To believe people are hardwired to be kind isn’t sentimental or naive. On the contrary, it’s courageous and realistic to believe in peace and forgiveness.” Also this strategy won’t be successful in 100% scenarios, however as the author says, “ accept and account for the fact that you’ll occasionally be cheated. That’s a small price to pay for the luxury of a lifetime of trusting other people.”This book is powerful and can change the way we perceive the world.

For more information see this article by an actual Tongan: https://thespinoff.co.nz/atea/17-05-2...This author turning a very complex story and culture into Feel Good Clickbait White Savior story, makes me question the lens of the other stories in this book and who profits when white authors treat other people's stories (especially those of indigenous people) like a salad bar. Picking and choosing what they like to produce a book that likely is intended to only comfort those who already benefit a great deal from the pain suffering of others.

260,9082942186,http://goodreads.com/user/show/109172989-briana,5,"A book built on the premise that most people are inherently alright. It goes through the biological changes and advantages of being kind to one another, then debunks common misinterpretations of popular studies, like the Stanford Prison experiment, and finally gives a few examples of how we can utilise our natures to make the world a better place, citing the Norwegian vs American prison systems and alternative education systems. The chapter on NYPD's 'broken windows' philosophy is particularly pertinent today.It does gloss over 'the solution to racism!' happily by saying we'd all be better if we just mixed a bit more. It's clearly written by an author who has never had the pressure of representing their token minority or experienced aggression for being the odd one out.Easy to read and it makes you feel smart."

So much here that I already believed in my heart of hearts. So much that is easy to forget when faced with our media, the occasional sociopath in business, and the division among us. But with this book Bregman reminds me what I believe. "
263,9082942186,http://goodreads.com/user/show/67574581-david-franklin,4,"An entertaining book which succeeds in persuading us that we are kind at heart. Bregman is right to take on Lord of the Flies, and to challenge Hobbes’ contention that we are all savages in a state of nature. His exploration of empathy as a double-edged sword gives us a helpful framework with which to understand the polarisation we see today. The book is an easy read: Bregman is good at connecting with his audience, and his use of examples throughout is excellent. Where the book struggles is with the gap between ‘we are kind at heart’ and ‘we must design institutions that reflect our kindness’. Bregman may well be right that it is civilization’s fault that we end up with Machiavellian leaders. But we are here now, and civilization has more going for it than against it. He cites a few examples of participatory democracy and self-directed teams, but they are more of a curiosity than a convincing case for change. The reader is left slightly in the dark about how Bregman would go about redesigning institutions for the better.While the writing is persuasive, he over-uses the ‘I used to think X, but then I found Y and it shocked me’ device. There’s also one bit where he admits: “I’m going to be honest. Originally, I wanted to bring Milgram’s experiments crashing down”, which is not a good starting point for an unbiased examination. That said, his honesty, like much of the book, is refreshing. Four stars for being a great read, and for fighting back against the false idea that the cynics are always right."

And after reading this, I am not convinced the truth about human nature is quite as heart-warming as Bregman presents, but I think it’s an argument that needs to be made and fortunately, he is capable of *some* nuance. I did enjoy the way he criticised these old totemic studies that have shaped our views to an alarming degree - I can only hope the studies supporting Bregman’s views received the same level of scrutiny... It is an easy, engaging read, especially the first two thirds. As is often the case with thinkers, the parts about how to actually implement their excellent ideas are the weakest link in the chain."

As should we all.
274,9082942186,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6044031-jayati-deshmukh,5,"This book is like a ray of hope in the current times of global pandemic, inter-community disruptions, natural disasters and more. All of us need to be reminded in the intrinsic goodness of the humankind, even though sometimes it might be hard to see. The core idea of this book is that humans in general are kind and trustworthy. And the author builds on this idea throughout the book across diverse aspects like education, business, government and more.The book has many interesting and well researched case studies like the real life version of the fictional story from Lord of the Flies. What might have happened on the Easter Island than the usually believed story of war, mass destruction and cannibalism. There is also an in-depth analysis on some of the expected questionable events / experiments like the Stanford Prison experiment, Milgram’s shock machine experiment and Catherine Susan Genovese’s murder in NYC. In all these cases, an alternate picture based on detailed research is presented which completely changes the point of view. The models of our day-to-day systems will be very different and enriching when they are built from a trustful point of view rather that the existing models which are usually distrustful by default. There are interesting examples where the application of these principles has brought remarkable change. Management, of example in a top down manner with strict way of doing things can be counter productive. There is an interesting example of Blok’s model of management where small teams are given full autonomy which has been very successful and created a win-win situation for the company as well as the employees. As the author say, “Because nothing is more powerful than people who do something because they want to do it.”Further, education is looked at from the opposite of current day industrial / factory model. Importance of play, where the children are left free to experiment and explore is highlighted. Agora model of education which give a lot of autonomy to kids to design their own learning paths is presented which builds much more well-rounded individuals. “You can’t teach creativity,’ writes psychologist Peter Gray, ‘all you can do is let it blossom.”Next example shows how cities and governments might look like when then are run autonomously using participatory models of governance. There is also an interesting discussion of the Elinor Ostrom’s model of the commons countering Hardin’s tragedy of the commons. Finally, the author gives examples where even in the most complex scenarios like handling prisoners, controlling police or even wars, it is possible to bring a positive change with models based on trust and compassion. Being kind in not easy. As it is mentioned towards the end of the book, “To believe people are hardwired to be kind isn’t sentimental or naive. On the contrary, it’s courageous and realistic to believe in peace and forgiveness.” Also this strategy won’t be successful in 100% scenarios, however as the author says, “ accept and account for the fact that you’ll occasionally be cheated. That’s a small price to pay for the luxury of a lifetime of trusting other people.”This book is powerful and can change the way we perceive the world. It also presents numerous examples where a culture of trust, autonomy, goodness and compassion can build much better systems. This book restores hope in humankind and shows a way where we can be the change we want to see in the world, by being kind!"
275,9082942186,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6571378-luke,5,"This was a wonderful book!While reading I was doubting if I wanted to give it 4 or 5 stars. The reasons for giving it 4 stars being that a). Bregman writes in quite an informal way - sometimes bordering on slang - and b). makes very 'out there' statements which at times seem to be written just to shock., both of which I found to be slightly aggravating. However, I found that I got used to this as I progressed and that the content of the book outweighs these reasons by far. To me it was very surprising how Bregman manages to discuss themes, current affairs and human behaviour in a completely new and innovative way while being 'realistic' and using excellent resources (and let me tell you, if there is one thing that irks me greatly, it is a lack of- or untrustworthy resources). The value of the book in this regard is in my opnion both the way that Bregman dares to discuss them so fearlessly, thereby breaking old taboos and clearing space for new ideas, and the nuanced way he seems to do so (once you get used to the slightly jovial use of language, that is). I recognized many of the studies that Bregman debunks and was just afghast once I realized how religiously they are being teached at our schools and universities when learning about our Western history and society. Take Zimbardo's Standford Prison Experiment for example, or Miligrams shock experiment, both are studies that were very formative when learning about human behaviour during both my social and nursing education. Like I said, this book opened some doors for me and broke a lot of old thought patterns I ddn't realize I had. It made me feel inspired, uncomfortable and hopeful at the same time. I am very happy it will be released in the English language in may 2020... this way I can recommend it not only to my Dutch speaking friends, but to my English speaking ones as well ;)"
276,9082942186,http://goodreads.com/user/show/62488403-ben,5,"Why should cynicism be synonymous with realism? Bregman deconstructs our views on human nature, and the way these views underpin our sociopolitical institutions. With his defence of human decency, a tendency toward peace, and a sense of community, he builds hope. Despite occasionally feeling disorganized, this book should be required reading - especially for those who question whether people are fundamentally good."
277,9082942186,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1838124-bart-van-loon,4,"I really enjoyed this book - or collection of essays if you wish - by Bregman. I am very happy to have some of my misconceptions in social psychology set right (the shock-experiment, the Stanford prison experiment, the murder of Kitty Genovese, etc...). It was also refreshing to see somebody bluntly oppose great thinkers like Pinker and Gladwell and join the ""new realism""-ranks of Harari. I found this new history of mankind very compelling and interesting to read.However, I also agree with most of the criticism online: sometimes the author's writing betrays a pedantic desire to have an exclusive right to the truth, and from time to time he even reverts to fallacies he elsewhere condemns. I also found the very large font size, big margins and huge chapter headings in this edition and the sensationalist style overall somewhat negatively impact my taking his obviously hard work seriously.Still, he has me convinced that people indeed are inherently good and the subtitle ""a new history of mankind"" is not exaggerated for this book."
278,9082942186,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4877957-denise,3,"Bregman espouses the theory that people are fundamentally good and we should all act according to that assumption, thus making the world a far better place. It's a nice theory, optimistic, uplifting, bound to give you the warm and fuzzies. If you buy it. Which I don't. I went into this book with a healthy (though Bregman might disagree) dose of scepticism, and I came out with said scepticism firmly intact. That's not to say I think the book a load of nonsense - on the contrary, Bregman makes many good points and offers plenty of examples to back them up. It's certainly thoughtprovoking and makes one question one's assumptions. It's also, however, entirely too biased and black and white if you ask me. For every ""people are good at heart"" example he cites, one could find one supporting the opposite - but anything that doesn't fit Bregman's preconceived notions is disregarded. Call me cynical, but to me this oversimplified view is both unrealistic and naive."

The famous Tongan boys were co-operative and mutually self-supporting because they came from a congenial Tongan culture very different from the competitive and status-obsessed one of the boys in ""Lord of the Flies"". We are only as good as our culture and our leaders - and, crucially, our peers - allow us to be. Status, like Power, corrupts, and we are, largely, the slaves of power and the status it confers. Collaborators with tyranny (as Bregman must know) tend to vastly outnumber dissidents and resistants. There are exceptions (such as the Danes in World War Two) but they only prove the rule. "

Verdict: humans have a natural tendency for kindness. He questions why this answer is often met with scoffs and skepticism, and challenges the view that it is more realistic to view humanity as bad once you remove the veneer of civilization. To do so, he puts into questions popular psychological and sociological theories, common myths and beliefs, and often succeeds at completely undoing them. He collects a good number of studies, experiments and stories that provide evidence that it may in fact be more realistic to expect people to do good.

For more information see this article by an actual Tongan: https://thespinoff.co.nz/atea/17-05-2...This author turning a very complex story and culture into Feel Good Clickbait White Savior story, makes me question the lens of the other stories in this book and who profits when white authors treat other people's stories (especially those of indigenous people) like a salad bar. Picking and choosing what they like to produce a book that likely is intended to only comfort those who already benefit a great deal from the pain suffering of others. I'm not against optimism, I am against it when it involves exploitation and mythmaking at the expense of marginalized people."
290,9082942186,http://goodreads.com/user/show/109172989-briana,5,"A book built on the premise that most people are inherently alright. It goes through the biological changes and advantages of being kind to one another, then debunks common misinterpretations of popular studies, like the Stanford Prison experiment, and finally gives a few examples of how we can utilise our natures to make the world a better place, citing the Norwegian vs American prison systems and alternative education systems. The chapter on NYPD's 'broken windows' philosophy is particularly pertinent today.It does gloss over 'the solution to racism!' happily by saying we'd all be better if we just mixed a bit more. It's clearly written by an author who has never had the pressure of representing their token minority or experienced aggression for being the odd one out.Easy to read and it makes you feel smart."
291,9082942186,http://goodreads.com/user/show/55982773-rebecca,5,"This was actually phenomenal and I’m not sure that I have the words to convey just how much of a “must-read” this is!It discusses anthropology, the human condition and psychology. It looks at the true meaning of humankind & how the vast majority of humans are kind and good natured despite the cynical view that we can’t trust anyone.I absolutely devoured this book and highlighted so much (via kindle) and I would love a physical copy to reread! I feel like it’s something that everyone could read over and over again and take something new from it.It’s truly brilliant and opens us up to a hope for the future while also being honest about how society is and how it can seem like we’re all alone but we’re not!"
292,9082942186,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9170270-leah,5,"Just read this book. Maybe if we all read it, our hopefulness would be infectious and the world would stop seeming so out of whack. So much here that I already believed in my heart of hearts. So much that is easy to forget when faced with our media, the occasional sociopath in business, and the division among us. But with this book Bregman reminds me what I believe. "
293,9082942186,http://goodreads.com/user/show/67574581-david-franklin,4,"An entertaining book which succeeds in persuading us that we are kind at heart. Bregman is right to take on Lord of the Flies, and to challenge Hobbes’ contention that we are all savages in a state of nature. His exploration of empathy as a double-edged sword gives us a helpful framework with which to understand the polarisation we see today. The book is an easy read: Bregman is good at connecting with his audience, and his use of examples throughout is excellent. Where the book struggles is with the gap between ‘we are kind at heart’ and ‘we must design institutions that reflect our kindness’. Bregman may well be right that it is civilization’s fault that we end up with Machiavellian leaders. But we are here now, and civilization has more going for it than against it. He cites a few examples of participatory democracy and self-directed teams, but they are more of a curiosity than a convincing case for change. The reader is left slightly in the dark about how Bregman would go about redesigning institutions for the better.While the writing is persuasive, he over-uses the ‘I used to think X, but then I found Y and it shocked me’ device. There’s also one bit where he admits: “I’m going to be honest. Originally, I wanted to bring Milgram’s experiments crashing down”, which is not a good starting point for an unbiased examination. That said, his honesty, like much of the book, is refreshing. Four stars for being a great read, and for fighting back against the false idea that the cynics are always right."
294,9082942186,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2559314-foppe,0,"My review of Rutger Bregman's recent publication HumanKind: interesting book, but his argument has a dangerously limited scope, which undermines his case. If you want to know why I think so, please see the linked article.-> https://weeklyworker.co.uk/worker/130...Hope folks find it helpful."
295,9082942186,http://goodreads.com/user/show/13942646-louise,5,"Wow! I loved this book. I learnt so much and my life will be richer from having experienced the joy that Rutger's words have allowed, to view the world from a new and fresh perspective. Thank you Rutger."
296,9082942186,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2497806-melanie-harries,5,"If you have any worries about the current state of humanity (and how can you not right now all things considered) I highly, highly, highly recommend this book"
297,9082942186,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8093511-patricia,5,The author attempts a clear eyed view at how human nature has developed. He illustrates his points about good and evil with stories and evidence. In the end he finds reason for hope. With great readability (and large type) the 400 pages go by quickly. Highly recommended.
298,9082942186,http://goodreads.com/user/show/67500159-john-dean,5,"This is one of those books that I could feel remolding my world view as I progressed with it. I feel like even though I am a fairly optimistic person, the constant exposure to negative news had been really getting to me. To say this book pulled me out of a depression may be a little bit of an overstatement but it sure as hell helped. I want to give this book to every single person I've ever met"
299,9082942186,http://goodreads.com/user/show/36413961-kuan,5,"Great optimistic book, shed new lights on many widely accepted historical events, such as in the social psychology on why people behave bad, such as the Stanford Prison Experiment, on what happened that night Kitty got stabbed in NY where the whole neighborhood was supposedly watching.Good to hear the other side."
