0,0747581908,http://goodreads.com/user/show/766968-tami,5,"A copy of An Ocean of Air should be on every library bookshelf in the world. I found this text both immensely informative and extremely interesting. Quite a number of times, I jumped up, put the book down, and went to find someone to tell about an remarkable fact or a story about a particular scientist that I thought was amusing. The book is set up in chronological order, exploring the various issues surrounding air. It starts off with the presumptions about air that our ancestors had about the substance. Then, it begins looking at the various individuals who were courageous, curious, and sometimes just plain mad enough to ask questions and seek answers. The stories progress throughout touching on a variety of associated topics from chemical composition of air and the ozone layer to carbonation and space flight. Apart from the historical and scientific usefulness of this book, I also want to note the humanizing aspect of the various scientists. Often when we picture scientists, we assume that they sit in their laboratory using their great intellect to uncover scientific discoveries. We don't often think about the sacrifices of these individuals or that often such discoveries have not always been popular. Moreover, often the most interesting successful experiences were those that went horribly wrong. "

A fascinating read for those who are interested in the history of science. Like the title suggests, the book gives an ordered insight into how the scientific world got itself acquainted with air and its many mysteries. I read this like a thriller, where a group of detectives were solving different yet connected parts of one giant case. While reading this book I realised that Science is itself an art and the talent of a scientist is not so different from that of an artist, imagination is just as important as knowing a bunch of facts. Gabrielle Walker gives an interesting insight into the lives and minds of those scientists whose rich and unique intuition shaped up the science as we know it. Being a student of meteorology it was interesting to know about the scientists and their process in discovering many of the science we all take for granted. I was also surprised to find out how the different scientists were connected and knew each other. It strangely made them seem real, rather than being these obscure names in my textbooks. Even for someone without a scientific or meteorological background, it will feel just the same. After all, the book talks about something that is all around us, something we all interact with and change on a daily basis, something which gives us life.The book gives a simple introduction to global warming and climate change as well, as any book on the atmospheric air inevitably will. But in a clear, jargon-less manner, which makes us feel included, rather than being an unaffected observer. Although a thrilling read, I found that the incidents concentrated around America and Europe, and it made me wonder what was happening at the scientific front over the rest of the world."
2,0747581908,http://goodreads.com/user/show/38599237-zoe-brittain,5,I wish we were exposed to this kind of narrative when learning undergraduate chem and physics. As I was reading I could feel all of that knowledge finally clicking into place. One of the best science narratives I have ever read. 
3,0747581908,http://goodreads.com/user/show/46092811-jennifer,5,"I love non-fiction books that give a new perspective on the things that surround us and that we often don’t think much of at all. In this case, I don’t think I will ever see air the same way again. In fact, if it had been up to me I would have titled it “The Sky Above Us” because it had a similar impact on how I saw the atmosphere as “The Sea Around Us” had on how I saw the ocean. The book compares our atmosphere to an ocean, and based on scale alone (which I had never really thought of) the comparison is apt – Earth’s atmosphere weighs 3,750,000,000,000,000 tons. And like the oceans, its activity is an immense driver of climate patterns and the life they support; for one thing, the wind patterns in the troposphere are the reason the world’s major deserts are located 30 degrees north and thirty degrees south of the equator (examples include Sahara and the Gobi Deserts in the northern hemisphere and the Atacama and the Australian outback in the southern hemisphere), even though the equator is hotter. And yet, “we give our own overlying air-ocean so little respect that we even describe anything that’s full of air as being “empty.” (page 5).And then there is the difference between looking up at the sky versus looking down at the sky. Almost everyone has looked up, and seen the vast expanse of blue, looking surprisingly solid and perhaps populated with some fluffy or wispy clouds. But only a few people have journeyed to the edge of space, and have seen something radically different:“Where Earth’s surface curved away from the horizon, a glowing blue halo stood out against the blackness of space. This glow was the atmosphere, the single greatest gift our planet possesses…That thin blue line has transformed our planet from a barren lump of rock into a world full of life. And it is the only shield that stands between vulnerable earthlings and the deadly environment of space.” Astronauts have often described it as one of the things that makes Earth look not only incredibly beautiful but also incredibly fragile.This book is worth it for the prologue alone, which describes how Joe Kittinger used a helium-filled balloon to ascend over twenty miles above Earth, and then jumped (in appropriate survival gear). He was the first to do it; two similar jumps by others followed, the most recent in 2012. The prologue vividly described his descent through the various layers of the atmosphere that he fell through, explained some of the activity further above him (he did not ascend very far into the ionosphere because it is crackling with electrical activity), and effectively set the stage for the rest of the book. One passage I particularly enjoyed was: “Kittinger was tumbling through another of our world's vital protective shields – the ozone layer. Ozone is miraculous stuff…High aloft it is both vigilant and resilient. Any invisible UV rays that had slipped through the ionosphere were being soaked up by a diffuse cloud of invisible gas. Split asunder by ultraviolet rays, the ozone molecules around Kittinger were calmly reforming. Like the burning bush encountered by Moses, they are constantly ablaze but never consumed.”A subsequent chapter elaborated on the ozone layer and what it does for us, and I gained a new appreciation for it: “Our ozone layer protects us so comfortably and effectively that we could easily never know the dangers that lie just a few miles above us. It works like a minefield: Whenever an ozone molecule is touched by an ultraviolet ray, it explodes, firing off one of its three oxygen atoms. But this is a minefield that reforms itself constantly. The shrapnel from the explosion – a stray oxygen atom and an ordinary oxygen molecule – recombine. And when they do the ozone is born again.” (page 131).Also, this may be the first time I have heard ozone described as “beautiful” (it is a striking shade of blue). I will add that I was in grade school when the hole in the ozone layer exploded into the national conscience and CFCs became a household term. Needless to say, a great deal went over my head at the time, so it was good to have this description to fill in the gaps. A discussion of how CFCs came to be was very interesting – they were originally developed by a company conscientiously attempting to improve the safety of the refrigerators it produced in an age before government prodding. Because the book was published in 2007, I will add that a 2016 study published in Nature showed that the 1993 global ban on CFCs has been effective and the hole in the ozone layer has gradually begun to shrink and the layer itself is already slightly thicker.Humans are not the only ones to have dramatically affected the composition of the atmosphere – plants have had – and continue to have – a huge impact when it comes to carbon dioxide: “The scale of this activity [plant-based photosynthesis] is staggering. Every year, green plants convert carbon dioxide into 100,000 million tons of plant material. To do this, plants use up 300 trillion calories of energy from the sun, which is thirty times the energy consumption of all the machines on Earth.” (page 68). The prologue also helped provide a new perspective on plant life. Kittinger landed in the desert of New Mexico, surrounded by yuccas and sagebrush. But where other people saw a dry desert and small, scrubby, and generally unattractive plants, he saw an almost impossibly lush landscape, explaining that, “fifteen minutes before I’d been on the edge of space, and now, to me, I was in the Garden of Eden.”The book also touched on Earth’s magnetic field, which helps protect our atmosphere from the sun. Although it was not presented this way in the book, I found it helpful to think of the sun as a giant continuously detonating thermonuclear bomb throwing out just about every form of radiation on the spectrum. This radiation includes the solar wind, a stream of high-energy charged particles travelling over a million miles per hour. Earth’s intrinsic magnetic field extends over ten thousand miles into space and forces the solar wind and other blasts of electromagnetic radiation to part around it. Anything that does manage to get past the magnetic field still has the exosphere, ionosphere, and ozone layer to contend with. The result?“I can scarcely believe that air too thin for me to breathe is yet strong enough to fend off everything that space can throw at us. Yet it is. In October 2003, a series of explosions rocked the outer surface of the sun. A massive flare flash-fried Earth with X-rays equivalent to five thousand suns. A slingshot of plasma barreled toward us at two million miles an hour. The radioactivity it contained was the equivalent…of taking every nuclear warhead that has ever been made – not exploded, mark you, but made – and detonating them all at once.And yet nobody on Earth felt a thing…The most massive solar flare since records began and one of the biggest radioactive maelstroms in history together met a far more formidable foe. They each arrived, and then, one by one they simply bounced off…thin air.” (page 235).Highly recommended."
4,0747581908,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5466619-naftoli,4,"I read this book as the current selection for the Monterey County Science Book Club, our meeting/discussion date will be held at the beginning of August.I found this book, by Gabrielle Walker, to be quite a gem. I am not trained in the sciences so a book involving chemistry (I've never taken a chemistry course) is a bit intimidating. Yet Ms. Walker does not spend much time on the chemical reactions found in the atmosphere - she indeed goes over the concepts and presents them to the reader - but, instead, focuses more on the inventors who sought or stumbled upon various truths about the compostion and purpose of Earth's atmosphere.In a sense, I found it to be a serial biography of interesting, intense, and odd personages whose lives and legacies had one thing in common: the atmosphere. Ms. Walker is certainly a witty writer. Every chapter included drole even hilarious excerpts from the scientist's life. Just when the discussion about the atmosphere became a bit scientific, she colored the story with an anecdote. One example is the discoverer who happened across the curvature of the Earth ... he operated a single engine plain and eloped with his soon-to-be bride. In attempting to woo her with his piloting skills, he landed on her farm and wisked her away as her parents ran after the plane, her father shouting and shaking his fist only to have the engine quit thus forcing him to make an emergency landing a few farm fields within eyeshot of her folks.Without a doubt this is a good popular science book or even a good book to induct interested readers who are fascinated by science but still lack much of the course work; after all, it held my attention and I majored in cultural anthropology! I also enjoy people with a sense of humor and this writer knows how to enliven an otherwise dry topic. I give this book 4 stars."
5,0747581908,http://goodreads.com/user/show/26976114-shanti,3,"I got this book from the library, because everyone needs a bit of non-fiction once in a while (Or at least I felt that I did) It promised to be 'A Natural History of the Atmosphere'. It wasn't. Each individual chapter is fascinating, with all sorts of interesting sidenotes, and vivid people who leap to staggering yet true conclusions. Yet it is not a natural history of the atmosphere. It is a human history of the atmosphere, of the (white men) who discovered the conditions that make earth safe for us. The atmosphere is the background, and the people are the foreground. Of course, I acknowledge that writing about the atmosphere without people would be dull. But what of spiritual ideas about the atmosphere, how science changed our relationship to the atmosphere, how climate change continues to change it? That didn't come up. So I finished this story with an incomplete, incoherent view of the atmosphere, one where people have discovered interesting facts about how it works, but apart from the chapter openers, I didn't see the whole of it. However, it gets points for being interesting, and Gabrielle Walker for being a female scientist.Interesting sidenote 1: My mother kept calling it the 'ocean book' which is very wrong.Interesting sidenote 2: We were next to the ocean and it rained and this book got totally wet and I had to buy another copy. Not much air in that, it may have drowned. "
6,0747581908,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5881435-niall519,5,"This was superb. Some of the best science communication I've encountered in years: amusingly told, cohesive, and comprehensively referenced.My only gripes were that it was not near long enough to go into further detail about atmospheric chemistry and physics, and the occasional jumping around in time to focus on another part of a developing story took some mild effort to note or retain. I would have loved to read more about the development of understanding of global climate mechanisms, and the interactions between sea, mountains, and atmosphere. I'm guessing that the author felt this was outside her area of focus with this book though.The apparently common issue with the relative lack of diagrams or pictures didn't bother me in the slightest. With some careful reading, each of the experiments and their apparatus were clearly set out in words, and lovingly described in terms of the thought processes leading up to them, and the implications that flowed on from them.I'm off to find everything else that Gabrielle Walker has written now."
7,0747581908,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3189888-bob,5,"Air. So who ever thinks about it -- since air is everywhere, all the time? I never gave it much attention, until I discovered this book in the library.Turns out that some really brilliant people have investigated air, starting with Galileo, and they have done some genius work to figure out what it is. Investigators include Antoine Lavoisier, Joseph Priestly, James Van Allen, and Robert Boyle, just to name a few. They were collectively very ingenious with their experimental projects, failing countless times before finally getting a trustable answer. Something that especially jumped out at me was the question, how much does air weigh? Nothing? 10 lbs? 200 lbs??? Answer: Air weighs a lot. A whole LOT. Take a basketball court, which measures 50 ft by 94 feet. At 14.7 psi, that translates to a weight of air at 9.9 million lbs. Pushing down on the basketball court. Incredible."
8,0747581908,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3049736-marsha,5,"This book was outstanding...a great source of real alouds for my science kids. The author had an amazing way of turning these long dead scientists into real people, simplifying the extraordinary science they discovered, and tying all the advances into relevance in today's world. I also really liked how the book makes you see the changing nature of what we know (scientifically speaking, of course)....and that science is not static."
9,0747581908,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3801857-titus-l,5,"An absolute eyeopener in terms of the scientific discoveries about our upper Ocean of Air that the author recounts as well as a delight in the many examples given such as this of an Aurora;''This is from a boat trip at Talvik in Finnmark as late as 1881;Immediately after nightfall the northern lights began to flame merrily in the sky. They gathered like ahuge fire in the deep-blue vault of the heaven, and great pencils of rays, mauve, blue and green, united and danced in flaming witches' knots above the boat. We had just about reached the middle of the Korsfjord when I suddenly noticed an aurora above Alta that had knotted itself right down on the surface of the water and was rushing across the fjord at high speed....''It will overturn the boat'' shouted Jakob from the thwarts. And in the darkness I could see the men bend their backs and heave on the oars so that the phosphoresence shone about the blades....I shut my eyes for an instant. When I looked around a moment later with the light penetrating my eyelids, I found we were in the midst of such a fantastic sea of light as I shall never forget. Flames of wonderful transparent color surrounded us, violet, blue and green, but without the slightest breath of wind... That rare but lovely play of light passed us by in a few seconds. A moment later it was gone. ""Id recommend this book to any who are interested in our world and am happy to report that whilst it touches on the technical it in no way repels the non specialist but is on the contrary an acessible wealth of insight into our air."
10,0747581908,http://goodreads.com/user/show/43207450-karthik-vijayakumar,4,"The book talks about how our understanding of the atmosphere evolved over time. That is all the way from the old thinking that air is an element to modern understandings of layers of the atmosphere, weather patterns etc. The book walks through this evolution by going over events in chronological order.There were multiple occasions when I wanted to put the book down, catch a friend and tell them about this amazing story of how something was discovered."
11,0747581908,http://goodreads.com/user/show/81941983-zach-galvin,5,"Great book! I sometimes found the explanations of different phenomenon difficult to understand, but that is ok because this isn't meant to be a textbook. My favorite part of the book was that it went through a brief life story of each scientist which made you feel like you were discovering how the atmosphere worked with them! "
12,0747581908,http://goodreads.com/user/show/24128895-jose-zapata,4,"An amazing view on what makes us live, our protection barrier against the dangerous and hostile outer space, the atmosphere, Walker carefully threads the stories of exploration of the layers, composition, behavior, responses, interactions, reactions of the sea above us."
13,0747581908,http://goodreads.com/user/show/61966496-justin-haley,2,Somewhat missed the mark. Loved the concept but the author focused too much on climate change preaching and not enough on atmospheric effects. Wouldn't recommend to others.

18,0747581908,http://goodreads.com/user/show/17492778-james,5,Fascinating and surprisingly entertaining. It reads like a novel. Highly recommended for anyone with even the slightest curiousity in the subject.
19,0747581908,http://goodreads.com/user/show/595788-alex-telander,4,"AN OCEAN OF AIR: WHY THE WIND BLOWS AND OTHER MYSTERIES OF THE ATMOSPHERE BY GABRIELLE WALKER: Each and every day the people of the world go about their daily activities: going to school, going to work, going to help someone; all with little idea of the great ocean of air above them that has trillions of molecules constantly performing crucial reactions – much like the population below – with the aim of keeping this planet (and its people) healthy and alive. An Ocean of Air by Gabrielle Walker is an excellent 235 page book that teaches you everything you could ever want to know about our atmosphere, its many layers, and the very air we are constantly breathing. Part science book, part history book; An Ocean of Air provides a whole semester’s worth of knowledge and learning in just a single volume.Walker is an award-winning scientist with a Ph.D. in Chemistry from Cambridge University. As well as having served as climate-change editor for Nature and features editor for New Scientist, she is a visiting professor at Princeton University and has presented many programs for BBC Radio. In An Ocean of Air, she breaks down the atmosphere into its components, explaining each in detail and in clear layman’s language, making it easy to understand for any reader. Along with the science, she also goes into the history of when this air molecule or atmospheric layer was discovered, how and by whom. Apart from learning the makeup of our atmosphere, the reader is also learning of great scientists and inventors of the past who were able to discover so much about something that is essentially invisible.The book is split into two parts. The first part, “Comfort Blanket,” explains what the air we breath consists of; the fascinating evolution of oxygen and why we cannot live without it, but at the same time it leads to our inevitable deaths; and how wind is formed and develops into the fierce and destructive hurricanes and tornadoes around the world. The second part, “Sheltering Sky,” is where Walker explains the various levels of our atmosphere, their history and discovery, from stratosphere to ionosphere – which is constantly being bombarded with radiation from the sun, but causes a reaction that protects the complex life below. It is here that Walker launches into the crux of the book, explaining the history of global warming from the invention of CFCs and the depletion of the ozone layer, to our present which is just beginning to look towards and understand the possibility of a doomed future.Just as anyone can be amazed at the complexity of the human body and how it keeps living and moving with the millions of different processes and reactions taking place constantly, our atmosphere is seemingly just as complex and in some ways fragile. Walker keenly points out that while carbon dioxide levels have spiked in Earth’s history, they are now at a level never recorded before, and continuously increasing. Her intent is to inform and educate readers on what is happening to the atmosphere, and therefore the world, and with a further reading section, one can learn how to do their little bit to help this ailing planet.For more book reviews, and author interviews, go to BookBanter."
20,0747581908,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2206775-maurynne-maxwell,4,"An Ocean of Air opens with Joe Kittinger, an Air Force test pilot, in 1960, about to jump from a gondola hanging 20 miles in the air above New Mexico, at the edge of space, wondering if he's about to die. As he falls through the layers of atmosphere (landing safely), he is tracing the journey we'll follow to discover the wonders of wind and breath and the thinnest radiation shield ever--the layers of gases that surround our planet and make our lives possible. How much does air weigh? Galileo almost got in trouble again for wondering. He discovered that it must have weight, but ""how much"" it weighs--that was for others to find out. (If you are in Carnegie Hall, the air around you weighs 70 thousand pounds.) Like a good science teacher, Ms. Walker asks questions and draws us in to the discovery of the answers through epic storytelling. Galileo, Columbus, Marconi and Van Allen (of the belts) get their stories told, but so do Will Ferrel, Oliver Heaviside, Wiley Post, and others, in all their quirky glory. Who knew that Columbus, alchemy, Pascal, wars, the space race, the sinking of the Titanic, and climate change could be bundled so compellingly together? Or how truly lucky we are to have an ozone layer? Even reluctant nonfiction readers are seduced by Walker's stories--and it reads fast, since the last full quarter of the book is notes and index. Fascinating. For the curious: Felix Baumgartner's death-defying leap from space in 2012 was the first to break Kittinger's 1960 record, and Kittinger was one of his advisors. "
21,0747581908,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7358-jen,3,"Somewhat like Bill Bryson's ""Short History of the Universe"" (not sure if I got the title exact), this book about the atmosphere focuses on the key scientists, their quirks, and how they made their discoveries. It's a topic not often covered, and there are some truly elegant experiments explained - for instance, how could you show that burning an object actually releases a gas, or prove the existence of different types of gases at a time when ""air"" was considered a basic, uniform element? But I don't think I have ever been so disappointed to not see diagrams in a book. It wasn't always easy to wrap my mind around the experiments and concepts, and that would have been a great addition. Similarly, a lot of these parallelled really well the concepts that my 8th grade physics students work on - pressure, magnetism - but I just felt like the author's style of writing made the book beyond the reach of even my advanced kids. We'll see, though! "
22,0747581908,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1008236-bookmarks-magazine,0,"Although Gabrielle Walker, author of Snowball Earth (2003), holds a Cambridge doctorate in chemistry, her ear for storytelling is perfect for popular science. One critic praises her lyrical style; others praise her use of detail, anecdote, and science that wouldn't be out of place in Meteorology 101. Critics inevitably compare Walker to Dava Sobel (Longitude; Galileo's Daughter; The Planets, *** Jan/Feb 2006), one of the genre's most popular writers. Walker has honed her skills as a contributing editor of Scientific American, and her breezy tone fits her subject perfectly. Even though her choice to start from square one may frustrate readers with some previous knowledge in the area, Walker has penned an engaging, readable book-nothing too heavy, and worth the reader's every breath.This is an excerpt from a review published in Bookmarks magazine."
23,0747581908,http://goodreads.com/user/show/12499-cass,5,"WOW! I can't believe I checked this book out three times before finishing it (or moving past the introduction. But I guess I was so in awe I knew I wanted to devote to it the time it deserved). I think that everyone studying Earth, Climate, environment, or education should have this as a required read. It was a page turner, full of educational information the whole way. By telling the story of the sky through the people that invented it, I was much more inspired than typical fact-delivery books. The biggest that I took away from this was the importance of System Thinking. Almost every ""natural philosopher"" to physicist that Walker wrote about became famous because they applied their creative ideas with someone else's work. I'd read it again. Especially out load to a group of kiddos. Hey, I might do that. :)"
24,0747581908,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6297140-lili,3,"This really was a book I should have loved, and I admit, at first I did. The atmosphere is a wonderful thing, and reading about its discovery and how various scientist found out how the various parts and elements functioned was quite enjoyable. However I found the rather romantic sounding descriptions of the various scientist tedious after about the second one. I really could care less about their luscious locks or pretty eyes, I was reading this book to learn more about the atmosphere, not about people. I admit, this is my personal bias, the author's writing style is enjoyable enough and it is well written, just a bit disappointing. Now if I could have the abridged version without the life stories, personality quirks, and physical appearances of the different scientists, well then I would be very happy. "
25,0747581908,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4131417-kirsten,5,"This book is awesome. The author has the rare (especially for a scientist), but welcome gift of taking complex topics and making them not only understandable but interesting. The book covers several major themes of atmospheric science, including the history of discoveries. She also talks about wind, ozone, environmental damage, etc. A great read for anyone interested in an introductory overview of the atmosphere, how it works, and what effect that has on humans.A very quick read with lots of polka dots scattered throughout, which I admit, I enjoyed. Not exactly a heavy duty reference book, but a great starting point."
26,0747581908,http://goodreads.com/user/show/573268-etta-mo,3,"even for a pop-science book, this was a little too light on the facts and too heavy on the hyperbole. the first section of the book was nothing anyone who has taken basic chemistry and watched ""an inconvenient truth"" wouldn't already know. the last two-thirds were on more interesting topics (trade winds, the upper atmosphere, respectively) but Walker spent more time describing the personalities of the players than delving into the science they were doing. all in all, this book seems geared towards people with very little, if any, scientific background. "
27,0747581908,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2505253-leefrances,5,This wasn't quite what I thought it would be but I loved it. It read as fast as a novel and felt like one too. She includes mini-biographies of all the people whose discoveries led to what we now know about air and the atmosphere. She adds in interesting little tidbits about their clothing or how crazy they were. All of the science is described in terms that even I could understand without it feeling dumbed down at all. I really loved this and wish that most nonfiction were written in this style.
28,0747581908,http://goodreads.com/user/show/71276-jess,5,I wish I could go back in time and tell my past self to pay more attention in science. This book walks you through humanities concepts and experiments concerning air. It also goes on tell you exactly how the experiments worked and what happens in the interaction between 'air' and matter. Turns out Galileo was the one who figured out how much it weighed. I keep running into all of these familiar names like like Lavoisier (named oxygen and proved that air was made up of different gases) and Boyle (as in 'law' and invented seltzer water) and I'm only in chapter 2. Love it.
29,0747581908,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3133678-fate-s-lady,4,"I found this book really interesting and accessible, and it brought so many questions I've had about the atmosphere down to my level, answering countless childhood questions and enlivening the education with tidbits about the lives, quirks, and habits of some of the greatest scientists and thinkers to influence the study of the atmosphere. A great story. I would warn, however, that while this was a ton of fun, a full third of the Kindle book is actually reference material, making this a much shorter read than I was anticipating. "
30,0747581908,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2333132-lncropper,5,"Usually books on science are way over my head, but I loved this one. It is actually written so we non-scientific types can understand it. I am going to have to read it again to remember everything, but I learned a ton of things I didn't know, such as:What, exactly, is ozone?How did Marconi figure out that his signals would travel long distances, and what did he not know?Who learned (and how) what carbon dioxide does?I could add many more. If you want to feel a little smarter, this is the book to read!"
31,0747581908,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6057218-andrew-hoffman,4,"Fascinating book written at a popular level on the science of air. Not only do we learn about all the unknown and fascinating attributes of air (how much does the air in an empty Carnegie Hall weigh? Answer: 70,000lbs!), Walker also tells stories of the remarkable people who brilliantly and sometimes daringly discovered these attributes.

Thought provoking; ranges in topics from the chemical makeup of air, hurricanes, ozone layer, trade winds, jet streams, the northern lights. If you can stomach history and science -together- an interesting read."
209,0747581908,http://goodreads.com/user/show/798841-richard,3,An easy-to-read book about atmospheric science and the scientist who discovered air.
