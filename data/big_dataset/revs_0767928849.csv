I had the same thought when I first picked it up; hours later, after reading the book in a single sitting, I realized that good writers can make any story interesting, fascinating, engaging and a lot of fun. Susan Casey is a wonderful writer and the subject only grows more interesting the further you read. While I'm the first to admit that I enjoy a good novel, I also enjoy non-fiction titles, and this one is a 'Don't Miss.'"
1,0767928849,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1526851-will-byrnes,4,"Size matters to Toronto-born Susan Casey, wave size that is. She is interested in the big kahunas of wave-dom, rogues, freaks, giants or monsters that rise a hundred feet or more above the surrounding water. Think The Perfect Storm. Then think bigger. Scientists once dismissed the notion of waves that big, but science has started to turn what were believed to be tall tales into accepted truth. In 1933 a serene officer on the USS Ramapo measured one such rogue at 112 feet! Even the enormous (see, I didn’t say titanic) cargo carriers of today are no match for such fury. Current models of oceanic wave generation have not been up to the task of predicting when and where these big guys might emerge. Given how much material is transported across the ocean there is considerable interest in improving our wave prediction capabilities. Add to that the impact of global warming, which is expected to increase the volatility of the seas, and the need to understand the mechanics of the briny deep becomes critical. Casey alternates between looking at the science and history of waves and the surfer royalty who travel the world in search of the biggest, scariest monster waves to ride. She talks with the people who know huge waves best, in both scientific and surfing communities.It must have been really tough for Casey to hang out with all those gorgeous, energetic, fit, scantily clothed men, but she made that sacrifice and offers a close up view of the high-end surfer culture. In particular she focuses on Laird Hamilton, the Michael Jordan, Tiger Woods and Babe Ruth of the sport, trailing after him and his cohorts as they seek out that perfect ride, succeeding, failing, wiping out and telling tales of how they got all those nifty scars. Of course, one might wonder how an outsider, even one with a publishing resume like Casey’s, which includes The Devil’s Teeth, a best seller about great white sharks, could gain such intimate access to the surfers’ world. Cash helps. Hamilton was paid to ease Casey’s way into this [primarily] boys’ club. So while Hamilton no doubt deserves all the accolades that come his way for his professional achievements, one must always wonder what might have been left out. [see http://www.quillandquire.com/blog/ind...] Nevertheless, Casey joins Hamilton and many other top names in surfing as they drop in at the major surf meccas of Hawaii, surf in Tahiti, California and Mexico and even catch some monster waves a hundred miles out at sea. Going rogue for real. It makes for gripping reading.The scientific chapters are less personal but more informative. Casey relates some chilling history of tsunamis, both the regular and mega varieties, including one puppy that topped out at 1,740 feet in Lituya Bay in Alaska in 1958. The results on the ground were impressive. That two people in a boat survived this may be more impressive. She visits Lloyds of London to find out just how big an issue losses at or because of the sea might be. She hears from crew members about a voyage on the oceanic research ship Discovery, an outing that included getting battered by multiple hundred-footers coming at the ship from many directions, and she reports on a conference where the biggest brains in the wave business gather to discuss their work. There is surprising information here on how some waves act more like light than matter. And there is a nifty bit of info on just how Britain came to be an island.Casey offers a less than lovely look at the future through the eyes of Bill McGuire, a world expert on global geophysical events, or as he likes to call them, “Gee-Gees.” He has acquired nicknames like Disasterman and the Prophet of Doom. In the disaster movie of your choice, McGuire is the guy who would be dragged away from his child’s graduation to advise the president, or the PM, as this Englishman works in London. By offering such different perspectives, Casey has succeeded in teaching us a lot about an important subject while at the same time providing an exciting, entertaining read.Dude, this is one wave you really want to catch.

Being somewhat of a specialist in this area (a physical oceanographer), it is great to see my field popularized in this way. Unfortunately the author chose to present the science behind waves in a very shallow way. Instead she chose to spend the book talking about a group of big-wave surfers. There are guys with egos as large as the waves they surf, and lots of money too. How they get the funds to jet off to Tahiti or South Africa at the drop of a hat is not explained. I suppose they get enough from sponsorships to do this - they must get a *lot* as they do a lot of traveling. One of the main guys, Laird Hamilton, said he has jet skis tucked away in Tahiti in case he needs them. Who can afford to have spare jet skis on hand in Tahiti?The science of ocean waves is so interesting. The author could have discussed the difference between shallow water and deep water waves, or what refraction is and how it works (she mentions the term but does not explain it), or some discussion of *why* the wave field is forecast to become more energetic as the Earth warms or how the propagation of tsunamis is so different from regular waves.One wonders if this lack of depth is a result of the author's limited understanding of it herself, or an attempt to draw readers into the world of big-wave surfers, or a need to dumb the science down for a general audience. Some dumbing down is always necessary of course in a popular book. This one just seemed dumbed down way too much.Nevertheless, looked at as entertainment, the book was pretty good. She is a good writer and knows how to tell a compelling story. I just wish she had used that talent more wisely."
3,0767928849,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1711431-eric-w,4,"edited 3/12/11 to add references and some linksWe are surrounded by waves: electromagnetic, light, radio, and water. They can be helpful providing power, light and communication; but they can also carry unimaginable force. The science of waves and surf forecasting is relatively new. It began in earnest during WW II when scientists realized that successful amphibious landings required some ability to forecast surf sizes on the beaches. It didn’t hurt that there was oodles of money available and scientists, no different than anyone else, like nothing better than to specialize in something that has practical applications for war.Reports of huge, 100-foot waves have traditionally been dismissed as typical seafaring exaggeration. Shackleton reported having his ship tossed about by the largest wave he had ever seen and one that towered over his ship. Large, seemingly unsinkable ships have disappeared without a trace. One ship that did, the Munchen, left a lifeboat that had been torn from its davits and which normally was suspended 65 feet off the deck. And yet, the physics of waves didn’t predict the possibility of such waves except in extraordinarily rare circumstances, so rare, as to be literally incredible.Technically a “rogue wave inn oceanography, is more precicely defined as waves whose height is more than twice the significant wave height (SWH), which is itself defined as the mean of the largest third of waves in a wave record.”A scientific discovery ship aptly named the Discovery was tossed around like match wood in a storm on the way to Iceland. Fortunately the captain was able to save the 200 foot vessel which was layered with scientific instruments which recorded periodic waves of 100 feet among normal sets measuring 45 feet.Jan 1, 1995 something happened that made scientists reconsider. On a platform in the North Sea. Seas were high, running around 38 feet as measured by instruments on the platforms underside until an 85 foot wave hit the rig at 45 mph coming out of nowhere. The first confirmed measurement of a freak wave, more than twice the size of its neighbors. The engineers who designed the rig had built it for the one-in-10,000 year 64 foot wave. 85 foot waves were not part of the equation. The emphasis soon shifted from whether these waves existed to how and why they occurred. An oil rig, the Ocean Ranger, went down off Newfoundland that had been designed to withstand 110 foot seas. There were no survivors. (Things were a little more complicated than just the wave according to this entry: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ocean_Ra...) Casey’s version is sensationalized and you have to take some of her descriptions with a dose of salt.Interesting facts: two large ships sink every week, but the causes are usually just attributed to bad weather. Unlike when an aircraft goes down, rarely is there an investigation that’s more than cursory. Casey alternates between science and the more prosaic, like surfing. (Her adulation for Laird Hamilton carries a sexual tension that should have had Laird’s wife, herself a striking former beach-volleyball pro, (http://gabriellereece619.typepad.com/...) more than a little concerned. Their swim out to “Jaws” and back and then getting hosed off bordered on prurient.) Some of her similes border on the silly, likening a personal characteristic to being “as wide as interstate 10,” whatever the hell than means. We follow Laird around the world seeking the ever more thrilling ride, as Laird laments the ever-larger crowds, crutches like Surfline that forecasts huge swells with precision, and sponsors and contests. (It should be noted that Hamilton gets lots of endorsements so he can afford to be dismissive of those seeking greater glory.) There’s also little examination of the effect and controversy of tow-in surfing, really the only way to get to the right spot for gigantic waves. Hamilton’s long-time tow-in partner Derrick Doerner even though, as I understand it, he was a champion paddle-in surfer (true surfing??) many years before his connection to Hamilton. Perhaps he was less Adonis-like than Hamilton.The answer to the formation of these freak/rogue waves was found in quantum physics and Schrödinger’s equation (for you math types: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schr%C3%...) which describes deep water waves (they have found some waves 600 feet high rumbling around below the surface) and surface waves that become unstable and a central wave will “rob energy from its neighbors” making the troughs on each side of the enormous wave very deep. (The BBC series cited below has some spectacular graphs showing this.) What makes these waves especially dangerous for ships is that they aren’t the typical waves with sloping sides that ships are designed to handle. Rather, these have very steep sides and deep toughs on either side. The captain of the Queen Mary who saw one of these said it reminded him of the cliffs of Dover, straight up. And they break, which means you have millions of tons of water dropping on you, about 100 tons per sq. meter as opposed to a 12 meter wave that’s about 6 tons per sq. meter. (That would make a great Disney ride although it would be guaranteed to bring on massive puking.)For the truly paranoid or apocalypticly oriented types, I recommend reading the section on the side of the mountain in the Canary Islands that's due to collapse into the ocean generating a 100 foot wave along the east coast of the United States; or, Latuya Bay in Alaska that generated a 1,000 (yes, that's one thousand) foot high wave following an earthquake in 1958. I mean, really. (The USC Tsunami Research Group found evidence the wave may actually have been 1,720 feet high. - http://www.usc.edu/dept/tsunamis/alas... - I thought Casey was exaggerating so I had to look it up. The wave snapped trees that were six-feet thick.)Perhaps my favorite part of the book was the section on salvage tugs and their crews. Those who have read other reviews of mine will understand the attraction I have for these stories. Farley Mowat wrote a wonderful novel about ocean-going salvage tugs: The Grey Seas Under: The Perilous Rescue Mission of a N.A. Salvage Tug. One of the hazards Mowat doesn’t even mention was dealing with dangerous cargo. The worst is undeclared pesticides or herbicides. The regulations in carrying such cargo are so onerous –and properly so– that the incentive to carry them illegally is huge. When a ferry, the Princess of the Stars – capsized off the Philippines the salvage experts discovered an extremely hazardous pesticide, Endosulfin, that would have caused devastation on a nearby Sibuyon Island, environmentally pristine sanctuary. Other hazardous cargo such as phenyl, a common ingredient in plastic causes paralysis when its fumes are inhaled. In one case cyanide powder had been labeled as flour. These intrepid souls head out in the absolute worst weather to rescue ships in distress (For a great video of one such French ocean-going tug see: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w8K2B1.... (I get seasick just watching this video, notice the wave breaking on the bridge.) For a high seas rescue check out the video of the Flandre’s sister ship, the Bourbon: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5Na8E.... For a very unusual salvage story see In Peril: A Daring Decision, a Captain's Resolve, and the Salvage that Made HistoryI would have preferred a little more science (the title is misleading, it’s really more hagiography of Laird Hamilton) and a little less surfing (I'm exaggerating a little, perhaps I'm just jealous.) She’s a good writer although I should point out one never says 25 knots per hour; 25 miles per hour or 25 knots. John McPhee, Casey is not. Nevertheless, it’s a fascinating read.Confirmed from space: http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/na...The BBC has a nifty series of videos with some great footage at http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Htq57D...Popular Mechanics article Dec 1972 “Little Boats that Go Out to Save Big Ones”: http://books.google.com/books?id=69QD..."
4,0767928849,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1067741-susan,3,"This book was so good at explaining complex science in accessible terms, and overall it was very interesting. Basically, Casey hypothesizes that global warming has produced enormous, rogue waves much more frequently than has ever been thought. One such documented wave in the 1950's in Alaska measured a staggering, atypical 1,740 feet. The implications of this, especially if you own real estate on a coastline, are sobering. However, in her examination of the surfers who risk their lives to ride these 60-100 footers, the adulation she showers on Laird Hamilton, her main subject, proved a fatal flaw for this reader. It's clear that Casey's heart was all in with the sexy surfers and their unique, laid-back-but-testosterone-driven culture at the expense of her forays into scientific inquiry. This was a serious pity, since she is a very, very good science writer who blends the art of writing with the objectivity of science gracefully and well. The jacket copy misleads readers to suggest that the book examines science and surfing with an equal eye. I liked the content of this book better than a 3, but I found the pervasive Laird-worship just a bit cringeworthy at times. To my thinking, the true and unsung heros are, in fact, the scientists who devote much of their lives to studying this alarming, increasingly important phenomenon for relatively little pay and less glamour. They certainly don't bag Red Bull and Monster sponsorships, nor do they get a yearly Oscar ceremony. I like Beautiful People (these would be the Surfers) and admire their exploits, don't get me wrong, but the two diverse cultures made for a queasy and uneven blend. Call me a geek. I won't argue."
5,0767928849,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1654645-deb-readerbuzz-nance,4,"""A wave might seem to be a simple thing, but in fact it's the most complicated form in nature. Scientists even find it difficult to agree on a basic, all-around definition of what a wave is. Many, but not all, waves move a disturbance through a medium. That disturbance is usually, but not always, energy. A wave can store that energy or dissipate it. Paradoxically, it's both an object and a motion....In order to exist, wave require a disturbing force and a restoring force.""I knew nothing about waves before I read this book-for-book-club book; honestly, I don't think I wanted to know anything about waves.Well, that's what I thought. Wrong.Susan Casey is one of those amazing nonfiction writers that can take on a subject that might make you roll your eyes in boredom and explain it in ways that not only are easily understood but are also captivating.""When you're actually on a giant wave...the experience is like a collage of sensory impressions. There may be a flash of white spray, a sudden jolt, a feeling of energy surging beneath your feet, the suspension of time so that ten seconds stretch like taffy across a violent blue universe. Inside the barrel, a place that surfers regard with reverence, light and water and motion add up to something transcendent. It's an exquisite suspension of all things mundane, in which nothing matters but living in that particular instant. Some people spend thirty years meditating to capture this feeling. Other ingest psychedelic drugs. For big-wave surfers, a brief ride on a mountain of water does the trick.""Casey explores the world of big-wave surfers, as well as taking on stories of some of the most huge waves known to man. It is absolutely mesmerizing."
6,0767928849,http://goodreads.com/user/show/858949-chris,4,"Okay, I want you to do something for me. Close your eyes.Wait. No, that won't work. Open your eyes again.Eyes open? Good. Now imagine you've closed your eyes, but don't actually close them because that will rather impair your ability to read this review.So, you're imagining that your eyes are closed. Now imagine you're on a cruise ship. It's a lovely place - blue water, blue skies, the faint scent of salt in the air, the waves lapping up against the hull of the boat in a soothing rhythm. It's a perfect way to spend a vacation.You get a daiquiri and lean on the railing, looking out towards the horizon. This is nice, you think. Just what I -Wait. What is that?You shield your eyes from the sun to get a better look and see what looks for all the world like a shadow on the horizon, stretching long and with flecks of light shimmering off its top. As it gets closer, it gets bigger, and you can feel the boat drop under your feet. The water gets higher and higher, and you know this can't possibly be happening because for the wave to be that high, it would have to be at least sixty or seventy feet. In thirty-five foot waters.A shadow is cast over the boat as the wave crests above you, and the last thing you think before the top comes down, shattering the cruise ship like it was made of so much balsa wood, is, ""I wonder what it would be like to surf that....""It has often been said that we know more about the surface of the moon than we know about our own oceans. I have no idea who first said it, or in what form it was said, but reading this book drives home that it is absolutely correct. What's more, that ignorance may well kill us. The oceans are full of relentless mysteries and hypnotic beauty, but also terrors and dangers the likes of which we shorebound humans have trouble understanding. The sea has always been a dangerous place, really. We know that. What we don't know is what all of those dangers are. Tales of giant waves have been around since antiquity, but until recently, people didn't really believe them. It defied everything that was known about the ocean - to say nothing of common sense - to have waves appear out of nowhere, rise to heights of up to a hundred feet or more, wreak havoc on oceangoing vessels, and then vanish. These were the tales of sailors, whom everyone knew could not be trusted to tell the truth about their journeys.Perhaps that is why Casey chooses to open with a scene from a research vessel in the North Atlantic. The RRS Discovery was on a routine mission to gather data about the sea between the British Isles and Iceland when it found itself under attack by the ocean itself. The ship was hit over and over again by waves reaching up to sixty feet, then dropped down into the void between waves and lifted up again, over and over for five days. Things that weren't bolted down flew in mad directions all over the ship, and many things that were  bolted down - like lifeboats - were ripped off their moorings. It was so terrifying that the scientists on board, after they had gotten home, wrote one of the very few research papers that included a note at the end thanking the captain for bringing them back alive. Only great skill and good luck saved that ship from oblivion in waters that seemed to have risen up for the sole purpose of destroying it.No one - no weather forecaster or meteorologist, oceanographer or climatologist - no one thought that waves of that size could exist under those conditions. And yet there they were, and the Discovery's instruments captured it all.Scientists who study the oceans are just beginning to understand how waves work on the ocean, but the almost infinite number of variables that contribute to making waves is so overwhelming that it's hard to conclusively predict where and when these rogue waves will appear. Other people who work with the sea - salvage operators, ship captains, insurers - know that this kind of thing is possible, and that the sea carries risks with it that no other form of transportation faces. Every year, dozens of ships are lost, and with them go many lives and countless dollars worth of merchandise. Some of these losses come from human error, but others come because the ocean is an inherently dangerous place for us to be. It is vital for our safety and our economy that we know how the ocean works, but we are nowhere near being able to do that.What's worse, the onset of climate change could make current models obsolete as the seas become higher, rougher, and more unpredictable. We are racing against the clock - and losing.But for all the scientists who are trying to map the behavior of waves, there is a community of people who seek them out. People who know the waves intimately, even if they can't write an equation to tell you what it is they know, exactly. These people are the surfers, and if there was ever a group of people more attached and attuned to the sea, they'd have to be mermen.Casey spends a lot of time with surfer Laird Hamilton. I wanted to say ""the famous Laird Hamilton,"" but I didn't know the man existed until I read this book, which makes him one of those people who is very famous, but only to the kind of people who would find him famous. Now that I know more about him and his community, though, I can certainly understand why he has the prestige that he does. Among big-wave surfers, he is a legend. And that takes some doing.To ride a regular wave, you see, you get out there with your board, get behind the point where the waves start to break, and paddle to catch up. With the big waves, though, they're moving much too fast for a paddler to get into position, so the big-wave riders have someone on a jet ski to pull them along. Once in position, the jet ski goes down the back of the wave while the surfer heads down the front where, hopefully, he won't be killed. If he falls off, his partner has to come in, find him, and get them both out before the next giant wave - and where there's one wave there are always more - comes in to crush them both. Regular surfing has its share of dangers, but the perils of big-wave surfing are orders of magnitude worse.There is a whole community of surfers looking to ride these great waves. They travel across the world on the mere possibility of great surfing, heading to places with names like Jaws, Mavericks, or Egypt, all in the hope of catching the biggest waves. Injuries are common, and sometimes terrible. Death is always an option. But they come anyway, just for that moment of zenlike awareness of the Eternal Now that you can only truly achieve when you're riding down the face of a wave and trying not to die.I don't like the ocean, myself. I find it too big, too impersonal. It's a place that could swallow you whole and leave no trace you were ever there. It's a place that cares nothing for us puny humans and will, on a whim, try to destroy us. I certainly appreciate the ocean and what it does for us, and it's nice to look at. But I certainly don't trust it, and this book really didn't help in that regard. From tales of ships crushed by rogue waves south of Africa to waves so large and so powerful they could strip the bark off the trees they uprooted, it was a testament to the fact that the moment we underestimate the ocean is the moment it kills us.What's more, with climate change being what it is, our problems with the ocean are going to turn into new and different ones. The models we have now - good though they are - are incomplete, and the changes that are coming in the future will keep scientists on their toes for years to come. As Casey notes, wave science is a very young discipline, but it is one that needs attention if we're going to safeguard our coastal cities and global commerce. This book is an exciting read about a topic you've probably never given much thought to. You fear for both the surfers and the scientists, and in the end realize just how much there is about the ocean that we still don't know. I don't know about you, but it kind of freaks me out....--------------------------------------------------------------""If you can look at one of these waves and you don't believe that there's something greater than we are, then you've got some serious analyzing to do and you should go sit under a tree for a very long time.""- Laird Hamilton--------------------------------------------------------------"

I was not so much interested in the surfers or their stories. However, not far into the book, that changed.The author talks with scientists studying the phenomenon and hangs out with the surfers who tackle these big waves. Despite the recent improvements in monitoring and measuring, the science still has a long way to go and the ocean is still wildly unpredictable. While the scientific information is interesting and enlightening, I really enjoyed getting a bit into the minds of the big-wave surfers who attempt challenges most of us would never even dream of trying. Some have paid with their lives. Many are part of a close knit pseudo-family, enduring the squabbles all families have but watching out for one another, often at the risk of their own lives.“If I scare myself once every day, I am a better person,” he had said, “It helps to have that little jolt of perspective that life's fragile.”(This quote is from an advance bound galley, so may have changed in the published edition.)The number of huge ships, especially the low-riding tankers, that just disappear without a trace and with little if any media coverage is amazing. Often these ships are registered to countries with loose maritime standards and crewed by under-trained third world natives.The book also contains information on maritime insurance, climate change, marine salvage companies, lots of people and organizations involved with the vagaries of oceanic behavior.I do wish the author had explained a few more of the surfing terms for the uninitiated, like I am. That is my only quibble with the book, and it is a minor one. All in all, the book is a fascinating read.I was given a copy of the bound galley by the publisher through Goodreads.com, for which I am very grateful. "
8,0767928849,http://goodreads.com/user/show/951409-josh,2,"After reading the intro and getting scared to death about being on a boat caught in a massive storm, i was frighted and excited to learn more about the processes that go into forming these freak swells. I was intrigued by how ms casey would tie the surfing pursuit of big waves with the science behind how waves work together. In the end i felt that it was a failed attempt. She should have just written a biography on laird hamilton as that is largely what i felt the book was. the science and discussion was poorly explored or explained and at times downright misleading. as a physicist i could tell that she did not pick up on the subtly of what many the scientists she interviewed told her. further, her narrative almost implied that the surfers understood the processes that the scientists studied better. At the end, i respect big wave surfers as i know a few, but it is not what interests me in surfing, so if the book had been advertised as being about big wave surfers i would not have picked it up. I picked it up as what promised to be a pop science exploration of ocean processes. I got a lot of what i was not interested in and a little of what i wanted to read about but poorly done. I feel that as a non-scientist she did not know how or what to write about in the science of waves that would be interesting, but had a contract to write the book so filled in the story by hanging out with the strapped crew. will not read again and would not really recommend unless you want to learn about laird hamilton and his quest to surf massive ocean waves. end of the day not a pop science book."

She invites the reader to spend time with a band of surfers, to listen to what drives them. Between the chapters with these men, she interviews physicists studying waves, salvage crews rescuing ships broken by waves, shares archived accounts of people who lived through extraordinary waves and hears the concerns of insurers and others whose economic success can be destroyed by freak waves. I read this because it fulfilled a challenge, but I also hoped to understand men who would risk everything, who are willing to endure horrendous injuries and watch their colleagues die, just for a thrill. That did not happen. I admire firefighters, police officers, social workers serving in dangerous neighborhoods and others who risk their lives for little gain just to help others, to make the world a bit better for someone else. But, I still can’t comprehend nor condone engaging in such dangerous behavior for bragging rights or an adrenalin high. "

11,0767928849,http://goodreads.com/user/show/129099-jennifer,4,"It is too predictable to say that Susan Casey wrote a great piece of non-fiction. As the author of countless articles in mainstream periodicals like Outside, National Geographic and Men's health, to being the current editor of O Magazine, to writing the gripping and meticulously researched ""The Devil's Teeth"", you come to her second book expecting excellence and she does not disappoint. Casey follows two groups of individuals in parallel- big wave scientists/ researchers, and big wave surfers. Coming from the premise that most people see big waves as something to be avoided, she attempts to understand people who consciously devote their lives to them, intellectually (through the researchers) and physically (through the surfers). Subsequently the book is a great read, breaking up the occasional tedium of academia with the adventure of big wave chasing.The only downside to this book is that Casey attempts to argue that global warming is creating seas that will be more unpredictable and serve up larger waves. While she always asks her scientists about this possibility, the argument seems tacked on at the end of the chapter, eclipsed by the larger-than-life characters that pepper the book. While she may be accurate in this conjecture, it seems as if she hoped it would be the moral that wrapped up the book whereas it ended up being a sidenote.In short, The Wave was another engrossing read by Susan Casey, and I look forward to seeing what topic she adeptly tackles next.

Yes, I ended up reading a book about sport. Freaked me out a bit, but I went with it. And now I have a greater appreciation for surfers.Every second chapter of this book is dedicated to telling the story of the time the author spent hanging out with big wave surfers. These are not your average surfers at all. Although they may use surfer lingo and talk about the sea and waves like they are personified, they do use a lot of meteorological and hydrological knowledge in their puruits. They have a genuine respect for the people around them and they nurture new talents.I have a new found respect for surfers and the sport.The alternating chapters focused on the more scientific side of large wave theories and predictions. Don't panic non-scientificals! It's all fairly light going as the author is only a journalist. These chapters are essentially interviews with wave scientists, mariners and insurance brokers.Even though the book approached the subject non-scientifically, I learnt an awful lot about waves and rogue wave formation. The style of writing was easy to read and flowed well.I have another book to read soon, Bruce Parker's 'The Power of the Sea'. Parker has a phd in physical oceanography, so hopefully a more meatier, sciencey read."
13,0767928849,http://goodreads.com/user/show/903241-les-gehman,4,"The Wave by Susan Casey is an excellent chronicle of the people who chase big waves, and the people who try to understand and predict them. About half of the book follows Laird Hamilton as he chases the biggest waves in the world to surf, while the other half documents the scientists who strive to understand what causes rogue waves and how to build ships and platforms to withstand them.Laird Hamilton and his fellow tow surfers are insane. They risk their lives to ride ever larger waves. Casey does a great job of capturing the surfers intensity and the risks they face. I would have liked to read more about the scientists and their work in predicting waves and also more detail about the destructive power of the waves. However, all in all, this is a wonderful book and well worth reading."
14,0767928849,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1865168-rick-spilman,2,"Sea monsters exist. They break ships in half and pull them below the waves. Sometimes they swallow them whole. Most who encounter them never return to tell the tale and those few who do, until very recently, were rarely believed.I am referring to rogue waves, which until only the last decade or so, have been dismissed as myths, merely sailor’s tall tales. Only in roughly the last ten or fifteen years has the existence of rogue waves been fully documented and accepted by oceanographers. Scientists are only beginning to gain some understanding of how and where the waves rise up from the oceans to crush the unfortunate and the unlucky.I am intrigued, fascinated and a bit frightened by rogue waves, so when I saw Susan Casey’s new book, “The Wave: In Pursuit of the Rogues, Freaks and Giants of the Ocean” I was excited. I want to learn more a about rogue waves and this book looked like it could tell me what I wanted to know. Sadly, was I wrong. Very wrong.Casey’s book is a hyper-kinetic jumble which primarily focussed on surfing. Yes, surfing. And not just any surfing but specifically an extreme form of surfing involving jet skis called “tow surfing.” What does this have to do with rouge waves? As far as I can tell, absolutely nothing.We should first define out terms. From Wikipedia, not Ms. Casey’s book, the following definition: “rouge waves (also known as freak waves, monster waves, killer waves, extreme waves, and abnormal waves) are relatively large and spontaneous ocean surface waves that occur far out in sea, and are a threat even to large ships and ocean liners. In oceanography, they are more precisely defined as waves whose height is more than twice the significant wave height (SWH), which is itself defined as the mean of the largest third of waves in a wave record. Therefore rogue waves are not necessarily the biggest waves found at sea; they are, rather, surprisingly large waves for a given sea state. Rogue waves are not tsunamis, which are set in motion by earthquakes [and] travel at high speed, building up as they approach the shore. Rogue waves seem to occur in deep water or where a number of physical factors such as strong winds and fast currents converge.“Ms. Casey spends most of her book following around a band of extreme surfers who travel the world looking for those places where ocean swells collide with reefs and generate huge breaking waves. This is all well and good except that breaking waves and crazy surfers have nothing to do with rogue waves. She also spends considerable time on tsunamis, often shifting directly from a discussion of rouge waves to tsunamis, unaware or unconcerned that the two have relatively little to do with one another.It only gets worse when she starts discussing ships. She seems to know that there are ships called bulk carriers, that they sink frequently and that having hatch covers ripped off in heavy weather is a bad thing. Beyond that things get really fuzzy. She does mention he sinking of the LASH ship MS München, but she calls it a container ship, rather than a barge carrier with a load cargo of steel products stored in her 83 lighters. In this case, the details do matter. It appears highly likely that the München was struck by a rogue wave. What is known of her sinking is a fascinating if horrifying tale, which Ms. Casey chooses not to tell.She goes on at greater length regarding the sinking of the MV Derbyshire, which may or may not have been sunk by a rogue wave. A study performed in 2000 suggests the Derbyshire sank due to progressive flooding in a typhoon. An excellent animation of how the ship is believed to have sunk can be found here for anyone who may be interested.Ms. Casey also seems to have a touch of xenophobia regarding the ship’s crews. Her repeated references to “third wold crews” do not appear complimentary. In discussing the Derbyshire she notes, “unlike other lost ships, this one wasn’t flying a Liberian flag and manned by Laotian sailors.” Elsewhere she comments on the global crew shortage: “This lack of expertise was especially troubling given the next-generation ships, floating colossi with complex computer navigation systems to master, not always a snap when the manual’s written in German and you speak only Tagalog.” Obviously crew training is important but it is hard to tell if she is making that point or simply insulting Philippine mariners. And like so much else in the book, it has very little to do with rouge or freak waves.Ms. Casey is the editor of Oprah Winfrey’s magazine “O” and the Wave reflects a certain style of personality driven journalism. Often the book feels like a series of profiles of the surfer dudes who surf huge waves and the scientists who study the huge waves. After several chapters of following the surfers doing insane things on massive breakers, Ms. Casey finally goes to a conference on waves where we meet the scientists, learn that the math they use is really complicated and very little else. She never does the hard work of finding someone to translate the scientific jargon and mathematics into language understandable to the layman. Mostly she appears bored, preferring to be back out with the surfers. “The presentations continued in a blur of wave theory while outside the real waves grew. Surfers streaked past, filling the windows.”We do get nice little portraits of each scientist and surfer. At the conference we come to know more what the scientists look like and wore more than what they are working on. Just two examples of many:Peter Janssen was up next, and he unfolded his tall, wiry frame from his chair and strode to the podium. He had wild gray hair, a peppery beard, and a strict, professorial appearance that seemed intimidating until you noticed the sparkle in his eyes.It was impossible not to like Cavaleri, a whip-smart man in a no-nonsense plaid shirt, his sleeves rolled up, his caterpillar eyebrows jumping around on his face, his hands swimming through the air.And so on and so on.In the end “The Wave: In Pursuit of the Rogues, Freaks and Giants of the Ocean” comes off as primarily a travelog of a journalist hanging with lots of surfer dudes and a few scientists. If you want to learn about the people who do crazy things on surf boards on huge waves, then this is the book for you. If you want to learn anything about rogue or freak waves, you are better off just doing a Google search."

The synopsis compares this to Into Thin Air which is fantastic so I had high hopes for this. Chapters go back and forth between following a group of surfers and scientific information on waves. A few of the surfing sections were very intense and interesting but about half way through I was ready for this to be over."
16,0767928849,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1826682-trish,5,"The Wave is an outrageously good read, alternately thrilling and terrifying us in turns. How many ways can a wave be described? As many ways as there are waves, though one suspects the Hawaiians had more words for the qualities of water than we do. While surfing plays the loudest chords in this book, one of the most resonant notes played was a description of Lituya Bay in Alaska, where epic waves scour the coastline. I went back and forth with the narrative to examine the included photographs again and again. Pictures help, but Casey’s descriptions are harrowing. Reading (or writing!) about surfing could be a difficult endeavor. After all, unless one is on the wave, it is difficult to get a feel for its power. Even watching from shore doesn’t give one any real feel for what is going on in the water. Casey brings us up close and personal, partly through her access to the men who ride in wild conditions, and partly through her use of language and imagery to describe different conditions: “Among big-wave connoisseurs, Ghost Tree wasn’t especially beloved. It didn’t break that often, and when it did it lunged open in a maniac sneer, spitting foam and tangled rafts of kelp.” For me, I have an indelible picture of this vicious water, as in this different, but equally effective description of Mavericks: “The Aleutian swells thunder three thousand miles across the North Pacific, barging past the continental shelf until their progress is rudely halted by a thick rock ledge that juts offshore about a mile from Pillar Point, near Half Moon Bay’s harbor. When it hits this shallower depth, the wave energy rears up, shrieking and screaming, forming the clawed hand that is Mavericks.” As I read, I was reminded of Yvon Chouinard's autobiography Let My People Go Surfing because while the visionary businessman and adventurer lamented climate change and the disappearance of glaciers, he prepared for it by developing a bigger line of surfing products. If there is going to be more water everywhere, Chouinard suggests, that's where the business opportunities are for the outdoorsman. But even now we see that the biggest waves are becoming too much for the surfboards now made. Laird Hamilton, surfer extraordinaire, is trying new hydrofoil boards to take on the larger, more destructive waves being generated in oceans whose currents and temperatures are changing.This book is the equal of Born To Run, the word-of-mouth bestseller among athletes and couch potatoes alike. One doesn’t have to do more than act like a sponge to enjoy this extraordinary book. "
17,0767928849,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4330113-der-shing,2,"Waste of time. Rogue waves... just the visual alone of a liquid mountain rushing, unstoppable, across the open ocean, is enough to make the imagination race. What causes them? What specific weather phenomena, geology, geography, climate, etc? What type of physics lies behind these mass movements? What are the effect of waves on humans and the world? There are so many questions! I enjoy watching footage of waves and reading anecdotes of people who have encountered them, so this book seemed like an interesting doorway into that world. What I got instead was a love-letter to competitive sport surfers, a distressing lack of information about the basic science and mechanism of waves, and a lot of useless, pointless information.If this book has been framed as a book about big-wave surfing, I could have given it a higher score (if I had bothered to read it, which I wouldn't have). The book is, however, centered around giant and unpredictable waves. She decides to approach the subject emotionally instead of having any sort of deeper interest in the waves themselves, or doing basic research on physics beforehand. She attends a scientific conference in which she shows up late, is clearly more entranced by the surfing going on outside, and where she doesn't understand any of the science until it is anthropomorphized (the then tries to ascribe morality to waves). She also spends such a huge amount of time telling me how much body hair certain people have, or how much their eyes glitter, or what famous personality they look like. It seems disrespectful to the scientists who work hard to understand the world, and insulting to the reader who picked up this book to get a bridge between a layperson understanding and a highly technical explanation. She does, however, talk about how tall everyone is, and what expressions they make when they are thinking, especially if it is Laird and he is doing something attractive.I was terrifically disappointed. It felt like I was following a giggling fan into the locker rooms and then forced to watch her sit down every so often for classes, mechanically questioning everyone unanswerable questions about climate change to make her sound topical and engaged. And then suggest that scientists are less able to understand these waves because they sit at computers with their glasses on instead of rippling their attractive bodies over 40 lb boards. Very offputting. "
18,0767928849,http://goodreads.com/user/show/84043-matt,4,"The book dedicates about 3/4 of its pages to the surfers that ride giant waves, and about 1/4 to the science behind them. All in all, very cool, and not being a surfer myself, I found myself enjoying those parts more than expected. As famed critic Joshua Brustein points out, the hero worship can get to be a bit much (especially with Laird... geez Susan, he can't be that cool), but it doesn't take too much away from the content.I would have enjoyed a little more time dedicated to the science, especially the relation between climate change's effect on giant waves and what it means for specific places. Still, well done. The only element I thought was largely missing was the viewpoint of the surfer's family, especially given how dangerous the whole business of riding 100 ft waves can be. The first quote I think summarizes Susan Casey's writing style, and the second is her attempt to summarize our relationship, even kinship, with waves.""... a true waterman could swim for hours in the most treacherous conditions, save people's lives at will, paddle for a hundred miles if necessary, and commune with all ocean creatures, including large sharks. He understood his environment. He could sense the wind's subtlest shifts and know how that would affect the water. He could navigate by the stars. Not only could he ride the waves, he knew how the waves worked. Most important, a waterman always demonstrated the proper respect for his element. He recognized that the ocean operated on a scale that made even the greatest human initiative seem puny.""""Like the sea, we are always in motion. The waves loom in our dreams and in our nightmares through all of time, their rhythms pulsing through us. They move across a faint horizon, the rush of love and the surge of grief, the respite of peace and then fear again, the heart that beats and then lies still, the rise and fall and rise and fall of all of it, the incoming and the outgoing, the infinite procession of life. And the ocean wraps the earth, a reminder. The mysteries come forward in waves."""
19,0767928849,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2587252-pamela-barrett,5,"“Except for luminous glints of turquoise at its peak, the wave was sapphire blue, gin clear, and flecked with white. If heaven were a color, it would be tinted like this.” This quote is Susan Casey’s description of seeing a wave up close at Jaws, a Maui surf spot known for huge dangerous waves. At fifteen, my father gave me a 9ft Ole surfboard—it was too big for me and I could barely drag it down the beach. I wanted to look cool with it under my arm like all the surfers did and I wanted more than anything to be the girl that the Beach Boys sang about in Surfer Girl. It wasn’t going to happen, but that big board attracted surfers who wanted to help me get it into the water and teach me how to paddle out. I loved watching them catch the waves. Years later my love affair with Ocean waves and surfers really took off when I watched early surf films and saw the shots Greenough took inside the tube of pristine waves; their glassy faces a peek into another world. So when I heard about Susan Casey’s book, The Wave, I had to read it and she didn’t disappoint. It is the perfect blend of surf stories from some of the best big wave riders and the guys who help them make it out to those waves along with the guys who help in the rescues when the waves eat them up and spit them out; and a look into the history, physics, and science of freak monster waves that appear out of nowhere and cause massive destruction. Read this book and it will change the way you look at the seas around the world. An entertaining and educational 5 star read for anyone who loves the Ocean."
20,0767928849,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2765632-uyennie,4,"I don't know who's more bad azz in this book...Laird Hamilton and his gang of Watermen or the scientists who also brave scary risks in the pursuit of knowledge. I also found the section on the marine salvagers really fascinating.Although some of the science section is a bit arcane for the average reader, I think most semi-intelligent people will get the main gist of the concepts.The stats on how many ships go missing is astounding. As Casey points out, if even a small plane went down, we'd hear about it in the news. Yet, ships apparently routinely go missing and the world is ignorant about it. The history of Lloyd's of London is also fascinating. I have more respect for them now knowing their maritime origins instead of just knowing they insure crazy celebrity body parts. It takes a pretty skilled author to make an insurance company sound interesting.The only reason this didn't rank a perfect 5 star is the number of surf stories. While they were definitely harrowing and exhilerating and Casey does a good job of taking the reader there, after so many, they started to blend together - big scary waves that can do major damage to a downed surfer. Other than that complaint, the glimpse into the surfing culture, and the scientific knowledge from the book was fascinating."
21,0767928849,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1039395-anthony,2,"It was ok. 3/4 of the book is a surfer lovefest. Maybe a Laird Hamilton crush. Don't get me wrong, I am a huge fan of Laird and all the big wave surfers. I enjoy surfing (not anywhere near their level). It is just that having watched the dvds Riding Giants and Step Into the Liquid I could have written 3/4 of this book. Ok, I will be fair 1/2 the book. I enjoyed rehashing what was already covered in the movies. I liked the maritime disasters. I wish she put more research into her book. More story telling in the maritime. I just saw a 48 hours mystery type documentary on the Oceanus. She glossed over this and said the Captain and crew left first and that was about it. Too bad she didn't take the time to research this tragedy. She could have really brought up a fascinating and gut wrenching story. The bay in Alaska was fascinating. I thought the book would be equal parts surf, maritime, tsunami, science. Of course, not surprisingly, the science she uses is suspect. She is part of the ""Global Warming"" cult. It was disappointing because it is titled Wave. I thought it would be more about the wave."
22,0767928849,http://goodreads.com/user/show/109560734-kristen-longo,4,Switching it up a little with a non-fiction. My friend recommended this one to me and I really enjoyed it! All about waves and surfers. Very interesting and I loved all the short stories. I definitely have a new respect for the waves. 🥰
23,0767928849,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1962180-audrey,4,"Apparently the reason so many ships -- container-ships -- go down each year, and they do apparently, in dozens, is that ocean waves have so little regard for conventional math that a consortium of the top quantum physics and math people are routinely blown away by the ways in which ocean waves totally fail to behave and then monch the boats.For some reason I find that very comforting. A terrifying and wonderful book that's let down only by the author's insistence on including too much of the big-wave surfing scene. A little knowledge that there's a cadre of dudes who travel the world, surfing, goes a long way. (How do you even afford a rescue helicopter when you put down ""surfer"" as your profession on your tax returns? Someone please explain this to me.)Anyway, those sections pale in comparison to the ones that take place in 18th century Alaska (spoiler: 1740-foot wave kills everyone, no film at 11), at Lloyd's of London (someone has to keep making bad shipping decisions), an oceanography institute in Southampton, and a marine salvage firm in South Africa."
24,0767928849,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1774954-sarah,5,"How do you end a book about waves, taking into account the ending of The Great Gatsby or the repetition in a Van Morrison song? It’s not something to tackle lightly, or even something that the author of a non-fiction exploration of wave science and surfing (both) would be expected to do. But author Susan Casey does what she can now that the metaphors are all used up here in The Wave: In Pursuit of the Rogues, Freaks, and Giants of the Ocean (Doubleday, 2010). Ending lyrically is maybe her hardest task – and the one that doesn’t even matter when your source material is this amazing. The ostensible research interest in The Wave is large waves, known as freaks or rogues. These have been chronicled in various surf documentaries including Riding Giants. If you’ve seen Riding Giants, you’ve been amazed. The waves are so big as to be without scale – unimaginable and inconceivable in size and power. Like The Wave, Riding Giants captured the epic proportions, the emotional highs and the personalities of folks who chase these. The Wave follows, in depth, surfers and their important buddies – rescue teams, helicopter friends, photographers and endorsers. It also, horribly, records the inevitable and incredibly sad fatalities of folks who surf the sea. What’s the biggest wave you’d ride? The book describes epic tales of masterful wave riding, putting the reader right there in the pipe with long-serving watermen. I felt salted, thirsty and exhausted at the end. Yes, the answer is always yes. Until it’s no. The Wave keeps the adrenaline pumping until the tale of Brett Lickle, best bud of Laird Hamilton. In a most masterful chapter (starting on page 217), Casey relays the tale of the buddies riding out in a storm near Egypt (read the book), and the near-death survival of Lickle, rescued by Hamilton who appeared on a lost jet ski in the middle of 120-foot waves. Laird Hamilton, did I mention him? He’s a star here, larger-than-life and moody like the sea. Hamilton hands out few kind words to hangers on and wannabees, but is the man’s man glue holding a rowdy group of thrill seekers together. He’s as methodical as the scientists studying wave theory, devising new boards and means of staying in the pipe. Hamilton and his ilk aren’t scientists. But The Wave is both about sport and science. For instance: in 1958, an 8.0 earthquake along the Fairweather Fault in Alaska generated a 1,740 foot wave (you read that right) which traveled across the bay at 100 mph and denuded the land for 4 square miles. The science in The Wave examines a few places on Earth where the geography amplifies wave action. And the book explores reasons why wave action isn’t predictable, especially when unknown climatic conditions are fed into the poorly understood wave system. Take our current shifting weather patterns, our perpetually moving tectonic plates and you’ve got a case of heretofore undocumented wave breakouts across the globe, taking out tankers, sailors and researchers at the seeming drop of a hat. The research is a mix of personal anecdotes, trips with surf masters like Laird Hamilton, visits to wave science centers, and interviews with meteorologists, climatologists, physicists and barge rescuers. The Wave reminds that water is our real master – harsh, energetic, deadly and without logic. It’s a terrifying read, but one which is thrillingly constructed of all these tales woven together. The editing is superb, the pacing well done, the visuals are graphic and cutting, the writing’s honest and sincere. No regrets here; grab hold. "
25,0767928849,http://goodreads.com/user/show/374456-kerri-anne,5,"It's taken me over a month to sit with my thoughts about this book and it's been an ongoing struggle to force myself to write something coherent about it that's more than just me all-caps exclaiming how GREAT this book is and how much I LOVED IT and how it's ONE OF THE BEST AND MOST DELIGHTFULLY OCEANICALLY NERDY BOOKS I'VE READ IN SUCH A LONG TIME AND HOW DID IT TAKE ME SEVEN YEARS TO FIND THIS WAVE-RIDING MAGIC BECAUSE I SERIOUSLY DOG-EARED OVER HALF THE BOOK, YOU GUYS. So, yes. There are big pieces of this book that are about the history and practice of big wave surfing. Do I think surfing (and specifically big wave surfing) is a pretty fascinating sport/adrenaline rush/activity for the more-than-marginally insane? Yes, I do. But I still maintain I'm really not Casey's or this book's target audience. Because do I care about surfing MORE than I care about learning about (rogue and myriad other) waves and the science behind them? Nah, brah. WHICH IS ANOTHER REASON THIS BOOK IS SO WELL DONE. Because if you're in any way into surfing, or even mildly curious about surfing, I'll wager you're going to dig the surf-related storytelling in this book. BUT, if you don't give two craps about surfing, I'll also wager you will STILL be wholly into the wave-related storytelling in this book. (I got the unexpected double-whammy of enjoying both aspects of the storytelling, which in two-paragraph hindsight means maybe I *am* Casey's target audience for this book, after all. Lucky me!) There are stories about insane surf survivals (and tragic losses) coupled with stories about super nerdy and ominous wave/ocean climate conferences. There are images of MASSIVE waves and tiny humans precariously and (sometimes not so) expertly riding them alongside equally unbelievable and true stories of rogue waves all across the world. Casey takes her time with this book and does her research, and it's extensive, and impressive, and the bigger point is: This sort of science is really only in its infancy. Only recently have scientists been able to prove rogue waves exist! Even though they've been wiping out boats and fleets and entire civilizations for CENTURIES. To me, THAT IS ALL-CAPS FASCINATING. But I'm also a huge and unapologetic ocean nerd, so. You should read this book, is my overall point. Seven years later and our oceans are only warmer, and a lot of people might learn about rogue waves in a less comfortable way than reading about them if our global climate trends continue in the direction they're going. [FIVE ALL-CAPS STARS FOR BEING A BADASS BEHEMOTH OF NERDTASTIC TRUTH. And a warning. That likely no one in positions of power is heeding fast enough (or, you know, at all).]"
26,0767928849,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11951948-paul,4,"Waves can be thought of small and harmless, as they wash gently against your feet on a sun kissed beach. But they have a darker side, an ability to become an enormous destructive force that can obliterate landscapes, cities and ships.Fifteen years ago scientists did not believe the reports of 100 foot high waves that appeared from nowhere in calm seas to sink boats. Their models didn’t show them, and they thought they were myths or just wrong estimates of the height of the wave. But then there were two instances, an oil rig that had sensors fitted to record the heights of the waves beneath the platform, and a research ship in the Atlantic that was caught in a horrendous storm. The measurements proved what scientists didn’t believe was possible; that not only did these monster waves exist, and they occurred frequently.Each year a number of ships disappear completely without trace. It was thought that it was because of maintenance or other factors, but it is now believed that some of them are completely overwhelmed by these freak waves. Casey visits Lloyds in London to see the register of lost ships and talk to the insurance giant about ship losses. It is thought that around two big ships a week are lost, mostly bulk carriers, and there are pictures in the book of ships with their bows ripped off, and 70 foot high decks being covered with waterShe spends a lot of time with those at the leading edge of surfing. This select group are the guys who only want to surf the giant 60 foot plus waves. This is a dangerous game, and even though the safety equipment has improved since the beginning, lives are lost every year. A lot of these waves are formed by the geology in particular coastal areas and this forces the wave higher and increases the danger as they are above reefs or close to cliffs. To even get onto these wave require the surfer to be towed onto the wave behind a jet ski.. Even thought this is a nonfiction book about the sea, it reads like a thriller. Casey’s writing add drama and eloquence to the drama of being on a ship that is at the mercy of the sea, the anticipation of the surfers waiting for that perfect 100 foot wave and the scientists who are humbled by the power of the natural world."
27,0767928849,http://goodreads.com/user/show/155663-david,3,"This is quite a fun book to read. Most of the book is about a crazy sport called ""tow surfing"". Surfers are towed by jet skis, and are positioned on monster waves that are coming in to shore. Thirty, forty-foot waves are easy. The big ones are sixty, seventy feet or even more! It seems like total chaos. Often there are a few helicopters flying overhead, that double as photography platforms and rescue vehicles. Jet skis are criss-crossing each other, and sometimes tow-ropes get intertwined. A clump of ruined jet skis litter the beach. If a surfer falls from his board, he may be underwater for up to a minute, while additional giant waves pummel him.Some of the chapters are about the science of forecasting giant waves, and a few chapters are about the danger that freak waves pose to ships, large and small. Good ship captains know that in a big storm, they should steer into the swell and make slow headway, in a ""hove-to"" position. However, commercial ship captains are under heavy pressure to get their cargoes to port, and fast. So, if they cave in to this pressure, or if their obsolete ships lose hatches due to waves crashing down, they can be caught by a freak wave and sink.There is strong evidence that freak waves are not rare occurrences. Storm-driven freak waves are occurring more frequently, as are tsunamis. Their frequency is increasing, largely due to global climate change. In the case of tsunamis, the increase is due to earthquakes associated with the rising sea level.The book does seem to be a bit schizophrenic--one chapter about surfing, the next about ship disasters, then one about wave research, followed by another and another about surfing. You can get dizzy!"
28,0767928849,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3485047-nicole-harkin,5,"I read this book right away when it came out a few months ago...and LOVED it. So why have I not written the review yet? One word: jealousy. I had this idea to write a book about giant waves, from an article in the New York Times. Hundreds of ships go missing annually. For years they had no idea why...but now we know that the sailors stories of giant waves were not just tall tales.But I did not write the book. Mrs. Casey did.She took an interesting tact: she interwove the science of the waves with the stories of surfers trying to surf giant waves. It works well. You get the personal interest stories coupled with the scary science. (FYI: no cruises for me, ever, thank you very much.)For example, there are landslide-induced tsunamis. These happen under water. 8,000 years ago a piece of shelf the size of Kentucky gave way off the coast of Norway. The slide might have been caused by methane hydrates, or spherical gas deposits frozen into the sea floor. Changes in the temperature of the ocean could trigger more of these spheres to explode. Changes as little as one degree will set them off, leading to giant waves and vast clouds of methane going into the atmosphere. Methane is a greenhouse gas ten times more potent than carbon dioxide. Scary stuff.Oh and the USGS conservatively estimates that twice the carbon found in all fossil fuels in the world is contained in these ice balls.Bottom line is that the book is a great example of non-fiction done well. "
29,0767928849,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5962234-jason,0,"I had high hopes for this book, but you'll get sucked into the majesty of big wave / tow surfing in one chapter only to be bored to sleep with a chapter on the science of waves. It took me months to finish this book because once I hit a ""science"" chapter, I'd put the book down for a few days or weeks because I just didn't want to deal with it. The author also drones on and on about climate change and global warming to the point where I just stopped caring about it. She seemed to blame anything and everyone on climate change, BUT didn't offer any solutions on how to combat it. Don't alert me to what's wrong with world and then don't offer me any way to change my lifestyle. OK, so the burning of fossil fuels is bad, BUT all the surfers and wave researchers (who want to stop global warming) burn more gas than the average person flying around the world in airplanes, driving gas guzzling SUV's and jet skis. This book would have been AWESOME if you just read the chapters on Laird Hamilton and the rest of the tow surfing community and skipped the chapters about the science and mathematics of wave theory and global warming."
30,0767928849,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2384912-chris,3,"Not bad, but not quite what I expected. Very heavy on the surfing when I was expecting more science. Quite the opposite, in fact. The science there was, was more or less a lecture on human's impact on the climate, and not the science behind giant mysterious waves. To be fair, one of the main points, it seems, is that we have little clue about how to predict or calculate them, so how many pages can you spend saying that we are clueless. There was a lot of time spent warning us that human's impact was undoubtedly triggering worse storms, which in turn will clobber us with worse waves, yet citing example after historical example of giant killers that occurred before humans would have impacted the climate. Seemed somewhat incongruous and preachy.That criticism aside, it ended up being a fun read, and I enjoyed roaming around the world with the author chasing surfers and their pursuit of monsters. Looking at the pictures and reading of their bravery cum lunacy was enough to get this reader's blood pounding."

One of my bucket list items was to catch Jaws in action but my family visits have mostly been in the summer. Luckily, one Thanksgiving visit, it hit. Locals and visitors alike gathered on the cliff to check out the big wave riders. This book helped me understand more about the science of waves, surf culture, and Maui's north shore. Although the book takes the reader all around the world including NorCal's Mavericks, Mexico, South Africa, and Tahiti, I'm taking The Wave back to Maui because it's really anchored by people who live there.

Pg 10 This book is a search for what we know about outsized waves.Review: The book is told from the author's point of view as she goes about traveling the world to chat with various wave experts: surfers, Lyoyd's of London (the underwriter the policies world-wide for ships and cities), salvage experts, professors, and scientists from all over the world.The two main story lines (expert interviews and hanging out with Liard Hamilton's surf group) were separated by chapters but sprinkled around. I'm sure she considered creating two distinct halves, but this works because she learns more about waves as she goes and that part is linearly written. The interviews with experts focused on layman's terms, what we know, what we don't know (a LOT), and stories they had to share. This could have easily been bogged down with overwhelming data or terms, but the author does a great job of relating how complex the science is and how over her (and the readers head) it is without losing the overall fears, excitement, implications, science, and personalities. Her dry humor and personal observations add dimension. The other main story tract was getting introduced to big wave surfers and then basically following them around to learn how they found big waves and what it felt like to ride them. This could have easily, and very nearly did, sound like bragging. She seems to have gained membership into a long-standing pack of surfers who pioneered tow-in surfing on giant waves. She's in the loop on last second plans, doesn't get left behind or out (big waves require traveling off shore generally), gets to hang out at their houses and private viewing and launch spots. But her honesty about her lack of knowledge, getting interrupted a lot, feeling outside of and inside joke or story, and getting yelled at by boat drivers and surfers for doing something she shouldn't keep that in check. She clearly starts to learn the lingo and get more comfortable with them and being out on the water in insane conditions, but that never seems to go to her head and she's respectful and humble, and mostly curious and brave (or out of her mind for going out there.... Bc it sounds SCARY).My favorite part, some of which I read out loud, were the telling of Lituya Bay. I learned about this one in the course of studies at University. I hesitate to give this 5 stars because it doesn't feel like a 5 star, but I can't exactly say why exactly bc I did really enjoy it and recommend it. So 4 stars."
35,0767928849,http://goodreads.com/user/show/59553849-kuang-ting,4,"It’s a book about big wave surfers with some science description here and there.Most people will think they are reading a popular science book, but it turns out about 2/3 of the book is stories about surfers. The protagonist is Laird Hamilton who is a legend in realms of surfing sports. Author Casey flied around the world with surfing stars to catch big waves. Casey tells surfers’ philosophy and their lives to readers. It is actually very interesting to “observe” world of surfing from such a close range. These surfers are both brave and crazy in pursuit of monster waves around the world. They visited Tahiti, Hawaii, California, etc, to catch bigger waves. Sometimes they flied across the globe non-stop. They may hop on a plane and head to the next destination right after an exhausting day. It sounds really ridiculous, doesn’t it?The books are divided into chapters. There are scientific research trips between chapters of surfer’s stories. Casey went to Southampton to visit wave scientists, Cape Town to visit wave forecaster and shipwreck salvagers, London to visit ship insurance broker, just to name a few. It is like traveling on a purpose. The facts Casey presented us are good knowledge as they are fresh to most people. It’s always interesting to learn more how the world works. For example, shipwreck salvagers are the first people that rush to the scene trying to rescue everything as much as possible. It is mind-widening to learn about some basics of this ‘industry’.Casey is very good at describing the environment. I feel as if I am on the beautiful or dreadful scenes beside her. The only quibble I have is the overfilled depiction of those surfers. It outstays the welcome after half way through the book. It repeats the same theme such as “We gotta respect waves! Humans are humble in the face of mother nature!” It is a little too much actually.Overall, the book is indeed enjoyable. Recommend to everyone interested in ocean and sports."

In her book, Susan Casey interweaves chapters about elite surfers and the quest to find the largest waves with interviews with scientists and people whose livelihoods are tied to the ocean. Casey begins the book with a chapter about an immense rogue wave sank an allegedly unsinkable ship designed for the rough waters of the North Atlantic. After that she introduces readers to the King of Surfers Laird Hamilton. Fascinating reading ensues taking readers to exotic locations like Tahiti and the offices of Lloyd’s of London. You read about how the study of the ocean’s waves has advanced, shipwrecks, near wrecks, and surfing disasters. This landlocked Midwestern enjoyed this book. ,"
37,0767928849,http://goodreads.com/user/show/375767-joanna,4,"Fascinating and exhilarating and frightening. I would never be the girl storm chasing or surf chasing or any other kind of running-into-danger adrenaline-producing could-maybe-get-you-killed activities. Nope. Not my jam. But man, I do love reading about other people doing those things! This work explores the world of giant waves with an emphasis on elite surfing but also the dangers inherent in commerce on the seas- oil riggers, tankers, transports, yachts- as well as some sidelong glances at coastal living and the attendant storm damage. Some attention is paid to oceanography and meteorology, and there are cautionary words sprinkled throughout about the realities of global warming, climate change, sea rise, but the real star of this show is definitely the high octane world of the surfers you see dwarfed by enormous waves on magazine covers. They are intense. Wow. "

Given that I generally have a really hard time with the way authors try to handle math and science concepts, only occasional annoyance is pretty good.Anyway: If you like waves, weather, or a look at how climate change might change storms, etc, you should probably check this out.[4 stars for science.]"

Casey sucks you in; sometimes I’d be reading along and realize every muscle in my body was tense, like I was the one about to surf a 70-foot wave... My critique would be that it felt a bit disjointed, jumping from Hawaii surfers to physical oceanographers to tsunamis and back to Hawaii surfers, without a storyline holding it together. But it’s worth a read for sure. "

52,0767928849,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2064068-christopher-rex,1,"I'm not sure if this book deserves an ""Honorary Austerlitz Bag o' Crap"" Award or not, but I can't bring myself to give it more than 1-star. Basically, Austerlitz deserves zero stars and this book deserves one. Man, was this book lame. Start with the fact that she manages in the 1st 50 pages to improperly define ""Body Surfing"" (she calls it ""Body Boarding"" which is an entirely different activity). From there on it is a sap-fast of hero worshipping with few redeeming qualities.First of all, it's basically a book about Big-Wave Surfers with a smattering of other tidbits thrown around in random chapters. It is NOT really about ""big waves"" and/or the ocean. It's about big wave surfers and she fills it out with other crap (some of the ""other crap"" is actually quite interesting - much more so than the surfers - but she leaves it so undeveloped and secondary it gets lost). This is the problem when the Editor of ""O"" magazine thinks she can write a book about something as complex as waves and/or the ocean. She's clearly obsessed with Laird Hamilton and comes across as nothing more than a starry-eyed hanger-on who seems to think everything big-wave surfers do is amazing and everything they say is worthy of being written down. Otherwise, I'm not sure why 7 pages would be needed to describe a post-paddle-session breakfast conversation between Hamilton & Crew or 9-pages would be needed to describe the Billabong XXL Award procedures. And these are just 2 examples. The book is riddled w/ this nonsense which drags it out to 315 pages when it could've been 250pp. and 100x better. Borrrring.The other glaring problem (among many) is that the author either got a Big Book of Adjectives for Christmas and/or kept a 64-Color box of crayons next to her at all times in order to come up with sappy, unnecessary (and lame) descriptions of everything - and I mean EVERYTHING. By the end, I felt I would puke if I read another description of the ""apricot"" or ""lavender"" or ""cornflower"" or ""mauve"" color of the sky/clouds and/or the ""silver-green"" fields. And, if another dude was described as ""ruggedly handsome"" with ""well-carved"" features (or whatever) I might be looking for a shotgun to put in my mouth. Not everything needs 22 adjectives. Read your Hemingway, lady.If you want to read about big-wave surfing, I'm sure there are other books much better out there. I'm pretty sure Laird Hamilton has written his own book. If you want a book about the ocean, there are MUCH better books out there....""The Perfect Storm"", ""Endurance"", ""In the Heart of the Sea"", ""The Last Voyage of Columbus"" and ""Over the Edge of the World"" all come to mind. Granted these are about fishing/whaling/exploring, but they give a billion-times more engaging analysis of the sea and all its dangers and unpredictable personality.If you only have this book and ""Austerlitz"" to choose from, read it.....if you're trapped on an island with ONLY this book, Krakatoa and Austerlitz, you will likely be rigging a noose from the closest palm tree which is perched under the ""lavender, peach, cornflower and gold clouds"" next to a ""six-dimensional navy blue"" sea where ""the only thing missing is a pod of frolicking dolphins""....you can't make this crap up.

The stories of oceans devouring ships and one hundred foot waves based off eye witness accounts is now being proven as real with the advance of technology and the actual measuring devices on ships and platforms across the world. In pockets throughout the oceans of the world , ships, freighters and tankers are disappearing at alarming rates. As technology advances continue to improve, scientists throughout the world are coming together to discuss the alarming facts of what possibilities exist with global warming and how this process has and is affecting the ocean currents. While there have been eyewitness accounts for hundreds of years, there is a disturbing trend that is believed to have made what was an anomaly, into something that is far more frequent, terrifying and destructive then previously thought. There is some talk that in order to become this giant wave where there are certainly treacherous seas, that some anomaly seems to happen where the energy is sucked from other waves giving itself a huge peak that stands high in the air for seemingly moments before crashing down and destroying everything in its course. It seems that often times the wave or similar group of waves seem to come out of thin air actually after the sea has calmed down from a storm. Some of these Rogue waves as they are referred to, are caused by disruption under the sea as well as storms. Witnesses often speak of a smell in the air created by the energy coming off the air surrounding this monster. And as happens with many of the challenges that mother nature throws at us, there are the usual challengers.This particular challenge is picked up by hundreds of surfers world wide. This books also follows the exploits of this amazing group of individuals as they challenge the mightiest of waves,willing to risk life and limb for the ultimate challenge of surfing the hundred foot wave. Sometimes real life is stranger than fiction which is proved out over and over between the pages of The Waves.I found this book to be very thought provoking and even hauntingly beautiful. It is also a brutal and terrorizing look at what global warming is doing to our oceans. Susan writes a very comprehensive account of both the scientific studies as well as the surfing from her view from the inside. She knows the people involved in both sides of the issue through both research as well as being one of them. While this is not a book of fiction, it reads very much like one, leaving you breathless at times and horrified and fearful at others. A very real look at a possible future.I received this book as a free copy from Goodreads First Reads. I am not receiving any compensation and all opinions are my own based off my independent reading of this material."
54,0767928849,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1756815-wendell,2,"Two things make this book mildly interesting rather than great. First, Casey cannot decide if she’s writing a book about extreme surfing, oceanography, or sea disasters. The lack of focus means that all three subjects get short shrift, though she unfortunately pays more attention to the least interesting aspect of this triumvirate – extreme surfers. Which brings us to the second reason the book is more an example of “I’m the editor-in-chief of _O Magazine_ and that’s how I got a book deal” than it is of exemplary journalism. Casey fails to realize that her human subjects – the big-wave surfers whom she befriends and follows around the world – all sound exactly the same and yet have almost nothing revealing or profound to say about what they do. That does not, however, stop her from quoting them at great (not to say excruciating) length as they spin long, ineloquent paragraphs that all boil down to “wow, that was just incredible, but you had to be there to understand why.” One hates to hang a review on a cliché but the cliché is unfortunately true here: Extreme surfers, like many extreme athletes, either cannot say why they do what they do or (and one suspects this is the real reason) aren’t willing to tell the truth about it. For the surfers whom Casey adulates – men (without exception) who repeatedly put themselves in mortal danger, often while bitterly criticizing other men who put themselves in mortal danger for what are evidently less pure motives (the splitting of experiential hairs becomes more than slightly annoying, in fact) – what very much appears to be the actual reason for their participation in a sport that consumes their lives (along with hundreds of thousands of dollars) is simply that their masculinity demands it. The character named Lickle provides the best evidence of this when he describes his group of extreme-surfing buddies as a “gang”: “There was no way out,” he says. “There’s so much peer pressure.... You can’t just walk away.... But if you get shot up and almost die, they let you out.” Indeed, that is precisely what happens to him – he nearly dies – and, as a result, he is allowed to “walk away.” But his use of terms like “gang,” “peer pressure,” and “get shot” (he isn’t shot; he all but bleeds to death when one leg is flayed open by a razor-sharp surfboard fin) betray the ethos entirely. What Casey is actually researching is the same testosterone-driven masculine psychosis of criminal gangs, the same blood in/blood out mentality that means members can almost never “walk away.” Yes, the physical setting is the beach and the spectacles tend to be acted out in bright sunlight, but the psychological environment is no less troubling for all that nor are the actors less chilling in their relentless compulsion to perform their maleness over and over again. Even if it kills them."
55,0767928849,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4216776-baq,2,"TL;DR: This book should have been called ""My Obsession with Laird Hamilton and Some Other Stuff about Big Waves"".To understand how I feel about this book, just filter the reviews by 2 stars. I agree with a bunch of those reviewers, whose views can be summarized as:* though the synopsis does mention big wave surfing, the book also sells itself as a scientific exploration of rogue waves, and so caveat to the reader who's looking for a good pop treatment of the science of large waves.* the scientific exploration in this book comes up very, very short. Rogue waves are a real phenomenon with lots of cool science going on to research them (how does the ocean produce these giant waves for which we have no solid predictive models for?), but this book pays lip service to that research.* the book is jumbled: talks about tsunamis and rogue waves and big wave surfers and none of them really have anything to do with each other except that they all involve the ocean and superficially, waves.* too much attention is paid to how awesome Laird Hamilton and his crew are, how ripped they are, their conversations and lingo and what drives them. * it was awkward how much easier she found it to describe how scientists looked and what they wore rather than come up with a coherent, lay explanation of the research they were doing.Of the books I've read about the all consuming power of the ocean, I'd recommend The Perfect Storm: A True Story of Men Against the Sea or Isaac's Storm: A Man, a Time, and the Deadliest Hurricane in History. These are narrative non-fictions by some great authors that actually do delve into the science of waves (and storms)."
56,0767928849,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3452501-kayt-o-bibliophile,4,"A surprisingly fascinating, very human look at waves that scientists thought for years shouldn't exist. Author Susan Casey takes the reader around the world, from Hawaii to South Africa to England to Alaska and, always, back to Hawaii.She doesn't have quite the irreverence of Mary Roach, but the book's style is the same: the author/researcher writes in humorous first person, giving a detailed look at the subject (giant freaking monster waves) as it intersects with various groups of people: surfers, scientists, surfers who are scientists, insurers, salvage experts, and more. And, like Roach, she has the ability to write and explain in such a way as to make it interesting even if you are none of the above.As a girl with a lifelong, slightly morbid fascination with natural disasters, I particularly loved reading about previous waves (like one in Alaska that topped one thousand feet howisthatevenpossibleI'mgoingtoliveonMountEverestforever) and even today we still don't know much, and ships still disappear at sea. Also, I haven't been deterred from wanting to take another cruise, but I am never ever ever packing precious items for one ever again. This book is the only inspiration you'll even need to pack light, just in case.Another thing I loved was the recurring characters of super-wave surfer Laird Hamilton and his gang. They were the thread that wove the story together, a very human, intuitive voice among all the scientists and facts (which weren't dry or boring, but you know what I mean).The only complaint I have is that it's not possible to embed videos in books. But once you finish you have to run to Youtube and find footage of half the things mentioned--sinking cruise ships, giant storms, and, of course, the epic deadly waves surfed by Hamilton."
57,0767928849,http://goodreads.com/user/show/16647835-sean-mcgowan,3,"Susan Casey is a New York Times bestselling author of Devil's Teeth, a fascinating story of great white sharks off the coast of the United States, and the editor in chief of O magazine. For her latest non-fiction book Ms. Casey is back in the sea, literally, in a book described as capturing ship swallowing waves with scientists and surfers.Her first book on great whites was an excellent book that put you in the boats on a scary island off the coast of California. This book attempts to do the same with huge waves, like the mysterious 100 footer. I think it fails a bit in its delivery.If you are a follower of competitive surfing this book will interest you more than someone not familiar with that sport. A lot of the figures, who I am sure are famous in their own right for the feats, were lost to me. There daily dealings with colossal and deadly waves is described in over 2/3 of the chapters. Tied with the great photos of surfers and waves, this is an interesting part of the book, but did not fully get into the questions of rogue waves at sea that can cause catastrophic loss.When you read in the book that on a regular basis ships are lost at sea, some of them never to be heard from again, it gets the reader interested in how and why this happens. This is especially true, once again, when you view the excellent photos that accompany the book. What I think the book fails to do, in some degree, is describe these deep sea waves in more detail. I think too much of the book is spent on surfers and their lingo and much less on rogue waves, a la The Poseidon Adventure.After reading the Devil's Teeth and purchasing another book by Susan Casey, I was excited to see how she would tackle the world of waves as she had done great whites. Although the research was obviously meticulous and she did travel the world for a story, South Africa to Tahiti to Hawaii, I still think the mark was a bit lost in translation."
58,0767928849,http://goodreads.com/user/show/764994-rick,4,"Casey, author of The Devil’s Teeth, a True Story of Obsession and Survival Among America’s Great White Sharks, is a talented journalist, a magazine editor, and as the subtitle of her first book suggests, a fan of extreme activities and circumstances. In The Wave she shadows extreme surfers, those big wave surfers who are towed by jet skis into position to ride 50, 60, 70, 80 foot or higher waves, often in storm conditions. Laird Hamilton is (literally) the poster boy for this cohort of extreme athletes who dare to do the near impossible—the photos are amazing. She also travels the world to meet with scientists investigating big waves, rogue waves (startling, potentially fatally, large waves that seem to come out of nowhere), and whether the ocean and its waves are getting more treacherous and, if so, why. Casey does right by the surfers, following the same mad travel schedule that they and their crews take in reaction to weather reports that say big wave conditions are right—one crew began the day in Hawaii surfing, flew to northern California surfed, drove and flew through the night to Mexico and surfed some more with virtually no sleep over 60-70 hours. Rather like the movie Apollo 13, Casey also does right by the scientists, casting them as the equivalents of the surfers in their passion, exceptionality, and obsessive, intellectual risk-taking. She translates for them, headlines their discoveries, and shares their warnings.The Wave is good reading, dramatic and urgent. I for one am glad that Laird Hamilton is riding these waves and not me. I’m even gladder that the scientists who study them are doing their jobs and hopefully they and other scientists working on the problems that global warming presents will eventually win the war between understanding and stupidity being waged by American politicians."

My disappointment mostly stems from the fact that this book is being sold as a book about waves when really its a book about the authors infatuation with rugged surfers. I have nothing against attractive men, quite the contrary, I love them! but I found the authors very obvious crush on Laird Hamilton quite cringe making and distracting. This is reinforced by a picture of the author cuddled up to Hamilton on his jetski and descriptions of his physicality. The title Hanging with Hamilton or Hormonal with Hamilton may have been a better though every man in this book seems to be fair game, including, in fairness, the scientists she interviews. They are all rugged, or gentle or muscular or intense. There are very few women. There most be about 20 chapters in this book and every second chapter deals with the authors 5 year trek following surfers, mostly Hamilton, to various waves. The conversations are faithfully recorded which is extremely tedious as theres so much you can take of ""Man that was a gnarly wave Brah"". I like reading about surf culture but I suspect even if this book had been marketed as a surf culture book I would've found it very boring. There are quite alot of interesting stories in the scientific chapters and I will use this book as a reference but they are not followed through to any great depth which is a pity. A narrative of waves events from earliest time to the present with scientific exploration of the same and perhaps a chapter on surfing would have made a better book I think. If you're into waves this I suppose could be a good reference, if youre into surfing (or men) you're better off going out and experiencing them rather than reading this.."
