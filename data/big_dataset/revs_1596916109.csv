0,1596916109,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1713956-manny,5,"About a week ago, Not and I were browsing in a Melbourne bookstore when I noticed Merchants of Doubt. ""Should we buy it?"" I asked, after glancing at the back cover. Not was unenthusiastic. ""It'll be one of those books,"" she said - by which, as I immediately understood, she meant that it would be another partisan book about a hot topic, which dishonestly reported one side of a complicated and unclear debate while ignoring the other side. ""So what kind of book would you buy?"" I asked. ""The kind I'd write,"" said Not promptly: this time, meaning a book that was carefully researched, fact-based, unbiased, and written primarily from a historical perspective. It was a perfectly reasonable reply, and I considered putting the book back on the shelf. But I'd heard good things about it and thought I'd leaf though it bit more first. ""You know,"" I said after a while, ""I think this is the kind of book you'd write. One author is a professor of history and the other is a climate scientist. It seems pretty sensible. And it's got a lot of stuff about Robert Jastrow. I want to find out more about him."" I'd been interested in Jastrow ever since I'd read God and the Astronomers a few years ago; as far as I was concerned, this was the decisive argument. We added it to the already considerable pile of books we'd decided to purchase and went over to the cash desk.I've now finished Merchants of Doubt; despite Not's impressive ability to judge a book by its cover, acquired from decades of work in the book business, I'm prepared to say that this is one of the rare occasions where I got it right and she got it wrong. Oreskes and Conway live up to their advance billing and have produced a worthwhile addition to the climate change debate which doesn't just recap all the pro-climate-change books you've already seen. If you're the least bit interested in these matters, you're strongly advised to read it.Why? Well, let's cut to the chase and address Not's sensible question: what reasons do we have for assuming that it isn't seriously biased? There are now a good many books out arguing both sides of the story, with some saying that climate change is a proven fact and others saying that it's mistaken alarmism. There are basically three positions you can take: either the pro-climate-change people are right, or the climate change skeptics are right, or we don't really know. Given that it's all about complex science that only a few experts really understand and there seems to be a great deal of disagreement, there's a strong temptation to go for the third alternative. Oreskes and Conway, however, come down unequivocally in favor of the first one. Why should we trust them?Most of the pro-climate-change books I've previously seen argue it in terms of the science, and you can indeed make a good case there; but, unfortunately, the skeptics also seem to be able to make a good case, at least if you're not an expert. Oreskes and Conway talk a good deal about the science, which is of course essential, but they focus at least as much on the history and the people. Where, exactly, do the climate skeptic arguments come from? Who has been advancing them? Do the people concerned have any obvious reason for advancing them? It turns out that this is a fruitful line of investigation, and the results of following it up systematically are both interesting and rather horrifying. The core opposition to the notion of climate change comes from a small group of influential American scientists, of whom the most important were Robert Jastrow (the guy who first attracted my attention), Fred Seitz, William Nierenberg and Fred Singer. They had extremely good contacts at the highest levels of the US military-industrial-political complex, right up to Presidential level. What makes the evidence against them so damning is that they pursued a consistent, well-documented pattern of behavior in blocking and obfuscating government intervention in a number of contentious issues. They began with links between smoking and cancer, where they successfully delayed anti-smoking legislation for decades, both with regard to active and passive smoking. Later, they shifted to other, more explicitly environmental questions: acid rain, damage to the ozone layer and most recently climate change. Their modus operandi was all cases substantially the same. In an area where there was an overwhelming scientific consensus in favor of a particular conclusion (smoking causes cancer; CFCs are destroying the ozone layer), they raised spurious doubts to make it appear that there was disagreement. They were often the only person in a committee disagreeing with an otherwise unanimous conclusion. They used their power and influence to rewrite reports so as to give undue weight to their views, which were then further amplified by the right-wing press. The newspaper accounts were often so distorted that the original scientific findings had almost disappeared. Corrections and retractions were published in scientific journals and websites, but the public did not read them; when angry letters were sent to the newspapers that presented the incorrect reports, they were not accepted for publication. It turns out that it's quite easy to present the appearance of a scientific debate when in fact there is none. Oreskes and Conway say that most journalists they've talked to have initially been unwilling to believe that they could been fooled so easily into thinking they were being fair in presenting both sides of a debate, where one side is in fact an artificial fabrication. They've been shocked to see the comprehensive documentary evidence the authors spent five years collecting; all of this is on record if you know where to look. There are dozens of pages of footnotes for people who wish to track down the sources themselves.Why would anyone do such a thing? What was the motivation? Here, again, Oreskes and Conway have a depressingly plausible answer. Jastrow, Seitz, Nierenberg and Singer weren't evil. They didn't do it primarily for money, even though they did receive a fair amount of money from various interested parties. Mostly, it seems, they were driven by ideology. They had a strong, unreasoning faith in the importance of free market economics, which led them to believe that any government interference was bad and that anyone promoting government interference was bad. When this began to include scientists who discovered things that made government inference necessary, they concluded that those scientists were bad. In the end, when almost the whole scientific community was ranged against them, they logically took the last step: science itself had become bad, since it opposed the free market.The ultimate irony is that the scientists in question, who so strongly believed in the power of the free market, themselves spent nearly their whole careers working for the government; they were employed by NASA, the nuclear weapons program or other US government agencies. They said that every important technological advance had come from free enterprise in response to market forces, when a brief study of the relevant history would have immediately shown them they were wrong. Modern machine tools, which gave the US its technological lead, were painstakingly developed over fifty years by a government program. The nuclear and space technology they themselves worked on was all created by the government.Once again, we see a variation on the central theme of the 20th century: powerful people with fanatical, non-evidence-based beliefs are very dangerous. Read this book, it'll help you understand what's actually going on._____________________________The rogerebert.com review of the movie suggests both that it's very good and that it contains a lot of material not in the book. I look forward to seeing it as soon as I get an opportunity - so far, it hasn't been playing anywhere we've been._____________________________[Update, Apr 21 2017]I just read a scary article from Scientific American. This passage was particularly memorable:House Science Chairman Lamar Smith (R-Texas) has routinely accused federal agencies of fraud if he does not like their scientific conclusions. Smith told the crowd, to a raucous cheer, that he would be open to crafting legislation that would punish scientific journals that publish studies that don’t meet his standards of peer review, which he did not define.“The days of trust-me science are over,” Smith said."
1,1596916109,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10762842-nicole-r,4,"I am a scientist. I have a PhD in biological sciences and spent the vast majority of my 20's studying the impacts of a marine invasives species and how climate change facilitates the spread of these non-native species. I hold research scientists in high regard even though my career path has ventured down a different path. For a few years I worked on The Hill where science was politicized and attacked, and now I work with the general public as I struggle to get the average person to understand and accept climate change.One thing in all of my work that I have noticed is that science is under attack. As a scientist, I understand that peer-review, empirical research is hard to understand. It is detailed, involves complicated stats, is written in what seems like a different language, and...have you met a scientist lately? Most of us are awkward, not eloquent, and cannot communicate with people who do not have a doctorate in our exact field. (I like to think I am the exception to that rule but I may just be dilusional). And, all of these things are fine, it doesn't make the science wrong. But somewhere along the way, it has become the defensive trend to attack science itself. To attack people who take pride in their work, are neutral by nature, don't make a lot of money, and live their lives chained to their desks in an endless cycle of writing grants, conducting research, and publishing peer-reviewed papers all for the love of science. Because they have a desire to investigate our our world, environment, and bodies work. Because they are curious individuals. I find it incredibly frustrating and aggravating. Especially when it comes to something like climate change that 97% of climate scientists believe is happening and it is because of human inputs. In fact, the scientific community never even really talks about it because it is a given. Yet, those 3% of scientists, who do not agree for a number of reasons, seem to spin popular media so it seems like the issue of climate change is not scientifically settled. Why is this? Who is pushing this anti-climate change agenda?I heard Naomi Oreskes speak at my graduate school back in 2008 (or maybe it was 2009. Years blur) and she was great. She spoke about how science regarding a number of issues - SDI, smoking, DDT, second-hand smoke, acid rain, the ozone hole - have been attacked for decades. And really by the same handful of people. I instantly wanted to read her book on these exact topics.Well, like acceptance of science by the general public, it took me a while to get to it.I thought this book would be informative, maybe even help me with my current job, but what I wasn't expecting was for it to be so riveting. The Case Against Science is a well-funded, well-organized, media blitz and poor scientists don't stand a chance (nor to they really want to be in the fray). The burden of proof is on apolitical scientists and attacks are made by people who do not understand the scientific process, what peer-review entails, or the complicated issue of scientific uncertainty. Only recently has climate change become accepted by the general public (something the science community has been saying for over 20 years now) and you even have traditional climate deniers backing away from their previous stance.(Did you know in science NOTHING is certain? Seriously. Gravity is a theory. Nothing can be known 100% because we cannot possibly know the outcome over every single test from now until infinity under circumstances that we may not even be able to foresee. Replication and corroboration limits the margin of error, but you will never find a legitimate scientist saying that something is 100% true. It is the nature of science.)This is not to say that the application of this science to policy decisions does not come with real world ramifications. Social, economic, and political concerns come into play when actions are discussed and solutions are implemented. However, none of these concerns invalidate the science itself nor are they so complicated that they demand a no-action alternative. You rarely find a research scientist making a policy recommendation or advocating for specific actions. To them, that is not their area of expertise and they leave it to the people that work in those realms as they blink in the sudden sunlight, grab an extra large coffee, and slink back to their labs to continue writing stats programming for their latest data.If you want to know a bit more about how science is conducted and how peer-review is conducted along with a little insight to the scientific research culture, then this book is a way to whet your appetite without being too boring or technical. Fair warning: this book reports on science. Acid rain does occur. CFCs caused a hole in the ozone layer. Smoking and second hand smoke kills. Climate change is happening. As a scientist, these things are no longer debated on a large scale in my profession.And, I will leave you with a quote from the book:All scientific work is incomplete - whether it be observational or experimental. All scientific work is liable to be upset or modified by advancing knowledge. That does not confer upon us a freedom to ignore the knowledge we already have, to postpone action that it appears to demand at a given time."
2,1596916109,http://goodreads.com/user/show/175635-trevor,5,"Impossible to recommend this one too highly. A testament to the power of cognitive dissonance, is my reading of this. This is the story of a group of physicists who helped to build the atomic bomb to help defend free enterprise. Unlike many of those who worked with them on this project (that later went on to see the bomb as the world’s greatest threat to our continued existence and therefore who tried to remove this threat by then working to ban the bomb) they spent the rest of their careers talking about ‘winnable’ nuclear wars and dismissing 'nuclear winter' as typical of commie fellow travellers and 'watermelons' - people who are green on the outside, but red on the inside. Being indoctrinated with free market ideology is a dangerous thing, as any ideology tends to be. In this case it took a group of scientists (and not just scientist, but physicists, for god's sake) and turned them into anti-scientists. Money has many abilities, and this surely must be one of its least attractive.In the name of ‘freedom of choice’ these scientist protested against the mounting evidence that smoking causes cancer, then against acid rain, then against the cancer risks of silicon breast implants, global warming and ozone depletion. They even accuse Silent Spring of causing more deaths than Hitler - what sort of scum-bag would you need to be?It is hard to imagine what it must feel like to look back on your life’s ‘achievements’ and see that litany of lies.The importance of doubt – particularly as a scientific and a philosophic concept – is hard to over stress. But like any other concept, it can be abused. This book documents some of the most outrageous abuses of doubt – doubt based on deceit to further self-interest. It is hard not to come away from this book despising the central characters. As someone who is becoming increasingly interested in research it is interesting to see how, as Dylan might say, dirt covers up the truth with lies.This book does not make for an enjoyable read (it will make your blood boil, in fact), but it is an important book and one everyone should read."
3,1596916109,http://goodreads.com/user/show/53209373-simon-clark,5,"One of the absolutely essential reads on climate change and quite how we got into the mess of denialism at the very highest level of government that we're in today. In a sentence, the book documents the same playbook used by various industries from tobacco to foster doubt in the minds of consumers, allowing these industries to continue operating. It is an incredibly frustrating, depressing read and a cautionary tale about the power of unchecked information and unchecked capitalism. As well as a few unchecked 'scientists'. It's also fantastically researched and clearly written work that should serve as a gold standard for anyone writing about the history of climate or policy. There are well-characterised individuals who come up again and again, and does an exceptionally good job of explaining some complicated science. Every part of this book is impressive. Everyone should read it."
4,1596916109,http://goodreads.com/user/show/155663-david,5,"This is a truly impressive book. The subtitle really says it all; ""How a handful of scientists obscured the truth on issues from tobacco smoke to global warming"". The authors did an immense amount of research, revealing how and why a small group of scientists had such a powerful, and negative impact on important issues. The issues were: the danger of cigarette smoke, strategic defense, acid rain, secondhand smoke, the ozone hole, global warming, and the recent vilification of Rachel Carson. The authors present a very comprehensive and persuasive case. Several scientists who established their excellent reputations during the Cold War had very strong views about Capitalism, the importance of the free market, and that all regulation is bad. Therefore, in their views, the EPA (Environmental Protection Agency) had to be stopped; they believed that the EPA issues regulations that take the country toward socialism, one step away from Communism.These scientists used their reputations to publish in the non-scientific press, to present their side of each regulatory issue. Often, their opinions were not objective, as they were partially funded by foundations that were funded by industries (like tobacco, CFC, mining, defense, oil and transportation). They were physicists, and they were not experts in these fields. But their reputations were strong enough to give them a strong foothold in the popular press and with politicians. They often misrepresented the facts, distorted the science, and generally gave the impression that the issues were controversial, even when the vast majority of scientists had long ago reached nearly unanimous opinions. They tried to vilify outstanding scientists, falsely accusing them of the very tactics that they themselves were guilty of.I strongly recommend this book to all citizens. People need to understand how the very same deceptive tactics are repeated over and over again, for each regulatory issue. People need to understand that science never gives a 100% proof of anything. Science is based on peer reviews and scientist community consensus. The popular press is usually not subject to objective reviews, and often tries to present ""both sides"" of a scientific issue. However, it is often the case that there is only one side to the science, and the ""other side"" is a purely political agenda."
5,1596916109,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3357765-jimmy,5,"I would first like to comment on the idea that a ""small group of people"" caused all of this. I think that is misleading, and the subtitle of the book is misleading. Here is a list of just some people and groups that I think help all of these attacks on science and reason to happen:1. Corporations like Phillip Morris, Exxon, Monsanto, Dow Chemical. The list can go on. I say those names and I am stunned by what appears to me the total greed and lack of morality they can exhibit. I belong to a Vietnam veterans group, and I have heard grown men cry about agent orange. Yet the companies responsible still claim there is no connection between agent orange and cancer.2. Powerful individuals like the Koch brothers, the Murdochs, Rush Limbaugh, and the Hunt brothers.3. Media outlets like the Wall Street Journal, Fox News, National Review, and just about all of talk radio.4. Just about the entire Republican party and any Democrat that can be bought with a healthy campaign donation. Mitch McConnell, the senate Republican leader from Kentucky, is in the back pocket of the coal companies. If it were up to people like that, there would be no regulations on coal companies and the energy they produce. What do we ever intend to do about toxic sludge dumps?https://earthjustice.org/features/map...5. Evangelical Christians who home school their children and teach them the earth is 6,000 years old. One short step from that to disbelieving all of science.6. Powerful groups like the Heritage Foundation, Heartland Institute, American Enterprise Institute, National Rifle Association, Americans for Prosperity, American Legislative Exchange Council, Cato Institute. The most ironic one is Americans for Prosperity. Folks, there won't be any prosperity for anyone as climate change gets worse. 7. And need I mention ignorant voters.I could go on with my list, but I think you get the point. On pages 64 to 65, Milton Friedman's book Capitalism and Freedom is discussed briefly. In my mind, Mr. Friedman has done enormous damage to the economy, the environment, and the government. By defending unfettered capitalism, he influenced countless numbers of true believers who are more powerful than ever. What people like Friedman seem to ignore are the ""unintended consequences"" of the free market and the ""potential remedy--regulation."" This seems to me to be at the heart of the problem we face today. Four names need to be placed into the science Hall of Shame:1. Fred Singer2. Fred Seitz3. Bill Nierenberg 4. Robert Jastrow All four are a disgrace to science. My newest additions to the Science Hall of Shame: 5. Phillip E. Johnson 6. Michael Behe 7. Thomas Woodward An important point about science in the book is that science truly began in the 1600s when groups of scientists started to form. Individual scientists like Darwin and Newton were important of course, but it is the groups with their peer reviews that are critical. We must listen to them. They do boring, painstaking work. It is published in scientific journals. They are telling us that it is time to pay the bill for the industrial revolution that had us all living like pigs in a trough. Those days must change. I believe this book should be read by all intelligent people who care about science and about the future of our world."
6,1596916109,http://goodreads.com/user/show/793473-clif-hostetler,4,"I used to believe that selling one's soul to the devil was something that only happened in fictional stories. This book makes it clear that it's a real life option for credentialed scientists who accept salaries and research grants from businesses with interests in obfuscating the truth by covering it with questions. The book provides a history of the battle between economic interests versus health and environmental interests. The topics covered by the book are well summarized by the seven chapter titles:1. Doubt Is Our Product, 2. Strategic Defense, Phony Facts, and the Creation of the George C. Marshall Institute 3. Sowing the Seeds of Doubt: Acid Rain 4. Constructing a Counternarrative: The Fight over the Ozone Hole 5. What's Bad Science? Who Decides? The Fight over Secondhand Smoke 6. The Denial of Global Warming7. Denial Rides Again: the Revisionist Attack on Rachel CarsonScience by its very nature is vulnerable to obfuscation by asking questions about uncertainty. But the word uncertainty in the context of science has a different meaning from the way it's used in common vernacular. In cases where the evidence would be judged ""beyond a reasonable doubt"" in a court of law, the news media interprets additional questioning as a sign that the no consensus has been reached. Some of the histories covered by this book are pretty well resolved even though there are still fringe commentators who claim they weren't problems in the first place. However, global warming still remains the universal joke punch line in some circles (tag ""it's caused by global warming"" at the end of any story, and it's guaranteed to cause laughter by the deniers). Ever wonder why the United States has failed to act on global warming?""There are many reasons why the United States has failed to act on global warming, but at least one is the confusion raised by Bill Nierenberg, Fred Seitz, and Fred Singer.""All three of these individuals are physicists who have never done peer reviewed research in fields related to meteorology or climate modeling. Singer was a rocket scientist. Nierenberg and Seitz worked on the atomic bomb. The book indicates that small numbers of people such as these have had significant influence on popular perception of the issue of global warming. Consequently public opinion concludes that scientific consensus has not been reached leading to the stalling of policy making. "
7,1596916109,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6816078-maru-kun,5,"The story begins, where else, with smoking - that ur-science denial project which spawned many of the weapons of modern-day sowing of doubt. Amazingly denying the dangers of smoking is a project which still lumbers on in dark corners of the developing world hiding from the scrutiny of western media.The story moves on to acid rain, then passive smoking, ozone depletion and - one I wasn't expecting - a born-again denialist program praising the long forgotten benefits to human wellbeing of DDT.But this is all just warm up for the mother of science denial projects, climate change, which the authors remind us ""..strikes at the very root of economic activity: the use of energy…"" and which might be the last battle for scientific truth ever fought.While good fights evil in the climate change debate new science denial projects, the toxic fusion of vested interests and shady PR companies, ooze their pollution into the scientific world as swiftly and penetratingly as the run-off from a Koch brothers mine.Deniers are opening a new front in their war against truth with the claim that sugar and processed foods have nothing to do with obesity. This New York Times article is the latest report from the trenches.Sadly the denialists' weapons are getting ever more sophisticated. In those heady early days of defending tobacco we had groups like the ""Tobacco Industry Research Committee""; including ""Industry"" in the title shows a charming naivety that no longer exists today.Now we have the cleverly named ""Global Energy Balance Foundation"" - a front group for soft drinks companies whose mission is to remind us that, if lazy slobs like you and I spent most of our waking hours in the gym, then we would have no trouble burning off the calories from the sugar laced foods and drinks which advertisers force down our throats every day.Denying science only works for as long as you can deny reality. Sooner or later reality catches up.""Merchants of Doubt"" lets us see how the denialists' arguments become more refined as reality piles up the evidence against them. For example, an early salvo of climate change denial was the claim that human migration would allow the peoples of the world to avoid its worst effects. These days, when we can see the problems caused by a fraction of the refugees that would be created by climate change as they try to cross the Mediterranean into Europe, such facile arguments have been quietly dropped.Nowadays the latest tactic in the battle over climate change is for US politicians to proudly boast about their ignorance, saying that they can't make any climate policies because ""we are not scientists"". This is accepted by the media, who don't seem to wonder why their elected representatives lack the personal initiative to phone their scientific advisors and take some advice.The smoking deniers delayed adoption of anti-smoking measures by a couple of decades. Such a delay I doubt caused more than a few tens of millions of unnecessary early deaths. Climate change deniers must have a few decades in front of them before reality catches up, although if phenomenon such as the Californian drought continue much longer reality may catch up that bit sooner.Sadly for our children and grand-children climate change may be an irreversible, discontinuous process causing human suffering orders of magnitude greater than ever caused by tobacco. I hope there is a special circle in hell for climate change deniers and their facilitators.Although this book tells you the history of science denial it doesn't aim to give you the nitty-gritty details of how such knavery is carried out. For this you need a book on public relations and I would recommend Toxic Sludge is Good For You.Here is an example from that book of the cynicism of the PR industry that will make you fear for the future of the human values of honesty and integrity.Many thinking people know that the PR companies have units that set up fake ""grass roots"" campaigns (""astro-turf"" campaigns) intended to pressurize politicians.But did you imagine there are even companies that specialize in telephoning round to try and find individuals who they can groom with a few ""grass roots"" opinions on a topic? These companies then conference-call their mark through to the relevant politician's phone while dropping off the line. And this book was written back in 1995 - just imagine how worse things must be today.So where are we now? We have Senator Inhofe, head of the U.S. Senate Committee on the Environment and Public Works, bringing a snowball onto the Senate Floor as evidence that anthropogenic climate change is a hoax, demonstrating to any scientist watching a level of ignorance so deep it cannot understand the difference between ""weather"" and ""climate"". This brings me close to despair.Although science denialists may win a few of their battles against the truth, reality will ultimately win the war. We can only hope that victory comes soon enough to allow us to repair the damage the denialists will have caused."
8,1596916109,http://goodreads.com/user/show/18622-doug,3,"Lawyer Doug thinks: What's the big deal? As much as the authors try to spin it, the science on a lot of these issues were not definitively settled at the time. These people that the book villify - and this book is pretty venomous in its portrayal of some of the characters - are advocating a position and are using facts to frame their argument. This book make is seem like the global warming advocates are innocent and blameless, but they use the same tactics of massaging science to get their message across. The science behind global warming, pollution, and cancer are enormously complicated, and both sides try to reduce all this to sound bites papatable to the public, no one has a monopoly on spewing out junk science. This is all much ado about nothing. Engineer Doug thinks: Something stinks here. These scientists were physicists, and they don't necessarily have the credentials to be experts on pollution, tobacco, and global warming. If you follow the money, it leads to big corporations and think tanks that have a huge interest in advocating certain positions, and wouldn't you know it, these scientist come to exactly those conclusions. All their work seems to be a campaign to cover up the dirty little secret of capitalism:[U]nrestricted commercial activity was doing damage – real, lasting, pervasive damage. . . . To acknowledge this was to acknowledge the soft underbelly of free market capitalism: that free enterprise can bring real costs – profound costs – that the free market does not reflect. . . . This is the common thread that ties these diverse issues together: they were all market failures. They are instances where serious damage was done and the free market seemed unable to account for it, much less prevent it. Government intervention was required. This is why free market ideologues and old Cold Warriors joined together to fight them. Accepting that by-products of industrial civilization were irreparably damaging the global environment was to accept the reality of market failure. It was to acknowledge the limits of free market capitalism.I like Engineer Doug better. Maybe I should update my resume. "
9,1596916109,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2511892-w-littlejohn,4,"This immensely important and timely book demands attention from anyone determined to think critically and intelligently about the current interface of politics, economics, and science, which one might describe as the three gods of our time. The book is not flawless, to be sure. As a complete layman in such issues, I can detect certain ideological flaws, which I shall come to in due course, and it is hard not to think that the authors present a somewhat one-sided perspective on a highly contentious issue, and that their opponents would have rather more to say for themselves than Conway and Oreskes imply. Indeed, in such matters, it is always essential to keep Proverbs 18:17 in mind: ""The one who states his case first seems right, until the other comes and examines him."" Nonetheless, from what I know of the world, and from the compellingness of the narrative set forth in this book, I am for now provisionally convinced that their basic picture is accurate. This picture, it turns out, is considerably more complex and interesting than I had expected when I picked up the book. The basic gist I thought I knew: climate change denial is largely funded by Big Oil and industries with a vested interest in staving off any policy shifts in a green direction. The science is being corrupted by greed. And, should you be skeptical of such cynicism, just look at how Big Tobacco did the same thing in the 60s—and the 70s and 80s and 90s, for that matter; doubt is a highly durable product, it seems. A sordid story, but alas, a somewhat believable one. Yet, such a story has the troubling consequence of making scientists look like they're for sale to the highest bidder. If Big Tobacco and Big Oil could simply bribe scientists into distorting the facts, then why should the moral of this story be ""Trust the scientists,"" as it must be for climate change orthodoxy? Thankfully, Conway and Oreskes's story is, as I said, considerably more complex, and on reflection, more disturbing.  The denial of climate change and the denial of the dangers of smoking do not merely share links to big business; they (and the denial of the ozone hole, of acid rain, of nuclear winter fears, of the dangers of DDT, etc., all covered in this book as well) share something more insidious—a blind faith in markets, technology, and progress. In each of the doubt-sowing narratives that Conway and Oreskes survey, they find a very small cast of lead actors, chief among whom are a cadre of high-profile Cold War physicists, Frederick Seitz, Fred Singer, and Bill Nierenberg. It was Frederick Seitz, at that time aged 84 and retired from active scientific work for 17 years, who penned the damning public slander of Ben Santer and his chapter of the first IPCC report on climate change in 1995, after having spent most of the 1980s supervising contrarian research on behalf of the tobacco industry. Of course, the very fact that the same few names keep cropping up again and again, in radically different contexts, is enough to raise a few eyebrows as to whether we are dealing with real scientific opposition or some kind of conspiracy. (Admittedly, it may well be that the authors overemphasize somewhat these few main characters so as to make the contrarian community seem smaller than it really is; however, they do not seem to be incorrect in assigning a leading role to these figures.) How many solid-state physicists, after all, can claim to be experts on oncology, the effect of acidity on ecosystems, and the distribution of heat in the earth's atmosphere? And indeed, part of the burden of the book is to show how just a few well-connected, sufficiently outspoken, and somewhat unscrupulous scientists can create the illusion of a whole community of scientific dissent. They note how a credulous and naive media and public is often willing to credit the testimony of any leading scientist as a relevant expert, even if his expertise is in another field entirely, as if an expert plumber could settle a controversy on the best way to construct the roof, just because he's involved in the homebuilding industry. Why is it that these physicists should be so determined to attack environmental concern wherever it should arise? It is here that Conway and Oreskes are at their best, subtly and insightfully introducing us to the Cold War mindset that drove these men. They were all formed within that black-and-white view of the world, capitalism vs. communism, freedom vs. statism. And for them, as for so many hawks of that era, superior technological innovation was the means by which freedom would triumph. Seitz and Nierenberg both got their start working on the Manhattan Project, and were heavily involved in subsequent weapons-development research in the early Cold War, as was Singer. Not only did this early work help set their ideological trajectory in a hard-right direction, but it also catapulted them to positions of remarkable political influence, which they maintained. (Oreskes and Conway wish to leave us in no doubt that when it comes to the charge that our politicians are being manipulated by influential insider climate change alarmists, the shoe is most definitely on the other foot.) Since most of the rising concerns about the harmful effects of certain industries on health and environment necessarily implied the need for government regulation of those industries, men like Seitz, Singer, and Nierenberg thought they spotted a Red agenda at the heart of the Green movement. Dedicated as they were to the freedom of capitalist industry and to a confidence that technology was our savior, they bitterly resisted the implications that capitalist industrial technology might be harming the planet and might call for government intervention. In the Reagan era, such convictions easily won the day on issues such as acid rain, whatever the vast majority of the scientific community might say, and those who held them gained established footholds of influence.  Conway and Oreskes also draw close attention to the strategy behind all this anti-environmental science. The objective, most of the time, has not been to directly deny the various claims of harm being advanced. The tobacco industry spent little time trying to prove that smoking was fine for you, and Singer and Nierenberg did not try to claim that acid rain was harmless. Rather, their product was doubt. The point was always to persuade the public that, yes, there might be a problem, but there was so much we didn't know that we couldn't be quite sure what its origin was, how serious it was, and what the best solution might be. The downsides of our current course, then, were uncertain. Accompanying this was the argument that the upsides of our current course were obvious, or the downsides to changing our present course were quite clear and certain, and certain to be serious. As a delaying tactic, this argument served the tobacco industry astonishingly well. Would-be smokers could be reassured that, although they couldn't be sure one way or another of the science surrounding the safety of cigarettes, at least they could be sure that they really enjoyed smoking them, and it was probably worth a little risk. Juries could be persuaded, for more than forty years after the extremely carcinogenic effects of smoking had been scientifically demonstrated, that there was still enough uncertainty to render the tobacco companies legally immune. Again, Conway and Oreskes insightfully show how psychology can lead us astray here. We tend to fall prey to short-term thinking, willing to face future risks for the sake of present enjoyment, and disposed to always prefer the known (what we are already doing) to the unknown (any proposed change), assessing the latter as riskier than the former, even when the evidence clearly suggests otherwise. (Many of the contrarian scientists described in this book were clearly driven by this kind of thinking, particularly those with a particular interest in economics. The economic costs of environmental protection, they felt, were so high as to outweigh the evidence of future harms.) These psychological tendencies are if anything even more true on the social level than the individual. What this means is that anyone claiming that we must stop the enjoyable things we are doing in order to avert future or unseen calamities, and must start ordering our lives in different ways, has to meet a very high burden of proof indeed to be listened to. Our political leaders, who are supposed to take the future into account and thus make these difficult decisions for us, are unfortunately just as much the slaves of short-term thinking. Economic growth in the present, not environmental protection in the future, is what is likely to win them their next election. The merchants of doubt, then, have a comparatively easy task. All they have to show is that there is enough uncertainty in the science that perhaps we had better sit back and wait for more evidence before committing ourselves to a costly change of direction, or, heaven forbid, sacrificing our freedom to government bureaucrats.Unfortunately, it is extraordinarily easy to prove uncertainty in the science, because all science is always uncertain. Conway and Oreskes are refreshingly upfront about this, and criticize the outdated positivistic view of science that imagines that science ""proves"" facts with logical certainty. Even when the basic facts are well-established (though never absolutely proven), there exist all sorts of details that still need to be worked out, and ongoing scientific work will of course be dedicated toward investigating these remaining areas of uncertainty. Anyone with a dedicated agenda of skepticism, then, will have no difficulty in finding evidence of uncertainty and debate in the current scientific literature, even when there is a firmly established consensus about the key points. Moreover, given that the front lines of scientific work are so far beyond the ken of the average citizen, it is easy for him to be duped into treating as equally authoritative the testimony of popularizers and think tanks with some kind of scientific credentials. When we look at this cacophony of voices and see evidence of widespread disagreement, we shrug our shoulders and say, ""Who are we to believe?""  So what is to be done about this? Conway and Oreskes suggest some answers in their epilogue, pointing out how many areas of our day-to-day in which we recognize the need to trust experts and act on their advice, despite the inevitable uncertainty. They conclude""So it comes to this: we must trust our scientific experts on matters of science, because there isn't a workable alternative. And because scientists are not (in most cases) licensed, we need to pay attention to who the experts actually are—by asking questions about their credentials, their past and current research, the venues in which they are subjecting their claims to scrutiny, and the sources of financial support they are receiving. If the scientific community has been asked to judge a matter . . . then it makes sense to take the results of their investigations very seriously. . . . Sensible decision making involves acting on the information we have, even while accepting that it may well be imperfect and our decisions may need to be revisited and revised in light of new information. For even if modern science does not give us certainty, it does have a robust track record . . . modern science gives us a pretty decent basis for action. . . .""Don't get us wrong. Scientists have no special purchase on moral or ethical decisions; a climate scientist is no more qualified to comment on health care reform than a physicist is to judge the causes of bee colony collapse. The very fathers that create expertise in a specialized domain lead to ignorance in many others. . . . So our trust needs to be circumscribed, and focused. It needs to be very particular. Blind trust will get us into at least as much trouble as no trust at all. But without some degree of trust in our designated experts . . . we are paralyzed, in effect not knowing whether to make ready for the morning commute or not. . . . C.P. Snow once argued that foolish faith in authority is the enemy of truth. But so is a foolish cynicism. . . . We close with the comments of S.J. Green, director of research for British American Tobacco, who decided, finally, that what his industry had done was wrong, not just morally, but also intellectually: 'A demand for scientific proof is always a formula for inaction and delay, and usually the first reaction of the guilty. The proper basis for such decisions is, of course, quite simply that which is reasonable in the circumstances.""In other words, we need to accept that painful, costly public policy decisions will have to be taken on the basis of uncertainty. In fact, they always are, for economic projections about the future (perhaps the most frequent basis for public policy) are at least as uncertain as scientific ones. If the consequences of inaction appear sufficiently serious and probable, the prudent ruler (and the prudent society) will begin to undertake corrective action even while acknowledging the possibility that subsequent research will reveal such action unnecessary; better safe than sorry.  My one major misgiving about the book: despite their attempts to demystify the scientific enterprise, and acknowledge that it is human, all too human, not blessed with some special gift of infallibility, it is hard not to feel that the authors continue to speak of ""the halls of science"" in somewhat reverential tones. Scientists are repeatedly eulogized as pure uncorrupt seekers after truth, even while a few contrarian scientists are shown to be quite the opposite. But of course, if Seitz, Singer, Nierenberg, and others could let their ideology and the interests of their benefactors get in the way of doing honest and objective science, who's to say that most other scientists are immune to this. Conway and Oreskes do enough to suggest, I think, that the accusations that climate alarmists are acting out of self-interest or political ideology are a case of the pot calling the kettle black; however, that doesn't mean that the kettle may not be black as well. I have no doubt that most climate scientists are conscientious researchers who do their utmost to be objective and avoid unnecessary alarmism. But not all, and not always. The authors always speak of ""peer review"" the same way that Catholics speak of ""Our Holy Father,"" and it irks me just the same way. Peer review is certainly better than the lack thereof, but it's no magic epistemological bullet. Scientists, like anyone else, are subject to the herd instinct, to confirmation bias, and sometimes to something as prosaic as mere laziness. After just a couple years in academia, I have seen enough of the failings of the peer review process in theological studies to be skeptical that it could work as perfectly in scientific studies as many seem to think.  So pardon me for still being something of a skeptic about the reliability of mainstream scientific opinion at any given time. That said, I concede the overall point Conway and Oreskes are trying to make—you can't refuse to act just because there will always be grounds for skepticism. Mainstream science may be riddled with errors, but when the stakes are high enough, you've got to make decisions based on the best resources available to you, and until God deigns to issue an oracle telling us the truth about climate change and the best solution to it, we'd best pay attention to the scientists."
10,1596916109,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6237864-nandakishore-varma,0,"On another internet forum I used to frequent, there was a hot argument whether science was ""good"" or ""bad"". Two or three members were convinced about the inherent ""badness"" of science - they were great believers in metaphysics and spirituality. Another member and I were arguing for the inherent value neutrality of science.There was one guy who was pro-science, but vehemently against value-neutrality. He argued that science, unless inherently coupled with ethics, is bad. While I appreciated this as a political position, I was highly sceptical about its practicality. I mean, e=mc2 can create both electricity and the nuclear bomb - it is inherently neutral as far as moral values are concerned.Reading about this book, however, bought home to me the fact that science has got an intrinsic value - it has to be the search for truth. The scientist has to be committed to it. Otherwise, it means that the scientist has sold his soul to the devil (I mean, corporate interests)."
11,1596916109,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5843790-tim-o-neill,5,"This Australian summer's bushfire catastrophe brought with it a deluge of climate change denialism in the press, on some TV commentary, from certain politicians (with a lot of weasel words from others) and, particularly, on social media. Long debunked claims, distorted misinformation, cherry picked data and error-laden memes were spread far and wide, supposedly ""debunking"" the expert assessment that the unprecedented fires and attendant drought were substantially driven by climate change. My frustration at seeing this nonsense being pushed by bot armies, full time contrarians and culture warriors and, in many cases, accepted uncritically by far too many Australians motivated me to start tracing back where these arguments came from and the origin and source of climate denialism in the face of the scientific consensus.This led me to finally read Oreskes and Conway's book, which I first put on my mental ""to read"" pile a decade ago. With meticulous care, the authors use their skills as historians and archival researchers to uncover the decades long history of not just climate change denial, but a whole interconnected anti-science campaign by political ideologues determined to defend unregulated business practices and laissez-faire capitalism at any cost. The power of this ideology is such that what has become a virtual crusade against science itself has been, ironically, substantially driven by a few contrarian scientists with a political agenda.The authors show that the tactics used today by climate change deniers were developed and honed in previous skirmishes between these laissez-faire capitalist fundamentalists and scientific reality. Beginning with the tobacco lobby's attempts to stall any restrictions on their industry in the face of a clear consensus on the deadly effects of tobacco in the 1960s, the authors show that exactly the same tactics were used to dispute the effects of DDT, deny the causes of acid rain and obfuscate the origin of the hole in the Ozone Layer. Not only this, but they show that it was often the same contrarian ideologues in the scientific sphere who drove each of these campaigns of misinformation or eagerly lent their reputations (usually in unrelated scientific fields) to their cause. Over and over again the same names come up - Robert Jastrow, Fred Seitz, William Nierenberg and Fred Singer - who along with some lesser fellow travellers, spent decades creating an illusion of doubt on these subjects, bamboozling the media into thinking there was good reason not to act in any way that might restrict big businesses' capacity to make profits at the expense of human health, well-being and the environment.The way these fanatics manipulated the media's obsession with ""showing both sides"" and the reason this ""balance"" idea doesn't work when it comes to science is a key theme in the book. What is depressing is that in the ten years since its publication, the media has not become much smarter on science issues and, unfortunately, scientists have not become much better at beating the contrarians by presenting the real story. But the most interesting element for me was the historical roots of the ideology that drives denialism to this day - the Cold War obsession with anything remotely like Communism, leading to a blind and wrongheaded embrace of its equally irrational and purely ideological polar opposite: the idea that untrammelled business and industry will inevitably produce the greatest possible good. The book shows that climate change denial is the latest and biggest lie in a sequence of lies that are driven by a poisonous ideology, funded by greedy plutocrats and their political creatures. Nothing much has changed, though events like the 2019-20 Australian bushfires are perhaps starting to make more people realise that the things we were warned about are now happening. This excellent book is a classic example of how understanding the past can help us understand the present and shape the future. By seeing how this toxic ideology arose and how its tactics developed, we may have some chance of fighting it before it's too late. "
12,1596916109,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3260895-stuart,4,"I'm giving this book an extra half star because I know one of the authors and I can read between the lines and see that her contributions are more circumspect and better thought out than the compromised version that ended up in this book. Merchants of Doubt is about the misuse of science by politicians. It's a very good, methodically researched introduction to how science gets twisted in the political process. Where this book loses credibility, however, is that it shows only one side of the story: the misuse of science by conservative politicians aided by conservative scientists. It happens on the other side as well.Don't believe me? Here's an example. When Obama came into office, Steven Chu, his Nobel Prize winning DOE head, suspended work on storing high-level radioactive waste storage at Yucca Mountain. Obama has publicly made claims that the safety of the site is not supported by the science. Actually, the science shows it to be a good site. The start of the entire ""Yucca Mountain is bad"" movement began with a long tome filled with theories that defied basic physics written by a single DOE employee. Environmentalists and Nevadans championed this tome. They became, using the title of this book, merchants of doubt.The best part of the book are the naked facts, most of which it gets right with wonderful detail. The worst part of the book is the venom and cattiness. The book overplays its hand again and again and tries to simplify in order to make what amounts to character assassinations about those it doesn't like. Some of these people died many years ago and of course, can't rebut the claims made. Some of the claims are inconsistent. Cheap foreshadowing is used - how these people supposedly act or look or talk - to make these people seem sinister. Just because someone has a different point of view does not make them inherently evil. Just because someone agrees with you does not make them a messiah incarnate. The book makes the claim that the same Cold War conservative warriors show up again and again to fight sound science related to environmental issues. That's not really true. It's certainly not the same people every time. Some die along the way. Others were children when this cabal supposedly started. Edward Teller fought for SDI, yes, but he wasn't involved in acid rain, second hand smoke, or global warming issues. Even the characterization of Reagan's motivation for SDI is given a sinister edge; the authors needed to do some more research on that end.In short there is a consistent and I believe ill conceived attempt to connect many many dots - some far apart, some close - together. The examples aren't all pertinent and some run counter to the thesis - acid rain legislation was actually passed under a Republican administration as was the Montreal protocol - of this book.Science is misused by politicians all the time. The trick of finding one scientist - qualified or not - to cast doubt on scientific consensus isn't something that just takes place with Republicans. Democrats do the same thing. This book, which has some excellent examples of this trick, would be far, far better if it shed its liberal bias and agenda - put aside the demonizing and paranoia - and just stuck to the facts.If you can get past all the venom and the looking at the world through a very liberal, environmentalist filter, there is a lot of wonderful material in this book. I don't think many people have that ability.There is another flaw in this book that I will only cursorily mention. In order to try to strengthen its arguments, it puts far too much faith in the value of environmental models and peer review. Models are highly flawed things. So is peer review. At times, the approach of the authors in extolling peer review sounds eerily like the language free marketeers use when discussing the ""invisible hand"" that supposedly corrects the economy. I only wish peer review and even scientific consensus were as rational as the authors' claim."

16,1596916109,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1345046-todd-martin,4,"Back in the 1970’s, in response to irrefutable evidence that tobacco smoke represented a significant health issue, anti-regulatory forces hit upon a successful strategy that was to become the template for all future fights. The tactic was to sow doubt and to foment uncertainty about the science as a means to prevent regulatory action. And it worked. Why is this approach so successful? Part of the answer lies in the public misunderstanding of science; what it is, and how it works. Science (in particular, science of emerging issues) is not a collection of proven facts, it is a body of knowledge that provides a better understanding of the world as the evidence accumulates. There is always more to learn about any topic, but this not a reason to conclude that action should not be taken in the absence of certainty. We do things every day in our lives based on the best evidence available, even if it is incomplete. A simple example would be choosing whether to purchase a piece of fruit. We use the data generated by sight, smell and touch to estimate the likelihood that the fruit is good and determine whether to buy it based on this evidence (which is anything but definitive). The anti-regulatory lobby takes advantage of the uncertainty that is present in each scientific discussion to argue against taking action. Even if this strategy ultimately fails (and it eventually does, time and time again), the delay that it creates is a victory in itself (tobacco was known to cause harm in the 1950’s, yet it was another two decades before the government finally began to institute regulations to protect the public from harm). Oreskes illustrates the history of this obfuscation using the examples of tobacco smoke, acid rain, ozone depletion, and second hand smoke as well as the current hot button issue of global warming. While is not surprising that the same arguments are recycled again and again as excuses for inaction, what is surprising is that it is often the very same people and institutions that are making them. Not surprisingly, it is ideology rather than the desire for good public policy that motivates these groups. They tend to be right-wing, free market fundamentalists who see government regulations of industries and practices that harm the public as a descent into Communism. While you may or may not agree with their ideology, their willingness to resort to deception, obfuscation, misdirection and outright falsehoods to further their agenda is something every truth-loving citizen should consider offensive. Unfortunately, given a public that is largely scientifically illiterate and unused to critical thinking, this strategy will continue to bear fruit and it is the rest of us that will pay the price."

It tells us about RJ Reynolds and how cigarettes ""don't"" cause cancer, George H W Bush working for Ronald Reagan and their SDI program which cost the US $60 billion on lies, how we were told that acid rain and ozone holes were not real, how secondhand smoke is a farce, DDT and insecticides were not harmful, and of course how Global Warming is not real according to ""certain"" scientists, Rush Limbaugh, newspapers, journalists and the White House.All of these things that the American people have been duped into believing is wrong.

19,1596916109,http://goodreads.com/user/show/974210-erik-graff,4,"A few years ago a diverse group of right-wingers affiliated with a variety of conservative and 'libertarian' think-tanks, corporations, foundations and publications attempted the take-over of America's sole liberal 'great books' school, Shimer College. Shimer is a small institution, but its charter, dating to the mid-19th century, is priceless and the whole notion of 'the Great Books' has traditionally attracted idealogues of the Right. Under two presidents, Rice and Lindsay, both arising from Republican administrations, the board of the ever-financially-strapped college was packed with similarly-minded persons (each of which had to contribute a minimum of $10k, several of whom were secretly funded by one Barry Seid, a reactionary industrialist) in any effort to change the direction of the school. Fortunately, the pattern was discerned, the plot exposed and publicized. The college was saved by a one vote margin in the board. Many of the same players figure prominently in this book about the ongoing efforts of what its authors call 'free market fundamentalists' to fight environmental science, ostensibly seen by them as a form of creeping socialism. Coincidentally, but unsurprisingly, such insights are often actually motivated by large sums provided by the corporations facing regulation, corporations such as the tobacco industries and the energy companies.Here in Chicago, home of Shimer College, the most notorious of these institutional mercenaries is The Heartland Foundation, the major funders of which are the self-same tobacco and energy corporations for whom the foundation publishes materials supporting smoking, attacking climate change science and those who worry about such things as second-hand smoke, acid rain, ozone depletion, radiation and the like."

But a doubt can dismantle the very same theory in just a few words.Science has always been at war - sometimes it challenges the ideology of the masses and in more recent years, it impacts profits of large organizations. Scientific history becomes important in this context to be documented and well circulated. The propaganda isn't against science, at least not always. The propaganda attacks the way a scientific theory is presented, the narration it takes, and that becomes enough for those with limited to basic knowledge to question the actual theory. Be it tobacco industry, auto industry, agriculture - there is always the other side that persists in denying effects of excess use of CFC, harmful chemicals used to protect crops, tobacco etc. The studies on these subject matters start as theories and observations which get peer reviewed, subject to discussions in international platforms and either gets a nod or flat out dismissal. The theories that stem from lobbying and propaganda don't always take this route. They enlist PR firms, lobbyists, journalists, media entities, politicians and even scientists. What started in 1960s in boardrooms and newspapers are now familiar mantra during political campaigns. In this day and age we have people saying ""I believe in science"". Belief? Science isn't a religion that warrants faith. Its based on proof; it gets accepted or rejected based on peer evaluation. It acknowledges the probability of being wrong with advancements in knowledge. But it doesn't mean you don't act upon or take precautions to the warning it currently poses. Not just scientists but all of us, as human race, are obligated towards ethical and moral decisions. It is in human nature to defy that to pursue a profit, a political or business agenda. Scientists are no exception to that. All we have to remember that our actions have direct consequences.

Contained within its pages is a careful analysis of how a handful of corporations and scientists distorted public understanding for their own narrow purposes.

I do wish the book had more explicitly pointed out the cost to the environment and human health caused by stirring up unnecessary doubt, especially on more settled issues such as smoking. I also disliked the authors’ conflating scientific method and political posturing. Unfortunately, science’s peer review process is not infallible, and casting it as if it is was an unnecessary weakness in the book’s analysis – especially when the authors themselves clearly explained how little research these so-called merchants of doubt performed on the contested issues. But those are very minor quibbles to what is an otherwise top-notch book. Highly recommended. "
24,1596916109,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4828849-michael-burnam-fink,5,"Merchants of Doubt reads like a case presented by the prosecution. Oreskes and Conway look at several late 20th century scientific controversies: the link between cigarettes and cancer; the risks of nuclear weapon, the damage done by acid rain, CFCs and the ozone layer, and above all climate change, to find that these controversies extend far beyond the limits of reasonable doubt. This is no accident, but rather the result of a deliberate public relations strategy formulated by a small group of Cold War physics, propagated by a network of conservative think tanks, and funded by companies with a business model that creates threats to human life.The scientists are Fred Singer, Frederick Seitz, Robert Jastrow, and William Nierenberg. All of them parleyed real scientific work around the Manhattan Project and the early Cold War into political positions connected with the Republican party. In the mid 60s, as the dangers of smoking became apparent, the tobacco industry began supporting scientific research to create a bench of trial experts to cast doubt on the link between cigarettes and cancer. Seitz, Nierenberg, and Jastrow founded the staunchly freemarket George C. Marshall Institute in 1984 to provide structure for for their work. Singer was loosely affiliated with the network. The charges are serious enough, and timeline involved complex enough, that I'll leave the details to the book. Whatever the nature of the debate and the connection between science and policy, the goal was always to inhibit regulatory action by the government, and the playbook almost identical.The Merchants of Doubt playbook is not laid out in the text, so I'll do it here:Step 1 is Developing the Controversy: This begins innocently enough with emerging scientific issue of regulatory significant and locating legitimate uncertainties. Science is always incomplete, and particularly in early stages models may be crude approximations with unclear causal mechanisms. But rather than contributing actual work, (the scientific CVs of the merchants are notably thin post-1970) criticize the science for lack of realism and certainty, without offering testable hypotheses of your own. Extend personal uncertainty to willful density. Hold up official government reports through bureaucratic delays and denying consensus.Step 2 is to Launder the Controversy: Demand equal time for ""your side"" to a news media that lacks the time or expertise to check the validity of both sides, and knows that a story headlined ""scientists argue"" is more interesting than ""scientists say"". Launder your own credentials in an unrelated field to present yourself as an expert on whatever is required beyond all standards of professionalism. A scientist might master two fields, but cannot master the details of physics, atmospheric modeling, epidemiology, forest ecology, and so on. Develop press materials which mimic scientific articles in style and format, but have not passed review. Present glowing assessments of your position in friendly media like The Wall Street Journal.Step 3 is to Amplify the Controversy: Make sure everybody, not just friendly venues, sees the conflict. Get politicians and media figures to present your views as fact. Accuse your opponents of politicizing science and scientific misconduct. Attack, slander, and when necessary, lie. Cast attacks on your own evidence and backing as censorship akin to that suffered by Galileo. The end goal is to make the controversy the story, leaving doubt in the public mind long after the science has settled.I believe that Oreskes and Conway's case, as presented, is bulletproof. The titular merchants of doubt systematically violated scientific norms out of an ideological commitment that any sin was valid in pursuit of their political goal. They accused the scientific community of tampering with evidence and ideological bias, two acts which they were consistently and shamelessly guilty of. The end of this book, where Oreskes lays out the motives of these scientific antagonists, is not as strong. She describe an ideological journey, where Cold War anti-communists came to believe that anything was permissible in defense of American liberty. With the collapse of the Soviet Union, they made the errors of identifying Free Market Fundamentalism as the only economic system compatible with American democracy, and environmentalist sentiment of all sorts as the new communism. Rather than a blind faith in the efficiency, justice, and wisdom of markets, environmentalism recognizes many market failures of externalities, imperfect information, and various kinds of monopolies and technological lock-in. The ultimate logic of environmentalism is simple: The freedom to pollute cannot indefinitely stand above ecosystem integrity and human life. It's opponents would rather commit mass suicide than stop believing this.Merchants of Doubt is not a scholarly book, despite exhaustive research and footnotes. The authors include a chapter on Rachel Carson and the posthumous attack on Silent Spring because I believe Oreskes sees Carson as role model. Silence Spring wasn't strictly science either; it was a case prepared for public opinion, and one the launched the modern environmental movement.The point of both Silent Spring and Merchants of Doubt was to launch a movement. As I write this review, on the day of the first March for Science, that movement is ever more necessary. We live in a world trending towards Step 4, a nihilistic universal skepticism that expertise is even possible, that's there's anything other hidden motives and a desire for power in claims of scientific authority. Oreskes and Conway argue that we can't do our own science, that at a certain point there must be faith in the integrity of what's presented, because no-one can understand the full extent of the network that is activated in making a scientific claim. This may be correct, but it's also unsatisfying. The tactics developed by the merchants of doubt are a near perfect psuedo-science, carrying all the epistemic markers of scientific validity while containing a deadly poison of social paralysis. In this moment of Trumpian ""alternative facts"", we need to do more than push back against doubt, we need to make producing it a marker of perfidy, partaking in it a road to self-destruction rather than further prestige. I don't yet know how to do that, but Merchants of Doubt precisely lays out the cause of our present troubles."

Still, a useful and forensic look at how a few shills hopped around from the tobacco industry to global warming denial promoting the 'teach the controversy' message. As long as the debate is kept alive, action is stymied and more people believe lies about second hand smoke or carbon emissions. Interesting just how few people were at the core of these projects. Merchants of Doubt helped me think about how consent is managed in liberal democracies, though far from provides an answer to this. Never Let a Serious Crisis Go to Waste: How Neoliberalism Survived the Financial Meltdown takes a similar approach to discuss economics, but is a much better book.The investigative 'dot connecting' pages that made up the bulk of the book were strong, but the concluding chapters undid much of that. The end is a quite boring plea for Good Government and a defense of 'our' scientists (the authors irritatingly assume an American readership throughout, even stepping into 'our founding fathers' levels of turgid liberalism). Perhaps it's churlish of me to complain about the authors not being wadical enough for me in an otherwise decent book, but this is my review and I'll do what I want tyvm."

Their powerful re-assembly of the history of such programs over the last fifty years covers issues ranging from tobacco safety to DDT to Acid Rain and of course, global warming. The details of their reporting are far too vast to elucidate here, but suffice to say that many of the same players – some of the top ranked hawkish scientists of the 20th century – have been involved in many, if not all, of these campaigns. “Merchants of Doubt” explores everything from the motivation of such projects, the key players and funders, the methods of dissemination and media manipulation (“equal time”) and the ultimate refutation of such programs (SDI: Star Wars) over time. The vast detail and scope of Oreskes’ and Conway’s well written work makes “Merchants” one of the most important books of the year and a volume well worth reading."

When ""fair and balanced"" counter balances the discoveries of science against the views of those with a profit motive, we are all the poorer. It saddens me that so many americans, including some cherished family members, have no idea of what goes into establishing a justified, true belief. The corporate control of our news outlets make it easy for tobacco companies and oil and coal companies to have their propaganda accepted uncritically. Progress seems hopeless, but the truth has a way of winning out. The book gives me hope and explains how these doubts are funded.

29,1596916109,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1500718-ryan,4,"Why does so much of the ""global warming is a hoax crowd"" recall the ""tobacco doesn't cause cancer crowd?"" In Merchants of Doubt (2010) Oreskes and Conway show that the same few individuals use consistent strategies to attack science in defense of their ideals. In other words, this small group attack or question findings showing that smoking is one cause of cancer, that nuclear war is apocalyptic, that sulfur dioxide emissions caused acid rain, that nitrous oxide depletes the ozone layer, that second hand smoke is also one cause of cancer, or that greenhouse gases cause climate change. I see I am very smart people write that this questioning is just what science does. Is it though?The core claim here is that these merchants of doubt promote denialism neither for truth nor money (though they often are given a load of money) but rather because of ideology. Oreskes writes, and I'm sorry for mangling the passage but this brings it all together:""Friedman argued ... that capitalism and freedom go hand in hand--that there can be no freedom without capitalism and no capitalism without freedom. ... Working scientists were finding more and more evidence that industrial emissions were causing widespread damage to human and ecosystem health. The free market was causing problems--unintended consequences--that the free market did not know how to solve. The government had a potential remedy--regulation--but that flew in the face of the capitalist ideal. ... If science took the side of regulation--or even gave evidence to support the idea that regulation might be needed to protect the life on Earth--then science, the very thing that Jastrow, Nierenberg, Teller, and Frederick Seitz had spent their working careers trying to build up, would now have to be torn down.""The Heartland Institute, Cato, and George C. Marshall Institute are the three think tanks most commonly mentioned here that support these merchants. The former two think tanks appear in other non-fiction texts about climate change, and the George C. Marshall Institute ended with the Cold War. As decades wear on, their tactics become surprisingly devious. It wasn't until reading Merchants of Doubt that I understood the exasperated references to skeptical physicists in climate change books.On another note, I often find science reporting inadequate, but who is to blame? The final chapters consider scientists who would rather ""do science"" than demean themselves by becoming ""popularizers."" Is this a reasonable mindset? I note that economists excel over perhaps every other field in popularizing their ideas--and their ideas are edging out the work of all other scholars so far as I can tell. Maybe there's more to the calling than scholarship. I'm not sure the audience carries culpability, per se, but they do offer an explanation for why climate science takes so long to leak into the population. I don't just mean our desperate devotion to the ideologies that ground our worldview, or our craving for findings that tell us things are good, better than we think even. I mean something more like this: if told to not imagine an elephant, it's very difficult to obey the command. The command to not do X always carries in it a message to do X, especially if X is in any way conducive to our worldview. If you hope to produce an aberrant result on a multiple choice question, for example, include ""not"" in the instruction. The correct working of scientific discourse is to make findings, review them, dispute them, and resolve them through further scientific method--at least that is how I understand scientific discourse. But our minds do not respond well to this constant revising of results--the initial understanding, however inaccurate, endures for decades.Regardless, Merchants of Doubt is excellent and I'd consider it one of the best ""climate change"" books to read. I suspect I'll recommend it a lot going forward."
30,1596916109,http://goodreads.com/user/show/20843555-justpassingby,0,"Oreskes and Conway project an idealistic view of the scientific community. If by 'scientist' we mean full-time research staff of mainstream universities, either tenured or on a track towards tenure, then according to my personal (dated) experience most scientists, while observing at least basic courtesy in communicating with each other, privately sometimes harbour contempt. Physicists were the undisputed masters of the first half of the 20th century; when scientists in other fields announce important breakthroughs, particularly in the social sciences but also in the more statistically-oriented branches of the life sciences, scepticism comes naturally.One premise of the authors that I do subscribe to, is that they attach a much higher value to the classical peer-reviewed scientific journals than to any report or white paper produced by commercial organisations or by self-proclaimed experts working and publishing outside academia. Journalists who compare the former to the latter are not balancing opposing viewpoints: they are effectively refuting verifiable sources using unverifiable claims.This book is superior over other conspiracy theories in at least two very important respects. First, because it describes verifiable facts about the actions and writings of specific named people; and second, because its claims are supported by an extensive bibliography. For these two reasons I find the book highly credible, i.e., I have become convinced of the conspiracy.The accusations are harsh. Some of the important voices who question the truth of global warming, or its man-made nature, or the need for international political action, are not independent thinkers with an opinion of their own: they are experienced manipulators of public opinion with a decades-long history of deliberate misrepresentations in order to further a political or commercial agenda. They are merchants of fabricated doubt."

At best they are motivated by a blind faith in free markets and fear of regulation. At worst they are only killing the Earth for a buck.I end this book astonished that scientists still do the hard slow work to understand reality, even though their findings don't matter to politicians and only gets them harassed by trolls.Oreskes and Conway go deep in the details of peer review processes and scientific methodology. This is important for the nature of the book, to show how this work is different from the pseudoscience they decry. It also leads to some very dry pages.But I'm glad this book exists and sad this book needs to exist."
32,1596916109,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3733820-keith-swenson,5,"Rarely have I finished a book with such a strong feeling of the importance of the book. For years -- more than a decade -- I have been wondering why it is that public debate of many important issues get so sidetracked into obviously false, manipulated positions. We thought the Internet would be an instrument of truth enlightening the masses, but instead it seems to be an instrument of the worst kinds of gossip, along with information to purposefully mislead and confuse. Good and decent people I know are drawn in to intellectual positions which I can only describe as crazy. This book finally explains how the pattern works its distruction.This book lays bare the pattern of behavior in a number of the main anti-science campaigns: tobacco smoke, strategic defense initiative, acid rain, the ozone hole, second hand smoke, DDT, and of course global warming. The pattern is repeated over and over: scientific facts appear that threaten interest groups, and the group fight back:* scientists never say anything is 100% certain, and so plain talk about error probabilities is expanded into a general doubt about the entire position. ""We don't know""* scientists focus on uncertainty because that is where the most needed research is, and that is not the most useful background for public policy* delay tactics: the science is incomplete and acting now, before all the facts are found would be wasteful and risky* scientific credibility is maintained in scientific circles by avoiding inflated descriptions, and so the lack of strong statements is used against the position* a ""fairness doctrine"" is used to insert counter opinions, even when the facts are decided and the counter opinions are not relevant.* arguing that there may be harm, but there are many potential harms, and drowning and established specific harm in a pool of unspecific and unassocaited harms* there may be harms, but the costs of addressing them is far more than the benefit: ""spend a billion to save a million.""* Using statements out of context to confuse the public. * ad-hominum attacks on the entire scientific community suggesting they are corrupt, self-interested, or in the thrall of a nefarious political ideology.* Blatant lies and misrepresentation of events* persuasive propaganda; ""Sylvester Stallone paid $500,000 to associating tobacco with strength and power in no less than 5 feature films.* Claiming that the science is ""junk science"" based on claims that use partial evidence, even procedures that are perfectly acceptable but just sound questionable* The threshold concept that while something might be a poison, there are doses below which are safe and we don't need to be concerned. This makes the scientists appear alarmist worrying about trivial things.* fear association with absolutist ideas of freedom and liberty. First they take your cigarettes, next your property* trickery: such as a questionable paper published with Revelle's name on it, used to discount and attack Al Gore by making it seem he didn't understand Revelle.* scientists rarely fight back, because in the long run this kind of trickery will be exposed, and it is not in the interest of any single scientist to take the risk to debunk the theories. Good science will triumph, but it takes time.* attacking established science as being a popularity contest, implying that scientists only follow the herd and gain agreement from each other, and reality requires individualism to stand up against the herd* collusion with news outfits that would not print the entire letter, or left critical pieces out.* in general scientists tend to publish in places which are not widely read by the public, while the counter opinions are placed in widely popular magazinesWhat is most interesting about this history of the times is that a few key individuals were involved in multiple campaigns in widely varying areas. Fred Seitz and Fred Singer both retired physicists who played key roles in the tobacco movement (without any particular tobacco expertise) the acid rain debate, the ozone hole debate, and the global warming debate, among others. This tells us that it does not take expertise in an area to fight a war against the truth, it just requires familiarity with techniques for disrupting the truth.You can tell a lie with a single sentence, but it can take 100 sentences to counter and put everything straight. It takes a lot of careful research and organization to lay down a case to show how lies were purposefully established and propagated for special interests. This first 3/4 of the book is just that. An encyclopedic expose of the history of who did what in each of these public discussions. This foundation can be a bit dry to read, but it is absolutely needed in order to understand the conclusions.Aided with the knowledge of the specific which were used repeatedly in these public debates, the Conclusion Chapter is profound. Free speech is necessary for a democracy. Free markets help automate the functioning of the economy. But mixing both together has these bad consequences. Free speech is not fair and equitable when there is a profit motive. The truth suffers when a corporation's business model depends upon the public not knowing the truth. What is illuminated in this book is how easy it is to disrupt discussion of the truth. The truth has one voice, while lies speak with 1000 tongues. We see the same pattern in many other anti-science fields: evolution, vaccinations, GMO foods, and a million other conspiracy theories. This pattern is not going away any time soon.Unfortunately Oreskes and Conway don't have any simple solution. The only path is to help educate the public on how science works, and how it really does get to the better answers, and to enlighten the public to how these campaigns of doubt work. That is why the book is so important. This should be required reading everywhere."
33,1596916109,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8734097-p-d,5,"4.5 starsAlright, two major takeaways from this book regardless of how you feel about the authors' conclusions:1. Compare people's credentials—and their affiliations—to the topic at hand. This isn't as straightforward as Dr. Ben Carson, a pediatric neurosurgeon, having opinions about economics or climate change. It could be down to whether or not a now-disgraced physician like Andrew Wakefield has the chops to conduct research at all (fun fact, a number of coauthors had their names pulled even before the whole study was retracted; of course, we now know he had taken money to skew the results, but the study itself had bad data), or if Dr. Oz is in any way qualified to give nutritional advice, especially while he's shilling products on TV. MD training doesn't necessarily cover the nuances of nutrition—hell, degrees in nutrition don't cover everything, we're only just learning about the essential role of the microbiome in nutrient absorption—nor do they cover epidemiology, which requires a fair bit of statistical training. I've known doctors who were qualified to conduct and review studies, but it required additional training.2. If you want the caveats, go to the source. I totally get that papers are behind paywalls and even when they aren't, you need pretty damn specialized training to dissect methodology. This is why we have websites like The Scientist, which aggregates content and is free to read, and then for the top two journals in the overall field, Science News and Nature News. Are the headlines as sexy as CNN or whatever people read these days? No. Does it take extra work to digest these? Yes. If you want the true-truth, suck it up; the articles point out flaws or additional work needed in the research efforts they're summarizing. You are responsible for doing your due diligence, too.Anyway, on to the book itself...my first instinct is to deride the persistent use of slanted modifiers, but you know what? Fuck it. This book is a goddamn paean to the problem with trying to maintain full-blown scientific integrity and objectivity, and Oreskes and Conway spent five years doing their due diligence—the notes include additional detail in multiple places—they've damn well earned the right to call a snake a snake.So yeah, fantastically researched and incredibly depressing. Scientists undermining the integrity of science, in an era where trust is already low because of the lack of realized economic benefit—or outright economic harm in some regions—is the worst. And of course, as the authors hint at, it undermines the overall sense that science is worth listening to, even though the strength of peer-reviewed research in top journals has improved over time.As has been pointed out in some of the publications I linked above, though, issues like climate change aren't unilaterally liberal. They do focus on free marketeers, many of whom are Cold Warriors, as the major driving force behind undermining science. What's not emphasized at the end (the bits about Nixon creating the EPA, etc read to me more like they were saying he was making necessary 'liberal' concessions) is that being obsessed with deregulation and anything that smells of socialism isn't necessarily the same as being conservative, even though the two have been closing together since the Reagan era. For instance, the Pope's encyclical on climate change is centered on Catholic values, even though the issue is generally associated with secular science. And many 'green' solutions have been adopted by companies ahead of government regulations because they have business benefits.Also, while this book is a thorough summary of what has been done wrong, it doesn't offer a huge sense of how to be an aware reader in the future. It's easy enough to infer that we should, aside from the things above, stop frequenting and sharing websites which are funded by a source with an obvious bias, but how is one to know that a publication has a history of bias without trawling the archives? Maybe there isn't a shortcut to this—or maybe the shortcut is going back to school, getting a BA in science, and then spending all day reading journals—but it would have been nice to see more on that end.That said, this book does a lot to dispel myths about what science truly entails, and while the authors are not shy about demonstrating bias, said bias is well-qualified by primary sources and the fact that Big Tobacco—and now Big Oil—have come under federal scrutiny for obfuscating major issues that they had internally identified."
34,1596916109,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7226831-josh-friedlander,4,"It's rare that a highly partisan book on a controversial issue can so utterly convince me of the rightness of its cause, so the authors of this book deserve credit for the work they've done, which strikes a balance between relentless scientific fact-citing, damning historical evidence, and some careful, nuanced discussions on market failures, the tragedy of the commons, and the exact definition of proof in empirical research. ""Why can't scientists stop contradicting themselves?"" I wrote to a scientist friend a few years back, frustrated with the conflicting reports I kept hearing about anthropogenic climate change. He responded with righteous umbrage, and stacks of data points, and links to unwieldy PDFs that I'd never more than scan. It seemed like for people in the know, the evidence clearly pointed one way: but then why did so many seemingly intelligent people still harbour doubts? It is primarily this question that this book sets out to explain.Beginning with the tobacco industry's fight against the link between smoking and diseases, the authors recap the genesis of the idea that scientific evidence that threatens a company's income could be deflected by sowing the seeds of doubt. Astonishingly, it is many of the same people - disgruntled or maverick scientists, or those who feared that environmentalist threats to business could be the vanguard of socialist threats to freedom (the ""green tree with red roots"") - and funding from many of the same think tanks, that connect the threads between the fight against the science of smoking, acid rain, DDTs, missile defence, and global warming. Owing to the fact that fields such as epidemiology and meteorology must, by definition, always draw their conclusions based on statistical correlations and induction from large data sets, and cannot be proved in the same way as, say, Newtonian mechanics, the eponymous ""merchants of doubt"" sowed sceptical seeds, utilising their scientific reputations and the media's desire to show both sides of any story to convince the public that things were complicated, and that we ought not to rush into any rash decisions. ""More research is needed,"" ran their mantra. To obfuscate is always easier than to clarify.This campaign extended to maligning the reputation of many prominent scientists (and journalists such as Rachel Carson), assigning murky motivations to researchers who had toiled in obscure fields for decades, and insisting on denying the weight of evidence years beyond the point where consensus had been reached within the scientific community. Its results have been disproportionately successful. Only recently, as the public has become more aware of the one-directionality of the evidence, has more of an impetus to action been seen, most recently in the COP 21 conference in Paris. This book clarifies much about the disconnect between technical scientific research and public understanding, and the need for clear communication channels between scientists and the public, in the absence of which malicious actors will manipulate the confusion for their own ends. It is far from clear what can be done to remedy this situation. But for this non-scientist reader, it is a huge gain just to be aware of the problem. "
35,1596916109,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10174911-syed-ashrafulla,1,"This is a pretty bad book attempting to convince people through a combination of snark and thin arguments, hoping the resulting murky mess will clog your brain and force you to lose the argument by simply not wanting to talk to them anymore. The authors could have made a great theme about the issues of ""fair and balanced"" scientific journalism. They instead chose to pick three scientists (Seitz, Singer and Nierenberg) as villians with a bunch of poor scientists on the other side as unwiling victims. As a result, their language is extremely charged; they provide no attempt to objectify their scientific analysis.In fact, I think the authors pride in this. They wanted not to write a historical perspective but rather an angsty rant on those bad Republicans and their bullying of scientists. To this, they have to mine for a concept which allows science to be conveniently in their corner the entire time. The pillar they choose is the one that loses all the merits they may have had in supporting causes like environmentalism.Their pillar is peer review, which is the biggest weakness in science. The weakness of peer review is clear to anyone who's ever had to edit anything for a friend or colleague. The review is always shallow, has no basis due to the lack of expertise, and generally cannot point out any issues. It is only when intrepid scientists try to recreate or criticize the work that bad science can be refuted. Yet, to the authors, peer review is good enough to avoid those criticisms.As for the construction of this book, the authors consistently use one argument only to contradict it within the next 30 paragraphs. For example, they make the point that the heel Republicans are not biologists while the face Democrats know a lot about science even though they also are not biologists. They believe in causation even under the evidence that regression is a terrible attempt at finding causation. They want journalists to be more emotional while going after the emotional nature of the anti-environmentalist arguments. They attack the presence of associations between scientists and industry only when it's conservative (yes, conservative, not anti-environmental, make no mistake this is an anti-conservative book with the word ""environment"" as a shield). They go after regulation while supporting regulation. This is a big problem and it really turns the book to mush.On a smaller note, the authors brought up many minor actors on either side of the argument. Two stood out to me: Gregg Easterbook (the TMQ author) is apparently anti-regulatory, and Malcolm Gladwell (yes, him) is apparently anti-science and a former conservative writer. Those names were a bit of a shock to me.On a smaller note for the statistically inclined, the authors also made a claim that linear models are better than linear-and-threshold models because linear models are more general and better fit data. After what the authors wrote as five years of research in a field filled with statistical science, you think one of those peers who reviewed this book would have told them that linear models are a subset of threshold models (which are linear with caps)."
36,1596916109,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2905820-pendred-noyce,5,"This is an important and eye-opening book. Many of us may have a vague feeling that there's still something wrong with the science on global warming or acid rain, or an idea that Rachel Carson's attack on DDT was somehow sloppy or overly emotional. It turns out that the reason these doubts play on our mind is that there has been a concerted effort by a small group of Cold War physicists and their associates to promote these doubts. Naomi Oreskes and Erik Conway present a well-written narrative, both tightly argued and copiously referenced, that shows how for this group of scientists, opposition to Communism became opposition to environmentalism because of their conviction that environmentalism would lead to socialist attacks on the free market and therefore on freedom itself.A handful of scientists and a small but powerful network of funders and think tanks, from Phillip Morris to Exxon to the Competitive Enterprise and Cato Institutes, have orchestrated campaigns of doubt against emerging scientific consensus on a range of issues from the harms of smoking (and second hand smoke) to the ineffectiveness of the Strategic Defense Initiative (Star Wars) to depletion of the ozone layer to acid rain to global warming. Oddly, they have even gone back to the settled issue of the harmfulness of DDT, charging Rachel Carson with responsibility for the malaria deaths of a million African children -- ignoring the fact that insect resistance had already undermined the effectiveness of DDT before Carson wrote Silent Spring. Oreskes and Conway demonstrate the common strategies used by these scientific contrarians. They begin by focusing on questions and controversies within the scientific community. They call for more research before any precipitate action can be taken. They meet with journalists and editorial boards and urge them to ""report both sides"" of an issue even if it has been settled. They write articles for non-peer-reviewed (often industry-sponsored) publications and then quote these reports in the popular press as if they had equal weight with massive reports of scientific consensus. When necessary, they launch concerted personal attacks on the personal integrity of scientists they see as representing the wrong side.This is scary stuff. It's important to read this book carefully, to keep an eye open for evidence of bias or exaggeration by the authors. At times they may state something a bit too strongly. At times they attribute motives to the sowers of doubt without real knowledge of what their motives are. But all in all, this is an important, disturbing book that shows how our own intellectual laziness and our preference for believing things aren't so bad that we have to change have deceived us. Too often we've allowed ourselves to be lulled into complacency by so-called experts working for the benefit of those who have the most money to lose if the truth about negative environmental effects of certain industries becomes widely known."
37,1596916109,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4235397-sarah-clement,4,"I am giving this book a high rating for the quality of its research and the brilliance of its synthesis, but if I were rating it in how well it was communicated, then I would give it only 3 stars. Oreskes and Conway have engaging points to make, and the recurring themes through the book very clearly bring to light the logic of science denialism. Yet you have to work very hard as a reader to get to those themes. The authors get bogged down in historical facts that make the narrative drag and do not enable the reader to see the forest for the trees. There are moments of extreme clarity in this book - often written quite eloquently - but these moments are nearly obscured by the endless detail. If this is meant to be a book for historians, then that is fair enough, but I think it is actually meant to be a book for the masses. The topics in this book are right up my alley: the interface of science, politics, and policy, with many of the topics squarely in the environmental realm. Maybe it is precisely because of my academic and professional experience that I was exhausted and impatient with the level of the detail, but I really do feel like it distracted from their main points. (I mean, at one point they were telling us the topic of various researchers' PhDs!) And maybe it's also because of that experience that I wasn't really shocked by anything in this book. These aren't conspiracies or exceptional cases, really. In many ways they are simply revealing the anatomy of environmental politics - especially the way science is translated in the public arena, in committee rooms, and behind closed doors. For that reason, this would be an excellent book for students of policy to read, provided they can wade through the detail and grasp the overarching messages. I would have also appreciated a map/chart/'cheat sheet' of the recurring figures throughout the book, as there were so many 'characters' that I found I needed to flip around or refer to the index to remind myself. The final substantive chapter in the book, on Silent Spring and revisionist attacks on Carson, is what I wanted from this book all along. It's messages are clear, and it brings together the themes of the book rather brilliantly, together with the concluding chapter. I know from Oreskes other work and from these chapters that she is very capable of writing a book that conveys the same messages without such cumbersome detail. The book has very important messages to convey, and it does indeed convey them...eventually. I just wish the whole book would have done so with the same level of eloquence and clarity as the final chapters; their ideas deserve it. "
38,1596916109,http://goodreads.com/user/show/19905652-eric-b-kennedy,4,"Merchants of Doubt is simultaneously a tour de force and an incredibly frustrating read.Its main contribution is to demonstrate the ways in which campaigns to seed dissent on the health risks of smoking, acid rain, the ozone hole, and global warming – among others – actually turn out to be the product of largely the same actors. It’s the same people who keep showing up; keep disputing the science; and keep attempting to argue against the need for regulation. And, these people are financed and urged on by the same sources, namely right-wing thinktanks and funders. On this task, Oreskes and Conway have done an exceptional job: they’ve demonstrated beyond a doubt that these characters keep showing up and keep attempting to sew doubt until it literally can no longer be done.But there’s a reason that academic texts and novels are written differently. In a novel, suspense is important, and it’s important not to spoil the ending. By contrast, in an academic text, you need to spoil the ending so that we can examine your work: we need to be able to test whether we agree that the evidence supports the claim you’re making. Merchants of Doubt fails terribly on this metric, to the extent that I almost need to put a “hide spoilers” tag on this review.In short, in the final chapter of the book, Oreskes and Conway reveal their big argument: Actually, it’s not just that the same people are showing up, but that they’re showing up because of a simple and singular aim – to fight for free markets and against government regulation. This ‘big reveal’ is long overdue, because the prevailing reaction throughout the book should be to ask the question ‘but why?’ Oreskes and Conway demonstrate so convincingly that these actors show up again and again to fight science, but they dangle and then ignore the crucial question: why is it that these folks behave the way they do? What motivates them to attempt to sew dissensus? Why their stamina and repeated involvement across issues that have little connection? Finally, in the last chapter, there’s an answer: it’s fighting for free markets and against government regulation. But, by making this a surprise conclusion, the reader is robbed of the chance to critically evaluate these arguments throughout the evidence they present.As a dirty Canadian socialist, I’m tempted to agree with their assessment, of course (their remarkably American attitudes to maligning democratic socialism in the dying pages of the book, despite what they’ve shown, are striking). That said, they offer little route forward here: is there a place for market-based solutions? How can authentic dialogue be achieved between right and left to find bipartisan solutions to climate change? How do you assess between ‘good’ and ‘junk’ science, other than the flimsy and ambiguous heuristics they offer (listen to scientists with credentials; focus on those who self-organize into institutions like the IPCC)?What becomes clear through the text, though, is that for Oreskes and Conway, this isn’t really their question because there isn’t really a need for much bipartisan collaboration. Why? Well, the world is just rather black and white. There are good scientists and bad free market promulgators. There are people who are trying to learn about the world and people who are trying to confuse. We solve these problems by embracing the good people and rejecting the bad.Take, for instance, their assessment of Roger Revelle. Oreskes and Conway devote the better part of eight pages to defending Revelle, a climate scientist who co-authored a piece with one of their Doubt Merchants (Singer). Yet they fight to redeem his legacy, ultimately going to pains to illustrate how Revelle was pressured and taken advantage of – effectively on his death bed – with no agency or autonomy to fight back against Singer’s writing of the article or to remove his name. There’s no room in the analysis for Revelle to be a character who has complex views on global warming, or might believe true and untrue things about it, or might have fought hard to communicate its realness and yet also have questions about its uncertainty. Singer is bad, Revelle is good, and lines must be drawn.How do Oreskes and Conway draw these lines? Well, again, it gets real tricky. What we need is an account of how to deal with messy science, wherein things aren’t perfectly settled or debates are open in some respects and closed in others. We need an account that – unlike Merchants of Doubt – distinguishes between the performance of legitimate science (i.e., drawing on work in the philosophy of science that distinguishes the processes and procedures of science that can be trusted) from questions of what we ought to do about it. The latter doesn’t follow neatly from the former (e.g., the fact that climate change is absolutely real and human caused doesn’t tell us how we should respond, which is a political decision), no matter how much Oreskes and Conway seem to imply that it does.So, ultimately, they seem to draw the lines on the basis of what science they, well, like. Again, it’s hard to be critical here, because their sensibilities of good science line up with mine. I believe climate change is happening, DDT is bad, a healthy ozone layer is good, and so on – I agree with their predilections. But, they don’t really have a procedural way of getting to those allegiances, nor is it clear that they’re open for discussion.To make this point, compare their treatment of Revelle and Jim Hansen. Hansen also shows up in Merchants as a key “good guy” who, in this case, was an early visionary in identifying and calling attention to the reality of global warming. But recently, Oreskes wrote a scathing editorial against Hansen, calling him a “climate denier” in The Guardian. Hansen’s view on climate change, of course, hasn’t changed since Merchants, but rather he has begun to argue for the need for nuclear power to help decarbonize the economy. Oreskes dislikes nuclear power; the world contains only good and bad people, implicitly argues Merchants; therefore Hansen must now be a bad person.All this ends up being quite problematic. Merchants is a tour de force in identifying the way that dissensus has been intentionally sewn in the aims of advancing laisse faire economics, yet its paradigm of good vs. bad ends up being much more dichotomous – and subjective – than is helpful. In the language of ‘science and technology studies,’ the volume forgets the principle of “symmetry.” We can’t, symmetry argues, use something’s veracity to explain why it became the way it did. Climate change, for instance, isn’t largely settled science because it’s true, it’s seen as true because of social processes of settling and consensus. Oreskes and Conway forget the importance of this analytical principle, instead taking things to either be true or false independently, and then explaining everything because of those intrinsic qualities.All this yields a much less interesting book than would be ideal. It does an exceptional job at documenting and proving these common characters. But it can’t tell us (1) why they behaved the way they did (or, more broadly, why scientists hold very different views on the same issues), (2) which science we ought to trust, or (3) how to make sense of disagreements between experts because of this failure to observe symmetry. And, in doing so, there’s a real risk that Oreskes and Conway end up perpetuating exactly the kind of ideology – rather than science – driven systems they critique."

40,1596916109,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6004149-justin,5,"Brilliant. Gripping. Urgently necessary. Merchants of Doubt is destined to be a classic work of history; it's political relevance to the dire circumstances we find ourselves in today is hard to overstate. From tobacco smoke to DDT to acid rain to the ozone hole to climate change -- the same handful of [US] scientists have, in my words, betrayed their own legacies in misrepresenting, distorting, and repressing the true scientific consensus on humans' capacity for self-destructive interference in the natural systems we depend on.This in itself isn't necessarily news to many of 'us', although the sophistication and the depth of Oreskes and Conway's deconstruction of it is compelling. What is news is the insight into *why* these people have behaved as they do. The reasons are complex and varied, but one fundamental refrain sounds loud and clear: they fiercely reject ANYTHING that would compel government to regulate or in any way interfere with the function of 'the free market'. Their free market fundamentalism leads them to vehemently attack the scientific basis for the mitigation of any damaging action (of individuals or collectively) if doing so would curtail the 'liberties' of the privileged few. Free markets are always and in every place the best and only way of securing 'freedom'; government intervention is always and in every place oppressive and to be prevented at any cost.Sadly, that cost is very, very real and will be paid by all of us distressingly soon."
41,1596916109,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4254578-justin-barney,4,"This book tells the story of various historical characters who have fought against scientific evidence. In many cases, the actors are the same, but the authors treat the following topics individually: (i) tobacco, (ii) acid rain, (iii) ozone depletion, (iv) secondhand smoke, and (v) global warming. It was interesting to familiarize myself more with the science behind these subjects, but the real eye-opener was seeing how in each case the science was twisted or simply contradicted by (financially) interested parties. The plots in these stories become fairly predictable, but that is a part of the scandal. The repetition allows you to pick up on patterns, making it easier to spot them in contemporary life.In their conclusions, the authors point out that intolerance for regulation is the motive behind the ‘merchants of doubt’. The role of government, then, becomes the decisive issue, and the authors outline a common sense approach to government intervention. The authors don’t hesitate to ascribe blame where it is deserved, but I think they do so as charitably as possible. This was a great book, and it was made into a documentary that will be in theatres soon. I hope to see it when we get back to the United States."

I _AM_ significantly more qualified to address climate change (PhD, Geology and Planetary Science) than the vast majority of the denialists - it fucking exists. We need to deal with it. It, in fact, may actually already be too late - a lot depends on what happens in the Arctic tundra.This book pissed me off. I'm getting angry again just writing the review. But that has nothing to do with the book itself or with the authors - it has to do with the professional denialists...people who should have known better, but used their positions to compromise peer review and deny research because of political considerations.Those people deserve a very special hell filled with Communists."
43,1596916109,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6468413-menjol-almeida,5,"A dozen of years ago I read a book that changed my life forever, and made me more and more interested in science. It was The Demon-Haunted World: Science as a Candle in the Dark, by Carl Sagan. In this book of Naomi Oreskes, Sagan is cited a few times. He was one of the bravest scientists that struggled against de merchants of doubt, a group of people, scientists either, that by themselves, struggled against the scientific evidence in a couple of diferent issues like acid rain, ozone depletion, second hand smoke and global warming. They were capable of interfere in very important political decisions, using governs and being using by them, against the most part of the human interest and its future in very important issues. It is a stunning book, problably one of those can change your life forever."
44,1596916109,http://goodreads.com/user/show/311480-adam,3,"Although I skimmed the book in parts, there was no doubting it's central message - that a small group of scientists & quasi-scientific policy advocates launched a series of powerful and effective disinformation campaigns that undermined the scientific community and individual scientists who were learning things about how industrial processes and products were damaging human beings and the planet. From the health risks of tobacco smoke and secondhand smoke to the acid rain and global warming, often the same few propagandists derailed the political process throughout outright lies and personal attacks, and in some cases prevented necessary government action for years, or even decades. A sobering read, and one whose relevance remains!"
45,1596916109,http://goodreads.com/user/show/260945-anna,2,"I suspect I am not alone in choosing to read this book because a) I love science and b) because I want to understand the historical role of science in society. However, I feel relieved to finally be done with this book - a challenge even in the midst of a stay-at-home order that has seen a dramatic spike in my number of books read. The topic matter is undeniably important. Unfortunately, the delivery is not up to the task. If I shift my perspective to consider this book as one purely about history, then my opinion is slightly more positive. Each chapter discusses (in well-researched and extensively documented detail) how a few individuals and institutions cast doubt on a particular scientific consensus - and subsequent policy/behavior change recommendations - to make the needed interventions seem controversial and unnecessary. This approach keeps the book organized, but my attention continually wandered in chapter after chapter of nondescript figures trying to one-up each other. Little detail was given about the lives and motivations of the central players in each chapter, which would have been helpful as most (with the exception of Carl Sagan) are likely to be unknown to even avid consumers of science history books. The individual chapters also failed to provide sufficient context and analysis of the figures’ actions, creating a repetitive effect and leaving the reader wondering what insight this committed retelling of what is largely the same story will provide. Finally, in the conclusion and epilogue of the book, the authors begin to identify institutional and societal weaknesses that allowed a few individuals and institutions to derail data-driven policy recommendations in significant public matters. However, in stark contrast to the highly-detailed main chapters, the conclusions begin from a perspective that is beyond bird’s eye. The authors suggest that the conflicts described in the book are the result of a capitalist economic system and spend a large chunk of their conclusion providing historical social and political examples demonstrating that (gasp) in a society motivated by profit, profit will be prioritized over truth and the public interest. Which, yeah, I absolutely agree. . . but perhaps a more pragmatic approach to the problem could be addressed in just as much detail? For example, how can we make space in scientific and intellectual circles for responsibly assessing and handling contrarian views? How can we ensure we protect and value independent scientific research and don’t make it astronomically difficult for scientists to succeed in the public sphere, incentivizing some to lend their credibility to institutions and policies that act against the data and public interest? How can we seek out unethical and biased behavior in our research institutions so that those who attempt to smear reputations have less ammunition? Especially as there is now a significant body of research on why we believe what we believe, I was also disappointed that this book didn’t touch on the psychology of holding contrarian viewpoints, tribalism in politics (and how it relates to the mentioned scientific issues), and how to better and more sustainably guide people to improve their critical thinking skills and constantly challenge their own views and biases. Yes, there are already books on these topics, but the intersection of these ideas with the contents of this book would have been a valuable opportunity for insight and discussion. Perhaps it was intended as a joke, but writing a book about the overwhelming body of data in support of hypotheses and theories of public importance and ending it with a quote that states “You just know in your heart that you can’t throw 25 million tons a year of sulfates into the Northeast and not expect some. . . consequences,” made me go, “What? No!” Again, YES, I AGREE, but ""knowing in your heart"" isn't how science works. And that’s not how this book should work, after pointing out how many people used that same “logic” to discredit science.To wrap this up, I think this book aimed to address a disheartening pattern of deception in evidence-based policy making. The book is well-researched and would serve as an excellent reference text. However, it didn’t add much to what I already understood about ethical controversies in and public misunderstanding of science. This book also doesn’t serve to win over those who hold and propagate views that aren’t evidence-based, given its esoteric and dry chapters. It took me a whole month to read during a time when I was scientifically and societally bound to stay home and do little else, so let that be a warning to potential readers.

46,1596916109,http://goodreads.com/user/show/12238870-jay-storey,5,"Ever wonder why science, and scientists, no longer seem to get the respect they once had?This book at least partially answers that question. It's the story of the decades-long campaign by a handful of right-wing ideologues, backed by massive infusions of cash from large corporations, to discredit scientists whose work disagrees with their free-market agenda. Smoking, acid rain, the hole in the ozone layer, and global warming are all targets of the ideologues' wrath. One of their favorite tactics is to imply that there is ongoing dispute about these issues. There is no dispute - all have been PROVEN beyond any reasonable doubt to be serious threats to humanity.Since they are unable to actually prove the science wrong (because it's NOT wrong), instead they assassinate the characters of the people and institutions making the claims. Of course, they can't do this with facts, because the facts are against them. They choose instead to lie, misrepresent, spread disinformation, obfuscate, and distract.They are probably responsible for millions of deaths, and have ruined countless lives, not mention the destruction of many of earth's ecosystems and extinction of many species. So how do they sleep at night? Your guess is as good as mine. This book has confirmed 2 suspicions I've had for many years: 1 – that many large corporations are controlled by sociopaths. 2 – that there really is a sucker born every minute.This book should be required reading in every school. It's a frightening demonstration of how the truth can be quashed by money and power."
47,1596916109,http://goodreads.com/user/show/17878620-margaretdh,4,"I happened to read this shortly after The Shock Doctrine: The Rise of Disaster Capitalism, and they really do fit well together. In Shock Doctrine, Klein details free markets gone wrong, and in Merchants of Doubt, Oreskes and Conway argue that an overpowering belief in free markets led a handful of influential scientists to obfuscate and cast doubt on scientific results that suggested new regulations.Oreskes and Conway take us through the science of smoking, DDT, acid rain, the hole in the ozone and climate change, and they show in each case how these men went against the bulk of the scientific community to suggest that conclusions were uncertain, and therefore no new regulation was needed. They identify the playbook, and then analyze each issue to show the similarities in tactics.Oreskes is a historian, and I suppose I'm biased in favour of the pronouncements of historians, but they don't have a dog in this fight in the same way that many writers on this topic do. And they're actually pretty forgiving to the scientists (mostly physicists) they write about. Instead of suggesting that they were motivated by greed or iffy loyalties, they argue that the Cold War instilled deep belief in freedom and the need to fight communism, and that this belief manifested as a distrust of any government regulation.Anyway, this is very readable, and I think definitely worth your time."

49,1596916109,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3511539-caroline,5,"I first heard of this book at the Boston Book Festival, where Naomi Oreskes was a speaker on a panel about science and media (or something along those lines). Since then this book has been sitting on my to-read list, until I suddenly had much more free time (aka sitting around bc you can’t do bench work during a quarantine).I thought this book was pretty eye-opening and very well researched. Obviously I knew that the tobacco industry tried to hush up the adverse health effects of smoking, but I had never really thought about the specific mechanisms they used (I really like the example of second hand smoking, where scientists agreed that it was harmful for children but were not sure if it was most harmful when they were pre or post natal. According to Oreskes, the tobacco industry honed in on this question and launched a campaign to make it look like the scientific community couldn’t agree if second hand smoking was actually harmful). The authors did a good job explaining industry tactics and scientific processes like the peer review system at a level accessible for any reader to understand regardless of their scientific background (or lack thereof)."

On the one hand, it is a compelling and persuasive look at how the findings of scientists have been manipulated, cast into doubt, and misused on behalf of those with political and economic interests. They authors explore with great detail and thoughtfulness exactly how this manipulation happens and why it should be exposed, doubted, and dismissed.On the other hand, the book suffers from a writing style that is often flat or even tedious. There is often an excess of detail. Sometimes the lifestories of scientists are told with what felt like too much information. I kept getting bogged down and it was challenging to finish. And that worried me because I fear not as many people will read it, or get it, as ought to.Still, even with a writing style that is less readable than I might hope, it is still a brilliant and insightful read.

Starting from the tobacco industry and now into the biggest global issue facing mankind, climate change, industries have become adept in creating controversy to discredit the already overwhelming evidence researched by scientists. The title says it all, how a handful of scientists obscured the truth on issues. It is not necessarily hard to create confusion in the public. Plenty of propaganda tactics deployed by these people has been incredibly effective because in the end the general public does not have time or does not have the capability to verify which is real science and which one is junk science. Creating counter-arguments is even enough to confuse the public and discredit science in general. "
52,1596916109,http://goodreads.com/user/show/891651-karen,4,"Why I Chose This BookSo long ago now I have moved from sadness to nostalgia, I was part of a podcast/book club that never quite launched. We took turns suggesting books, and I’d always keep a lookout for new titles that might be worth discussing, even long after the podcast project was stalled. When author Naomi Oreskes was interviewed on a March 2010 episode of the SETI podcast, Are We Alone?, I was intrigued enough to note the title. Far too cheap (sadly) to pay for hardback copies of books, I put my name on the library waiting list. Last month it was finally my turn to read it.Nutshell Review of the BookA significant portion of this book is footnotes and citations, and you can’t say that the authors have not backed up their claims. Orekse and Conway make the case that a very few number of scientists have gone out of their way to undermine and disparage research (by casting doubt upon it) calls into question the safety of certain business practices or political programs. These are the same few scientists again and again, and by the third example of this you’ve got your long list of targets for hate mail. By the sixth example, though, you’re just worn out and tired of being so angry. It was very difficult for me to finish the book, although I would not disrecommend it to anyone. Is that a word?Detailed Review of the BookThis is a book I really wish I’d read with friends. I’m pretty good at figuring out when someone is blowing smoke, well, at me when I’m listening to them, but when I see things in print they just seem so plausible. Particularly when they are in a book by an author from a podcast I generally trust from a monthly skeptical episode with lots and lots of footnotes. I found absolutely everything the authors claimed completely believable and I am ready to repeat the information from the book to anyone who will listen. They paint a very disturbing picture of what is basically a conspiracy against science that exposes the dangers of an unregulated free market, or science that is performed just to support a political agenda (such as the science behind Ronald Reagan’s Strategic Defense Initiative). They follow one or two scientists from the nuclear research programs of World War II through the tobacco industry’s suppression of data about smoking and second hand smoke, though arguments against the hole in the ozone layer, acid rain and global warming, and then to a purported smear campaign against Rachel Carson and her book, Silent Spring, about DDT.There are also about four pages just ranting about “free market capitalism” at the end of the book, which I enjoyed immensely for personal reasons, but which were so ranty and so enjoyable that I feel like I ought to go looking for the other side of the story out of principle. I mean, it’s a screed. It’s the kind of thing I want someone else to read so I can run my predispositions and biases past another brain just to keep my own enthusiasm in check. I don’t think that Oreske and Conway are making a sloppy case or letting the (manipulated) emotional responses of the readers do the hard work for them. I don’t think that’s what’s going on. I think they really are onto something reasonable and rational and well-documented, but if they are right and this is how people are behaving and the media outlets are just letting these behaviors slide (for a variety of reasons, and I didn’t come out here to slam journalists because I know what they’re all trying to do in the environment they’re in), well… it’s kind of awful to think about. If someone who I generally trust to read critically could tell me that they’ve come to the same conclusions or the opposite of that, I’d feel a lot more comfortable. And no, the reviewers on Amazon don’t count. For all I know half of them are performance artists.As for what’s in the book, it’s not difficult to understand. There is science presented to some degree of technicality, but it was very easy to follow. I liked the tone of the book, and appreciated the sarcastic asides and running commentary that peppered it. It was not so conversational that it distracted from the message, and it was not the kind of Look at Me! I’m the Author! sort of interruption I’ve encountered in other books. Nonetheless, reading did become exhausting. I blew through the first two-thirds like there was no tomorrow, and then right before the global warming stuff–-the reason Oreske was making the interview rounds and the most timely subject in the book–-I maxed out. The same people were employing the same strategies for the same reason over and over and over again, and I just didn’t want to read anymore. A week after it was due back at the library (couldn’t renew it because there were holds) I finally just sat down and busted through the thing. My outraged flared up a little, but I’d gotten the point already and was just turning the pages to see what was left.The Conclusion and Epilogue chapters were very important to read to get the full effect of the book, so I’m glad I pushed myself through it (and the screed was a fair reward), but I don’t know if starting at page 1 and reading through to page 270ish is a very good way to approach the book. It might be a good strategy to start at the epilogue and conclusion, and then read the tobacco stuff at the beginning, and then skip around according to what topics interest you. Information does build by chapter, but it’s not really confusing to fill in the blanks if you had to. It might keep you from also burning out on the book."

Not because it was written poorly (I got quite caught up in it), but because the facts presented are unsettling. Merchants of Doubt demonstrates studiously how a few organized opinion makers (often ex-scientists) can discredit an elaborate scientific consensus on societal problems, thus swaying public opinion and stunning governmental action and policy. A must-read for everyone who cares about science and politics, and wishes to gain insight in how these two are kept apart. "

It's an absolute must-read for those who wish to develop critical thinking and who wish to be able to distinguish the fake (the corrupted and manipulated data) from the real (the claims that have been tested and proved scientifically). The real question posed the book is: everyone has the right to express their opinions, but to whom should we be listening to...? Brilliant examples from tobacco business, global warming, etc.. "

A big plus is that it deals nearly entirely with important public examples, so a view into reality rather than 'oh, they're all liers' generality. The elephant in the room that the book compeltely misses is the role of and desire for power. If moral development flourishes, then arbitrary action by producers - power - diminishes. It's not just economic, or bad people, it is institutions lusting power. Good book, recommended. "

It was really helpful to read Dark Money earlier this year. That book mentioned Merchants of Doubt in its chapter on global warming. I really appreciated how this book explained how the pattern of denying tobacco studies in the 1950s led to a similar pattern to climate change denial now. It was also helpful to learn more about the discussion of acid rain and the hole in the ozone layer in the 1980s. I was very young when those issues were being talked about and thought they were settled very easily. It was interesting to see how they were not. Overall, this book gave a good recent history and explained how patterns used over fifty years ago have affected discourse today. Highly recommended. "

It respected both sides of the story, presented each side, motives behind their actions and shows how science and pseudoscience differ from each other. It shows how some scientists like Singer, Nirenberg and Seitz used uncertainties in science as a weapon for personal and political agenda. It also criticises free market ideology and to some extent liberalism. Recommended read!"

It was my first non-fiction book in quite some time but I am glad I chose to read it. Merchants of Doubt shows how a small group of people used and twisted science to purposefully delay public policy, and how this impacted the world. In addition to global warming, this book covers topics that I hadn't even thought of such as acid rain and DDT. In all, a well researched and well articulated book that I recommend."

The stories in this book explain how the creation of doubt and the spread of disinformation by individuals and groups slowed the regulation of key issues - tobacco, CFCs, pollution from coal-fired power plants and greenhouse gases etc. The book shows how ‘good’ people as well as ‘bad’ people can have a huge impact on the world...especially if they are organised, determined and have access to power. At times difficult and detailed read but well worth the effort. "

I’d have loved a little more style in the telling. Nonetheless, we all gotta eat our veggies, so roll up and learn how 3 scientists who’ve done no peer-reviewed research themselves since the ‘70s (Bill Nierenberg, Fred Seitz, and Fred Singer) have been able to launch dominant contrarian rightwing narratives on everything from secondhand smoking to missile defence to global warming.

Not exactly an uplifting story, but a necessary one.Throughout the book these four names continue to appear: Fred Seitz, Fred Singer, Bill Nierenberg, and Robert Jastrow - all noted by the author as the ""four horsemen"" of climate change deniers. Truly, these men seem to whisper in the ears of decision makers of the US, undoing much of what scientific theory is designed to build.Their motivation for this seems to be, as most contemporary problems are, keeping the money and power with those who currently have it - oil barons, corporate execs, investors.. all those who benefit from things remaining as they are.~~~Fred Seitz, Fred Singer, Bill Nierenberg, and Robert Jastrow had all served in high levels of science administrators where they had come to know admirals, generals, congressmen, senators, even presidents. They had also dealt extensively with the media so they knew how to get press coverage for their views, and how to pressure the media when they didn't. They used their scientific credentials to present themselves as authorities and they used their authority to try and discredit any science they didn't like. Over the course of more than 20 years, these men did almost no original scientific research on any of the issues on which they weighed in. Once they had been prominent researchers, but by the time they had turned to the topics of our story, they were mostly attacking the work and reputations of others. In fact, on every issue, they were on the wrong side of the scientific consensus...Yet for years the press quoted these men as experts and politicians listened to them using their claims as justification for inaction.Ch1, Doubt is our ProductThe goal was to fight science with science.. or at least, with the gaps and uncertainties in existing science and with scientific research that could be used to deflect attention from the main event. Like the magician who waves his right hand to distract attention from what he's doing with his left, the tobacco industry would fund distracting research.The industry defended its primary product, tobacco, by manufacturing something else: doubt about its harm. ""No proof"" became a mantra that they would use again in the 1990s when attention turned again to second hand smoke. It also became the mantra of nearly every campaign in the last quarter of the century to fight facts. For tobacco is not the end of our story, it is just the beginning. In the years to come, various groups and individuals began to challenge scientific evidence that threatened their commercial interests or ideological beliefs. Many of these campaigns involved the same strategies developed by the tobacco industry and some of them involved the same people. Ch2, Strategic Defense, Phony Facts, and the Creation of the George C Marshall InstituteCh3, Sowing the Seeds of Doubt: Acid RainRichard Nixon, a president not generally recalled as a visionary environmentalist, created the Environmental Protection Agency and signed into law several signature pieces of environmental legislation: The Clean Air Act extension, the Clean Water Act, the Endangered Species Act, and the National Environmental Policy Act. Things were changing though and within a few years Ronald Reagan would begin to shift the Republican Party away from both environmental preservation and regulation; a position that would separate the party from its historic environmentalism and put it on a collision course with science.In 1980, Ronald Raegan came to power in the US on a platform of reducing regulation, decreasing the reach of the federal government, and releasing the power of the private enterprise. ""Government"", the new president insisted, ""was not the solution but the problem.""In 1979, the White House Council on Environmental Quality had.. placed the value of air quality improvements, since the passage of Clean Air Act, at 21.4 billion dollars a year. Singer also presumed that the costs were mostly accrued in the present but the benefits in the future, and therefore the latter had to be discounted in order to make them commensurate with the former. That is to say, a dollar in the future is not worth as much to you as a dollar now, so you discount its value in your planning and decision making. How much you discount it depends in part on inflation but also on how much you value the future. Discounting would later become a huge issue in assessing the costs and benefits of stopping global warming as long term risks can be quickly written off with a sufficiently high discount rate.Using transferable emissions rights, the government would determine the maximum allowable pollution and then grant or sell the right to pollute to parties who could then use, sell, or trade those rights. In later years, emissions trading would be used to reduce acid pollution and today many people are looking to such a system to control the greenhouse gases that cause global warming. Yet economists and ordinary people know that markets do not always work. Indeed, many economists would say that pollution is an example of market failure. It's collateral damage is a hidden cost not reflected in the price of a given good or service. Milton Freedman, the modern guru of free market capitalism, had a name for such costs, albeit an innocuous one: He called them Neighborhood Effects. ""We don't know what's causing it"" became the official position of the Raegan administration despite 21 years of scientific work that demonstrated otherwise. ""We don't know"" was the mantra of the tobacco industry in staving off regulation of tobacco long after scientists had proven it's harms too. Conflict, it is sometimes said, makes good copy - and when a lonely scientist took up the right wing charge that acid rain might not be a serious problem, the press were quick to pick up his claims.Over the next 10 years, Gene E. Likens and his colleagues pursued the question of net forest health. In 2009 they spoke out frankly: ""Since 1982, the forest has not accumulated biomass. In fact, since 1997, the accumulation has been significantly negative. The forest was shrinking under siege from multiple onslaughts of climate change, alien species invasion, disease, mercury and salt pollution, landscape fragmentation, and continued acid rain. The sugar maple, beloved by both Canadians and New Englanders, is dying - and scientific research suggests that by 2076, the 300th birthday of the US - sugar maples will be extinct in large areas of the northern forest.If the US government had established a strong regulatory regime on acid emissions, then the industry may have done more to innovate. And if technological advancement had made it easier and cheaper to control emissions, then industrial resistance to tightening the caps, as time went on, would have lessened. And it might well have been easier to tighten the regulations over time, giving the forests the protection that science showed they really needed... One thing we do know for sure is that doubt mongering about acid rain, like doubt mongering about tobacco, led to delay... In the years that followed, the same strategy would be applied again and again and sometimes by the same people. Ch4, Constructing a Counter Narrative: the Fight over the Ozone HolePaul Crutzen, a brilliant Dutch atmospheric scientist, who would later dub the current period of Earth's history the Anthropocene because of human's extensive environmental impact, also presented a paper on chlorine at the Kyoto meeting.Everyone is entitled to an opinion, but when a scientist consistently rejects the weight of evidence and repeats arguments that have been thoroughly rebutted by his colleagues, we are entitled to ask what is really going on. From 1988 to 1995, Singer insisted that the Ozone research community was misleading the public about even the existence of Ozone depletion, let alone its origins. He argued in his 1989 national review article that researchers were doing this to line their own pockets and those of their graduate students by scaring those that could fund their research. Ch5, What's bad science? Who decides?: The Fight over Second Hand SmokeIn short, Bad Science was a compendium of attacks on science published in places like the Washington Times and written by staff of the Competitive Enterprise Institute. The articles weren't written by scientists and they didn't appear in peer reviewed scientific journals. Rather they appeared in media venues whose readers would be sympathetic to the Competitive Enterprise Institute's ideology...The goal wasn't to correct scientific mistakes and place regulation on a better footing, it was to undermine regulation by challenging the scientific foundation on which it would be built. It was to pretend that you wanted sound science when really you wanted no science at all - or at least no science that got in your way.Ch6, The Denial of Global WarmingConsidering all the other uncertainties that Shelling emphasized, his faith in the free market could have been viewed as surprising and his predictions have turned out to be entirely wrong. Fossil fuel use has risen dramatically over the past three decades even as Global Warming has accelerated. But if his prediction were true then there would be no need for government action. So this panel of worthies did not recommend a program of emissions reduction that might be phased in over time despite their own acknowledgement that the sooner we began the transition, the easier it would be. Instead they counciled research.Revelle's chapter on sea level rise warned of the possible disintegration of the West Antarctic Ice Sheet, which would release about 2 million cubic kilometers of ice before the remaining half of the ice sheet began to float. The resulting worldwide rise in sea level would be between 5 and 6 meters. The likely result: The oceans would flood all existing port facilities and other low lying coastal structures, extensive sections of the heavily farmed and densely populated river deltas of the world, major portions of the states of Florida and Louisiana, and large areas of many of the world's major cities. What did Roger Revelle believe about Global Warming in 1991? ""There is good reason to expect that because of the increase of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere there will be a climate warming. How big that warming will be is very difficult to say, probably somewhere between 2 and 3 degrees centigrade at the latitudes of the United States, probably a greater change in average change in higher latitudes and lesser change at lower latitudes. Whatever climate change there is will have a profound effect on some aspects of water resources."" The documentary record clearly shows that Roger Revelle did not change his mind.In June 1992, 108 heads of state, 2400 representatives of non-governmental organizations, and more than 10,000 onsite journalists converged in Rio along with 17,000 other individuals who would convene in a parallel NGO forum to address the problem of anthropogenic climate change yet it was unclear whether President Bush would even attend. At the last minute President George H.W. Bush flew to Rio De Genaro to sign the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change, which committed its signatures to preventing dangerous anthropogenic interference in the climate system. Bush then pledged to translate the written document into concrete action to protect the planet. By March 1994, 192 countries had signed onto the Framework Convention and it came into force. Like the Vienna Convention for the Protection of the Ozone layer, the UN Convention on climate change had no real teeth: it set no binding limits on emissions. It was an agreement in principle. Real limits would be determined later in a protocol that would be eventually signed in Kyoto, Japan, and with the threat that real limitations would soon be enforced, the Merchants of Doubt redoubled their efforts. Santer's panel had included 6 pages of discussion about uncertainty in the final text. But Bill Nierenberg knew all about altering scientific reports for political reasons so perhaps he followed the adage that the best defense is offense. Or perhaps he was guilty of mirror imaging as Team B had accused the CIA of in 1976, assuming his opponents thought and operated the way he did. Then Fred Seitz took the attack to the national media. In a letter published in the Wall Street Journal on June 12, 1996, he accused Ben Santer of fraud. ""In my more than 60 years as a member of the American scientific community, including my services as President of the National Academy of Sciences and the American Physical Society, I have never witnessed a more disturbing corruption of the peer review process than the events that led to this IPCC report."" Seitz repeated the Global Climate Coalition's charges that unauthorized changes to Chapter 8 had been made after it's acceptance in Madrid.  Bert Boland and Sir John Hotan also responded with a long letter defending Santer and the IPCC process. ""Frederick Seitz's article is completely without foundation. It makes serious allegations about the inter-governmental panel on climate change and about the scientists who contributed to its work, which has no basis in fact. Mr Seitz does not state the source of his material and we know that he did not check his facts, either with the IPCC officers or with any of the scientists involved."" This original text was edited out by the journal. We know how the journal edited the letters because Seitz's attack and the journal's weakening of the response so offended the officials of the American Meteorological Society and the University Corporation for Atmospheric Research that their boards agreed to publish an open letter to Ben Santer in the bulletin of the American Meteorological Society where they republished the letters in their entirety, showing how the journal had edited them.The over-the-top attacks on Santer began to have consequences for Nierenberg. In April Nierenberg had invited Tom Wigley to a conference he wanted to hold at Scripts that November on the costs and benefits of Global Warming, but Wigley smelled a rat: ""I have decided to withdraw from your November meeting. The reason for this is the letter you co-signed which appeared in BAMS (Bulletin of the American Meteorological Society). I have no desire to cooperate with anyone who endorses such an unmitigated collection of distortions and misinformation.""Eugene Linden, once an environment reporter for Time magazine, commented in his book Winds of Change that: ""Members of the media found themselves hounded by experts who conflated scientific diffidence with scientific uncertainty and who wrote outraged letters to the editor when a report didn't include their dissent. Editors evidently succumb to this pressure and reporting on climate in the United States became biased toward the skeptics and deniers because of it.""In July 1997, three months before the Kyoto Protocol was finalized, US Senators Robert Bird and Charles Hagle introduced a resolution blocking its adoption. Bird/Hagle passed the senate by a vote of 97 to 0. Scientifically, Global Warming was an established fact. Politically, Global Warming was dead.Ch7, Denial Rides Again: The Revisionist Attack on Rachel CarsonThe game here, as it was before, was to defend an extreme free market ideology. But in this case they did not just deny the facts of science, they denied the facts of history...If Carson was wrong, then the shift in orientation could have been wrong too. The contemporary environmental movement could have been shown to have been based on a fallacy, and the need for government intervention in the marketplace would have been refuted.The network of right wing foundations, the corporations that fund them, and the journalists who echo their claims have created a tremendous problem for American science. A recent academic study found that of the 56 environmentally skeptic books published in the 1990s, 92% were linked to these foundations.George Orwell coined the term ""Memory hole"" to denote a system that destroyed inconvenient facts and ""Newspeak"" for a language designed to constrain thought within politically acceptable bounds. Orwell understood that those in power will always seek to control history because whoever controls the past controls the present. So our cold warriors - Seitz, Singer, Jastrow, Neirenberg - who had dedicated their lives to fighting Soviet communism, joined forces with the self-appointed defenders of the free market to blame the messenger, to undermine science, to deny the truth and market doubt.Conclusion, of Free Speech and Free MarketsA third of all Americans think that Sadam Hussain was behind the attacks on Sept 11. Nearly a quarter think that there's no solid evidence that smoking kills. And as recently as 2007, 40% of Americans believe that scientific experts were still arguing about the reality of global warming. Who can blame us? Everywhere we turn, someone is questioning something and many of the important issues of our day are reduced to ""He said, she said, who knows?"" Any person could be forgiven for being confused. This cacophony of conflicting claims is particularly unhelpful when it comes to sorting out matters relating to science because science depends on evidence and not all positions are equally grounded in it.Ludwig von Mises, an Austrian aristocrat, was one of the founders of modern laissez faire economics. And this brings us to the crux of our story: the pivot around which these diverse actors came together. The link that unites the tobacco industry, conservative thinktanks, and scientists in our story is the defense of the free market. Throughout our story the people involved demanded the right to be heard, insisting that we the public had the right to hear both sides and that the media had an obligation to present it. They insisted this was only fair and democratic. ""If we do not carefully delineate the government's role in regulating danger, there is essentially no limit to how much government can ultimately control our lives. Today tobacco, tomorrow the Bill of Rights."" Sietz. Milton Friedman said much the same in Capitlism and Freedom - That economic freedom is as important as civic freedom because if you lose one, it is only a matter of time before you lose the other. And so one must defend free markets with the same vigor and vigilance as free speech, free religion, and free assembly. The billionaire investor George Soros has coined a term to describe this perspective: Free Market Fundamentalism. It is the belief not simply that free markets are the best way to run an economic system, but that free markets are the only way that will not ultimately destroy our other freedoms. The basic tenant of laissez faire that ""free and competitive markets bring supply and demand into equilibrium and thereby ensure the best allocation of resources"" is an axiom that turns out not to be true. Prices can be displaced from their equilibrium ideal for long periods of time as any American impacted by the ongoing housing market collapse can attest. Even Milton Friedman acknowledged that there may be external costs that markets fail to account for and pollution is the clearest example."
69,1596916109,http://goodreads.com/user/show/32553593-elliott-bignell,5,"This book has been a while in coming, and arrives none too soon. Anyone who has been chatting on the Internet's various science fora in recent years will have seen an odd phenomenon: Denialism. Various branches of science are under a systematic and eerily consistent PR attack vying for public opinion. If you have any experience with debating creationists, you'll find it almost impossible to miss that the exact same arguments and claims used by creationism are directed at climate science in an attempt to sell the idea that the science of anthropogenic warming is not ""settled"". If you are like me, you may have presumed that they are from the same people, and to a large degree this is true. It misses a very important part of the picture, though. This book provides that part.A small cadre of ideologically-motivated scientists, mainly long-since retired from doing any real science, have been honing a set of techniques for rhetorical attack on science for decades now and lending their status as ""scientists"" to anti-regulation campaigns of all kinds. Anyone familiar with debates on global warming will be familiar with the name of Singer. What they may not know is that Singer has been a prominent part of efforts to undermine science since the link between tobacco and smoking first solidified back in the 1950s and 1960s. Singer and a small number of other anti-Communist zealots have been politicising science that threatens to necessitate regulatory action ever since, trying to seed in the minds of the public and politicians the idea that ""the science is not settled"" and that it is motivated by a socialist agenda to extend the power of government.Singer is not the only character. Spencer is openly a creationist. Lindzen apparently denies the links between smoking and tobacco to this day. However, their names play only a walk-on part in this play. This book is more than anything else about Singer. Tobacco smoke, acid rain, ozone depletion, the flaws in SDI, passive smoking and now climate change - Singer has always been there, selling the idea that there is a scientific ""controversy"" while everyone really working in the field in question is yelling that something needs to be done right now. Always there, marketing Doubt. A RICO case actually found that the tobacco industry had conspired to keep scientific knowledge of the link with cancer suppressed, and the consequences are now working out. Those consequences do not yet appear to include the widespread discrediting in the public mind of the scientists who sold their sceptics' souls for ideological convenience. Well, this excellent book will hopefully help to correct that.This book argues - and I pick up on it because it articulates what I believed beforehand - that the media have played an ignoble role in the denial of science by applying a meretricious doctrine of ""balance"" which dictates that established science and marginal fruitloopery are entitled to equal time.. This, of course, is a doctrine that creationists have striven hard to sell. However, it rests upon the Fairness Doctrine which was quite properly introduced when broadcasting was considered to be a public good exploiting the public allocation of radio bandwidth. Back then, it was applied sensibly - no ""balance"" was deemed to be proper between Hitler and Churchill, even before the USA was forced into the war.It also documents that Singer has, ironically, evolved. His irrational modern arguments that we should not act to forestall problems unless they can be known with 100% certainty evolved after 1970, prior to which he apparently conceded the irrationality of such thinking, pondering whether Noah's compatriots had argued that technology would find a substitute for breathing and that the rising waters were not proof of a coming disaster!The authors are not working scientists but a historian of science and, it appears, a journalist writing habitually on science. This might be seen as a disqualification, but I would disagree. They are not explaining the science, for which there are oncologists and climatologists with deep expertise. They are examining the politicisation of a range of different science disciplines by a small cadre of free-market ideologues from outside, usually, the fields. This is more a work on the sociology of science and I would say that the authors are very adequately equipped for such an enquiry.This was an excellent read - thorough and clear, if perhaps a little dry. The authors restrain their sarcasm at the ideologically-driven lunacy of science-denial sometimes with visible effort, and the odd piece of ridicule slips through. Suits me fine! I zipped through it in a few commutes, mostly enjoying it but also wanting to slap someone. I thoroughly recommend it, although it might make you very, very angry. "
70,1596916109,http://goodreads.com/user/show/23180960-stephen-case,4,"I was asked a while ago by a local paper to comment on the issue of global warming. When I had difficulty reducing my views to a quotable byte, I wrote an editorial for the paper. (You can find it, along with some disappointing comments, here: http://daily-journal.com/archives/dj/....) In the editorial, I used the term ""manufacture a controversy,"" alluding to the fact that while the scientific consensus on global warming is established and has been for decades, there remains the perception for most people that climate change is not well understood and the science is questionable. This manufactured controversy is what Oreskes and Conway, two historians of science, explore in this book. In several exhaustively-researched chapters, they draw links between ""expert"" deniers of the dangers of tobacco, second-hand smoke, ozone layer depletion, acid rain, and finally global warming. In each of these cases, Oreskes and Conway argue, there was a clear scientific consensus deliberately attacked by a handful of skeptics. These attacks resulted in perceived controversy for the popular press and ultimately influenced politicians and policy—usually as an argument for not doing anything. The story the authors tell begins with the tobacco industry, which—as scientific evidence regarding the dangers of smoking and second-hand smoke mounted—enlisted individual scientists and publicity firms to mount a campaign of doubt, making it appear as though the scientific community was divided and more research needed to be done. Oreskes and Conway draw much of their evidence from documents that have been recently made public through the Legacy Tobacco Documents Library (http://legacy.library.ucsf.edu). After this, they argue, many of the scientists and organizations enlisted by the tobacco industry took the same approach to a wide variety of environmental topics, including and culminating with global warming. Popular perception is biased against the true scientific viewpoint by two factors: a “fair reporting” approach that placed the skeptics’ viewpoint (even when only held by a small minority) on equal footing with the mainline scientific opinion and the fact that skeptics published most of their work in the popular press while the evidence and research on global warming done by the actual scientific community appeared (and continues to appear) in peer-reviewed journals with very small audiences.So what's at play here? Do Oreskes and Conway have a conspiracy theory? No. What they have is a group of scientists who came to prominence during the Cold War and then, late in their careers and after their own research days were over, came to see environmentalism as the newest threat to American liberty. The common theme running through tobacco smoke, acid rain, DDT, ozone depletion, and now global warming is that each represents a market failure—a situation in which the true costs are hidden or not quantifiable by the free market. In such situations, government regulation is often necessary. The villains in Oreskes and Conway’s narrative are a small minority of scientists who did not want this to happen and so collaborated with industry, policy-makers, and the media to perpetuate a sense of controversy where the science was clear.The narrative is compelling. I recommended the chapter on global warming for a discussion group, and though each chapter is densely researched, a friend told me that it read for him like a murder mystery. The historical chapters show two historians of contemporary science at their finest. The concluding chapters, in which Oreskes and Conway offer their take on why controversy is created on these issues, blaming it on “free market fundamentalists” who cannot accept government regulation in any form and are willing to smear any science that disagrees with them through unscientific means, hit hard and—I feel—largely accurately. Finally, Oreskes and Conway offer some insight into why the public often goes along with this: a misunderstanding of how science actually works and a confusion between scientific consensus (attained) and absolute proof or clarity (never attained in science).Read it. Recommend it to your friends. It is easy to understand why the tobacco industry would want to manufacture doubt about the true costs of their products; it should be fairly easy to see why many today would want to do the same regarding the true cost of fossil fuels. This book connects the dots."

Naomi Oreskes & Erik Conway: 1) uncover the history of distraction, deception and doubt-propagation that companies have used for 50+ years to influence public opinion/action and 2) follow the trail of corporate money used to influence favorable public policy. They also explore the influence/manipulation of the media and think-tanks on both public and policy.With a chronological scope, the authors spend an in-depth chapter analyzing each of the following: the Tobacco Industry covering-up cigarette-cancer research in the 1950s and again in the 90s with second-hand smoke, the push for the Strategic Defense Initiative (Star Wars) in the late 70s-early 80s, the creation of doubt around acid rain research and creating a counter-narrative about the ozone hole (80s-90s), the denial of global warming (90s-present) and the present day revisionist-attack on Rachel Carson's history/legacy. As these doubt-merchants gained experience, they got better at their game. And we believe them. The astounding and horrifying aspect of the book is the realization that these disruptions were done intentionally, strategically and methodically out of self-serving interests. And we are easy to manipulate because we're (as a whole) ignorant about many things, distracted by media overloaded and generally to busy to be bothered. ""The protagonists of our story merchandised doubt because they realized... that doubt works. And it works in part because we have an erroneous view of science... History shows us clearly that science does not provide certainty. It does not provide proof. It only provides the consensus of experts based on the organized accumulation and scrutiny of evidence. Hearing 'both sides' of an issue [in the news media] makes sense when debating politics in a two-party system, but there's a problem when the framework is applied to science... Research produces evidence, which in time may settle the question (as it did as continental drift evolved into plate tectonics, which became established geological theory in the early 1970s). After that point, there are no 'sides.' There are simply accepted scientific knowledge. There may still be questions that remain unanswered -- to which scientists then turn their attention -- but for the question that has been answered, there is simply consensus of expert opinion on that particular matter. That is what scientific knowledge is."" The theme of the book (and of my outrage) can be best summarized by a quote from one of the last chapters: ""We take it for granted that great individuals -- Ghandi, Kennedy, Martin Luther King -- can have great positive impacts on the world. But, we are loathe to believe the same about negative impacts -- unless the individuals are obvious monsters like Hitler or Stalin. But, small numbers of people can have large, negative impacts, especially if they are organized, determined and have access to power."""
72,1596916109,http://goodreads.com/user/show/34325582-oldcanuck,0,"I read this book after a friend of mine commented, during a conversation we had where Rachel Carson was mentioned, that scientists ""had proven that she was wrong about DDT and that her science was flawed."" I was surprised by this because it has been such a long time since the book was published. I knew that Carson had been viciously attacked by some people when the book first came out but I thought the reasoning behind her book had since become completely accepted and who could get so mad at Rachel? This question rolled around in the back of my mind for a while and one day I decided to google ""current attacks on Rachel Carson"". Imagine my surprise when I found articles claiming that Rachel Carson was responsible for ""killing more people than Hitler"" and that her ban on DDT was responsible for ""millions and millions"" of deaths from malaria. I poked around a bit more and discovered this book ""Merchants of Doubt"". What a fascinating read. This book is well organized, well written, and extremely well annotated and footnoted within an inch of its life. As the title indicates, it takes the reader on an historical journey from the controversy surrounding tobacco smoke (is it really carcinogenic?), through the controversy around acid rain (does it really exist?), the controversy around the Star Wars project (it is possible to win a nuclear war and there is no such thing as nuclear winter) through to global warming (there is no such thing and if there were it would be a natural occurrence anyway). During the course of the previously mentioned conversation with my friend, we had both come to the conclusion that we didn't know anything about science and you couldn't trust anything scientists said because there were always other scientists saying the exact opposite. This book is an absolute must read for anyone who has ever allowed that thought to pass through their mind. The book gives a very clear explanation about how scientific research develops, the peer review process, the investigation by other scientists that may lead to modification of original research, and a final consensus in the scientific community. It explains very clearly how individual scientists can demand ""fair play"" air time and publication rights to deny scientific consensus on the above named subjects much as Holocaust deniers continue to claim today. Again, a must read for anyone who has ever been blinded by science on important issues of today. "
73,1596916109,http://goodreads.com/user/show/29706443-daniel,5,"I would give this book more than five stars if Goodreads allowed it. Without a doubt (no pun intended) this is one of the best books I have ever read on any topic. The quality of writing is not only exceptional by academic standards (admittedly a low bar), it's excellent by any standard. I was somewhat familiar with much of the content before reading the book, since I've read other books and articles that cite this one, and I've watched some of Naomi Oreskes' lectures on YouTube, but I still gained a lot by reading the whole thing. I was already familiar with the dishonesty of anti-science liars such as Rush Limbaugh, George Will, etc., but even so, to see the extent of their crimes against reason documented at such length comes as a bit of a shock. One wonders how it is possible that these enemies of civilization remain at large. If you've ever encountered the legion of amateur science deniers in real life or on the Web, and wondered where they get their nonsensical, counterfactual, and usually unsourced claims, this book lays it all out. Reading this book (and others like it) is not only a civic duty, it is essential to maintaining your sanity in a world full of truth-deniers. Every citizen needs a basic understanding of hazards to public health and/or the environment such as acid rain, DDT, tobacco, CFCs and the ozone layer, lead, mercury, and man-made climate change. But more importantly, every citizen needs to be aware of the orchestrated attacks on the scientific consensus around each of these threats to our well-being: who funds them, the rhetorical techniques they use to bamboozle the public and undermine the scientific process, how they intimidate individual scientists, and how to refute them.The same handful of influential science deniers have been consistently wrong about every topic they weighed in on without having any particular expertise, but they have managed to delay action to address a long series of threats to public health and the environment by years or decades. If you can't read the book right away, check out Manny's excellent review for more details on the revelation that awaits you."
74,1596916109,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2531665-charlene,5,"Exceptional. Put this book at the very top of your reading list. The authors provide a clear, stunning, and engaging history of how a handful of scientists were able to keep doubt alive during every occasion in which scientific evidence threatened to cut into a corporation's profit or a politician's proposed policy. These merchants of doubt were on the wrong side of history on every occasion. They didn't carry out their own scientific work. Rather they attacked the work of others as they attempted to convince the public that smoking does not kill, pollution does not cause acid rain, our seas are not rising, our glaciers are not melting because of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere caused by our fossil fuels, and DDT is good for the humans and the environment.This book gives a detailed account of the evidence for each of the above claims (i.e.., smoking kills), and a detailed account of how ""scientists,"" who were paid by the politicians and corporations in questions, twisted the data and even falsified documentation in order to stop the public from synthesizing the true scientific evidence into their knowledge base. Their tactic was always to confuse and keep the doubt alive. Some scientists for hire were extremely good at taking a Machiavellian approach to their jobs. This is why it appears as if there is a debate over global warming, when indeed there is not. Drawing a line through the arguments of the past and the arguments now, and demonstrating a specific pattern used by a handful of scientists, provided a strong and clear understanding of how false information was able to remain a viable option for society for so long. The authors have put all the science in one place, as well as the way that science was twisted and misused, so that anyone reading this book will finally understand exactly what scientists have said about tobacco use, pollution, global warming, etc. This book, so thoroughly researched, is poised to become the definitive source on how to prepare for debates about climate change and other important issues. I can imagine people saying, ""Have you read Merchants of Doubt? If not, you are not qualified to have this discussion. We can revisit after you are up to speed."" Absolutely a must read."
75,1596916109,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1069092-brad,4,"This is a thoroughly appalling book. This is a book that you have to take a breather when you complete a chapter lest your heart explode in frustration. This is a book about everything wrong with America today: the spread of scientific misinformation and the disease of scientific illiteracy.The criminals here, as they are for so many things, are right wing free market ideologues who, when Communism inevitably failed, turned to Environmental Protection as their new enemy. As the science was overwhelming concluding that smoking killed, the secondhand smoke was toxic, that acid rain and the ozone hole were real and dangerous and finally – and most troubling – that climate change is occurring and human activities are at fault, these Merchants of Doubt, led by a small cadre of Cold War era physicists (bona fide scientists, yes, but with no expertise whatsoever in the aforementioned) instigated a wide spread plan to disseminate misinformation, lies and bad science. It was they who instilled the ideas of doubt regarding the realities of climate change, the carcinogenic nature of tobacco, pollutants and pesticides where there was no doubt before. Because if these things were true – and they were mostly certainly true – that could only mean one thing: the free market had failed. That there were no incentives for pollution control and protections and that only one thing – the government and its regulations – could stop the spread of the poisons. Rather than accept that reality, they created their own and the media, the politicians, the people bought it.Scientific illiteracy is a death sentence. We live in a country where 80% think we should label food that contains DNA (?), where 40% like climate change is a hoax, where 25% think smoking is safe. Where vaccine preventable diseases are recurring. The Merchants of Doubt have capitalized on our ignorance. The media treats science as they do politics: that each side of a debate should be given equal weight. But that isn’t how science works. Leaving us with a reality that is very depressing indeed. . .

They trace its birth from early (and recently revived) attempts to discredit Rachael Carson and the dangers of DDT to wildlife, even if that first battle was lost by the nascent Merchants almost before it had begun. A Game Plan is PerfectedIn 1953 Tobacco executives got together and initiated a counter-offensive against the emerging scientific evidence that smoking was terrible for your health. The industry tried numerous strategies which are detailed in the book but coalesced around one, overarching approach. The tobacco industry’s key insight: that you could use normal scientific uncertainty to undermine the status of actual scientific knowledge.This included a host of tactics such as funding oppositional research, actually creating fake but legitimate sounding journals and advocacy groups, taking advantage of journalism's tendency to give equal weight as opposed to an accurate weight and many others which the authors (and others) termed the ""Tobacco strategy"". Ultimately, the goal of this strategy is to never let the discussion center on best policies or actions, instead one must keep the debate around the actual science itself (and claim this has to be ""settled"" before policy can be even discussed, let alone attempted)....For the rest check out my full review."
77,1596916109,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1641357-alexa,4,"This is an important and potentially thrilling book. I can imagine the material (a cabal of ex-scientists seeks to discredit the most important scientific findings affecting our world and health. The book asserts that scientific findings on smoking, global warming, the likely effectiveness of Reagan's ""Star Wars program"", asbestos, hole in the ozone, and more, are being denied or obscured for mysterious reasons. In the hands of Le Carre or another mystery writer this would be gripping and compelling fodder for a plot. Of course this isn't fiction, and as such the authors need to explain every concept, justify every accusation, site the references for their deductions etc. I became totally convinced about the validity of the scientific findings the cabal sought to shine doubt on, the effectivenesss of the ploy, and the reasons (largely misguided protection of the ""free market system."") they did so. And it was dry, and it was hard to read, and I wish I could give it 5 stars but you'd need to be more interested in the scientific details of these many topics to just LOVE this book. So, important and valuable yes, and entertaining, a good read - sorta. "

Marshall Institute, the Oregon Institute, the Heartland Institute, or the scientists that they secretly fund -- who pen a large fraction of the articles and opinion pieces attacking climate change (and the science of acid rain, ozone depletion, DDT, and secondhand smoke in years past) -- are engaged in a disinterested, objective search for the truth. Or if you just wanna see how these industry proxies succeeded in sowing doubt about the science for so long.The authors present a good deal of new information here, culled in part from their analysis of hundreds of thousands of tobacco-litigation records, and documented in over 60 pages of endnotes. Even more impressive, they managed to organize all this information into a highly readable and even entertaining(!) historical narrative."
79,1596916109,http://goodreads.com/user/show/447078-noel,5,"Astounding!! A well-written and documented account of how a small group of ideological ""Cold Warriors"", who were themselves accomplished scientists, conspired to convince the public and congress to reject the undeniable science that showed causal relationships between coal burning and acid rain, smoking and cancer, second hand smoke and health problems in children, CFCs and the ozone hole, fossil fuel combustion and global warming, and just for fun they decided to demonize Rachel Carson nearly 50 years after-the-fact!! Oreskes and Conway get into the details of the motivations of this group of scientists and the role of the media in allowing these doubt-mongers to thwart any sort of environmental regulation. This is a good account of how science should and does work, and about how well-funded ideologues can exploit the inherent uncertainty of science to advance personal agendas. Merchants of Doubt is simultaneously fascinating, frightening and infuriating!! "
80,1596916109,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4107962-scott-gilman,4,"What journalists Naomi Oreskes and Erik M. Conway accomplish in Merchants of Doubt: How a Handful of Scientists Obscured the Truth on Issues from Tobacco Smoke to Global Warming is expose how doubt and uncertainty have been manipulated to distort scientific judgment–to the detriment of peoples’ health and to the physical well-being of our climate and environment.The writers’ research into a handful of scientists–Cold War veterans, mostly physicists, who earned their status and reputations from the atomic bomb program–is exhaustive and at times so particular and exact that it can make this book a challenging read.Yet they take this approach in order to make their arguments iron-tight. By exposing every speech, letter, note, article review and correspondence they can get their hands on, the authors show how this group pushed forward their own agenda to stymie action, especially in the form of government regulation, in response to second-hand smoke, acid rain, ozone destruction and climate change.The writers do an excellent job throughout the book explaning the tenets and realities of science and the scientific process. This book, in fact, functions as a history of modern science. We are reminded, over and over, that doubt and uncertainty are a key ingredient of the scientific process; we don’t live in a world of absolute certainty. And things change as we learn more. That is natural and expected. Peer review, the long and extensive process whose function is to mitigate human error and to ensure the rigors of scientific study, is maintained and practiced precisely so that scientific learnings can be made with as much certainty, clarity and confidence as possible.To claim that error in scientific study, or the remaining existence of doubt, or the presence of unknowns, especially with the impossible task of predicting the future, taints scientific judgement and knowledge beyond repair is an insult to science itself, and worse, a blatant ploy of propaganda that turns the strength of scientific exploration against itself. It’s mischievous, and its results can be disastrous, even life-threatening.These rogue scientists, who took their Cold War mentalities and so-called defense of freedom and wariness authoritarian rule way too far, had helpers, if unwitting ones. In a critique of the news media that still resonates, the authors explain how the construct of journalistic balance, of showing both sides, should not be applied to scientific judgement and study.In the case of global warming, it’s neither fair or accurate to present both sides equally of a debate that has long been settled. Thousands of scientists, with the data and studies to back themselves up, have proven that climate change is real, is here and is caused by human activity. On the other side, a handful of rogue scientists, usually with ties to the fossil fuel industry or with connections to anti-regulation political operations, try to argue there is doubt about the science, that we’re better off waiting to see what happens, that the costs of doing something outweigh the benefits of doing nothing.To present these two so-called arguments with equal balance is a gargantuan distortion of reality and a misrepresentation of what the science tells us. Tobacco companies and their minions long knew about the risks of smoking and the harmful impacts of second-hand smoke. But their years of denials and obfuscation yielded that much more in sales and revenue while people smoked themselves and others to death.The same is happening with our planet.There is a deep psychological study to be made of the fear we have of changing our behavior, both as individuals and as a society. We don’t want to change, we fear it, and we also don’t want to make ourselves uncomfortable, to sacrifice, to give up what we have for the benefit of other people and the planet. That study is not what this book is about, but we get taken there, because the book does show that the science is conclusive. And that we ignore science at our own peril. We don’t have to and shouldn’t question science: science, through its own methods and peer review, does that for itself.And now we sit here during a pandemic, still questioning science. The fears humans have of change, of fear itself, of uncertainty, and our discomfort of being asked or forced to do things we may not want to, are fully on display.It is not the task of scientists to change human behavior. But scientists are regularly delivering to us the news about our health and our planet, whether that news is good or not. Hopefully the pandemic can help restore our public faith in science, but there is reason for skepticism. We are impatient, and every time we hear of different things about the virus, touch this or don’t, wear a mask or don’t, the virus does this but not that, it triggers the warning signals that years of so-called balanced reporting has taught us to keep at the ready when being presented with the evolving nature of scientific study.We need to grow up. Humans have accomplished so much, in technology and medicine, because of the scientific process. Government investment and management, at least in the United States, has done everything from landing a man on the moon to developing our highway system. It will take a government-level response to help us fix climate change, just as it did to ban DDT and fully reign in the tobacco industry.Uncertainty and doubt are part of the human condition. They can help us grow, and learn, and become better people and citizens. They should not be used as tools to further an agenda or to confuse us, but they are highly effective tools at doing so, as this book so clearly and thoroughly demonstrates.If we are going to get out of this, whether that ‘this’ is the pandemic or climate change, we’ll need the direction and expertise of scientists. Our lives literally depend on them."

With meticulous, well-documented research, Oreskes and Conway document the systematic deceptions promulgated by the smoking, fossil fuel, and other industries to subvert a free market so that their killing people and destroying the globe does not cut into profits. It covers smoking, acid rain, the ozone hole, pesticides, and global warming. Although the book does not contain the 2015 revelation that Exxon knew for decades -- even as they spent millions claiming otherwise -- that global warming was as bad as scientists had always said, the book is not dated.

I recommend it highly as those of us who are not scientists need to understand the process. But we also need to know how to tell vested interest from scientific honesty.
