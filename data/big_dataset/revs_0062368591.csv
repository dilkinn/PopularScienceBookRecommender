Carol Anne Freeling was certainly right when she said, “They’re hee-ur,” well maybe not enraged spirits, but there are certainly plenty of entities present to which we have paid insufficient attention. Maybe Regan MacNeil was closer to the mark in proclaiming “We are legion.” 
 When Orson Welles said “We’re born alone, we live alone, we die alone,” he was mistaken. Even when we are alone, we are never alone. We exist in symbiosis—a wonderful term that refers to different organisms living together. Some animals are colonized by microbes while they are still unfertilized eggs; others pick up their first partners at the moment of birth. We then proceed through our lives in their presence. When we eat, so do they. When we travel, they come along. When we die, they consume us. Every one of us is a zoo in our own right—a colony enclosed within a single body. A multi-species collection. An entire world. 
Trying to map what it is to be a physical human being, in something like the  Human Genome Project, is a daunting task. But our genes tell only part of our story, like a novel with a beginning and ending but no middle. That middle is taken up by the vast array of other life that exists within our bodies. While the guests we harbor may not necessarily be in league with Satan, they are a mixed lot. They mean us no harm, particularly, and we have evolved very workable symbiotic relationships with them, but they are not necessarily our friends either. They took up residence for their own benefit and will stick around and provide benefits to us only as long as we provide what they need, like that girl/boy friend you remember with gritted teeth.I won’t say this book will blow your mind, but this is your brainAnd it’s not even Mardi Gras – from the Brain Association of MississippiThis is your brain after reading this bookShame about that haircut[In the interest of full disclosure, it should be known that every day when my wife was reading this book, she would walk in the door and tell me of yet another thing she had read that had totally blown her mind. Not that my mind didn't go Ka-Boom when I read it. It certainly it. But hers was blown first. I only steal from the best. ]I Contain Multitudes will change how you understand not only the human body, but all the biota on the planet, hell, the universe. It will help you understand how it can happen that diseases like the flu can adapt so quickly to our latest attempts to stamp them out. It will help you understand why coral reefs are dying. It will give you some new words that help keep the new knowledge manageable. (My favorite is dysbiosis which is what it sounds like, a biological parallel to dystopia, with a hint of enforced disorganization.) It will expand your appreciation for how microbial biology works within people and in the world. It will offer you hope that there can be a future in which many of our maladies will not only be diagnosable, but will be treatable with the introduction of the right, specific probiotic. It will do your dishes and massage your feet. Well, ok, not the last two, but KABOOM, big new look-at-the-world stuff. Ok, you biologist types, pre-med, med, post med, anti-med, wearers of white lab coats, whatever the length, you know this stuff, at least I hope you do. But for most of the rest of us it is indeed a big change, a new layer of reality, well maybe not entirely new, but new enough to go KABOOM!Our intro to the world of which Yong writes, antibiotics, is probably akin to the one WW II bombadiers had through their bombsites. Amazing invention/discovery, antibiotics. They do a great job of wiping out pathogens, the nasties that make us ill, well, some of them anyway. Other harmful microbial types, the viral ones, roll their eyes at incoming antibiotics and keep on with what they are up to. However, as with items dropped from passing aircraft, the use of antibiotics entails considerable collateral damage, as the human body is a container for a vast array of microbial life. One might well envision millions of non-pathogenic residents shaking their fists as the incomings not only wipe out the harmful bugs, but vast numbers of the helpful ones as well. Ed Yong offers a more on-the-ground look, filling us in on what is actually going on inside, and how this part of what’s inside relates to that other part.If these folks can have an entire civilization inside a locker, just imagine what might develop in your liver or large intestine.If you don’t know who Ed Yong is, it’s a good bet that you will before too long. Yong is a popular science guy, a Neal DeGrasse Tyson, Bill Nye, Mary Roach, Jacques Cousteau, David Attenborough, Carl Sagan sort, a person who can take the wild, wonderful and fascinating things that are going on in the world of science and distill them all down for public consumption without making viewers’ or readers’ eyes glaze over, or listeners’ ears suddenly clog, without making you feel like an ill-educated dolt, and he accomplishes this with enough humor to produce a fair number of smiles and an occasional LOL. (Not in Mary Roach’s league for humor, but hey, who is?) He is an award-winning science writer at The Atlantic, whose work has appeared in a wide range of publications, from The New York Times to Nature, from The Guardian to Wired, from Slate to Scientific American, and on and on. He splits his time between London and DC, and I would not be at all surprised if he dashes back and forth in a TARDIS. I have provided links in EXTRA STUFF that will lead you down rabbit holes of fun material from Yong that may take you a while to leave.Ed Yong - From SpeakerpediaAmong the many surprises you will encounter here are a squid with its own high-beams, the microbial advantage of vaginal birth, the impact of gut microbes on mood, why a third of human milk is set aside for our guests (protection payments?), the relationship between the US Navy and mucus, why no man may be an island, but we may be archipelagos, and vats more. There is serious consideration given to how our relationships with this invisible world evolved:
…animals emerged in a world that had already been teeming with microbes for billions of years. They were the rulers of the planet long before we arrived. And when we did arrive, of course we evolved ways of interacting with the microbes around us. It would be absurd not to, like moving into a new city wearing a blindfold, earplugs, and a muzzle. Besides, microbes weren’t just unavoidable: they were useful. They fed the pioneering animals. Their presence also provided valuable cues to areas rich in nutrients, to temperatures conducive to life, or flat surfaces upon which to settle. By sensing these cues, pioneering animals gained valuable information about the world around them…hints of those ancient interactions still abound today.
 “It all depends.” As if life wasn’t complicated enough. Don’t you just love it when you are looking for help and the person you are asking responds with “It all depends.” And it really does, and it really will. What will be different, though, will be that your caregiver will have a much better idea than most caregivers can possibly have today. They will be able to look at a profile from a type of blood test and match potential solutions to the bacteria living in your gut, or wherever else in your two-legged bacteria condo might pertain. This knowledge is still in its infancy – at least a broad knowledge, but it is coming, and has the potential to make meaningful improvements in our health.
As microbiologist Patrice Cani told me, “The future will be a la carte.”And in this a la carte future, we won’t have to stop at picking the right bacteria for the job. Some scientists are picking the right genes for the job, and combining them into artisanal bacteria. Rather than just recruiting species with the right abilities, they are tinkering with the microbes themselves to endow them with new skills. 
Balance – from Explainxkcd.comThis raises some concerns, although they do not get a lot of attention here. If scientists can develop designer probiota to ameliorate suffering, there will always be evil-doers eager to use new technology to make designer biota intended to act as pathogens. In fact that is pretty much my sole gripe about this book. I wish more space had been devoted to the potential dangers of this advancing treatment modality. Just ask yourself, What would ISIS do?The title of Ed Yong’s book may not be up there with The Selfish Gene, Silent Spring, or Guns, Germs and Steel but what it lacks in snappy-ness it more than makes up for in content. This is a smart, readable explanation of one of the major ongoing scientific revolutions of our time. If you look deep inside yourself you will know that this is absolutely must-read material.

1,0062368591,http://goodreads.com/user/show/48650982-always-pouting,4,"I feel like this book really exemplifies what I want from a science book written for a mass audience. It made everything really accessible and easy to understand without sacrificing on providing details or explanations. It provides a lot of citations so I can go look up the specific research papers and experiments mentioned that are of most interest to me, which I did. It also just connected research to larger ideas and theories for why things work the way they do. I think the whole point of science and the interest in it has to do with its ability to provide insight and answers into the why of things, at least for me. I also think Yong was really good about explaining the limitations of the research while also making the reader excited about where things could potentially go. Like I think it can be quite hard to straddle that line between talking about the exciting potential of something while also being clear that it might not go anywhere and that there's a lot of complexity and limitation in science. Also he mentioned one of my favorite books of all time, The Vital Question: Energy, Evolution, and the Origins of Complex Life, at the beginning so that automatically made me like the author a lot more. Anyways I really enjoyed this, I know I've been reading a lot of non-fiction so far this year, and this has definitely been one of the best ones so fat this year."
2,0062368591,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3978225-carol,5,"For my entire hospital career I have worked in oncology, where I have been part of teams taking care of people with cancer. Frequently patients have “neutropenic fevers,” a condition considered to be potentially harmful and almost always requiring admission to the hospital. Neutrophils are those brave little white blood cells that go out into our bodies and do battle with all the nasty things our bodies are exposed to every day. Neutropenia means the patient has none of those cells to speak of (and this is why herd immunity and vaccines are important). We culture blood and urine, scan lungs, treat with antibiotics, and monitor for a few days to see if any microbes grow out in cultures. We teach people to fastidiously handwash, and avoid people who are sick. We make them wear masks in the hallways, in order to filter out airborne viruses. Their rooms have special filtration systems. We encourage them to make safe food choices, avoiding foods that can’t be washed or scrubbed clean, or might be undercooked. And you want to know the kicker? If these patients are infected, it’s usually because of microbes in their own body have run amok and caused infection.You know what else is in the hospital? Microbes. Tons of antibiotic-resistant microbes, hanging out in patient bodies and everywhere else. Once someone is cultured positive for these microbes, they stay on “isolation” for the duration of the visit--and sometimes for life in the case of microbes resistant to all antibiotics--in the (vain) hopes that staff, visitors and patients won’t go moving those resistant microbes around the hospital. A shift where I don’t where a yellow isolation gown to go into these rooms is pretty unusual.Yong made my little grey cells stretch and reach, and now I have yet more ways to think about microbes, and I dearly wish he would re-write this book–maybe in magazine form–every couple years so I can keep up with all the interesting research. Like David Quammen, Yong doesn’t just stick to one branch of research science; he wanders around many fields as he explores the impact microbes have made on us. He’ll first have you thinking about their sheer evolutionary weight (literally and figuratively), reminding us that we evolved in context of a microbe landscape, not the other way round (and some thought apes were a stretch). Like living on a planet where most of the water is saltwater, it makes sense that microbes would impact the evolution of life.Yong walks the reader through some of the science that show how animals evolved to use microbes (and perhaps vice versa?). Some are evolutionary, some genetic, some macro. There’s a lovely experiment where a glowing squid developed a sequestered area for those microbes–can’t set them free in the body, of course, so you have to create a special compartment.In other words, I highly recommend this book. It’s quite well researched and documented, with extensive citations. There’s a bibliography and index, for those that want to delve further or pick and choose. As a further note, I’ll say that I always appreciate researchers/writers who express appreciation for those they interview and follow, without being fawning, and Yong does a nice job with that as well. There are parts I really liked, parts I liked less, parts where someone should have trimmed his descriptive writing just a tad, but any book that keeps me thinking about it months later is a five star read.I’m going to put my detailed book report below page break at my wordpress site ( https://clsiewert.wordpress.com/2019/...) with notes heavily on the medical and the ocean science. There’s also some interesting stuff about insects, for those who might lean that way, and trees."

The first associations are not symbiosis and better health but infection and disease because the negative image is over-represented. Hygiene and health are essential, but the benefits of invisible companions are far too rarely highlighted and the beneficial minis outweigh the pests by far. Moreover, understanding the mechanisms is necessary for good health, built on a microorganism friendly diet.Without a symbiosis with a few pounds of microorganisms that are spread over and through the whole body, human life would not be possible, metabolic processes would stop death would be inevitable. A co-evolution has made all higher living beings dependent on the colonizers because they defend humans against enemy invaders which could harm their host. Of course, they also assist with bodily functions because they bring benefits to them so that the motivation for the defense help is not purely altruistic. They form a second front against attackers and it are often the human eaters themselves who are to blame when they wreck their microflora and lose the second shield because of permanently unhealthy nom nom.The coevolution of higher life with invisible helpers is long and has usually developed into a symbiosis. Much has happened since the first bacterium settled in a higher being while it was itself being altered by a virus etc.The ever more severe human intervention in this cycle has led to problems within less than 75 years. Since the advent of antibiotics and serial mass production of drugs, allergies, food sensitivities, autoimmune diseases, multidrug-resistant germs, lifestyle diseases, etc. are on the rise. How much of this is related to the destruction of the natural balance in the body, can be difficult to estimate due to a lack of studies. A one-sided diet with an excessive intake of antibiotics in addition to various other drugs is an essential factor that turns the symbiosis into a dysbiosis.Many drugs include, as a side effect, a mass extinction combined with a collapse of the miniaturized social order, civil wars and a lengthy reconstruction of it. With medicine and hygiene, much money can be made and as a result, super-pathogens grow in hospitals, while chemical gangs in the body of the patients decimate the defense forces of the body.Therapies with alternative and gentler drugs would be a new competitive and biological disinfectant and more expensive than artificial chemicals in the short term without including long-time costs. The patients pay for this with their health and sometimes life.The potential market with tailor-made probiotics and the manipulation and improvement of microfauna with genetically modified organisms is a future-oriented industry. As soon as enough bucks are made with conventional medicine, the Big Players will enter it. Until then it will be vilified and kept down.Actually the effort, according to the standards of medical economics, would not be responsible. Individualized medicine would have to first check the patients for potential vulnerabilities in their microbiome and then create a tailored therapy for them. A great alternative for rich people, but all others continue to receive the standard procedure of conventional treatment that kills friend and foe alike.If one eats microbe-hostile, one gets problems because a healthy, natural and balanced diet ensures a stable and robust micro-environment. Industrially highly processed and unhealthy food kills many of the little helpers and in their places settle less species-rich constellations, sometimes almost monocultures of dodgy creaturs. These not only damage health in addition to the unhealthy diet but also ensure that the desire for excessive and destructive gluttony with junk food never breaks off in the brain. Their interest in a steady supply is justified. A dietary change to fresh, low-fat, salt-reduced and sugar-free diets could significantly reduce their intake. Everyone has to make a choice themselves. Fit and peaceful armies that have lived and protected us for eons or, alternatively, mercenary junkie armies with dubious loyalty, prone to excesses and arson. One willingly lets them move around in the heartland until one loses control over them or they desert and begin dismantling oneself from within. Many times, a supposed protective power has in retrospect proved to be the worst enemy.The brain partakes at every meal and accordingly, the performance can be expanded or reduced. Not only the body feels sluggish after too much food, but the gray cells are overwhelmed too. It is not so much the energy used in digestion or the inertia that sets in with permanent overeating. Much more the fuel of the brain is of poor quality. In the car or an expensive machine, one would not pour substandard gasoline or cheap oil. This mentality does not apply to one's own body. From one-sided nutrition with inferior food of low quality less valuable substances can be extracted, which would be necessary for optimal brain function. One eats oneself dumb.A wiki walk can be as refreshing to the mind as a walk through nature in this completely overrated real-life outside books: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microbiota"
4,0062368591,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3427339-jeffrey-keeten,5,"”The latest estimates suggest that we have around 30 trillion human cells and 39 trillion microbial ones – a roughly even split. Even these numbers are inexact, but that does not really matter: by any reckoning, we contain multitudes.”“Perhaps it is less that I contain multitudes and more that I am multitudes.”I realized, as I was reading this book, that I have not had antibiotics in over twenty-five years. When I shared that information with my friends, the reactions were anywhere from “Wow” to “that is impossible.” Those reactions indicated to me how overly reliant we have become on antibiotics to fight what we perceive to be bad microbes. Of course, antibiotics are indiscriminate in what they kill. They are definitely a kill-them-all-and-let-Odin-sort-them-out kind of killer. ”But antibiotics are shock-and-awe weapons. They kill the bacteria we want as well as those we don’t – an approach that’s like nuking a city to deal with a rat. We don’t even need to see the rat to begin the massacre: many antibiotics are prescribed needlessly to treat viral infections they have no hope of countering.”I don’t get sick very often, and when I do, I seem to get sick to a lesser extent than do other people who are suffering from the same malady. Lucky genetics or maybe I’ve got a well balanced microbiome. I grew up on a farm and was exposed to a lot of microbes, more than the average person. In fact, one of the problems that is plaguing the first world is the fact that a greater percentage of people are not exposed to animals, a great source of useful microbes, or even just the outdoors, where we encounter microbes, bad and good, that help us format a diverse microbiome. They live in concrete worlds that are beneficial to health in the short term, but bad for health in the long term. They don’t run a gauntlet of infectious diseases that actually make them more resilient to illnesses. Their immune systems lack experience and become jumpy, overreacting to allergies and other minor threats. I think we may discover that microbes hold the key to all of our health issues. Big Brother might be watching us go about our daily lives, but what about the control imposed by the Orwellian, brainless, single-cell organisms inside of us? What we eat may not always be our idea. I’ve always been a bit wary of being manipulated by my own hormones, but what if I’m being manipulated by the microbes in my digestive tract as to what foods I like? ”Different microbes fare better on certain diets. Some are peerless at digesting plant fibres. Others thrive on fats. When you choose your meals, you are also choosing which bacteria get fed, and which get an advantage over their peers. But they don’t have to sit there and graciously await your decision. As we have seen, bacteria have ways of hacking into the nervous system. If they released dopamine, a chemical involved in feelings of pleasure and reward, when you ate the ‘right’ things, could they potentially train you to choose certain foods over others? Do they get a say in your menu picks?”So lean people have different levels of certain microbes in their digestive tract than overweight people. They tend to have a more balanced diet, heavy in veggies and fruits. Wonderful news, right? So to lose weight, all we have to do is take microbes from lean people and put them in overweight people. If only it were that easy. The problem is, those lean, mean producing microbes need to eat, so if the overweight person doesn’t change his diet and feed those microbes what they want to eat, they starve. This is, of course, an oversimplification of all the issues that go into trying to improve or change a microbiome, but the possibilities, with further research, are encouraging. I know we all want the magic pill that doesn’t require us to change our lifestyle or food choices, but what if your food preferences are being dictated by a microbe that has hijacked your nervous system to manipulate you into feeding it what it wants? That to me is sort of like being possessed by a demon. “‘America is a constipated nation,’ he said, indelicately. ‘If you pass small stools, you have big hospitals.’” If I miss a day not passing a bowel movement, I get annoyed. I like it when my intestinal tract is working like a well-oiled machine. I want the outgoing to keep up with the incoming. Nothing makes me feel less healthy than to think of BM hanging out in my intestinal tract any longer than it has to. When my digestive tract is working the way I want it to, it is operating to the theme song of Rawhide.
”Rollin', rollin', rollin'Rollin', rollin', rollin'Rollin', rollin', rollin'Rollin', rollin', rollin'RawhideShe rollin', rollin', rollin'Though the streams are swollenKeep them doggies rollin', rawhideThrough rain an' wind an' weatherHellbent for leatherMove 'em on, head 'em upHead 'em up, move 'em onMove 'em on, head 'em upRawhide.”
 We are coming out of an era where we were convinced that any microbe was a bad microbe and finally are starting to embrace the idea that some microbes are not only good for us but essential. We pick up microbes from the people around us, and some of those microbes get added to our microbiome. I was reading this article, titled Your Partner could affect Your Microbiome, about a study conducted on heterosexual couples to see how much influence each had on the other’s microbiome. ”After testing the samples, the researchers noted that microbes had been swapped between couples to a significant enough extent that computer algorithms were able to link a person to their partner with an accuracy of 86 percent.” Makes me wonder about the 14%: so how much interaction do you have with your partner? The next thought, of course, is to think about the fact that your partner also brings with her the microbes received from past partners, and now those microbes have been shared with you. *Shudder* It is probably best not to think about it. I came away from reading this book thinking that microbes might provide solutions to many health issues that have plagued us for generations, such as heart disease, cancer, obesity, and autoimmune disorders. Microbes have the ability to adapt and borrow from other microbes and change their makeup and purpose. The possibilities are, therefore, endless for us to find elusive cures hidden right in the microscopic multitudes within us. We have used microbes to dengue-fever proof mosquitoes and to save skin infected frogs from Amphibiageddon. My question is, can we use some of those breakthroughs to save the bees and potentially even the human race? The sky's the limit, and only with the very recent change in mindset about microbes have we begun to explore the potential. We have one great advantage…we know microbes exist! So take care of your microbiome, and start by reading this fascinating book. You will look at the world you can’t see with microscopic eyes.

5,0062368591,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1237196-petra-x,0,"Update: Antibiotics and obesity. It is routine in the US (although banned in the UK and Canada) to give cows, pigs, chickens etc low doses of antibiotics in order to fatten them up. No one knows why the antibiotics make them gain weight on the same amount of food, but they do. There is no reason to suppose that we are any different. The mechanism has to do with altering the biome, the microbes in the body, but how long the effect lasts isn't known, it might be a lifetime thing.Antibiotics and resistance. We are told that we are overprescribed antibiotics and that is causing resistance, but the amount of antibiotics any individual gets is absolutely minor compared to the amount that we consume. Not only consume from meat, but since animal droppings are used for fertilizer, perhaps from our bread and vegetables and water too. It reminds me of recycling and the emphasis on all of us individuals doing it. However, 98% of all waste is industrial, retail and from restaurants. Go to many supermarkets and they charge you for a plastic bag (if they even have them), go to a 'green' supermarket like Whole Foods and they give a paper one. Then look at the produce, it's packed in plastic, the meat is in styrofoam, the deli salads in plastic, the knife and fork you got to eat them with are plastic, the coffe cup (recyclable!) has a plastic lid, the bottle of juice is probably plastic but the straw is paper. Plastic is cheap and convenient, clean, easy to store and keeps things fresh. Why change if you can make people feel they are the problem and that you are helping them to do the right thing? It's just clever marketing. They are the 98% of the problem and until they address the issues of pollution and climate change in their own industries and stores, no matter how hard we try, we will only make ... 2% of a difference.____________________Schizophrenia used to be blamed on cold mothers, autism likewise, it was the mother's fault. We've moved on now to proving it is the mother getting flu or measles (why didn't she get vaccinated, oh how could she do this and risk inflicting her child.... dadadada. Oh no she couldnt' get vaccinated because that causes.... dadadada).   ""Patterson had read that pregnant women who incur serious infections, like flu or measles, are more likely to have kids with autism and schizophrenia. He thought that a mother's immune responses might somehow affect the development of her baby's brain. He just didn't know how."".......... ""And they realised that Patterson's mice had gut problems in common with actual autistic children: both were likely to have diarrhoea and other gastrointestinal disorders, and both harboured unusual comunities of gut bicrobes. Perhaps, the duo reasoned, fixing those gut problems might also lead to changes in behaviour."" And so it goes on, these male scientists keen to prove that these links to lab mice proved the mother caused autism in her babies. Until, science writer, a woman, Emily Willingham points out that, 
""Mice don't have autism, which is a human neurobiological construct shaped in part by social and cultural perceptions of what is considered normal. Is a mouse repeatedly burying a marble really like a child rocking back and forth? Is a lower frequency of squeaks the same as being unable to talk to other people? If you squint just so, the similarities jump out . Look again and and you might see parallels with other conditions. 
Then the killer - the lab mice used were originally bred to model schizophrenia. So you have scientists saying that the bacteria in the guts of autistic babies and schizophrenic mice who cannot possibly be bred in any way to be autistic proves that it is the mother is responsible, it's just more time is needed to find the proof, the microbes responsible.It's scientific confirmation bias. It's akin to a scientific conspiracy theory. One way or another the mother must be blamed. And say, as the woman science writer says, that all these gut problems can be seen as not just similarities but absolute parallels to other conditions, not autism ."
6,0062368591,http://goodreads.com/user/show/40898015-jamie,5,"Well, I will never think of bacteria and archaea the same. I certainly have a newfound understanding of just how vital it is to every part of life. That microbes and bacteria have helped shape our planet for billions of years, down to every single flora and fauna; even all the oxygen we breath has come from bacteria. I also never really thought about the microbes that are constantly around us and even on me, or how many you are ""seeding"" to the world. That""every person aerosolises 37 million bacteria per hour"". And, if that isn't crazy enough, how about ""It's estimated that every human contains 100 trillion microbes, most of which live in our guts. By comparison, the Milky Way contains between 100 million and 400 million stars"". To me, learning all of this was just simply incredible-the effortless symbiosis of microbes with the environment and with ourselves. I could go on and on about this book-so I will end with is, this is hands down one of my favorite science books. The ""science"" wasn't intimidating to read, as the author didn't assume you were already an expert on the subject. It wasn't dry either, and a few parts made me laugh. This book would be great for anyone who is interested in learning about the unseen world going on all around them. "
7,0062368591,http://goodreads.com/user/show/155663-david,5,"This is a fascinating book about the microbes inside all of us, and inside other animals as well. Now, it is often said that there are ten times as many bacteria in our bodies as there are cells. This, it turns out, is probably an over-estimate; the number of bacteria is probably in the same ballpark as the number of cells. But still, that is a lot!This book goes into detail about the amazing partnerships--the symbioses--between microbes and large organisms, mostly animals and humans. Microbes are essential to digestion, to our immune systems, and many other functions.Every person has his own population of microbes, which can be different between individuals. And we spread our microbes around; every day we deposit 30 million of them by breathing, touching things, and by excretions.Most microbes are not harmful to humans. But the distinction between harmful and not harmful and helpful is not always crystal clear. Microbes in our guts help digestion, but if they escape into the blood stream they can be deadly. I really enjoyed learning how dengue can be prevented by infecting mosquitos with a common bacterium called Wolbachia.I learned all sorts of great things. For example, probiotic foods and supplements have not been proven to be effective. Also, toilets that are cleaned too often are more likely to be covered in bacteria. And, hospital rooms with closed windows contain more deadly microbes than the fresh air outside. Some scientists believe that microbes are responsible for obesity, and even for high blood pressure.This book is actually fun to read, filled with subtle humor, and extremely informative. This book is so well written, I must recommend it to everyone."
8,0062368591,http://goodreads.com/user/show/84916113-somebunny-reads-phoenix,5,"I am Legion.  So, apparently human beings (and all beings in general) are just bags of bacteria and other microorganisms, and these fascinating fellas have always dominated the Earth, from the birth of life to present days: there are more bacteria in our guts than starts in our galaxy. Interesting, uh? I would say a wonderful topic for a wonderful book! I loved this book and found it extremely interesting for many reasons. First, because it was very well-written, and second because it opened my mind to the fascinating field of microbiology, which I'd never think it would be for interest for me (a linguist). This book literally opened a new door for me, and since starting this read I watched documentaries and collected all kinds of information on bacteria, virus, and microorganisms in general. For example, did you know that our body contains so many bacteria that there are roughly the same amount of human cells and bacteria cells inside it? Or that sponges are such simple animals and yet full of microbes that sometimes, if you look at a sponge under a microscope, you will barely be able to see the animal for the microbes that cover it? Or that there is such a thing as a poop transplant (Faecal Microbiota Transplant, or FMT), in which stool samples from one healthy individual are inserted into someone else's intestines to re-create a healthy microbe environment and thus fighting many digestion-related illnesses? This book was all extremely interesting, and I think it also contains two very important messages to always keep in mind: first (something that many people, but not all people, know), that not all microorganisms are bad, and some of them are not only fundamental to sustain life and normal functions of animals and plants, but can also be used to cure health conditions and preserve the environment. Our indiscriminate war against germs, overdoing with disinfectant and antibiotics, is both straightening bad bacteria and endangering good ones, with repercussions on our and our Planets's health. Second, that this field is one of the most futurist fields of science, and we'll probably see incredible developments in the future: the creation of medicines based on probiotics, bacteria artificially engineered to fight diseases; and, incidentally, we'll probably see a lot of this stuff in sci-fi. Of course, as the author himself points out, scientists always have the ambition to find a grand unified theory, a master equation which can elegantly explain our universe, and microbiology, with its recent discoveries on how our life on the Planet started (seriously, look it up or read about it in this book, it's fascinating), how microorganisms are intertwined with hosts in complex symbiotic relationships which can even affect genome, and how much we could potentially do/cure just using bacteria, is currently one of the most fashionable candidates. Without having to believe that bacteria is the solution to all our problems, from dying crops to saving the coral reef and solve both malnutrition and obesity, let alone eradicating lymphatic filariasis and dengue fever; we instead can and should try to educate ourselves more about the microcosm which thrives inside of us and inside the smallest of bugs, so that we can learn how to respect it and be aware of the danger those small little things can pose to us, but also us to them. Bacteria can get extinct too, and who knows how many good friends we used to have in our guts before we killed them and started getting irritable bowls! Save your friendly neighbour bacterium!!! "
9,0062368591,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2172096-barbara,5,"Though we might lather our skin with antibacterial soap, clean our hands with alcohol sanitizers, gargle with mouthwash, scrub our kitchen surfaces, disinfect our bathrooms, spray Lysol all over the house, take antibiotics, etc., there are - and always will be - microbes everywhere. This is especially true of our warm moist bodies - which are covered inside and out with microorganisms....and this is a good thing.Bacteria are on and in our bodiesIn fact our bodies are really an indivisible aggregate of 'our' tissues and organs....and the microbial world that makes its home there. Moreover this is true for every multicellular organism on Earth. The totality of microorganisms (and their parts) in/on our bodies is called our 'microbiome', and it's composed of myriad kinds of bacteria, viruses, archaea, snippets of microbial DNA, and other miniscule microbial fragments. This microbiome helps digest our food, produces vitamins and minerals, breaks down toxins and dangerous chemicals, guides our embryonic development, assists our immune system, probably influences our behavior, and so on. There are many kinds of microbes in the worldIn this entertaining and illuminating book, Yong touches on the evolution of microbes; the history of microbiology; symbiotic relationships among microbes; symbiosis between microbes and higher organisms; dysbiosis (unbalanced microbiomes that harm their hosts); how scientists study and identify microbiomes; research studies aimed at seeding hospitals and buildings with 'good microbes'; and much more.Symbiotic microbes provide nutrients for plantsHospitals are covered with microorganisms. Seeding hospitals with 'good microbes' might prevent 'bad microbes' from growing.Most people probably associate microbes with disease, and Yong provides some examples of pathogenic organisms. The vast majority of microbes are beneficial though, and I was fascinated to read about their varied roles in the world of living things. I've had a rather varied career and in a galaxy far away and long ago I got a degree in microbiology.....but this book has a lot of new and exciting information. I'll give examples of a few intriguing factoids gleaned from the book:1. We can improve our health by nurturing 'helpful' bacteria in our digestive system. Since fiber-loving bacteria are supposed to boost the immune system I added a LOT of fiber to my diet.....and I think I feel healthier already!! We need 'good microbes' in our stomach 2. Newborns are bathed in good microbes during vaginal delivery. Thus, infants born by caesarean section - lacking this initial 'seeding' - develop different microbiomes than vaginal babies. Breast-feeding also provides babies with an initial dose of beneficial microbes. 3. It's good for kids to have a dog because the pooch brings outdoor microbes into the home. Being exposed to a larger variety of microorganisms reduces the likelihood of getting allergies. 4. The author, Ed Yong, really likes the Hawaiian bobtail squid, which contains large colonies of luminous bacteria. Whenever Yong mentions this critter he calls it 'adorable.' (ha ha ha)Bacteria make squids luminous This tome covers a fascinating array of topics in an understandable - and sometimes humorous - fashion. I love this book and would recommend it to everyone.

10,0062368591,http://goodreads.com/user/show/793473-clif-hostetler,3,"Recently I've been hearing reports of miracle cures of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) by use of fecal matter transplants. Also I've heard that some autoimmune diseases may be caused by environments that are too clean. Upon hearing these things the question that comes to my mind is, why this new found enthusiasm for microorganisms? We've known about bacteria since Louis Pasteur. So why all this new information about microbes as if it was something new? (Actually we learn in this book that Antonie van Leeuwenhoek discovered the prevalence of bacteria on all sorts of surfaces in the 1680s, but for unexplained reasons his findings were pretty much ignored for 200 years.) What I learned from this book is that the new technologies of gene sequencing and genomics has changed everything. Before gene sequencing careful study of microbes was limited to those that could be grown on a culture medium. With current tools it is possible to sequence every single gene in a sample from a skin flake, stream bed, or any environmental or body surface. Suddenly researchers were able to provide detailed descriptions of myriad microbiota (This book uses the term microbiome.)What scientists are learning is that the number, variety and prevalence of microorganisms exceeded all expectations. Combined with our understanding of evolution we now know that all of life has co-evolved within close contact with microbes. Consequently many functions of animal life are either dependent on, or aided and regulated by, microorganisms. Food digestion is a leading example of this. This book warns that current science is in the early phases of understanding microbiomes and that we shouldn't become too excited about spectacular claims made by probiotic manufacturers. However, I believe that the wording used by this book in some cases hypes things a bit too much. In particular I'm don't like the way this book makes the statement that, ""The majority of cells in our body are not human, they're microbes."" Technically that statement is true, but it is misleading. The statement is true regarding the number of cells, but not mass (i.e. weight). Only about 1 to 3 percent of the human body weight is from microbes located mostly in the gut. The reason for this disparity between mass and numbers of cells is that most human cells (e.g. muscle, fat, & blood cells) are larger and more massive than bacterial cells. The information I've explained above about the mass of human cells and bacterial cells is not explained in this book. The book simply makes the statement regarding the number of cells which I'm sure will lead some people to make the declarative statement, ""Did you know that most of the human body is made of bugs?""The book explains why we should think of bacteria and viruses as companions, not enemies. Our efforts at being antibacterial—killing all microbial growth—can sometimes provide an environment in which pathogens can proliferate. But there is one quotation in the book by a doctor that provided another perspective to consider. ""I've never seen anybody die from getting antibiotics, but I've seen some die from the lack of them.""Also, our immune system evolved in an environment of mild background contamination. Thus, our modern clean living environments may be a contributor to increased occurrences of some autoimmune ailments. But of course we all know that contaminated environments can cause disease. Perhaps, as we learn more about microbiomes we'll learn to get the level of contamination just right. This book provides a good overall discussion of the expanding knowledge and understanding of microbes.The following is a link to an excerpt from the book about ""when Leeuwenhoek discovered Microorganisms:http://www.delanceyplace.com/view-arc..."
11,0062368591,http://goodreads.com/user/show/632247-chrissie,3,"I liked this book so I am giving it three stars. It is common knowledge today that everything and all of us are covered with microbes - that some are good and some are bad. Their number can be debated. We have in the past been fixated on getting rid of them. This has been to our detriment. It is clear we have gone too far. Antibiotics are good and necessary, but at the same time they must be used with care. In heedlessly wiping out microbes, we have created an environment where pathogens proliferate. This book is about the symbiosis we have with the microbes living on and in our bodies and in our environment. It is about our need to develop a harmonious relationship between us and them. The book begins with a rather long introduction. I wanted the book to get going; what we were being told was all too general. The introduction is followed by a chapter which focuses on the history of bacteriology, beginning with the Dutch scientist Antonie van Leeuwenhoek's (1632 - 1723) development of the microscope. He was the first to observe and describe single celled organisms. The growth of microbiology is reviewed through a discussion of the discoveries of scientists such as Louis Pasteur, Élie Metchnikoff, Theodor Rosebury, René Dubos and others. Microbiologists one has heard of and others less well-known. After the historical review, the remainder of the book contains fascinating information on more contemporary studies, but there is no real structure to the presentation. First of all, the titles of the chapters do not clearly indicate what the chapter will be about. Here are four titles so you can see what I mean:-The Long Waltz-Mutually Assured Success-Allegro in E Major -Microbes à la CarteOn completion of a chapter I had learned a smattering of information, all of which I had found interesting, but what exactly that particular chapter was focused upon most often eluded me. Topics brought up in one chapter come up again in another. For me, when reading a non-fiction book on a topic where my own knowledge is weak, I need structure. There is a heavy use of acronyms and scientific abbreviations, which are explained once, but most often just once. The same is true of the scientific terms used for particular experimental procedures, chemical compounds and pathogens. You can read this book without in-depth previous knowledge, but the more you know before you pick it up the easier it will be to understand. It definitely helped me to have recently read The Gene: An Intimate History. Today scientists are sequencing the genes of the microbes around us. Bacteria readily swap genes, something which humans do not do, but our cells can integrate foreign genetic material from bacteria. It is important to stress that we are today only beginning to understand the symbiotic relationship between our cells and the microbes living in, on and around us. This book does not give definitive answers but indicates where the future may take us. Numerous studies are cited. Here follow examples of topics discussed - fecal transplants, probiotics, studies on the bacteria feeding sugars in breast milk, the beneficial qualities of vaginal microbes for babies’ health and gut microbes in preventing obesity and autoimmune diseases, the value of dogs in increasing the microbe diversity in our homes, the decimation of coral reefs, squid with luminous bacteria. The topics are many and not only about humans, but other flora and fauna too. The book provides a lot of really interesting information, but I wanted a better structure to it all.The audiobook is very well narrated by Charlie Anson. Clear and easy to follow. The narration I have given four stars."

""Every time we touch an object, we leave a microbial imprint upon it. Every time we walk, talk, scratch, shuffle, or sneeze, we cast a personalised cloud of microbes into space.

16,0062368591,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8079403-max,4,"Yong explores the microbiome, not just in humans but in many creatures. He reveals the amazing variety of ways that microorganisms influence their multicellular counterparts. A properly balanced microbiome is not only critical to health, but can be essential to proper development, reproduction and survival. In essence we are one system with the many trillions of foreign organisms in our bodies. We rely on each other. Not that there is a clear cut line between beneficial and pathogenic, a single organism can be both depending on the circumstances. As Yong notes, the immune system is not just a defense against disease causing organisms, it is a manager of our microbiome, ideally operating to maximize its benefits and minimize its dangers.Yong offers numerous examples of the codependence of microbes and animals including humans. One example we can easily relate to concerns a mother’s milk. In human milk there are sugars called human milk oligosaccharides (HMOs), over 200 different ones, yet infants are not able to digest them. However, there is a bacteria that eats it all up, Bifidobacterium longum infantis. In return it feeds short-chain fatty acids to the gut cells. B. infantis also helps these cells generate an adhesive to fill gaps between them and it promotes the cells’ manufacture of anti-inflammatory compounds. Not only that, B. infantis helps infant brains grow by producing the sialic acid they need. And there is more. B. infantis attracts some pathogens acting as a decoy preventing them from invading gut cells. This microbe earns its keep.We are familiar with the term symbiosis which applies to the relationship between the microbiome and humans. Endosymbiosis is a more exact description of that relationship since the microbes live in and on us. Yong uses the term dysbiosis to describe when that relationship goes awry, when there is a loss of balance between the microbiome and the immune system. Such an imbalance can contribute to illness and conditions such as nutritional deficiency, obesity, irritable bowel syndrome, and many, many more. Unfortunately pinning down the exact constituents of the microbiome responsible is very difficult. Typically there is not one bad actor, but varying mixes of microbes that cause trouble and then only in people with particular genetics or circumstances. Think of your body as an ecosystem. One piece may go astray, but real trouble doesn’t show up until many pieces have been affected, making it exceedingly problematic to understand how the imbalance begins.Biologist Lynn Margulis, persevering in the face of intense criticism, became famous for making the evolutionary role of endosymbiosis credible. Today it is a widely accepted explanation for the mitochondria in our cells which came from a captured bacterium. She also came up with the word holobiant to describe a community of species that stay together throughout their lives including us and our microbiome. This concept can also be applied to genes. Biologists such as Richard Dawkins consider animals and other life forms to be vehicles for genes. Evolution operates to select genes. Their vehicles can change as needed. The genes in our microbiome directly influence our well-being and behavior. Shouldn’t they be considered a part of the set of genes being selected for in our evolution? In other words, the genes of the holobiant together determine the evolutionary vehicle. Consider the example Yong offers of two “species” of closely related flies. They were thought to be separate species. They never mated and they contained different microbiomes. But give them antibiotics and they will successfully mate. Microbes can change an animal’s smell and other factors that can determine mating preference. Eventually these two fly communities with different microbiomes will become distinct species if they never mate. Just as with these flies, it is our hologenome that may be deciding our future.Yong explores the therapeutic potential of changing our microbiome. We make a stab at this today with prebiotics, probiotics and fecal transplants. But to reliably tackle most conditions will require cocktails of bacteria properly proportioned to individual needs. These would require testing for efficacy and safety as would any medicine. We also need to think carefully about how antibiotics and antimicrobials affect the microbiome and the bacteria we encounter. As we begin the age of gene therapy, we can consider not only manipulating the bacteria in our microbiomes but their genes as well. Microbes can be much more easily engineered with genes than can animal cells. Bacteria exchange genes through horizontal transfer. They don’t have to inherit them but can readily pick them up from their neighbors. Thus genes from transient bacteria can get into your microbiome. Astounding, however, is the increasing evidence of bacterial gene horizontal transfer into animal cells. This is particularly true of insects which often have very intimate relationships with bacteria. How this happens needs to be explored. Throughout the book Yong relates example after example of the codependence of animals and bacteria. Bacteria can shape organ development, not only determine sex but change sex after it is established, stop or enable reproduction, stop or enable parasites, provide or block essential nutrients, eradicate or promote a species, decimate or protect a crop, alter the environment and much, much more. Yong makes the case that we need to consider our relationship with bacteria particularly our hologenome if we are to understand our health, our behavior and our future. We are at the beginning of a new appreciation of the role bacteria play in the world, what it means to be human, and new approaches to tackle disease as well as shape our minds and bodies."
17,0062368591,http://goodreads.com/user/show/49847688-emily,5,"A NEW NONFICTION FAVORITE!!! I'M SO HAPPY.This is absolutely fabulous scientific nonfiction. I think at times, scienctific nonfiction swings one of two ways--over simplified, or overly pendantic. This book truly hit the sweet spot. It's accessible, gorgeously written, and incredibly informative and well-researched.In particular, I liked that Yong doesn't shy away from differing schools of thought. Microbiology as we know it today is still a relatively new science, and as such there are a LOT of different opinions. Yong engages with all of the these. The level of nuance within this book is astounding, and truly elevates it.I also REALLY appreciated that Yong doesn't assume you miraculously remembered every detail from earlier chapters. He would repeat meanings behind acronyms, descriptions of bacteria and cell functions, and a whole lot of other things. However, this never feels repetitive. He's succinct, but also recognizes that his readers might, by chapter 8, forget a line or two from chapter 1. I definitely recommend this!"
18,0062368591,http://goodreads.com/user/show/50066399-diane-in-australia,4,"I did enjoy this book, but it didn't 'wow' me as much as some of the other reviewers. In fact, I started it awhile ago, and just got distracted by other books, and put it down ... which never happens, if I'm enthralled by a book. When I finally came back to it, I did learn a few things, and read a few things aloud to hubby, so, all-in-all I suppose it was a 'good read'.4 Stars = Outstanding. It definitely held my interest."
19,0062368591,http://goodreads.com/user/show/17746077-joshua-buhs,4,"A fascinating topic poorly served by the conventions of popular science writing.Ed Yong's book is about microbes--bacteria, mostly, but also viruses and few other extremely small creatures--and how they live with other organisms--humans for the most part, with plenty of other animals, too, though no plants.It has Darwinian ambitions, announced in its subtitle: ""A Grander View of Life"" evokes Darwin's famous phrase closing the first edition of ""On the Origin of Species"": ""There is grandeur in this view of life, with its several powers, having been originally breathed into a few forms or into one; and that, whilst this planet has gone cycling on according to the fixed law of gravity, from so simple a beginning endless forms most beautiful and most wonderful have been, and are being, evolved.""And it is there in the basic organizing principle of the book. Darwin followed the recommendation of the philosopher of science William Whewell that a good scientific theory account for a range of facts--he called this the ""consilience of induction."" Yong is out to conciliate some inducting, too--so to speak--setting out a view of the interactions between animals and microbes that is extensive.For the past one hundred and fifty or so years, microbes have been mostly seen in the light of germ theory: that is, they have been either classed ad pathological or of little interest. In the last four decades (or so), a new view has taken shape: that microbes are neither good nor bad. But they are ubiquitous. And they are *integral* to multicellular life. Some are pathological. Some perform vital functions. They form an entire ecosystem, one upon which life depends, but one that has been mostly ignored, mostly invisible.As I say, this is a great story, with very important repercussions. The details are fascinating, and Yong is great at explaining the complex interplay between microbes and multicellular organisms in easy to understand ways--that usually do not feel condescending. (I could've used a little less forced humor: de gustibus and all that, though.) Just dipping into the various chapters and reading the sections involves one in some remarkable bits of biology. The book, on the level of the sections, is genuinely fun.There are, of course, important sequelae to this line of thought. One set concerns how we are to live in the world when we know its expanded dimension. Food choices, medicine choices, standard questions about environmental protection--all become more complicated when we have to take microbiology into account. This ""grander view"" of life also calls into question traditional boundaries--between the self and the environment, between humans and other organisms. If bacteria help to build your immune system, what does that mean for ideas about the integrity of the body? If moods and behaviors are effected by gut flora, what does that mean about human will and determinism?Darwin's book was arranged unusually--though brilliantly, in its way. (Waiting twenty years to publish gives certain advantages!) He started with artificial selection, as something most people would understand. Then, in the next two chapters, showed how the elements of artificial selection were inherent in nature, too: one chapter explored natural variety, the other natural competition. Chapter four then tied these various strands together, showing how natural selection worked in nature as an analogue of artificial selection. The remainder of the book--to simplify matters--gathers together a host of facts that can all be explained by natural selection, from the geological record to what we would now call genetics.Yong's book does not work quite so well on the level of chapters. It's fine, but not quite as elegant. There are basically three introductory chapters: one is a prologue, which situates Yong at a zoo watching a scientist investigate the microbial flora on the body of a pangolin. He then moves to another introductory chapter which sets out some guidelines, though these are not consistently used through the book to justify their presence here. He notes that humans are, in effect, islands, homes to vast swarms of bacteria, which can be characterized as neither good nor bad, but as essential to life as we know it. He also introduces the idea that geological time is very long--he's definitely influenced by Darwin and evolutionary biologists, and wants to root the book in its tropes, though they are not really necessary.The second body chapter then introduces us to the idea that various people have looked at microbes over the centuries, to differing ends. He starts with Leeuwenhoek, who was probably the first human to see microbes. But his research into bacteria and similar creatures was never really transformative. He then jumps to the nineteenth century when Pasteur and Koch and the rest put germ theory in place. This was the beginning of what remains the dominant way of looking at microbes.The rest of the chapter then introduces us to the more recent view, which he dates back to the late 1960s with the discovery of a whole new branch of life, the archaebacteria, and then expands to the surveys of microbial life that took off after that. There's a sense that microbiology of the 197os was a lot like American vertebrate biology of the 1900s-1920s, with intensive surveys to characterize most of the major groups and define their geological distribution.This is also the section when Yong could have made a stake for a particular kind of order to the rest of the book, but opted against it. Given that there is a generational element to the story, Yong could have characterized the various schools of microbiology that took shape during this time and given an overview of the people who were involved. Something like what William Leach did with ""The Butterfly People."" If nothing else, it would have helped to make sense of the on-coming chapters, with its huge cast of characters, some recurring, some connected, but the network never quite clear.Instead, what he wants to do is offer a history of ideas--which could work. That's what Darwin did, after all, showing the various ideas that fall under the overarching umbrella, and how they connect. And it is possible to see this, though it is never quite laid out clearly. Part of that is because, for all the introductory matter, the book is never introduced in any but the most general terms. Part of the reason is because the chapter titles are jokey, and so not quite explanatory.Here, though, is a précis of the argument. (It's worth noting that Darwin had expanded chapter explanations in his table of contents, effectively working as a rudimentary index.)Chapter 3. Microbes help build body. Vital functions have been outsourced because microbes are so ubiquitous.Chapter 4. Reintroduces the idea that microbes are neither inherently good nor bad, and even pathological effects can result from certain conditions--in the same way that landscapes can support different kinds of living communities, depending upon their conditions.Chapter 5. Sickness, in people, other organisms, and entire ecosystems, can result from disruptions in the microbial flora. Chapter 6. Animals and their microbes co-evolved.Chapter 7. Because microbes can do so many functions, their coming together with certain organisms allows those organisms to expand into new niches relatively easily. Chapter 8. Genes can be transferred horizontally, from organism to organism.Chapters 9 and 10. The future, and the possibility of microbial engineering.The real reason, though, that it is so difficult to parse out the overall narrative arc is that Yong is in love with the smaller-scale stories. He has been a blogger and writer of magazine articles for many years now, and this experience shows here--to the detriment of the book, I think. With the exception of a few, the chapters do not really lay out a cohesive arguments, but are divided by stories. Again and again, just as Yong is building up to a point, he will take a break and start a new story--with new characters and new creatures.In short, the ideas that are supposed to be driving the story are pushed aside for the story of people. And in the end, the narrative falls between two stools, neither fully the laying out of an idea, nor a group biography, but something in between, and fractured.Apart from making it hard to develop much momentum and to see the forest for the trees, this fragmenting of the book ends up bringing up a whole host of questions that Yong can never really address. Does it matter that one researcher is far from home when she meets with him? Why is another's son hitting Yong in the rear end? Does it matter when World War II was? Talk about conditions leading to (or foreclosing) disease ties into alternative notions of medicine--how does this change in view of microbes relate? Why do Westerners live in an environment that promotes inflammation? Aren't there neo-colonialist concerns with researchers sampling poop from malnourished children? What are the implications of engineering the microbial flora--haven't we learned from big ecological engineering projects?Popular science writing likes to emphasize the humans involved in the science, the work they do, the ideas they have, their personalities and quirks. I get it. But I think the tendency makes it harder to see what Yong is trying to say here. The book is not equipped to answer these questions, and the stories tend to obscure Yong's Darwinian ambitions.Still, he makes some valuable caveats and interventions. As anyone who only half pays attention to debates over nutrition will know, microbes are a big deal--probiotics make lots of money, people are all into feeding the right bugs, and one part of the whole fascination over gluten-free diets is concerns over leaky guts and microbes slipping into the bloodstream. Yong shows how limited the evidence for this talk is, though--particularly probiotics--and as soon as someone starts telling you the exact composition of microbe you need, you should be very wary.And, really, the stories are still fascinating. This last part is what most reviewers I've noticed have focused on, and they are not wrong. Yong got gold of a great subject, and hunted down a huge number of really interesting stories that fit the project. The amount of work that went into the book must have been immense.And, really, when you think of all those accomplishments, it seems churlish to complain that Yong wasn't Darwin also."

If you have a dog, the volume of bacteria in your home increases exponentially. If, gentle reader, you are now scratching and twitching, may I suggest getting a copy of 'I Contain Multitudes' so at least you will know how bacteria function, and why we have them in us, on us, and everywhere else. Author Ed Yong writes for the general reader, explaining that the majority of bacteria are helpful. Good thing, eh? My skin is still crawling. Literally. Anybody else feel like hitting the shower for a good scrub?Author Ed Yong humorously explores the microbiological universe we live in. Several chapters explain that bacteria were the first forms of life on Earth, at least as far as we know, by describing the historical record scientists have sussed out through DNA research. He delves into how some of the more interesting bacteria were discovered, and how scientists are currently exploring how bacteria can be used to improve health. Reader, it is obvious after finishing this book being a hypochondriac is an exercise in futility. If it makes you feel any better, most bacteria are our friends. The Earth would be just rock, water and gas fumes without 'em. So. Learn to love your little invisible pets. They certainly love you. You truly are never alone.'I Contain Multitudes' has an extensive Bibliography and an Index. I read the Kindle ebook, which collected the included photos in the back."

Considering how many books about microbes are popping up, I was skeptical at first, but it quickly became apparent that this book was based on nothing but the best science available on the subject. Just like the Sonnenburgs' book Gut, I contain Multitudes focused on what we know about microbes and was very clear about the lack of evidence when speculating. The researchers cited by Yong are the best in their field. Who Yong *does not cite* is very telling. If you look for an author in Yong's citations (or in the Sonneburgs' citations) and that author is not there, do not trust their book at face value. You will notice that not one reputable microbe researcher and/or book author cites Grain Brain's Perlmutter, whose entire book is made up of misconceptions, sensational claims, and pseudoscience. Some of the most interesting parts of this book include: - Yong's very favorite microbe, Wolbachia, is a fairly magical creature. It is too big to fit into sperm and be passed down through the generations. It can only be carried in eggs. So what is Wolbachia to do if it wants to survive and pass down its genes? Well, it must ensure that as many females as possible survive to carry on its line. Accordingly, it controls the sex of many species as possible (especially arthropods). It either kills the males or alters them in some way to help itself spread through the population. Wolbachia stop female wasps from mating with males. When infected with Wolbachia, the females choose to clone instead. But, if you give the females an antibiotic to wipe out Wolbachia, they begin having sex with males again.In woodlice, Wolbachia interfere with the production of male hormones, ensuring that all woodlice are female or that male woodlice transformed into females. In Blue Moon butterflies Wolbachia kill male embryos, resulting in females outnumbering males by 100 to 1.In other species still, Wolbachia alter sperm in males so that they can only fertilize eggs infected with Wolbachia. (brilliant)Wolbachia is insanely successful, with infections rates often at 100% of the population. The majority of living creatures are arthropods, and 40% of arthropods are infected.- Once it was thought that no microbes could survive conditions at deep ocean vents. However, researchers found myriad forms of life at the vents. There is a worm that has no mouth or anus. To take in nutrients and expel waste products, these worms use the microbes that fill up their bodies. The microbes turn sulfur into the energy (what amazing alchemists!) that maintain the life of the worms, who live without the direct energy of sunlight. - Breastmilk is not for babies. It is to feed the microbes inside babies that are essential for baby's wellbeing and feed the viruses inside babies (the very viruses that make baby sick). - There are no good or bad microbes (this part was simply fantastic). In one species a microbe can be helpful and ""bad"" in another species who it harms. Even in the same individual, microbes are not good or bad. For example, gut bacteria is great.... in the gut. But if it travels to the blood, you have sepsis and die. The bacteria that caused the sepsis isn't ""bad."" It is simply in the wrong place to do its job. When in the blood, it does the same job it does in the intestine, but that is good for the functioning of the gut (and the parts of the body governed by gut microbes) is bad for the bloodstream. Sprinkled throughout the book was the message that, in nature, moderation is key. When is it good to wipe out all microbes? When is it not? How can we know what types of microbes (and at what concentration) are good for which circumstances. - Herbivores have the highest diversity of gut microbes, omnivores had second highest, and carnivores the lowest. Why should this be? Shouldn't animals that eat both plants and animals have more diverse microbes than an animal that only eats plants? Animals that eat only plants need the greatest variety of microbes because it takes tons of enzymes to break down plants but not nearly as much to break down animals. Plants have lot of cellulose and carbs, which are hard to break down. So plant eaters need microbes in great diversity and abundance to accomplish that task.It's funny, but you can think of herbivores as actual mouths. They do the eating of the plant. Their superior microbes break down the plants (just as a mouth and teeth break down food so you can swallow and digest it). Another animal, an omnivore or carnivore, comes along and eats what has essentially already been chewed and broken down. When the omnivore or carnivore eat the herbivore, they have saved themselves the work of breaking down the food. It's done for them. They merely chew it up some more to break it into small enough pieces so their intestine, which has far fewer microbes, can relax and just finish the job of digesting the plants (which hold the sun's energy!) that the herbivore and its microbes already did the hard work of breaking down. Yong gave many excellent examples of various strategies different animals species used for helping guts and microbes work in tandem to digest food. "
22,0062368591,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11951948-paul,4,"You may think that we are just made from muscles, blood cells, bones and a fair bit of DNA, but in between the gaps are microbes. Billions and billions of them. There are the odd rogue ones, but most of them are useful and make up an essential element of our being. Without them we could not live. They help us in countless ways, sculpting our organs, protecting us from disease and feeding and nourishing us; our gut contains a complete ecosystem that ensure that we extract all the energy we need.Microbes work equal miracles in other animals too, providing the ethereal light that disguises a squid as they hunt, ensuring that koalas are able to digest the unpalatable eucalyptus leaves and the weevil that uses bacteria to make its shell before killing them. The modern worldview of eliminating all microbes is causing as much harm as it is good; people nowdays have a revulsion of all things bacterial, hence the raft of cleaning products that are designed to scour all surfaces and hands clean of these unwanted intruders. However, as Yong successfully argues in this book that not only we might be missing a trick, but our bacterial ecosystem is essential for our survival. A good example of this is in hospitals; the modern view is that all windows have to be locked shut to keep rogue microbes out, but the effect of this is that patients sit in their beds stewing in a lethal mix of micro-organisms. This hazardous situation can be simply solved by opening a window, this allows the dispersal and dilution of the potentially lethal ones. Simple, but very effective.It is a fascinating account of the unseen creatures that live within and all around us. Yong takes us on this journey through the microscope to discover the most recent research from scientists all round the world and tell us of the secrets that are being discovered about microbes. Some of the treatments being developed have the potential to make people’s so lives much better; one example is RePOOpulate – as unappealing as it sounds! However, this treatment has worked miracles with a 94% success rate and no side effects, a success rate not seen in many other cures. Yong writes with an engaging and eloquent style and makes the science in here really accessible. Well worth reading. 4.5 stars."
23,0062368591,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5875398-rebecca,4,"Ed Yong is a London-based science writer for The Atlantic and is part of National Geographic’s blogging network. I had trouble believing that I Contain Multitudes is his first book; it’s so fluent and engaging that it immediately draws you into the microbial world and keeps you marveling at its strange yet fascinating workings. Yong writes like a journalist rather than a scientist, and that’s a good thing: with an eye to the average reader, he uses a variety of examples and metaphors, intersperses personal anecdotes of visiting researchers at their labs or in the field, and is careful to recap important facts in a lucid way.The book opens with a visit to San Diego Zoo (see the exclusive extract following my review), where we meet Baba the pangolin. But “Baba is not just a pangolin. He is also a teeming mass of microbes,” Yong explains. “Some of them live inside him, mostly in his gut. Others live on the surface of his face, belly, paws, claws, and scales.” Believe it or not, but we are roughly half and half human cells and microbial cells, making each of us – like all creatures – more of an ecosystem (another term is “holobiont”) than a single entity.Microbes vary between species but also within species, so each individual’s microbiome in some ways reflects a unique mixture of genes and experiences. This is why people’s underarms smell subtly different, and how hyenas use their scent glands to convey messages. The microbiome may well be tailored to different creatures’ functions, so researchers at San Diego Zoo are testing swabs from their animals to see if there could be discernible signatures for burrowing or flying activities, or for disease. I was struck by the breadth of species considered here: not just mammals, but also invertebrates like beetles, cicadas, and squid – my entomologist husband would surely be proud. The “Us” in the subtitle is thus used very inclusively to speak of the way that microbes live in symbiosis with all living things.If I were to boil down Yong’s book to one message, it’s that microbes are not simply “bad” or “good” but have different roles depending on the context and the host. You can hardly dismiss all bacteria as germs that must be eradicated when there are thousands of benign species in your gut (versus fewer than 100 kinds that cause infectious diseases). If it weren’t for the microbes passed on to us at birth, we wouldn’t be able to digest the complex sugars in our mothers’ milk. Other creatures rely on bacteria to help them develop to adulthood, like the tube worms that thrive on Navy ship hulls at Pearl Harbor.Yet Yong feels too little attention is given to beneficial microbes, and in many cases we continue the campaign to rid ourselves of them through overuse of antibiotics and taking cleanliness to unhelpful extremes. “We have been tilting at microbes for too long, and created a world that’s hostile to the ones we need,” he asserts.The book is full of lines like that one that combine a nice turn of phrase and a clever literary allusion. In the title alone, after all, you have references to Walt Whitman (“I contain multitudes” is from his “Song of Myself”) and Charles Darwin (“there is grandeur in this view of life” is part of the closing sentence in his On the Origin of Species). Yong also sets up helpful analogies, comparing the immune system to a thermostat and antibiotics to “shock-and-awe weapons … like nuking a city to deal with a rat.”History and future are also brought together very effectively, with the narrative looking backwards to Leeuwenhoek’s early microscope work and Pasteur and Koch’s germ theory, but also forwards to the prospects that current research into microbes might enable: eliminating elephantiasis, protecting frogs from deadly fungi via probiotics in the soil, fecal microbiota transplants to cure C. diff infections, and so on.The possibilities seem endless, and this is a book that will keep you shaking your head in amazement. I’d liken Yong’s style to David Quammen’s or Rebecca Skloot’s. His clear and intriguing science writing succeeds in inspiring wonder at the natural world and at the bodies that carry us through it.I participated in the official Wellcome Book Prize 2017 blog tour. See my blog review at Bookish Beck for an exclusive extract from the book."
24,0062368591,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10407443-ross-blocher,5,"I Contain Multitudes is science writing at its best: Ed Yong is curious and energetic, and his enthusiasm for bacteria (and wordplay) runneth over in this wide-ranging look at microbiomes within and without. The Whitman-inspired title is apt: we drift through a world teeming with bacteria. Our nonhuman bacterial denizens number in the trillions, and like Pigpen from Peanuts we exude a cloud of our own making, aerosolizing some 37 million bacteria per hour. Yong is quick to dispel the oft-cited back-of-the-napkin calculation that bacterial cells outnumber human cells 10-to-1. The best recent estimates render that split more evenly: roughly 39 trillion microbial cells to 30 trillion [significantly larger] human cells. Still, the point remains that we are hybrid creatures. If there is one takeaway message, it is that bacteria have gotten a bad rap due to our fixation on pathogens. Fewer than 100 bacterial species cause infectious disease in humans, compared to thousands of species [in our guts alone] that range from harmless to essential. If bacteria were to suddenly disappear, life would come to a quick and crashing halt. We need bacteria to digest, to supplement nutrients, to fight infection, and to offload hosts of other responsibilities we are evolved to depend upon.While the book is chock full of interesting factoids (your right hand shares just a sixth of its microbial species with your left hand!) and canvasses the history of human discovery of the microscopic world, most information comes in the form of Yong's interactions with researchers. We learn about connections between bacteria and immunity, and potential developmental connections to autism and schizophrenia. We look at the ever-raging battle between farmers and parasites, and how bacteria can be wielded by aggressor and defender alike. There's a lot of information on the bacteria we inherit from our mothers as we pass through the birth canal, as well as the purpose of milk for a developing child (it feeds important bacteria as well as the baby). We witness tests with bacteria-free mice, swabbed zoo animals, gene sequencing, computer simulations, and various other methods of isolating the causes and effects of bacterial strains. We learn about commercial products that do and do not help (for example, probiotics make sense in theory, but the popular brands do either nothing at all or very little). We are shown the dangerous effects of overusing antibacterial products (themselves bi-products of bacterial warfare) and our misguided attempts to sanitize our environments [read: hospitals] completely. We learn the power of horizontal gene transfer (HGT) to both explain much of evolutionary history, to blur the lines between species and genomes, and to give us a potential leg up against parasites. Yong chronicles some successful examples of engineering (such as infecting mosquitos with neutral Wolbachia to combat Dengue fever, or applying transplanted rumen to help Austalian livestock eat Leucaena without consequence), but also some of the ongoing problems like pine beetle forest destruction. We hold our noses while applauding the remarkable promise of fecal transplantation, especially for C-diff, and the ongoing work to address other conditions like IBS and colitis.Yong shares leading theories, discredited theories, promising research, ongoing debates, and a lot of the nuance you don't always get from popular science writing. He's a gifted communicator, and can't resist side commentary with a lot of juicy science and good sense. With each discovery, it becomes readily apparent that we've barely scratched the surface and that quick assumptions and preliminary results almost always mislead, giving way to deeper understanding with ongoing research. Further investigation into the bacterial world will result in exciting advancements in health, materials, food, and a variety of other fields. I hope many people read this and are inspired to join in on the discovery."

26,0062368591,http://goodreads.com/user/show/32913415-laura,5," When Orson Welles said ""We're born alone, we live alone, we die alone"", he was mistaken. Even when we are alone, we are never alone. We exist in symbiosis--a wonderful term that refers to different organisms living together. Some animals are colonized by microbes while they are still unfertilized eggs; others pick up their first partners at the moment of birth. We then proceed through our lives in their presence. When we eat, so do they. When we travel, they come along. When we die, they consume us. Every one of us is a zoo in our own right--a colony enclosed within a single body. A multi-species collective. An entire world. ~~microscopic view of bacteria on the human tongueEd Yong takes us into an absolutely fascinating world--the unseen world of microscopic life. These tiny life forms were first glimpsed by a Dutchman, Antony van Leeuwenhoek, who thought to look at a drop of water through his handmade lens in the 1660's. He went on to publish detailed drawings of his findings. They garnered him intense attention and fame, and he went on to become a Fellow of the Royal Society. However, he never taught anyone else how to make his superior lenses, and when he died...and his collection went missing...interest waned. But then came the late 1700's and Louis Pasteur. He, along with Robert Koch, did meticulous work showing that bacteria are responsible for diseases formerly attributed to ""bad air"". So microbes permanently entered the lime light, but have been cast, almost exclusively, as a villein. ""It didn't help that just before this wave of discoveries, in 1859, one Charles Darwin had published  On the Origin of Species . 'Through this historical accident, the germ theory of disease developed during the gory phase of Darwinism, where the interplay between living things was regarded as a struggle for survival, when one had to be friend or foe, with no quarter given,' wrote microbiologist Rene Dubos. 'This attitude molded, from the beginning, all later attempts to control microbial diseases. It led to a kind of aggressive warfare against the microbes, aimed at their elimination from the sick individual and the community."" I am, as a registered nurse, a product of this culture. We in modern medicine are proud of the largely successful warfare that we have waged against infectious disease. We've come a VERY long ways from the days in which surgeons, covered in gore, wiped their saw on their apron, and then moved on to their next victim/patient. We maintain meticulous sterile fields. We ""foam in/foam out"" to kill all microbes on our hands before touching patients. We autoclave equipment and sanitize hospital rooms. We prescribe antibiotics for true bacterial infections...and many infections that don't require these weapons. In short, we've solved giant disease and pestilence problems, prolonging human life by decades in the process, but created other issues. We're only now acknowledging the seriousness of these new issues, and the science behind why eradicating bacteria might not be such a good idea.Ed Yong, while not taking sides per se, nevertheless presents a plethora of evidence supporting the beneficial aspects of bacterial life. Yes, infectious disease is still a menace. Yes, antibiotics still save lives every day. However, most bacteria do not cause diseases (except in profoundly immunocompromised hosts), but they crowd out harmful pathogens on surfaces--kitchen counters as well as our skin, toilet seats as well as our guts. Overuse of antibacterial products not only promotes resistant strands of bacteria, it also kills the non-pathogenic organisms...leaving a vacuum that is filled by the most aggressive micro-organisms. But bacteria do far more than simply live on surfaces. They digest food that we can't digest ourselves, they allow squid to glow, they protect insects from predators, they provide the scent in glands which many different animals use to communicate, and they can block the malaria parasite from infecting mosquitoes. In fact, there is compelling evidence that chloroplasts and mitochondria are domesticated bacteria which now cannot live outside plant/animal cells. It would seem that the fate of animal/plant life and bacteria are entwined, for better or for worse. Yong shows ""the long waltz"" that our species have engaged in. Through natural selection bacteria evolve to better serve their hosts, and we (plants/animals) evolve to depend more and more on our bacterial companions. But while the four eukaryotic kingdoms (protists, fungi, plants, and animals) evolve at a rate that isn't particularly noticeable until many generations, bacteria can evolve at an amazingly rapid pace. They can evolve to allow rodents to eat plants that would otherwise be poisonous to them for example. This aspect of bacteria is fascinating to those in the biomed field--where researchers are hoping to discover new ways of combating diseases such as ulcerative colitis, diabetes, multiple sclerosis, and cancer. Far from being the enemy, many bacteria actually have the potential to save us.  My two cents : My above rambling review has barely scratched the surface how mind-blowing Yong's book is. Read this offering to see how complex and down right amazing our world is. Given 5 stars or a rating of ""Perfect"". Highly, highly recommended!!  Further Reading:  Here's a very good article from the National Institutes of Health on beneficial microbes--https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/arti...~~Here's a fascinating look at the newest kingdom, Archaea, from the University of California, Berkley --https://ucmp.berkeley.edu/archaea/arc...~~A link to the University of Utah's page on the evolution of the cell...and an emerging theory of the origins of chloroplasts/mitochondria--https://learn.genetics.utah.edu/conte...~~Finally, H.G. Wells incorporated bacteria into the plot of his novel The War of the Worlds over 100 years ago. I *loved* his ending. But now, the part of me who finds sci-fi interesting has to ask, after reading  I Contain Multitudes , what if we (meaning plants/animals) have evolved to serve as walking vessels for bacteria? What if we serve them instead of the other way around? It's *ahem* food for thought. After all, new research shows that food cravings might be caused by the bacteria in our gut!"

28,0062368591,http://goodreads.com/user/show/440651-dov-zeller,5,"“Forget Orson Welles, and heed Walt Whitman: “I am large, I contain multitudes.”“'Each animal is an ecosystem with legs,' says John Rawls.""“As palaeontologist Andrew Knoll once said, 'Animals might be evolution's icing, but bacteria are really the cake.'""Yep, Ed Yong knows how to salt and pepper his writing with some good quotes. He also pens some wonderful great-for-quoting prose himself: ""It's estimated that every human contains 100 trillion microbes, most of which live in our guts. By comparison, the Milky Way contains between 100 million and 400 million stars.""“Within 24 hours of moving into a new place we overwrite it with our own microbes, turning it into a reflection of ourselves.”Yong is a great storyteller and gracefully covers a whole, er, host of topics. This is a broad-ranging book that still manages to go to fantastic depths (at which, by the way, there are many micro-organisms. Exremophiles in particular know how to go where no human has gone before, though we seem to be improving our methods of travel...)Imagine being the first person (known) to look at pond water through a microscope. You see critters moving all around and you think you're seeing things. You try again and again and star looking at all sorts of stuff. Anything you can think of. And almost everywhere you look, these little beings are zipping around. All of a sudden you realize there is a world of activity, an unknown world (or worlds) that has been there all along and their influence and importance is likely on a grand scale. It is kind of a complement to the realization that the earth revolves around the sun (i.e. it's not all about us) and that our solar system is just a few small dots in a vast network of galaxies.Yong follows the first known microscopist (to see microorganisms) into wonder and awe, and then death, and when he dies, Yong follows him back into obscurity (for one or two-hundred years?). And he brings us to the next wave of scientists studying these organisms. He talks of the theories over hundreds or thousands of years used to try to explain the work of microorganisms that was, at that point, invisible, and then brings us closer and closer to the present, as our understanding that microbes affect us grows and yet our comprehension of their intelligence, complexity and range of activity and influence often lags behind. Knowledge is anything but forward moving. There are people who lived thousands of years ago who knew much more about science than many people today. Mostly because people let inflexible (and in my experience, often dangerous) assumptions and ideologies get in the way of processes of learning and, perhaps more importantly, unlearning. For, in order to learn something new, to see something, even if is highy visible and evidence of it is incontrovertible, we often must let go of previously held notions. Yong's book is a testament to all the ways humans are wrong about things, and the endless specificity and self-importance of our vision that makes more omniscient forms of knowledge and wisdom impossible. We are always struggling to understand the world we live in, and we are often failing to see how powerful we are and yet how fallible, vulnerable and small. I wish I could write a better, more thorough review. I listened to this book on audio and I didn't take notes. Or, if I did, I cannot find them. But one of my favorite sections of the book was about worms. The work they do in the soil (and the long-term productivity of organic farming that works in collaboration with them), the revolutionary potential for use of worms to make waste management much more sustainable. And there was an interesting section on the microbiome/microbial communities in houses and hospitals as well as in the body. How trying to kill microbes is much more dangerous than trying to find a healthy balance of them. So much cool stuff in this book. I highly recommend it to anyone who has an interest in illness and health (of self and community), in building balanced healthy ecosystems rather than trying to solve our problems by eradicating and flattening the communities of microbes in our midst. “Much of modern medicine is built upon the foundations that antibiotics provide, and those foundations are now crumbling.” Here is the list of chapters to give you a bit more of a sense of the trajectory:Living Islands (evolution of eukaryotes, a brief history of biological time)The People Who Thought To Look (Antony van Leeuwenhoek--early microscopists) Body Builders (and he's not talking about gyms.)Terms and Conditions Apply (our love affair with friendly microbes is not the kind of love that is unconditional. It is a lot of work to sustain healthy balances.)In Sickness And In HealthThe Long Waltz (how do symbiotic partnerships begin? How do they evolve?)Mutually Assured SuccessAllegro in E Major (microbes influence on the genome of other animals)Microbes A La Carte (trying to work with the microbiome to fight illness and create healthier body ecosystems)Tomorrow the World"

It is not the only literary reference and I truly appreciate that in a science writer.Yong gives the feeling of being on a safari, observing exotic wildlife. He makes single-celled organisms as interesting as wildebeest and lions. We have come a long way in understanding this part of the ecosystem, and we have miles to go before we perfect that knowledge.The microorganisms were here first. All of the multicellular animals & plants have evolved in concert with them and it should come as no surprise that we have vast colonies of microbes on us & in us. In fact, they are essential to our proper function—witness the microbe-free mice that researchers have created to experiment with these ideas. Their guts and immune systems don’t function properly and the animals don’t behave like normal animals either. Before reading this book, I had a much too simplistic view of the human microbiome. Now I know a number of the factors that can influence it (diet & antibiotics are only two of a long list) and that “good” bacteria can do bad things if the system is out of whack (dysbiosis, my new word for the month).Not to mention cool things like using bacterial infections to control mosquito-bourne diseases!Recommended reading."

So overall I enjoyed reading it.The reason for only three stars: the books structure is not great. He talks about an issue and revisits it again and again. It is lacking the flow, and feels like he is visiting the same points over and over again. I assume this is due to him writing a first lengthy book on a single subject. The narrative wanders a bit, and it is harder to follow from time to time.Also, some of the research presented in the book is preliminary and not conclusive. Even though he has a section on how we cannot infer cause-effect relationship of these findings, many instances of the book has premature conclusions.Overall, it was a fun to read book and taught me many new things.

Where Yong lays bare research into inter-species cooperation that’s changing scientist’s views about natural selection. In the classic evolutionary/ biological view, it’s “us” against “the world.” Life is a struggle, red in tooth and claw. While that is true, it ignores that adaptive success that cooperation often provides. But unlike macro-cooperation (like a tight-knit African village banding together to raise all of their children collectively, or Microsoft and Intel working together to benefit both companies), Yong focuses on microbiological cooperation. You know. Those “probiotics” yogurt and supplement companies are so keen to foist on us, overstating the potential benefits of eating Lactobacillus bulgaricus and Streptococcus thermophilus. Which, as Yong points out, seldom if ever survive our stomach acids. But Yong digs deeper than shallow pop-cultural gee whiz. For instance, he introduces a theory that a positive “bacterial infection” may have led to human’s increased brain-size. He finds the evidence in probiotics present in human infants, passed to the via their mothers, that increase brain size. What’s more, they break down chemicals in breast milk that neither our guts nor other probiotics can. He also discusses the bacterial adaptations of termites, and how bacteria, molds and algae band together to create a healthy environment for corals, which create a lush habitat for a healthy reef’s assorted flora and fauna.And then I Contain Multitudes delves deeper, highlighting the ecological collapse of the tight webs of interconnected lives. He traces many biological disturbances, from dying coral reefs to human bacterial infection, to “dysbiosis,” an imbalance of the ecological order. Sometimes this imbalance provides a new, more adaptive order, like how recovery from an illness protects us from that bug via antibodies. At other times, like in a dying coral reef or Irritable Bowel Syndrome, a dysbiosis can settle into a chilling, almost dead stasis.On a related, if and gross side-note that appeals to my inner 14-year-old science-geek (for the record, that’s many decades behind me), Yong spends a chapter discussing Fecal Microbiota Transplants. It’s as potty-humor funny as it sounds. Here, doctors (or alternative medicine quacks) shoot a slurry of healthy people’s poop into sick people’s rectums via a high-pressure enema. Though silly and gross-sounding, this procedure often cures dysbiotic ailments, such as Crohn’s Disease and Irritable Bowel Syndrome, albeit with risks. [FYI from my Inner Adult: Since there are risks, it's best to avoid alternative medical woo-woo and consult an MD for Fecal Matter Transplants. Which, despite the potty humor, is no laughing matter. Here’s a WebMD article that oulines the risk/ reward using the best available science: http://www.webmd.com/digestive-disord... ]My main criticism of the book is the gee-whiz visionaries and entrepreneurs, hoping to cash-in “using the science or probiotics” to create healthier human cityscapes and dwellings. Since scientific efforts like this have a storied history of failure. Like the kudzu that’s overtaking the southeast, which the Soil Erosion Service paid farmers to plant in fallow fields to avoid the next Dust Bowl, only to have it “take off,” overtaking about 2,500 acres of land in the south each year. Or the FDA introducing carp, a delicacy in European cuisines, as a source of farm income, only to discover that American-raised carp taste muddy compared to those raised in Europe. Problem was, byt the time they'd discovered this, carp eggs were “in the wild,” spreading like a plague, displacing native fish populations and destroying the habitat of others. These two failures of ""scientific solutions"" are illustrative: many more exist. So needless to say, this skeptic won’t hold his breath. Like the antibiotic craze that’s created or current dysbiosis and given rise to higher-than-average allergies, asthmas and other autoimmune diseases, this “cure” will likely create a new dysbiosis. Flaws (and new-fangled tech gee-whiz) aside, I enjoyed Ed Yong’s I Contain Multitudes. I recommend it without reservation to fans of science books. The material is engaging, new and interesting. And very important. I was tempted to give it five stars, but something held me back. So I’m going with my four-star (and probiotic rich) gut in saying “four-stars.” . "
39,0062368591,http://goodreads.com/user/show/695116-jim,5,"The first paragraph of the book's description perfectly describes it for me. Yong didn't just tell me how important my microbiome is, by the end of book, I felt it. There he really missed a perfect picture for me - that of Pigpen from the Peanuts strip by Charles Shultz. We aren't discrete beings making our lonely way through the world, but continually changing clouds of bacteria influencing & being influenced by our surroundings plant, animal, & mineral due to our incredible ecologies. That's not an overstatement & Yong gives plenty of examples throughout the book.We didn't evolve in a vacuum, bacteria have constantly drenched every living organism. Most don't have much to do with us, but many find a home within the newcomers, the more complex hosts, & they act like good house guests. Sometimes they move in to stay & provide services (symbiot). Occasionally they get out of line (disbiosis) & far more rarely they're bad. He gives fascinating examples of all states.He really shined with his descriptions of how one variety mosquitoes are altered to not carry disease. I've heard about such efforts, but never knew any of the methods. He'd mentioned & had given enough details about the bacterial strain Wolbachia that when he got around to telling how scientists were infecting mosquitoes that carried Dengue fever with it in an attempt to eradicate the disease, it made perfect sense & I'm not a scientist of any sort. IOW, his explanations were all good & accessible.His discussion of balances within the microbiotic community were especially interesting to me since both my wife & daughter have stomach issues. I had no idea how much or quickly such things could change. A mere change in diet of a day can completely change the balance of our gut bacteria while a course of antibiotics can be catastrophic. Of course, we have to balance the risks of destroying gut bacteria against dying of another infection that the antibiotic is being taken for. Often there isn't a definite or even a good answer, but a guess based on probabilities. It's messy & defies simplification so beware of miracle cures. In a few decades a doctor might be able to tailor a bacterial cocktail for your particular symptoms & biome, but the science is in its infancy. One of the places it is starting is with Fecal Matter Transfer (FMT). Gross, but it's been routinely carried out for those whose systems are in such distress that they're losing weight & wearing diapers. A colonoscopy that plants a donor's poop up their own intestines often fixes the problem, at least for a time. Now they're refining this to cultures that are contained in a capsule. yes, they give out a poo pill! Apparently our species' aversion to eating poo isn't exactly the norm in the animal kingdom. Rabbits & rats have to eat their own or else they get a vitamin deficiency. Other species regularly eat other's poo & it's one way beneficial bacteria spread & inoculate them. It can also lead to similar smells among them fostering a sense of community. Who knew? Fascinating!I was really surprised by the example of Sea World keeping the dolphin's water too clean. Anyone who has had an aquarium knows it takes a while to balance the system & clear up the water. It's not dirt, but the bio-balance, so it's often best to start a new tank by taking water from an existing aquarium. I never changed more than 1/3 of the water per week, a rule of thumb that was told to me early on by seemingly everyone. Ivory tower syndrome?While this is rather long & sagged a bit about 2/3-3/4 of the way through (at least I wandered a bit) I highly recommend reading it all the way through. The end is great & well worth the journey. My edition was well narrated & easily understood. I did get the ebook to refer to, but didn't have to very often - mostly just for the name & spelling of some terms & names.Highly recommended!"
40,0062368591,http://goodreads.com/user/show/16002711-anna,5,"This was a fascinating book. I’ve heard of gut microbiota and faecal microbiome transfer, but there was tons of new information. One of the most important concepts for me was that the microbiome is necessary for the normal development and functioning of higher organisms. One of the main targets for research is the gut:“The weird biology of germ-free animals is most obvious in the gut. A well-functioning gut needs a big surface area for absorbing nutrients, which is why its walls are densely lined with long, finger-like pillars. It needs to constantly regenerate the cells at its surface, which get sloughed off by the passing tide of food. It needs a rich network of underlying blood vessels to carry nutrients to and fro. And it needs to be sealed – its cells must stick tightly to each other to prevent foreign molecules (and microbes) from leaking into those blood vessels. All of these essential properties are compromised without microbes.If zebrafish or mice grow up in the absence of bacteria their guts don’t develop fully, (which) can be rectified simply by giving the animals a normal complement of microbes or even isolated microbial molecules. The bacteria don’t physically reshape the gut themselves. Instead, they work via their hosts...Lora Hooper demonstrated this by infusing into germ-free mice a common gut bacterium called Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron – or B-theta to its friends. She found that the microbe activated a wide range of mouse genes that are involved in absorbing nutrients, building an impermeable barrier, breaking down toxins, creating blood vessels, and creating mature cells.”The microbiome is also essential in the early development and the normal functioning of the mature immune system:… an animal’s genome doesn’t provide everything it needs to create a mature immune system. It also needs input from a microbiome. Hundreds of scientific papers, on species as diverse as mice, tsetse flies and zebrafish, have shown that microbes help to shape the immune system in some way. They influence the creation of entire classes of immune cells, and the development of organs that make and store those cells. They are especially important early in life, when the immunity machine is first constructed and tunes itself to the big, bad world. And once the machine is chugging away, microbes continue to calibrate its reactions to threats.I found it fascinating that breast milk doesn’t just contain antibodies to protect the infant, it also contains special oligosaccharides: „scientists have identified over 200 human milk oligosaccharides, or HMOs, so far” that the infant can’t digest. Breast-fed infants carry Bifidobacteria in their guts. “HMOs are not an all-purpose food for Bifs. [] the sugars selectively nourish one particular subspecies called Bifidobacterium longum infantis, or B. infantis for short. As long as you provide it with HMOs, it will outcompete any other gut bacterium.” [] As it digests HMOs, B. infantis releases short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) that feed an infant’s gut cells – so while mothers nourish this microbe, the microbe in turn nourishes the baby. Through direct contact, B. infantis also encourages gut cells to make adhesive proteins that seal the gaps between them, and anti-inflammatory molecules that calibrate the immune system.”There are also chapters dealing with how microbes play a role in the life and death of coral reefs, symbionts in insects, how symbiosis is a precarious balance and only advantageous when the microbes are in the right place at the right time… I could go on, but you must read it yourself. I think it will be an engrossing read for anyone who is interested in science, symbiosis, evolution, ecology, hygiene…"
41,0062368591,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1192324-ana,5,"This will be a difficult book to review, because I find myself short of words to express how good it is! Ed Yong is a science journalist and an amazing story teller. He masters the difficult art of delivering detailed and scientifically accurate information in an agreeable way, without scaring away the layman reader while satisfying someone with knowledge in the field as well. In fact, he manages to make it so interesting that I often found myself glued to the pages and sometimes reading parts of the text aloud to my daughters.Yong’s erudition is visible in many ways, including the several links he makes with literature, which begin right with the title of the book, a verse taken from a poem by Walt Whitman, ”Song to myself”.In the introduction, Yong describes a visit to a zoo with a microbiologist, to collect samples from a white-bellied pangolin – in his words, “an utterly endearing animal that looks like a cross between an anteater and a pine cone.” What starts like a novel, quickly gives way to an overview of the different types of microbes that live on, within and around every animal. We find ourselves amazed by the variety and ubiquity of these beings and we know we’re trapped: our curiosity has been stirred and we will not stop reading this book!The first chapter of the book is a summary of the evolution of life on Earth, framing the appearance of the human being in relation to other life forms, and especially single-cell ones:“All the visible organisms we’re familiar with, everything that springs to mind when we think of ‘nature’, are latecomers to life’s story. For most of the tale, microbes were the only living things on Earth” (more precisely, from March to October, in an imaginary calendar that we can use if we collapse the planet’s entire 4.54 billion years old history into one year, to make it manageable by our brains; in this calendar, humans have only existed for the last 30 min of December 31).The second chapter is a condensed historical overview of the “discovery” of microbes by man and the way knowledge and our general perception of this group has evolved. It finishes with a visit to a museum in the Netherlands dedicated to microscopic life, that I absolutely need to visit: Micropia (https://www.micropia.nl/en/)From here onwards, each chapter follows the work and the recent discoveries of scientists working in different parts of the world with different microbe groups and applications (ecology, agriculture, human health…). I am not making a summary or giving away any spoilers, but suffice to say that although I am not a complete layman in this field, I still found myself amazed and fascinated enough to ponder enrolling on a microbiology online course just to freshen up my long forgotten and outdated knowledge in this field.As far as I could find out, this was Ed Yong’s first book. I can’t wait to read his next one, although I am prepared to wait, as I am sure books like these take a very long time to write. This is very clear from the dozens of people he interviewed, laboratories he visited and publications he consulted. The book has around 70 pages of notes and bibliography, which I found myself constantly referring to.For those who are still thinking whether they should read this book, I am leaving a link to a talk given by Ed Yong himself about his book on the day it was published. I am sure he will convince you himself:https://edyong.me/i-contain-multitudes/"
42,0062368591,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5558652-emma-sea,5,"just fantastic. the best book I've read in the last couple of years. Makes me actually excited and optiomistic about the future, which is a refreshing sensation after so many climate change books. "
43,0062368591,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3123067-elizabeth-a,5,"The fun thing about participating in readathons, is that books that have been on my TBR pile get a chance to float to the top. I read this as part of the May #AsianReadathon, and listened to the audiobook which is well narrated by Charlie Anson.I loved biology as a kid, and was that kid who read every single book she could get her hands on. So much so, that my Mom, a Bio and Chemistry teacher, had to keep them away from me so I would study other subjects. This wonderful book took me back to those days of sheer delight and wonderment at learning such cool stuff.This nonfiction book is wide reaching in scope, but takes deep dives on specific themes. Homo Sapiens often forget that we are relatively really late to this game called life, and that microbes have been around (and dominant) for much, much, much longer. It should then not be a surprise that all other life forms evolved with/around microbes. It's not news today that we are all covered (internally and externally) with trillions of microbes, but it's not often that we look at the world from the microbes point of view. This book explores the history, zoology, ecology, and biology of microbes and how they affect every single living thing on the planet in a myriad of ways. We often tend to focus on the bad guys - the pathogens - but that's like learning about terrorists, and assuming all that kind of people are terrorists. Not remotely true. I was educated, entertained, entranced, my mental maps where changed, and I will never look the world the same again. It was rather like a flat lander learning that the planet is not in fact flat. I do not exaggerate. The writing is really good, and covers a lot of ground in an easily digestible manner without dumbing things down. I appreciated the author's respect for the people on the front lines of the field, and the humor interspersed throughout. I loved every minute. I just learned the author covers science for The Atlantic, and I've added all his articles to my TBR list.Why might you care about microbes you ask? Well, from the book blurb: Many people think of microbes as germs to be eradicated, but those that live with us—the microbiome—build our bodies, protect our health, shape our identities, and grant us incredible abilities. You choose to remain ignorant at your own peril!"
44,0062368591,http://goodreads.com/user/show/21413858-k-j-charles,0,"Very interesting overview of how microbes work for and against us, and some of the developments in expanding technology. Also gives a good argument for not trying to create hygenic, sterile, too-clean environments because they reduce our microbe populations and leave us vulnerable to invasion by bad things. As a slob, I feel vindicated. Highly readable, the best sort of popular science."
45,0062368591,http://goodreads.com/user/show/17501320-helga-cohen,4,"This was an interesting book about the microbes inside us and around us and that are everywhere. This book goes into a lot of detail about the symbiosis between the microbes and other organisms, humans and animals. They are essential for life in all aspects, in digestion, our immune systems, and every other aspect of life. We would not be here today without them. It is also important to know that most microbes are not harmful. We have become so fixated on getting rid of them by too many antibiotics and too much antibacterial soaps and overly hygienic conditions that it is to our detriment. Antibiotics must be taken with care and only when necessary. Bacteria have been around forever and we have learned about them since Louis Pasteur and other microbiologists but with the new technologies of gene sequencing and genomics, it is now possible to sequence every gene and get a complete detail of every microbiome. With our understanding of evolution, we know that all life has co-evolved within close contact with microbes. And with our fast expanding knowledge of these microbes, we are learning how to eradicate diseases and learn how to live with them symbiotically.This book covers a very interesting array of topics about microbes in an understandable way and is for you if you are interested in microbiology."

47,0062368591,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5935491-tanja-berg,4,"This is an absolutely fantastic journey into the world of microbes. A world that pre-existed the one of all more complicated life forms and that every other creature has had to accommodate to.I’m on day five of influenza and am sorely not up to writing the titillating review this book deserves. I am hoping my virus infection does not result in a bacterial infection that would need antibiotics. Bacteria evolve at a blistering speed by gene transfer, so resistance is almost instantaneous. Furthermore, a dose of antibiotics would put my gut microbes into havoc, possibly decimating the colonies I would like to keep and let more nasty ones settle. But no, you cannot treat a viral infection itself with antibiotics! Please! Our microbiomes aren’t inherently good or bad. There is no such thing as a good bug or a bad bug. Some play along the entire scale anyway. What has become clear is that our obsession with cleanliness is counterproductive, causing autoimmune diseases such as asthma. We need to train our immune systems to not be jittery and overreact.This book deserves to be read. It’s well told and entertaining, while being immensely informative."
48,0062368591,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4739424-mal-warwick,4,"If you’re a physician, a nutritionist, or have studied biology, you’re probably aware that our bodies contain an immense number of microbes. Most of the rest of us find that surprising. Though I knew about the bugs that inhabit my digestive system, British science journalist Ed Yong helped me understand just how numerous and widely dispersed those microbes are on my body—and yours. Try 39 trillion. That number’s greater than the estimated number of human cells in our bodies. And it’s 100 times as great as the largest estimate of the number of stars in the Milky Way galaxy. In other words, it’s an understatement to say that the number of microbes we contain is astronomical.Should we fear the microbes within us?Now, before you panic about the many diseases you’ll contract from all these bugs, rest assured. “There are fewer than 100 species of bacteria that cause infectious diseases in humans,” as Yong explains in I Contain Multitudes. “By contrast, the thousands of species in our guts are mostly harmless.” And a great many of them play indispensable roles in keeping us alive and disease-free. They bolster our immune system, digest our food, and even help make us who we are.How did this come about? “Remember that animals emerged in a world that had already been teeming with microbes for billions of years,” Yong notes. “They were the rulers of the planet long before we arrived. And when we did arrive, of course we evolved ways of interacting with the microbes around us.”The world within usThe collection of microbes in each of us is generally called the microbiome. Yong explains its functions and its fathomless diversity in conversational English with occasional flashes of humor. “Every one of us is a zoo in our own right,” he writes. “A colony enclosed within a single body. A multi-species collective. An entire world. . . Some species are common, but none is everywhere.” And that collection of species is unique to each of us. The microbes in my gut and on my skin are very different from those in and on you. Not only that but “your right hand shares just a sixth of its microbial species with your left hand.”The symbiosis spectrumThe theme of I Contain Multitudes is symbiosis. In common parlance, symbiosis suggests mutual benefit. Technically, though, the meaning is broader. “If one partner benefited at the expense of the other, it was a parasite (or a pathogen if it caused disease). If it benefited without affecting its host, it was a commensal. If it benefited its host, it was a mutualist. All these styles of coexistence fell under the rubric of symbiosis.” Yong’s book includes a huge number of examples, not just within our own bodies but in animals and plants as well. If you have an affinity for science, you’ll love this book.By the way, “there is no such thing as a ‘good microbe’ or a ‘bad microbe’ . . . In reality, bacteria exist along a continuum of lifestyles, between ‘bad’ parasites and ‘good’ mutualists. Some microbes . . . slide from one end of the parasite-mutualist spectrum to the other, depending on the strain, and on the host they find themselves in.” The possibilities of these combinations are endless.The ever-evolving field of biologyYong will take you on a tour of the laboratories where scientists study symbiosis and its effects on its many hosts in other living things. You’ll meet the pioneers in the field—a fascinating lot, few of whom match the stereotype of the frizzy-haired, absent-minded professor. You’ll learn about the emerging fields of biogeography, metagenomics, and synthetic biology. And you’ll see how the discoveries in these fields are benefiting medical science—and portend more advances in the future.The title of this engrossing book is from Walt Whitman: “I am large. I contain multitudes.”About the authorBorn Edmund Soon-Weng Yong in 1981, Ed Yong is a staff member of The Atlantic. He has degrees in zoology and biochemistry from England’s most celebrated centers of scientific teaching and research, the University of Cambridge and University College London. His popular blog has been incorporated into the National Geographic online."
49,0062368591,http://goodreads.com/user/show/563794-amy,5,"I originally encountered this book when ordering it for a class at the high school where I work. I have to think that if I had read this book in high school, my life would have taken a different trajectory. I find the world of bacteria and fungi to be ridiculously fascinating. Since I started reading this book, I’ve started reading microbiology textbooks and even joined a local mycology society. I’m not sure what I can do with all of this fascination at this point in my life, but here I am. I made 102 highlights in this book. Where in the world do I start? First of all, I think it’s important to clear up the misconception microbes are mainly disease-causing germs. Viruses cause diseases, but fewer than 100 bacteria actually cause diseases. So many of them work in symbiosis with the creatures that they inhabit making them healthier overall. Many have evolved with their hosts. Some of the more interesting ones discussed in the book are microbes that work inside insects to do things that the insects couldn't do on their own (such as the protozoa inside termites which help to digest wood). I could read an entire book on microbes inside insects and be happy. One of the more intriguing microbes that works in our favor is the bacteriophage. Bacteriophages in our mucus act as a line of defense against bacteria that try to enter our bodies through our mouths and nose. A bacteriophage injects its DNA into an invading bacteria and then replicates itself many times over inside the bacteria. Then all these new baby bacteriophages burst out of the bacteria in a spectacular act of bactericide. Something I’ve thought for years is that we’re hurting ourselves by living in cities, staying indoors, not interacting with farm animals, sanitizing everything, swimming in chlorinated pools, washing our hands too often and with anti-bacterial soaps, taking too many baths, being overly-cautious about refrigerating food, etc. We're robbing ourselves of the good bacteria that once colonized us. As a result, we have more allergies, more inflammatory diseases, etc. Of course, I say this, but I can’t stand for my hands to be dirty. But I do notice a huge difference moving to the city and spending more time indoors than outdoors in the woods. Last time I went back to visit relatives who live in the pine-filled South, I was sneezing at pine pollen that never bothered me before. I’ve been trying to spend more time in the woods, even going so far as to fall into mud puddles while trail running. It’s all part of the master plan of gaining more microbes. At least I’ll tell myself that. When we take antibiotics, we know that we’re eliminating helpful bacteria as well as the bad bacteria infecting us. As a result, we’ve been led to believe that eating yogurt or probiotics can help restore our gut microbiome. And we've heard about our gut microbiome affecting obesity. It is true that several studies have shown that it appears that gut bacteria can determine our propensity toward obesity. For example, normal-sized mice have 3000 times more Akkermansia muciniphila than obese mice. When obese mice eat this bacteria, they lose weight and are less likely to have type 2 diabetes. However, studies have shown that eating yogurt doesn’t really change the gut biome in the long term and probiotics really can only shorten diarrhea brought about by the infection or the antibiotics. Probiotics an also save premature infants from death by necrotising entercolitis. Otherwise, neither yogurt nor probiotics do much good in restoring what we’ve lost. However, it is possible to restore our gut health by acquiring the right microbes. But the way that we do this may sound a little gross because it’s by cacophagy (ingesting feces in pill form) or fecal transplants. I noticed my dog doing this for herself on a walk the other day and had to tell myself that it wasn't gross; she was just treating herself to a free ecosystem transplant. Fecal transplant studies have been found to cure up to 94% of participants of certain maladies which is statistically amazing. Fecal transplants have been used to treat everything from obesity to gut issues to mental health issues. I feel like I need to reread this book a few times to really get everything from it. There are just so many things that are interesting in the world of microbes. I know this book only scratches the surface, but it does so in a way that’s easily readable and understandable. Sometimes when I was reading this, I found myself far more intrigued to see where a study went than to find out what was happening next in my fiction book. Not all authors of scientific subjects can manage to do that."
50,0062368591,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1376766-becky,4,"I picked this book up recently from Audible (because they had a sale and I'm weak.) ((After writing that I remembered that as part of that sale I received a $5 credit and then went to Audible to scope out their daily deal to see if I wanted to use it on that. I. AM. WEAK.)) (((By the way, it's Leviathan Wakes, which I already own, and absolutely recommend. $5.95 - can't beat that price for the audio!))) But anyway, I've been reading and listening to a LOT of nonfiction this year, and this was right up my alley, so of course I would pick it up if it was on sale. And man, was this fascinating. I have never been the type of person who worries overmuch about cleanliness to the point of sterility, and this book has kind of made me feel justified in that. I learned a lot - some that worries me for the future of my preemie, c-section born, and formula-fed nephew's future gut health (because he didn't get a boost of beneficial microbes that vaginally born and breastfed babies usually get from their mothers)... but a lot more that makes me hopeful for a lot of other conditions and illnesses and diseases that could be treated or prevented with the right microbial application. The hubs and I have been probiotic fans for a while (him more religiously than I) and so it was a little disappointing to learn that for the most part, this is useless and bunk because any microbes ingested this way don't actually stick around to become part of our biome, but rather pass through as any other food would. But it is a thought in the right direction for how we think about health, and how we think about microbes. Far from the ""all bacteria are bad!"" model, we should be thinking about them as organisms that can be beneficial or harmful depending on the situation. To a mouse, a cat is always bad news. To a human relying on that cat to rid them of mice, the cat is beneficial. Sometimes we're the mouse, and sometimes we're the human, but the cat is always just the cat. I was really interested to learn how microbes have facilitated evolution and development for many, many animals through symbiosis. This part of the book was very fascinating to me, because we usually tend to think of an organism as suited to its environment on its own, but that isn't always the case. For some animals, the right microbe at the right time is necessary to reach maturity, or to be able to eat and digest certain foods, etc. Really interesting. I didn't love the reader for this audiobook. He wasn't bad, but he would pause oddly in the middle of sentences sometimes (especially toward the end of the book) and it would throw me off thinking that he was done with the sentence, only to continue the thought. Otherwise, the only little nitpick I had was that sometimes the way he pronounced things threw me off. Aside from that, I thought he did a fine job, and I really enjoyed the book."
51,0062368591,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7324264-john,5,"A Most Engrossing Exploration of the Microbial Organisms Which Lurk Within UsEchoing Charles Darwin's concluding paragraph in the first edition of Darwin's ""On the Origin of Species"" in its subtitle, noted science journalist Ed Yong's ""I Contain Multitudes: The Microbes Within Us and a Grander View of Life"" is an exceptional, quite riveting, account explaining how bacteria and other microbes have played - and continue to play - important roles in shaping the course of the history of life on our planet. Yong offers us a compelling account of microbial ecology - especially the human microbiome - that can be seen as a worthy successor to David Quammen's masterful book on biogeography, ""The Song of The Dodo: Island Biogeography in an Age of Extinction"", Quammen's other notable works on evolutionary biology and Carl Zimmer's excellent books ranging from microbiology to evolutionary biology. While Yong does not explicitly refer to the coevolution of bacteria and other microbes within their plant and animal hosts, he does stress the importance of the mutualistic aspects of coevolution, noting as the main theme of his book, symbiosis between microbes and those other, much larger, organisms for which they are the ""multitudes"" within them.Yong takes readers on a compelling journey through space and time, noting some of the most important figures in the history of microbiology as well as introducing us to important contemporary microbiologists, and especially, microbial ecologists, such as University of Texas, Austin entomologist Nancy A. Moran, who is highly regarded for her research into the coevolution of aphids with their microbiomes, and most recently, honeybees with theirs. There are also especially noteworthy biographical overviews of Antony van Leeuwenhoek, the inventor of the microscope, and the first serious scientific investigator of the microbial world, Carl Woese, the American microbiologist who discovered the Archaea, Earth's oldest - and most ""primitive"" - organisms, and Lynn Margulies, the maverick American biologist who developed the credible scientific theory of endosymbiosis, explaining the origin of the eukaryotic cell found in plants and animals. He also explains how the once popular germ theory of disease promoted first by the likes of Robert Koch and Louis Pasteur in the 19th Century - which treated virtually all microbes as germs that had to be destroyed to prevent humanity from suffering from germ-borne diseases - is giving way to a far more nuanced view of the microbes residing within us, as willing partners and occasionally, antagonists, which have played notable roles in our evolutionary histories while we have also been influencing theirs across the vast gulf of time.Yong asks us to see ourselves as individual ""islands"", drawing upon the scientific metaphor of island biogeography popularized by David Quammen in his seminal book, ""The Song of the Dodo"" and the subject of much notable ecological research from the 1960s to the present. We are ""islands"" inhabited by microbial denizens. He emphasizes this repeatedly, introducing us to species as bizarre as a squid that relies on luminous bacteria for fostering its growth from juvenile larvae to adult, and parthenogenetic female parasitic wasps relying on microbes that prevent the occurrence of reproductively fertile male wasps. He shows how important microbes are in facilitating digestion of otherwise inedible food, like grasses in the stomachs of ruminant mammals such as cows, goats and sheep. In humans, he notes how differing modes of birth - natural vaginal versus Caesarean section - will leave newborn infants with different microbiomes, that may have an important impact on the health of new-born infants. He also shows how current microbiome research in evolutionary medicine and environmental science, represents some of the newest frontiers in contemporary medicine and science.Ed Yong is such a compellingly gifted storyteller and prose stylist that ""I Contain Multitudes: The Microbes Within Us and a Grander View of Life"" will simultaneously surprise, delight, and entertain its readers. There is never a dull moment lurking in the pages of Yong's book; instead, readers will be mesmerized from its opening pages to its very last. If Charles Darwin read Ed Yong's ""I Contain Multitudes"", he might conclude that it offers readers a much grander view of life than what he envisioned when he wrote ""On the Origin of Species"". He might admit to possessing after reading it, both a substantial understanding and appreciation for the microbial life that he never thought of when he ended ""On the Origin of Species"" with these eloquent observations; ""There is grandeur in this view of life, with its several powers, having been originally breathed by the Creator into a few forms or into one; and that, whilst this planet has gone circling on according to the fixed law of gravity, from so simple a beginning endless forms most beautiful and most wonderful have been, and are being evolved."""

This book contains many interesting scientific findings and microbial interactions - such as worms that don't have a mouth and don't need to eat; parasitic wasps with antibiotic antennae goo; viruses inside bacteria inside a bug; bacteria that influence which bugs get to breed; the effects of your microbial ecosystem in sickness and in health; as well as a whole lot of other fascinating stuff.The author has a personable writing style without turning into a semi-biography. He manages to explain scientific concepts without simplifying them too much or bogging the reader down with technical terminology. The beginning of the book is a bit disjointed in terms of story telling, but then gets better as the author goes along. I do wish Ed Yong had included more details about some of the topics discussed, but that was probably out of the scope for a popular science book like this.Other Recommended Books about Microbes:- March of the Microbes: Sighting the Unseen by John L.

Here, the microbiomania was tempered by words of caution and foresight. For example, the lack of evidence that the lactic acid-producing bacteria survive the digestive track or even influence resident gut microbe communities, (most “probiotics” are mostly hype) while the bugs that HAVE shown clinical effects (e.g. in mice) should be wielded with much caution given that they are precisely more likely to establish themselves, and no organisms have only good or only bad effects. Even my favorite example of fecal transplants has really only been the miracle cure with C. diff infections, while the more complex IBD, obesity, and autism effects are clearly much more poorly understood. Still, there are amazing things on the horizon, and I love seeing that the actual reasearchers in the field are demonstrating that they have (finally) learned lessons from evolution and ecology and are trying to work with, rather than against, these forces. Balanced and rational arguments are so damned sexy."

Worldview, changed. All the knowledge. But... but really, and I say this with the greatest respect, what I'm mostly taking away from this is... THERE ARE TINY THINGS EVERYWHERE. I mean I knew this. Or at least, I kind of knew this, but I didn't know HOW MUCH this. Like... like really. You couldn't even eat food without them. And fish couldn't have fishy sex without them. Or something. It's all... terrifying and weird and crazy and beautiful. SCIENCE, people. That's the thing here. SCIENCE IS TINY AND AMAZING. I think that about sums it up. You should read this book. (Maybe not while eating lunch though. That was a mistake.)"

The definition of microbiome and what bacteria are to us humans was extremely fascinating. I was following the book with the audio version; it really does read like someone talking to you about interesting little creatures that make us up as well as our entire world! The writing was awesome, very easy to read for those who are not into microbiology or animals. It’s definitely not a boring read, and I learned a lot from it. The research that went into this about how long ago is very evident, which makes the more that much more interesting to read. Bacteria is everywhere; however, it’s important to learn what they do and how to do it to appreciate the world around us."
56,0062368591,http://goodreads.com/user/show/57204493-rachel-blakeman,2,"I am in the clear minority of readers here because I did not enjoy this book. It felt like a lot work to read without sufficient payoff. I feel more knowledgable about science and biology than the average person but I always felt a little behind in the science throughout. There were clearly interesting parts but they were outweighed by a writing and organizational style that felt unstructured and wandering. Very heavy on animal microbiomes, not as much on humans as I had hoped. If you're not interested in committing 264 pages of your life to this, you can get was amounts to a best-of on his ""Fresh Air"" interview. "

58,0062368591,http://goodreads.com/user/show/284485-kara,2,"A super interesting topic discussed with humor, but the book seemed to meander directionless often, and I had to take off a star for the distractingly poor line editing. "
59,0062368591,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8783847-ginger-bensman,5,"A well-researched, brilliant, humbling, and mind boggling book about the microbes within us and all around us. Turns out humans aren’t the independent, rugged, top of the food chain, go-it-alone heros of the universe after all! Instead, our very lives, and health—even our moods and thoughts, are interconnected with microbes and viruses in ways we’ve only begun to comprehend. A prismatic glimpse into the web of life. Highly recommended."
