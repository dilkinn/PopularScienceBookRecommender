0,0307272702,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1113334-betty,5,"Reading this book completely changed the way I look at food and nutrition. I deliberately held off from writing a review until I had followed Taubes' recommended regime and food intake for some time. Having started the book almost a year ago, my husband and I began eating in a whole new way and it took nearly a month for us to ""lose"" our lust for carbs and get used to our new lifestyle. The weight came off slowly but steadily and more importantly, we both lost inches (I dropped three dress sizes in six months - this is really significant because I am quite short and any amount of weight I carry makes me look the size of a house). It has been slow - I have lost nearly 15kg in 9 months - but this does not bother me, as Gary Taubes has made me realise that it took years to put the weight on and it will take time to lose it. Not only do I feel fantastic, but nearly a year down the line I am still losing and enjoying being able to wear lovely clothes again - and that's with very little exercise! My brain is quicker, I don't forget things like I used to and I have so much more energy and positivity! And as for the health benefits, I am far healthier than I have been in years. My friends are incredulous because I eat so much cheese, butter and cream! After following my new eating plan (I do not consider myself as being on diet) for three months, I started experiencing dizzy spells and weird leg cramps. I visited my doctor who ran a full series of blood tests, including all thyroid tests (I have been suffering from hypothyroidism for years and have been taking thyroxin for nearly 7 years). The results were astonishing - the cause of the dizziness was my thyroid. My new eating plan had kick-started my thryoid again and because I was still on medication, I was over-producing the hormone. My doctor immediately halved my dose of medication and retested me a month later, then the month after that. The dizziness and cramps disappeared. I have been completely off the medication for four months now and a recent blood test has confirmed that my thyroid function has returned to normal! As for the rest of my test results - my doctor told me that my full blood count is that of an 18 year olds! Although my overall cholesterol was higher than it's ever been, there were no red flags because my cholesterol to HDL ratio is very good. I have also suffered with low blood iron following years of regular blood donation and marathon running - at one stage having to give up blood donation because my iron reserves were so low. My iron levels are now extremely healthy. My doctor is 100% behind me on my new eating plan.I had to laugh at a review of this book that said that's its greatest downfall is that you have to follow this ""diet"" for the rest of your life and that that's impossible to do. Well, we all know carbs are bad for us, so that's like saying ""the problem with giving up smoking, is that you have to give up cigarettes for life!"". Taubes' book has truly hammered home the message that refined starch and sugar is poison. Thanks to this book, I have experienced a complete paradigm shift and am all the better for it!"
1,0307272702,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2658672-scott,2,"I didn’t realize this when I started it (though I probably should have), but this book is a 272-page advertisement for low-carb diets. My main criticism is that Taubes comes across as condescending. He’s so convinced himself that low-carb diets are the best that he’s unwilling, and in fact does not, consider compelling counterarguments against that contention. The first half of the book criticizes the conventional wisdom that, in order to lose weight, people must consume fewer calories than they expend. He cites numerous studies and research that establish that doing one of either exercising or reducing calories does not typically result in weight loss. When people exercise more, they eat more. When they eat less, they expend less energy. The major flaw in this position is that virtually none of the research addressed the efficacy of diets that require both diet and exercise. Clearly, both in conjunction can work and have worked; otherwise programs such as Weight Watchers would have no success, and the TV program Biggest Loser would not exist. I don't care how obese a person is, if that person accurately accounts for calories expended, even if sedentary, and then eats less than that, that person will lose weight. Even if that person eats almost entirely carbs. How else could Mark Haub’s (of Kansas State) Twinkie diet have worked? Taubes lost a lot of credibility by failing to acknowledge this fact. And while it makes sense that diets which severely restrict calories, such as 1500-per-day diets, wouldn’t catch hold, what about diets that restrict only a moderate amount of calories? Say, the amount of energy a person a day expends minus 100 calories? I actually lost 15 pounds last year by doing something similar, and I ate desert almost every day. I’ve kept the weight off by closely watching to ensure that I don’t consume more calories than I burn. That’s not to say, however, that some people aren’t more predisposed to becoming obese or that it isn’t easier for some people to stay lean. But with sufficient motivation, weight loss can be achieved, even while eating carbs. I acknowledge that many people can't, or won't, life a lifestyle requiring both diet and exercise in the long term, which is a valid criticism I suppose.But will people live a low-carb lifestyle in the long term? A low-carb diet is boring. How many breakfasts of bacon and eggs in a row can someone stomach? Are people really going to stay motivated, in the long-term, to avoid potatoes, beer, pasta, and sweets? Do you know how many places low-carb dieters can’t eat at with their friends? Low-carb diets are also expensive; many can’t afford to eat meat at nearly every meal. And what’s the success rate of those who begin low-carb diets in the long-term? Astoundingly, Taubes doesn’t even address that question. I’m somewhat perplexed at the unusually high ratings this book has received, given that it hasn’t addressed the issues above. It’s almost as if the low-carb diet is a form of religion about which supporters will not allow others to blashpeme."
2,0307272702,http://goodreads.com/user/show/155663-david,1,"I was attracted to this book, because it contains some interesting ideas, like ""we don't get fat because we overeat--we overeat because we get fat."" There may be some truth to this concept, and for me, it was the highlight of the book.After that, though, the book goes downhill. Like a lead weight. Basically, Taubes recommends a diet very similar to the Atkins diet: meat, fat, and some green leafy vegetables. Yes, you can lose weight on this diet, but then you have to stay on it forever. Taubes is honest, when he writes that this is not a diet book, one that you follow for a while just to lose weight. Instead, it must be a long-term, total lifestyle change. And there's the rub. It is very very difficult to stay on such a regime for the long term. People feel sick and constipated on this type of regime. And, Taubes really gives short shrift to the many medical problems that will ensue. For example, Taubes does not even mention the extra strain put on the liver and kidneys. Since someone following this regime will be eating TEN TIMES more protein than is needed, the excess protein has to be metabolized by the liver and kidneys. Yikes!As another example, this sort of diet is not a good long-term solution for diabetics. Dr. Atkins admitted as much, in his second book. And there have not been many good studies of the circulatory health of people on this diet; Only one has been done (Fleming RM. The effect of high-protein diets on coronary blood flow. Angiology. 2000 Oct;51(10):817-26.) and the conclusions are that blood flow is impeded, and artery disease increases.So here we have a journalist who is giving nutritional advice. He has never treated a single patient, and he is ignorant of the long-term effects of the regime he espouses. "
3,0307272702,http://goodreads.com/user/show/175635-trevor,4,"I want start this one with a disclaimer. I really know virtually nothing about human dietary requirements and anyone that takes advice from me on this subject is a fool. Also, the depth of my ignorance is such that this guy (who knows infinitely more than I probably ever will on this subject) could make me believe that a diet rich in horse droppings would make me taller. All the same, and with my general ignorance presented as a given, I have to say I found this a very interesting book and quite convincing.The other disclaimer is that my mother and sister are somewhat obsessed with low cholesterol diets. Something I’ve been resisting for about two years now.The fundamental idea that lies behind the generally accepted theory of why we get fat is that it is all about a misbalance between the energy we take in via our food and the energy we expend in working during the day. He makes the point early in the book that if you mess this balance up by as little as a bite of toast a day then over a twenty-year period you will end up obese. He is really very good at reducing to the absurd the generally accepted theories of why we get fat. The problem is that we humans prefer really simple metaphors that also link nicely to the world we live in. This is part of the reason why the mind used to be thought of as a steam engine and now is compared to a computer, when, really, it isn’t like either. Our bodies are likely to be compared to a car. You put fuel in and that lets you drive around – except that if you keep putting fuel into your car that you don’t use your mini doesn’t grow into a Cadillac and then into a bus – you know, in the way we do. By his stressing how it is almost impossible to balance calories in and calories out he then turns his attention to exercise. It seems reasonable that if you want to lose weight the best way to achieve it would be to burn your fat off through exercising. The problem is that exercise makes you hungry. So, yet again you need to somehow balance calories in and calories out and if you are like me and have tried to do this you will know that it is virtually impossible. I’ve used calorie counters and my iPhone to tell me how much energy I’ve burnt during my walks – but my weight remains remarkably consistent whatever I seem to do.Central to his argument is the idea that not all food is good food. The calories in and calories out idea is that you could get all of our calories from coke and as long as you were burning off the same number of calories during the day your weight will remain the same. This is the fuel in / energy out model taken to the extreme. But the human body doesn’t work like that. Essentially there are two mechanisms that are used to power our bodies and these come into conflict and help to make us obese. The first is how our bodies respond to sugars and carbohydrates. These foods are easy to digest and easy to get energy from, so our bodies digest them first. In response our bodies produce insulin – but one of the things insulin also does is to stop our cells from burning the fat they have stored in them and rather to store more fat in our cells. With increasing levels of insulin in our blood our bodies never get around to burning the energy reserves that are stored as fat within our cells. This process has a kind of irony about it. We eat carbohydrates and sugars and they encourage fat into our cells to be stored for a later that never comes and by raising the insulin levels in our blood eating carbohydrates ensures that that fat can’t ever be used. But our bodies still need energy – so even though we ought to be sated, we crave more food, particularly carbohydrate rich food that can quickly be turned into blood sugar for an energy boost. This again spikes our insulin levels, which again makes it impossible for us to get to the energy stored as fat. So, instead we lay down more fat and feel hungrier still. The method of overcoming this vicious cycle is to stop eating carbohydrates and this will then allow our bodies to reduce the amount of insulin in our blood and thereby allow our bodies to start burning our grossly increased fat reserves. Insulin, then, is the problem – essentially, this guy is saying that obesity is a kind of diabetes. But he goes further – he says that many of the diseases that are associated with Western diets are effectively forms of diabetes. This includes many cancers (breast and colon in particular) and Alzheimer’s – which he claims people are now referring to as Type Three Diabetes.So, how to get thin and live a healthier life? Well, this is the uncomfortable part of the story for me. We have to give up sugars and carbohydrates and to eat much more meat and fat. As counter-intuitive as it might seem, fat and meat are ‘good calories’ and he provides an evolutionary just-so story to prove it. He claims that meat, rather than vegetables and starch, was the key to our diet as hunter-gatherers. And as such we have evolved to eat lots of meat and certainly not lots of bread. As you can see, this is a full-frontal attack on carbs and like I said, I’ve no idea if this attack is justified – although the case he makes is very convincing. What he says makes sense. If any of you have some link to something that debunks this viewpoint, I would be keen to read it.And my interest in all this? Well, the problem is that diabetes doesn’t so much run in my family, it sprints. Out of the six siblings in my mother’s family only one does not have diabetes. If avoiding diabetes means I can also avoid Alzheimer’s I’m more than happy to give up just about anything.The high meat and high fat diet does have lots of things going for it – not least the promise that it allows you to lose weight without feeling hungry all of the time. I’ve actually tried exercise and limiting calories and exercise doesn’t work for weight loss (though it is much better at improving mental wellbeing and that isn’t something to be sneezed at). The promise of an easy way to maintain a healthy weight and avoid the associated problems of increasing body weight is very appealing – but at the risk of sounding particularly Protestant, it all does sound a little too easy. All the same, I am interested in science and don’t like to think that I am believing something that is not supported by the facts.This is a very interesting book. The problem is that it is supposed to be the snappier version of Good Calories, Bad Calories – but if this is snappy I dread to think what that book must be like. This could really have been cut in half again without much loss, but I do understand he is trying to cover all arguments against and I have to say he does do that. All the same, if what he has to say is even only half true then much of the dietary advice that has been given to us for around 50 years is not only useless, but actually counterproductive.More links and info on this review here: http://www.goodreads.com/review/show/..."
4,0307272702,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3971432-jessi,4,"First Line: ""In 1934, a young German pediatrician named Hilde Bruch moved to America, settled in New York City, and was 'startled,' as she later wrote, by the number of fat children she saw - 'really fat ones, not only in clinics, but on the streets and subways, and in schools.'""Taubes takes everything that I have spent the last several years learning about weight loss, fat gain, diabetes, and eating and turns it on its head. I am not yet certain whether I am willing to buy into his arguments, but there are three things that are making me at least consider that he might be right or partially right. 1.) He begins the book by asking all readers to analyze the material (his book and any others) and to make decisions for them. Most fad diet books tend to just take the stance that they are absolutely right and never remind us to use our brains. 2.) For every argument that I came up with while reading this book, he addresses it at some point and provides data to back up his theories. 3.) I have been trying to lose weight through recommended methods (low-fat diets, calorie cutting, and exercise) for almost nine years and have watched many of my family and friends with the same struggle. I recently read that of the people currently and actively trying to lose weight, only ten percent or so will actually be successful and of those, 96% will fail to keep off the weight they lose. With chances like that, I am willing to consider a different method and give it a try.I will also say that this book is simply a fascinating read. I don't think I have ever been so enthralled with a non-fiction book (especially one steeped in science) that I literally couldn't put it down, so this was a first for me.Update 2/29/12I followed up this book by reading the New Atkins Diet, Primal Blueprint, and the Paleo Diet. From these four which sometimes contradict each other, I constructed a diet with unlimited meats and veggies, no processed sugars, grains, or legumes and limited amounts of nuts, berries, dairy, and root vegetables. I am exercising but only in ways that I enjoy, specifically yoga and hiking. Since Jan 2012 I have lost 24 lbs, 1 pant size, and I feel much more energetic. I have had a few slip ups, but not many and when I do eat sugar or carb heavy items I'm almost immediately exhausted and grouchy. I am at the lowest weight I have been in nine years and my success makes it much easier to stick with it. I've got 66 lbs to go and for the first time I have hope that I'll actually make it and maintain it. "
5,0307272702,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1662632-richard,0,"Gary Taubes, the author of Why We Get Fat: And What to Do About It, wrote a moderately lengthy article in the New York Times Sunday Magazine on April 17, 2011, with the title 
“Is Sugar Toxic?”
 The evidence seems to be accumulating steadily that the amount of sugar that the average American consumes is profoundly unhealthy, and the article does a very good job explaining why.I’m not sure if that article covers the same grounds as this book, but I can very briefly recap the article:• Increasing sugar consumption is highly correlated with diabetes, metabolic syndrome, heart disease, and some cancers.• Granulated “table” sugar—sucrose—consists of one molecule of glucose bound to one molecule of fructose; that pairing is easily broken, leaving one molecule of each. High-fructose corn syrup (“HFCS”) consists of roughly half each of those same two molecules, and all the evidence is that there is no caloric or metabolic difference between the two forms. Plain corn syrup, on the other hand, is effectively just glucose—no fructose.• Glucose can be metabolized by any cell in the body whereas, with few exceptions, fructose must be metabolized in the liver. Therein lies, apparently, a key difference. When the liver is presented with fructose, it preferentially metabolizes it, dramatically elevating insulin and related hormones.• A high steady intake of fructose (either from sucrose or HFCS) means that insulin is elevated too often, leading to insulin resistance.• Fructose is also sometimes thought of as the fruit sugar. Whole fruits still have fiber, which apparently slows down intestinal absorption so much that it doesn't overwhelm the liver the way a soda does. But fruit juices? Yeah, sorry — rip out the fiber and you’re once again sucking down nothing but sugar water with a bit of “health halo effect” vitamins.• Insulin resistance is linked to heart disease (and other, related, disorders associated with a poor glycemic balance), and metabolic syndrome.• A thickening waistline is the visible indicator of metabolic syndrome.• Insulin is a growth factor in tumor production, which provides one likely explanation for why rising cancer levels have correlated strongly with the rise in sugar consumption for the past hundred and fifty years.The video that Taubes links to, by the UCSF scientist Robert Listig, is also well worth watching, even if you don’t read the book. It presents the example that a teenage boy’s caloric intake, on average, has gone up in five years (from 1990 to 1995) a total of 275 calories per day. Where is that from? Not fat, so much — that represents only 45 calories out of the total. “In fact, it’s all in the carbohydrates.” That would be an increase of 228 calories per day. Where is that coming from?Mostly soda. One can of Coca Cola or other soft drink is about 150 calories. It probably isn’t a coincidence that the other standardized container is the 20-ounce plastic bottle. Unless someone is addicted to the 44-ounce “Big Gulp” style. Or, especially disheartening: a “Texas-sized Big Gulp” is reported to consist of a 60-ounce Coca Cola, a Snickers bar and a bag of Doritos, all for 99¢.



Profoundly important, and profoundly depressing, since this trend doesn’t look likely to be reversed any time soon.I hope the book goes into more detail on metabolic and biochemistry. I fondly remember the Krebs Cycle from my high school physiology class, and I really like knowing the science behind all this stuff.For those of you just looking for the highlights, read the New York Times article, and then watch the video. If you can't be bothered to watch Robert Lustig's 90-minute long video, you could download a 52-minute interview with Lustig from KQED's Forum program:

Update
: yet another way of getting the highlights in an easy-to-comprehend dish is to check out Lifehacker’s What Sugar Actually Does to Your Brain and Body. For your health’s sake, study at least one of these, and get that non-fruit fructose out of your diet.­"
6,0307272702,http://goodreads.com/user/show/22371819-mariah-roze,3,"Gary Taubes shares his knowledge of not what only makes us fat, but what also keeps some people leaner than others. He emphasized how weight isn't only an overeating problem. It can also be caused by genetics, hormones and much more. We need to be careful of the assumptions that we make, because many people that are obese (especially) are because of one of these health issues.This book was an eye-opener to me and broke down all the assumptions that I have made about food and bodies."
7,0307272702,http://goodreads.com/user/show/90786-lee-klein,4,"Yeah I know New Directions didn't put this one out, it's not the fancy German dead white male lit I tend to like, but it does an admirable job of weaving more than a century of medical literature -- some of it German -- into a convincing argument that's at times stunning (I said ""wow"" aloud once or twice) and even heart-breaking on a grand scale -- for example, all those low-fat foods you see in the supermarket have extra carbs to replace reduced fats, so people buy low-fat stuff thinking it has less fat so it won't make them as fat as the full-fat stuff (makes perfect sense!), but according to the thesis of this book, the opposite is true: carbs make you fat, not the fat you consume. You'd think that shoving lard down your gullet wouldn't be better for you (your weight and your heart and triglyceride levels and blood pressure) than an equivalent amount of bread, even whole grain stuff, but it's counterintuitively true -- this book includes a few really interesting, counterintuitive, scientificially proven again and again assertions (eg, we don't get fat because our metabolism slows; our metabolism slows because we're getting fat). All of this is heartbreaking when talking about how the obesity epidemic snowballs as overweight/obese mothers prenatally increase their unborn children's insulin resistance, which leads to fatter children who more easily become obese when eating typical western carb/glucose diet, who then grow up to have metabolically worse off children, on and on (human bodies are literally snowballing thanks to carb-freaked metabolisms). The structure read sort of like a wonky thriller: initial hook followed by lots of history up front followed by pop science reviews of 100+ years of studies followed by easily vanquished anti-low carb arguments (ie, the impact of potentially higher LDL ""bad"" cholesterol levels) followed by a representative high-protein/high-fat/low-carb diet, which apparently is nothing new -- it's been popular pretty much forever, especially among native Americans and eskimos, as well as among 19th century physicians up till the 1960s -- only recently have we associated this sort of traditional human diet with some dude named Atkins. Sucks to have grown up during the food pyramid era, with its fattening base of grain. Recommended to me by my mama whose own mother was done in by carbs/sugars and a genetic predisposition for insulin resistance she passed down to her daughter and now to me. Easy to eat this way now that it's summer but the test will come when it's time for stouts and pizza in the fall and winter. Oh if only porters were brewed from porterhouse steak instead of grains . . . and if meat didnt come from cute cuddly animals or require massive suboptimum land used to fatten these animals with grain, land covered in ever-increasing tonnage of environmentally awful excrement et cetera etc "
8,0307272702,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1193707-suzanne,2,"Although I am inclined to agree with Taube that low-calorie diets and exercise do not lead to weightloss, based on personal experience as well as some new research, I find his argument for a primarily meat-based diet unconvincing. The primary weakness of the work is the lack of any scientific evidence to support his conclusions, but it also suffers from severe bias. He carefully presents only that data which will support his claims, and ignores reams of contradictory data.He claims that pre-historic humans lived primarily on meat, but gives no support for that claim, and ignores any evidence that would suggest otherwise. Anthropological work with hunter-gatherer societies today shows that about 80% of the diet is plant food gathered by the women, including seeds, grains, roots, and fruits. The meat that is provided by the men is wild game, which is low in fat and an uncertain source of food.The only way that he can make his case is to skip thousands of years of human civilization and known history. Certainly historic humans, if we can go by the business records of the Sumarians as well as the Bible, lived on beans, grains, fruits and vegetables. Logically, if humans were not eating cereal grains, why did they settled down to farming in the first place? And if starchy vegetables, fruits and grains are to blame for obesity, why didn't the epidemic begin around 2,000 B.C.E. with the development of agriculture? Why weren't the Irish the fattest people on the planet once they began living primarily on potatoes? He holds up the example of the Pima Indians, yet ignores the known fact that their native diet consists primarily of beans, corn, squash. And if fruit leads one to be fat, why aren't Europeans massive? They eat fruit as dessert at least twice a day. They also eat bread with every meal.He admits that he can't explain why Asians, whose natural diet is high in rice and vegetables, with only a little lean protein, are not fat until they begin eating a Western diet. He unconvincingly suggests that it's because they don't eat much fruit -- a claim he does not document.The only conclusion that can reasonably be drawn from the data he presents is that it is the introduction of refined grains and refined sugars as basis for our diets coupled with massive overeating that has led to the obesity epidemic."

Tough love... but a smart son.Some interesting ideas but I believe this journalist chose to ignore many important studies arguing against such a drastic dietary change. I get it...cut some of the crappy carbs...we all agree. But adding the copious amounts of high fat meats and cheeses makes no sense to this coronary student. For an alternate look that is backed up by literally hundreds of studies, read ""Prevent a 2nd Heart Attack"" by Janet Bond Brill. I find it much more helpful!"
10,0307272702,http://goodreads.com/user/show/208489-margie,2,"An argument in favor of low-carb diets. I'm giving it two stars because I wanted to punch the author. A hint to all aspiring authors out there: if you find yourself writing, ""As I said previously,"" 10 or more times in the first six chapters, you might be repeating yourself too much.Taubes cites many studies, though notably almost none of them are recent. He explains why, but really makes it sound as though all current researchers into obesity and nutrition are a) idiots and b) highly invested in maintaining the calories in/calories out format of most current diets. I kept asking myself, ""Why would researchers be so invested in that paradigm? Why wouldn't they want to make breakthrough discoveries? Why wouldn't they want to solve the issue of obesity and make a name for themselves?""Although there may be some sound reasons to adopt a low-carb diet, Taubes comes across as so condescending that he lost my support."

Read this with an open mind, think about his ideas, and try it if you don't believe. Understand a few things: ancient humans followed animals. North America wasn't populated by migrating pineapple hunters! Refined grains, refined sugars, and even refined vegetable oils are pin-points on the timeline of life. We have no business eating them in quantity. Understand also the evidence that saturated fats and cholesterol are bad for us. You won't find the science because it doesn't exist. There's only a mish-mash of epidemiological evidence which no person should be drawing conclusions from. Example: house fires are 100& associated with firefighters. Let's get rid of them all! Pfft. That's not science. The fact that cholesterol exists in plaque and saturated fats raise cholesterol prove absolutely nothing. We've followed this advice for 40 years and we've only gotten sicker!But we make bad decisions you say. Really? How do you explain obesity in six month olds. How do you explain a type 2 diabetes epidemic in the American military? These groups are fed by the food guides.

12,0307272702,http://goodreads.com/user/show/279256-diane,3,"This is a somewhat dense book, filled with numerous case studies and scientific research about why sugar and carbs make us fat. To summarize, it is all about insulin production, and whether the body is burning fat as fuel, or if the body is just storing fat. The book also discusses the decades-old line that to lose weight, you simply have to eat less and exercise more. Taubes disagrees, saying the formula is over-simplified and what is more important are the types of calories you eat. There are health benefits to cutting back on carbs and sugar, and extensive research is included.Despite needing to skim some chapters because they were so dense, the overall argument was persuasive and this book was inspiring enough that I am giving this eating plan a try. The author includes an appendix with guidelines for a low-carb diet, based on a Duke University medical clinic. To summarize, you can eat eggs, meat and fish, green vegetables, and some fruits. You can also eat cheese, butter and cook with oils. No bread or flour products, no potatoes or pasta, and nothing sugary, such as honey, jam, cookies, etc. If you remember the Atkins diet, it's similar to that.I was directed to this book by Gretchen Rubin, who mentioned it in her lovely and inspiring memoir, Better Than Before, which is all about forming and practicing good habits. One of the ideas both Rubin and Taubes discuss is whether it is easier for someone to moderate eating a certain kind of food, or whether it is easier to abstain altogether. For Rubin (and myself, I must admit) it is easier to completely abstain from a food. Some people can successfully moderate, such as having only one cookie a week, for example. I could never do that. I could never have just one cookie, just one potato chip, just one scoop of ice cream. For me, it is easier to make one decision to abstain from a food, and then get on with my life. I find it liberating.I would recommend this book to anyone interested in the science behind a low-carb diet. "

I certainly feel that the only thing I have to lose from following the guidance in this book is 20 unwanted pounds and a point or two off my blood cholesterol reading. "

I think everyone should read it, whether you need to lose weight or not, because everyone needs to understand how the body works, and everyone needs to understand how many lies we've been told the last 60+ years.It answered every question I've ever had about weight loss, including:- Why do I eat healthier and exercise more than some of my friends, but I am much more obese than them?- Why can my friend and I go to weight watchers together and she loses weight but I don't?- Why do I crave carbs and sugar like a drug addict?- What is insulin resistance and metabolic syndrome exactly?- Is fat bad for you?- Is my weight my fault?- Am I really just slothful and gluttonous? - Why does ""calories in/calories out"" not work as well as ""they"" keep promising me it will?- Why are some people so doggone skinny?I was either prophetic or intuitive when several years ago, I said to my husband, as we were watching The Biggest Loser, ""I hope that one day people will change the way they look at obesity, so that they don't judge and blame people so horribly. I hope that one day they will view someone obese not as someone who has a character flaw, but as someone with a medical problem, just like any other disease, because surely there is more to it, like hormone problems, and things like that.""Half way through this book (or perhaps sooner,) I was yelling at the book, ""I knew it!"" I feel so vindicated after years of knowing I was doing my VERY VERY VERY best to lose weight, and yet failing. There was actually a reason why I was failing, and that reason was called insulin.The author's premise is that much of the best science and research on weight loss was lost after World War II. The medical and weight loss community grasped onto some theories that were fraught with error and flaws, but kept touting them as God's truth, even though they knew their research didn't support the advice 100%. He says they refuse to look at endocrinology, and fat regulation and how the body accumulates fat tissue. If one does that, one can clearly see that one of the biggest contributors to fat accumulation is high blood sugar caused by too much of the hormone, insulin. Naturally, the solution turns out to be to stay away from carbs and sugar. The more you do, the more weight you will lose, HEALTHILY!And he doesn't just hope you take his word for it. Every page cites scientific studies upon studies upon studies.The author's tone is clear, logical, easy to read, and at times, humorous and ironic. I enjoyed this book so much I didn't want it to end. I plan on reading his book, Good Calories, Bad Calories, which treats the subject in more depth.After reading this book, not only am I getting rid of the big flour & sugar canisters on my counter, but I feel I can get rid of my scores of other diet & weight loss books, too. I'm sure this will be the last ""diet"" I will be on because it will be successful this time. But I can't stress enough how enlightening this book has been. I feel motivated to give up the carbs because I now understand thoroughly the science and reasoning behind why they are bad for us and why they make us fat. If I could stand on the street and give out copies, I would. That's how much I liked the book!"

In short, Taubes supports the Atkins diet, and we know how Atkins ended up. You eat his way, you will lose weight, just as you would on heroin or chemotherapy.

16,0307272702,http://goodreads.com/user/show/17620211-tras,5,"I've been keto since February 2016 and have lost a little over 100 lbs; I actually lost over 90 lbs within the first 12 months (should you be wondering). At my heaviest, I weighed 262 lbs and wore jeans with a 44 inch elasticated waistband (not the greatest fashion statement). I didn't exercise, ate an extremely high carb diet, had Type 2 Diabetes, and felt like complete and utter shit. At the time of writing this, I weigh 161 lbs. I have a 32 inch waist, I exercise most days and think nothing of cycling 30 km, or walking the 10 km to downtown Ottawa. I don't eat processed food but I do eat meat, dairy, saturated fat, leafy greens, and certain vegetables. I limit my net carbs to under 30g a day, weigh most of my food (because I know exactly how much I need), and I reversed my T2 diabetes a long time ago.I'm basically living testimony for the advice and observations contained within this excellent book. If you want to lose weight, limit the carbs and it will literally drop off. No need to starve yourself with ""low fat"" bullshit, and you won't feel hungry. As Gary writes:The message of Adiposity 101 is simple enough: if you’re predisposed to get fat and want to be as lean as you can be without compromising your health, you have to restrict carbohydrates and so keep your blood sugar and insulin levels low. The point to keep in mind is that you don’t lose fat because you cut calories; you lose fat because you cut out the foods that make you fat—the carbohydrates. If you get down to a weight you like and then add these foods back to the diet, you’ll get fat again. That only some people get fat from eating carbohydrates (just as only some get lung cancer from smoking cigarettes) doesn’t change the fact that if you’re one of those who do, you’ll only lose fat and keep it off if you avoid these foods.We now return to your regular programming :)"

If that quote peaks your curiosity, then you’ve got to read this book to understand the science behind such a controversial statement. Author Gary Taubes takes you through a thorough explanation of metabolic function with regard to fat regulation (including fat storage and fat mobilization), citing numerous published studies and clinical trials. But don’t be intimidated; you don’t have to be an expert in metabolic jargon to understand the information presented in this book. Taubes does an excellent job of minimizing the jargon and maximizing your understanding. He explores the origins of our current dietary recommendations (eating 6-11 servings of grains a day, minimizing dietary fat, etc.), and discusses how these very recommendations are contributing to the epidemic of obesity, diabetes, heart disease, and Alzheimer’s disease. He develops a compelling case for why we get fat, and specifically outlines what to do about it. If you’ve been looking for a long-term solution for reducing body fat and maintaining a healthy weight through nutrition, this book will equip you to make wise and informed decisions about your nutritional choices. It’s a must-read, not just for weight-management concerns, but for health and longevity, as well."

At the very least, it would help med students before they deal with patients who are overweight and suffering obesity-related health issues, who are also low-income (no matter where in the world they live,) to understand why people may be fat. It's not that the obese are eating chocolate bars by the gross and then sitting back defending our ""lifestyle choices"" when we're told to lose weight, eat less and get up and exercise. Medical professionals need to stop treating the obese, especially when the overweight are poor and come from food-insecure households, like we're just soft-addicted ""druggies"" who flat-out refuse to change our diets. Most of us don't have that option. This goes right to the heart of the issue in American society and the disparity between the rich and the poor. The rich (and by extension, post-grad medical students, doctors, nurses and their ilk) are thin and healthy because they can afford NOT to eat. The poor don't have that choice. American doctors don't have to skip meals because they can't afford them, and they've never had to decide which of their children doesn't get to eat supper that evening. When government subsidies go to cheap processed carb-based foods and resources, it translates at the grocery aisle. You can catch a good sale at Grocery Outlet for three candy bars for a dollar. Meanwhile, that same buck might get you 3/4 of an apple, if you're lucky.No, I stand corrected. This book should be read by EVERYONE, regardless."

In fact, I know people who’ve used that technique successfully. But this book explains the science behind why counting calories is pointless, and reducing carbohydrates is the only way to lose weight. (If you’re smart about counting calories, you probably reduce sugar first, which is why it seems to work to reduce calories.) If you’re willing to take my word for it, go buy Dr. Atkins or your favorite high-fat, low-carb diet book; otherwise read this book first.“Why We Get Fat: And What To Do About It” is the book I was kind-of hoping the author’s “Good Calories, Bad Calories” would be, but I’m actually glad they’re separate books. If you’ve already read GCBC, then you only need to read the last chapter and FAQ section of WWGF; otherwise it’s all the same information, but shorter, with more analogies and fewer researchers’ names, and presented with conclusion first and arguments after. However, I’m what they call a “high convincer,” so I appreciated the detail of GCBC (on both the science and history) that explains how we came to believe things that aren’t, as much as science can say it, true. Most people don’t need that level of detail and will be fine reading this one. Taubes does fall prey a little to the idea that we should get this message out even though more research is going on — the very same notion for which he criticizes the low-fat folks, who did a lot of harm by deciding on an answer before they did the research — but I’ll forgive him because he acknowledges it, and because the science of the body is uncontroversial and the science about diet is both consistent so far and resolves a lot of the seeming paradoxes in the previous research.On the one hand, I’m glad that I now understand why the Atkins diet works. On the other hand, without bread and chocolate, life isn’t worth living, so I know I won’t be able to go completely carb-free (although most people don’t have to do that except to start out the diet). Back to the first hand, I really would like to avoid cancer, hypertension, Type 2 diabetes, heart disease, stroke, and the host of other “diseases of civilization” that are beyond reasonable doubt associated with the increased intake of white flour, white sugar and white rice that comprises so much of the modern Western diet. Chocolate cake now or Alzheimer’s later? It’s a conundrum, honestly — a test of the conscious mind and delayed gratification over the sugar craving. For me, so far sugar is winning, but at least I feel guilty about the right things now.I hope people read this book, so that we can stop arguing about things that are pretty well proven false now (e.g., high-carb diets are good for you) and start figuring out how we can turn around the epidemic of diseases that’s plaguing our nation. In fact, this book sticks to its title thesis admirably well. I wish it had emphasized the association of refined carbohydrates with “Western” diseases even more, so that lean folks would know the message is for them, too. "

The Danes actually did train sedentary subjects to run marathons (26.2 miles). After eighteen months of training, and after actually running a marathon, the eighteen men in the study had lost an average of five pounds of body fat. As for the nine women subjects, the Danes reported, “no change in body composition was observed.”“there is no stranger phenomena than the maintenance of a constant body weight under marked variation in bodily activity and food consumption.”The fact that many people do remain lean for decades (although it’s less common now than in Du Bois’s day), and that even those who are fat don’t continuously get fatter, suggests there is something more going on with this business of weight regulation than can be explained by the notion that it’s all about calories.Steatopygia, the prominent fat deposits of the buttocks on this African woman, is a genetic trait, not the product of overeating or sedentary behavior.Why do the lean twins have identical bodies? And why do the obese twins? Why is their accumulation of fat so nearly identical? Are we to assume that they just overate, more or less, by exactly the same number of calories over the course of their lives because their genes determined precisely the size of the portions they ate at every meal and precisely how sedentary they chose to be—how many hours they sat on the couch rather than getting up and gardening or walking?Breeders of livestock have always been implicitly aware of the genetic, constitutional component of fatness. Those engaged in the art and science of animal husbandry have spent many decades breeding cattle, pigs, and sheep to be more fatty or less fatty, just as they breed dairy cattle to increase milk production or dogs for hunting or herding ability.Hence, a likely explanation is that the genes that determine the relative adiposity of these two breeds have little or nothing to do with their appetite or physical activity but, rather, with how they partition energy—whether they turn it into protein and fat in the muscles or into milk.Girls enter puberty with very slightly more body fat than boys (6 percent more, on average), but by the time puberty is over, they have 50 percent more.In other words, when a girl enters puberty as slender as a boy and leaves it with the shapely figure of a woman, it’s not because of overeating or inactivity, even though it’s mostly the fat she’s acquired that gives her that womanly shape and she had to eat more calories than she expended to accommodate that fat.It’s characterized by the complete loss of subcutaneous fat (the fat immediately beneath the skin) in the upper body, and an excess of fat below the waist.There’s a modern example of a lipodystrophy that’s not nearly so uncommon—HIV-related lipodystrophy, apparently caused by the anti-retroviral drugs that people infected with HIV take to subdue the virus and keep full-blown AIDS at bay.So what we want to know is why this room is crowded and so overstuffed with energy—that is, people. If you asked me this question, and I said, Well, because more people entered the room than left it, you’d probably think I was being a wise guy or an idiot. Of course more people entered than left, you’d say. That’s obvious. But why?To ‘explain’ obesity by overeating is as illuminating a statement as an ‘explanation’ of alcoholism by chronic overdrinking.”People who semi-starve themselves, or who are semi-starved during wars, famines, or scientific experiments, are not only hungry all the time (not to mention cranky and depressed) but lethargic, and they expend less energy. Their body temperatures drop; they tend to be cold all the time.The way Wade explained it to me, the animal doesn’t get fat because it overeats, it overeats because it’s getting fat. The cause and effect are reversed. Both gluttony and sloth are effects of the drive to get fatter.We are, after all, just another species of animal. Animals in the wild may be naturally fatNo matter how abundant their food supply, wild animals will maintain a stable weight—not too fat, not too thin—which tells us that their bodies are assuring that the amount of fat in their fat tissue always works to their advantage and never becomes a hindrance to survival. When animals do put on significant fat, that fat is always there for a very good reason.My son’s growth, like every child’s, is caused fundamentally by the action of growth hormones. As he gets older, he’ll occasionally go through growth spurts that will be accompanied by a voracious appetite and probably a fair share of sloth, but the appetite and the sloth will be driven by the growth, not vice versa.he could get their weight below that of lean mice if he starved them sufficiently, but they’d “still contain more fat than the normal ones, while their muscles have melted away.” Once again, eating too much wasn’t the problem; these mice, as Mayer wrote, “will make fat out of their food under the most unlikely circumstances, even when half starved.”If a baby rat that is genetically programmed to become obese is put on a diet from the moment it’s weaned, so it can eat no more than a lean rat would eat, if that, and can never eat as much as it would like, it responds by compromising its organs and muscles to satisfy its genetic drive to grow fat.Similarly, a greyhound will be more physically active than a basset hound, not because of any conscious desire to exercise, but because its body partitions fuel to its lean tissue, not to its fat.the hump provides a reservoir of fat for survival in the desert, without the camel’s having to keep that fat in subcutaneous deposits, as we do, where the insulation would present problems in the desert heat.she faithfully injected herself with her daily insulin in the same two sites on her thighs. The result: cantaloupe-sized masses of fat on each thigh.This is why diabetics often get fatter when they take insulin therapy. (It results from “the direct lipogenic effect of insulin on adipose tissue, independent of food intake,” as explained by the seminal textbook in the field, Joslin’s Diabetes Mellitus.)Because the insulin level in the bloodstream is determined primarily by the carbohydrates that are consumed—their quantity and quality, as I’ll discuss—it’s those carbohydrates that ultimately determine how much fat we accumulate.You think about eating a meal containing carbohydrates. You begin secreting insulin.So cortisol can make us fatter still when insulin is elevated, but it can also make us leaner, just like every other hormone, when insulin levels are low. And this may explain why some people get fatter when they get stressed, anxious, or depressed and eat more, and some people do the opposite.the higher the blood sugar in the pregnant mother, the more insulin-secreting cells her child will develop, and the more insulin the child will secrete as it gets close to birth. The baby will now be born with more fat, and it will have a tendency to oversecrete insulin and become insulin-resistant itself as it gets older. It will be predisposed to get fat as it ages. In animal studies, this predisposition often manifests itself only when the animal reaches its version of middle age.But if we’re predisposed to put on fat, it’s a good bet that most fruit will make the problem worse, not better.Dancel also noted, as Brillat-Savarin had and others would, that carnivorous animals are never fat, whereas herbivores, living exclusively on plants, oftenit’s worth remembering that we’ve been cultivating fruit trees for only the past few thousand years, and that the kinds of fruit we eat today—Fuji apples, Bartlett pears, navel oranges—have been bred to be far juicier and sweeter than the wild varieties and so, in effect, to be far more fattening.Researchers have continued to demonstrate that cholesterol-lowering drugs can prevent heart attacks and apparently allow some people to live longer (at least those who are at particularly high risk of a heart attack). But it has still not been demonstrated that either low-fat or low-saturated-fat diets will do the same.After six years on the diet, these women had cut both their total fat consumption and their saturated-fat consumption by a quarter, lowering their total cholesterol and their LDL cholesterol below (albeit only very slightly below) that of the other twenty-nine thousand women, who were eating whatever they wanted and yet their low-fat diet, as the final reports stated, had no beneficial effect on heart disease, stroke, breast cancer, colon cancer, or, for that matter, fat accumulation. Eating les...For women, HDL levels are so good at predicting future heart disease that they are, effectively, the only predictors of risk that matter.Gardner presented the results of the trial in a lecture that’s now viewable on YouTube—“The Battle of Weight Loss Diets: Is Anyone Winning (at Losing)?” He begins the lecture by acknowledging that he’s been a vegetarian for twenty-five years. He did the study, he explains, because he was concerned that a diet like the Atkins diet, rich in meat and saturated fat, could be dangerous. When he described the triumph of the very low-carbohydrate, meat-rich Atkins diet, he called it “a bitter pill to s...avoid other foods that might stimulate significant insulin secretion—diet sodas, dairy products (cream, for instance), coffee, and nuts,(Anecdotal evidence suggests that occasional or intermittent fasting for eighteen or twenty-four hours might work to break through these plateaus of weight loss, but this, too, has not been adequately tested.)Donaldson said in his 1962 memoirs, no matter how well someone does on the mostly meat diet that Donaldson prescribed, “any disaster that may overtake him, even to the extent of ground moles getting in his lawn, will be blamed on his diet.”For most effective weight loss, you will need to keep the total number of carbohydrate grams to fewer than 20 grams per day. Your diet is to be made up exclusively of foods and beverages from this handout."
24,0307272702,http://goodreads.com/user/show/837085-lorin-kleinman,5,"It’s no secret that America has an obesity problem. And we know what we need to do about it: eat less and exercise more. Consume less fat. Rely less on animal products. If we can all just control ourselves and eat a low-fat, plant-based diet and get some exercise, everyone will be fine. Right?That’s certainly the prevalent doctrine, dispensed by more or less everyone except for the authors of a trickle of low-carb diet books. (Confession: until recently, I considered Atkins and co to be utterly misguided.) But does it take into account how our bodies actually work?Not according to Gary Taubes. In “Why We Get Fat,” he argues that it is carbohydrates, not fat, that cause obesity. An earlier book “Good Calories, Bad Calories” made this point in a much more verbose and technical way; this is his attempt at a more layperson-friendly (though certainly not unscientific) account.Taubes regards the calories in/calories out model of weight loss as distinctly unhelpful. Sure: to gain weight, I have to eat more than I discard, but what causes this? Is every overweight person really just gluttonous and lazy?He illuminates matters by describing a group of female rats whose ovaries had been removed. They began eating incessantly and quickly became quite obese. In some cases, though, they were held to their usual diets. These rats also became obese, but in addition, were lethargic, moving only to gather food. Greed and sloth: end of story?No. Without ovaries, they had no estrogen. Estrogen helps regulate how fat is stored, and prevents it from landing solely in fat, as opposed to, say, muscle cells. In the absence of estrogen, most of the fat that these animals consumed was being stored in their fat cells. This meant that their bodies had no fuel to run on. So they kept eating. Forcibly prevented from eating, they lacked the energy to move. They weren’t getting fat because they were overeating: they were overeating because they were getting fat.Humans are in the same position: incoming fat can be shunted into storage or treated as fuel.* (And estrogen works the same way, which is probably why women who have had hysterectomies often struggle with their weight .) Taubes gives a somewhat technical but quite enlightening description of how we process food, with insulin in the starring role. We consume carbs, they’re turned into glucose, our bodies release a wave of insulin to cope with it. Insulin has a variety of effects, none very helpful to anyone who wants to lose weight. In particular, while insulin is elevated, it is impossible to burn anything other than glucose. It doesn’t matter how much fat is sitting around: we can’t burn it. In anyone with chronically elevated insulin, this is obviously a problem. Adding insult to injury, as we get older, we tend to become less sensitive to insulin, and some people become resistant. Obviously, this does not affect everyone equally (genetics plays a big role): we all know people who can eat piles of chocolate without gaining weight. “It may be easier to believe that we remain lean because we’re virtuous and we get fat because we’re not, but the evidence simply says otherwise. Virtue has little more to do with our weight than with our height,” Taubes says. Refined carbohydrates may not cause trouble everywhere, but where there are weight problems, Taubes says, carbs (and our hormonal response to them) are always to blame.It is impossible to decrease carbohydrate consumption without increasing fat intake. Taubes is fully aware of the environmental and ethical disadvantages of a heavily meat-based diet, though he does not offer a solution. He does, however, address the widespread claim that the key to both weight loss and good health is a low-fat diet. Rather shockingly, he makes a convincing case that its purported beneficial effects are not supported by science. (There is a revealing discussion of how the government came to claim that they were.) On the contrary, studies seem to show that people on low-carb, high fat diets have improved triglycerides and HDLs. As he points out, for a very long time our species lived chiefly on the fattiest meat it could find: the idea that we require carrots and orange juice isn’t entirely obvious. He dispenses with exercise similarly handily–while unquestionably very important, exercise does not seem to contribute much to weight loss.David Kessler recently made clear that given that our brains treat combinations of sugar, salt, and fat more or less like heroin, judgmental harumphing isn’t a reasonable response to the obesity crisis. Given the large, intense–and utterly useless–guilt-fest that this country’s discussion of weight still is, this book couldn’t come at a better time. *This is a simplified description: please do not treat this essay as an endocrinology manual."

There are some mind-benders in here, but once you see the reasoning, and the data, it becomes a mind-bender to try to think the other way. His adversary throughout is the simplistic ""calories in/calories out"" view of weight gain. Weight gain is actually function of how your body's hormones (particularly insulin) partition what you eat, not how much you eat. Here is an example of one mind bender, just as a teaser. We don't get fat because we overeat; we overeat because we are getting fat. I picked this book up on recommend from Instapundit, and it was well worth it. Highly recommended."

If you spend any amount of time talking to fitness enthusiasts, body builders, nutritionists, trainers, etc... they will all agree on this and it will be the first requirement upon starting a fitness regimen to lose weight. It's worked for me too and is working again as I'm focusing on tightening up my waist. I suppose the controversy is around how extreme it should be to remain healthy. No fruits? Really? No excessive vegetables? Are you sure? Can you maintain this kind of eating for life if you've struggled with weight problems? How healthy is it? For me those are the questions that I'm still researching and haven't answered to my own satisfaction - but I don't doubt lo-carb in and of itself simply to lose weight. I've seen it in anyone who has honestly tried it. One of the biggest new insights I gained was on the way that different bodies process fat differently. We all suspect the genetic factor don't we? But what is the science around that - why is that the case? Showing that different bodies process fat differently is not only key to understanding what one needs to do to lose weight but it should also produce just a bit more empathy towards people who have an extremely difficult time losing anything. "
27,0307272702,http://goodreads.com/user/show/73783-taka,5,"A must-read--Taubes presents a compelling case against eating carbohydrates and any food that has significant effects on the level of your insulin, which, he argues, causes all sorts of problems like obesity, cancer, heart disease, hypertension, Alzheimer's, and other exclusively Western diseases.The argument rests on the mechanism of fat storage. Insulin is the hormone responsible for storing fat. When there's a lot of insulin, the body tends to store whatever is digested into fat, and when there isn't much insulin around, the body tends to burn fat for fuel. In other words, whatever that triggers massive insulin secretion will make us fat, and what does this? Carbohydrates, such as sugar, flour, rice, and potatoes.When a lot of insulin is secreted, moreover, all sorts of things go wrong: HDL (the good cholesterol) goes down, dense LDL goes up, and triglyceride in the blood goes up, all risk factors associated with heart disease.Another surprising conclusion is that people who are fat are NOT fat because they eat too much, but they eat too much BECAUSE they are fat. The reversal of this firmly held belief is simply mind-blowing. Fat people aren't lazy or morally deficient, but they're lazy BECAUSE they're fat.All this is just the tip of an iceberg. For the detailed argument full of examples and historical and scientific reasons, DO read the book. It's easy to understand and you'll be infinitely grateful you've read it."

He provides the historical context for how and why the American medical community got so confused about how we get fat. It explains in painful detail how, results to the contrary, doctors and government officials, each reinforcing their wrongheaded advice have become entrenched in what can only be called diet myth. This book does provide ample evidence for why American's are suffering (and dying) from a growing epidemic of diabetes, cancer and Alzheimers all because we can't seem to understand our metabolic system and how it works. This book is even more valuable to me because I have lost and maintained my weight over the past year by following a low-carb diet despite my wife's lack of support. After reading Taubes' book, she has completely changed her views and she is now successfully using the diet as well! Follow the diet in this book and watch the pounds disappear, effortlessly and relatively quickly. My doctor now supports this diet (the results speak for themselves) and, if leadership ever returns to our government, the CDC and DHHS should revise the food pyramid just in time for our nation's 500th birthday!!!!"
29,0307272702,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1296331-karen,5,"This was much better than Taubes' first book (Good Calories, Bad Calories). Both had good information but this one was written in a much more reader-friendly fashion. If you've ever wondered why following the conventional wisdom of low-fat, low calorie eating, based on whole grains, fruits and vegetables, doesn't give you significant, long-lasting weight loss, this book will set you straight. Taubes is a science writer and has pulled together all of the nutritional studies done over the last hundred years or so that completely refute the typical current diet wisdom. Remember how the low-fat trend was supposed to reverse the weight gain that had begun in the 60's and 70's? And yet, more people than ever are more obese than ever! This book will show you why, and what to do about it. It's definitely not about fad diets.Update 10-15-2012 - I'm currently re-reading this book by listening to the audio version and it's even more compelling the second time around."

(There are lots of studies that show that exercise increases one's caloric needs.) Taubes is an award-winning science writer from Harvard and he makes a compelling case for cutting out (or cutting back on) carbohydrates and sugar as the only realistic way to lose weight. I just finished the book and I'm going to try to cut back on carbs for a while and see what happens. My achilles heel, as always, will be beer. I will let you know how highly I recommend this book after I've given it a couple of months. It's definitely a solid read.-jd"

It’s full of facts, references to scientific articles, and good explanations. One of the most useful things I found in this book was a detailed and understandable explanation of why the calories in/calories out theory of weight management just doesn’t fly. A good look at the many and varied roles of hormones in metabolism, weight gain, weight loss, fat production and general health was enlightening. As a person who grew up in the era of the demonization of dietary fat, I found this book very helpful in changing my perspective on dietary macronutrients!"
33,0307272702,http://goodreads.com/user/show/755462-nathan,4,"This is one great book, and I'd recommend pretty much everyone read it. Especially if you struggle with your weight, or heart disease or diabetes run in your family, as they do in mine. My mom recommended this book to me after she was diagnosed with Type 2 diabetes, despite the fact that she's very fit and active, not even slightly overweight, and has eaten 'right' all of her life. The basic theme of the book is everything you've been taught about the right way to eat and manage your weight is wrong. It's based on bad science with little to no evidence to back it up, while there continues to be more and more and more mounting evidence that the food pyramid is killing us all. Taubes is not a particularly gifted writer. There is little here in the way of clever writing. It's just straightforward explanation of facts. The amount of research he has done to uncover data and debunk popular concepts of healthy eating is enlightening and frightening. My one issue with the book is how down on the concept of exercise Taubes is. I think he's only trying to make the point that if you continue to heat high-carb diets, exercise a ton, and subscribe to the calories in/calories out ideas about weight loss (which he disproves both through an in-depth look at how your body actually metabolizes food, and through lots and lots and lots of clinical data) you're never going to lose weight, and you'll still be at risk for things like heart disease and diabetes. But he's practically dismissive of exercise, giving it only one general nod in the whole book that it ""may have other health benefits."" People looking for an excuse not to exercise could certainly use this book to come to the conclusion that it isn't necessary, and while maybe it's true that exercising is not going to keep you thin if you don't understand the devastating effects of carbs on your body, There most certainly are lots and lots and lots of other reasons to keep yourself fit and strong through regular exercise. Other than this one point, I think Taubes has laid out a solid, easy-to-understand, if sometimes dry blueprint for what's wrong with modern Western diets, and why the way we eat is killing us via obesity, diabetes, cancer, heart disease, and a plethora of other diseases. If you've done a bunch of traditional diets to try and manage your weight and failed, I think Taubes work could be particularly helpful. His contention is that it isn't your fault, to this point, that you can't control your weight. It's not that you lack will power or are too lazy, as many of us have been told. It's that you've been given the wrong information to succeed. You've been set up for failure, and then blamed when you do fail. Do yourself a favor, read this book, find a physician who understands these principals, and tell your nutritionist to suck it. "

Yes - the physiology of gycaemic spikes -> hyperinsulinaemia -> abberations in fat metabolism has been well documented, but methinks Gary Taubes may be as blinded as the ""dietary fat-haters"" by his passion that Western refined carbohydrates have caused dyslipidaemias and hence vascualar events. The answer is likely to be much more complicated than the glib one he proposes, having hand-picked the studies he presents to support his conclusion. I worry about the unsuspecting public reading this and following some nebulous advice to ""eat protein and fat"", without understanding the context, implementation and consequences of appropriate dietary modification.From a doctor's point of view - disappointing.

This contents of this book could easily be reduced to ""Because carbohydrates. Eat them less."" If I had to flesh that out, I'd add, ""Research has shown,"" and ""Anybody who thinks otherwise is a cottonheaded ninnymuggins beneath contempt."" I'm distrustful of any book that addresses food without some basic premises: It is a good gift from a good God. It is a multifaceted gift—given for pleasure, for celebration, and for communing as well as for fuel. Billions of years of evolution is a myth. What the Bible speaks well of, directly or by implication in metaphorical use, including bread and fruit and salt and honey and milk and meat, we must think well of. Anything that goes wrong with our bodies is ultimately the result of sin, and there are plenty of ways we can sin with food, so somehow, somewhere, somewhen, volition is quite possibly involved. Taubes misses the mark on all of these, and that mars too much of the book. The rest, the basic carbs cause fat gain argument and evidence, was persuasive and useful.But, yay!

For much of the first half of this book, Gary takes that notion and clubs it to death, leaving little skepticism in his arguments. In the later half, he further dissects we people get fat and how to deal with it, as the title makes extremely clear.This book didn't ruin bread for me (two others already did), but it's likely it will ruin it for you. If you quit eating bread for a month and then eat a bread roll (or pizza/toast/sandwich), you'll feel like you were shot with a horse tranquilizer. If you continue to not eat bread and other grains, the less you'll desire them, mainly due to how poor they make you feel.I'm not a health nut. I've read three books about diet in my life.

It challenges all of the accepted wisdom of the post-WW2 years and the recommendations provided by all official health and nutrition sources, and it goes into detail about how and why this wisdom is so simple, easy to follow, well meaning... and wrong.Having only 'read' the audiobook, I am about to purchase the print edition to allow easier checking of sources and future reference. But the fact I will have two editions and have given it five stars should provide some insight into its impact.To put it into perspective, I have lost 11kg/24lb over the last 10 weeks on The Dukan Diet, also based on lowering carbohydrate intake, and it's been as easy as making dinner. Seriously. Taubes's book explains in understandable detail why my experience has been so easy (and why I need to alter my current diet slightly) and why it is sustainable.Be skeptical of what I am saying (you don't know me), but do your homework if fat loss is important to you."
38,0307272702,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2735813-john,4,"Taubes frames his question in a most helpful manner: what does science tell us about how we get fat? He breaks his book into two sections, the first designed to call into question the popular health doctrine that to get thinner we need to balance the calories we put in to our bodies versus the calories we expend. Essentially, Taubes argues this is an overly simplistic and essentially unhelpful way of looking at the problem. Instead, he argues that we should pay attention to the kinds of calories that we put into our bodies. At the heart of it all, Taubes argues that we should limit carbohydrates--starches and sugars--and instead rely on a diet of animal products and green vegetables. He offers ample historical research that covers the last couple of hundred years to uphold his claims. And he makes a strong attempt to deal with the number one objection to his diet recommendation: that it will increase our risk of heart disease. The well documented historical research is largely persuasive, though I find myself curious about other diets around the world (like, for instance, an Asian diet heavy on rice and noodles) and how those diets impact those people groups as a whole.

39,0307272702,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2197912-julie,4,"Over the past few years I have started to question the whole as-long-as-you-spend-more-calories-than-you-take-in-you'll-lose-weight paradigm. I just wasn't seeing it translate in practice with my patients. This book does a great job of reviewing the research that shows where that misguided concept got started and why it is wrong, as well as the science behind how fat accumulation happens and why some people get fat and others don't. The book really resonated with what I've found in my own experience with my diet (despite eating a high-fat diet, I am thin). I've taken to recommending this book to my patients who have a history of beating themselves up for gaining weight even when they work out 2 hours a day and barely eat. It helps them see why that is unproductive for them and gives them a more effective way of eating to lose weight. The only reason I don't give it 5 stars is that I would have liked more detail about the science and what role the author feels cortisol levels play in all of it. Alas, it is a book written for the masses, and the level of detail was appropriate for that audience."
40,0307272702,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4519816-jennie-tichich,5,"Paradigm shifter for sure. I found myself so confused while reading this- cognitive dissonance, as the author Taubes calls it. Wow! Years of inconclusive medical studies on the true impact of high-fat diets yet we adopted the low-fat, high-carbohydrate as a dictum of healthy behavior!You have to believe that the science of metabolism is more complicated than: Calories/in = Calories/out. Taubes does an excellent job of demonstrating how fatting, or Adiposity 101, really works. Constantly high insulin secretion, coupled with a cell's increasing insulin resistance leads to the deleterious effects and vicious cycles of weight gain, fat storage, lipid disorders, diabetes (ie. Metabolic syndrome). Very compelling evidence against High-carb diets. AND, interestingly enough, equally compelling evidence for high-fat/protein diets. I went to the Meat House this weekend (while reading this book) and bought some steak. I looked around at the clientele. They were actually all thin! I then went to the gym yesterday morning and every woman in the locker room was over weight. HUH! Arguments are adding up!"

I realize that would be less marketable, but reading this was really a revelation. After being diagnosed with insulin resistance I really did try to change my diet. My doctors said I didn't have to actually cut back on carbs, but eat different carbs. Four years later I had diabetes. I'm not that old or that fat, so I realized that something bad was going on. Taubes explained it pretty well - my hormones are broken and carbs are killing me. When I started to restrict carbs the way Taubes explained, I noticed a big difference. I didn't lose a billion pounds in a week, but I did lose weight. Most important was that I felt like a completely different person. So, the printout of his recommendeded diet is on the fridge. Here's hoping my blood stops hurting."
42,0307272702,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5207645-milka,3,"Interesting read overall but I would think most people who read this book would want to read other viewpoints. The idea of removing many vegetables and all fruit from your diet because they make you fat seems a little extreme, especially if you replace them all with bacon. And while Taubes encourages to eat as much meat and fat as you want because those calories don't count, he also says to stop eating when you're full, which implies that too much meat and fat will make you fat if you overeat, just like almost any other food. I still like his main point, that refined sugar and refined carbohydrates overall well cause a lot of physiological problems. When you realize there is some type of sugar in almost every processed food, you eventually understand how much sugar you really eat every day."
43,0307272702,http://goodreads.com/user/show/71658-aj,1,"Skip this book and read Atkins, because this is just a big advert for no/low carb diets. This book feels strangely like something the Weston A Price foundation would pay for, considering the emphasis on how fats are good for you (even saturated fats, apparently) and eating all the meat you want. No explanation given for why vegans are so healthy and tend not to be overweight. The only good thing about this book is the message that losing weight isn't as simple as calories in/calories out. There are a whole host of reasons somebody can be overweight. I just wish the message went more towards healthy at every size and body acceptance, rather than eat lots of fatty dead animals and get thin. (In which case, why didn't Atkins work for so many people???)"

In short, this book blew my mind.With what I think was a sarcastic flair (which I loved), Gary Taubes took a complex understanding of the reasons why the obesity epidemic is full-blown, and explained it in a way that I think most anybody would understand. I want to hand this book to everyone, especially to those who've struggled with the low-fat diet that seems to be ""common sense"" at the moment."

Sounds like a heart attack diet to me. This entire book had me wondering how much money the author was getting paid from the meat industry. I dog eared the pages of the book with every intention of writing about each problem in his theory, but I don't have the time. Let me just say, not every carb is created equal, obviously it's healthier to have a potato than a pastry, but according to the book it isn't even okay to eat a potato or corn or certain beans. This book gets zero stars from me, because it could be potentially dangerous for someone to follow this misleading book. "

48,0307272702,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7381266-sandie,4,"I found this book highly readable and stimulating as Taubes turns everything I know about nutrition and the role of exercise in weight loss on its ear. In spite of my enjoyment of this book, I am not quite buying into his complete theory and am still in the process of analyzing his data and arguments. There are a lot of well written and sound reviews of this book from individuals in the science community and I am pacing myself through these. I don’t think there is any question that sugars and carbs are the prime causal factors of obesity. What I am unsure of is the role of behavior - overeating and lack of exercise- in creating the current epidemic. We have had very little success in combating obesity with behavioral modifications or diets so maybe it does not even matter where the blame falls, although I do realize that the solution has to be related to the cause. I do not support a meat based diet and am also not convinced that vegans have the answer but the bottom line is that we each find a lifestyle that leads to health and well being. Nutrition will continue to be one of the most controversial subjects discussed in health care as writers such as Taubes charm us with their theories and knowledge. 4 stars for peaking my interest in carb consumption and the insulin response!"
49,0307272702,http://goodreads.com/user/show/123323-rebecca,4,"I'm not entirely committed to 4 stars, but I didn't want to leave this unrated.First off, I am forever in debt to Gary Taubes for his previous (gigantic) book Good Calories, Bad Calories of which WWGF is the low-carb version (because it's thinner. get it?). I think he very effectively points out the absurdity and wrongness of the lipid hypothesis which should be entirely abandoned. It changed the entire way I think about food and nutrition and has ultimately led me to be a much more conscientious eater.But. I don't like the fact that he's now made up his mind entirely on this issue going so far as to stake his very reputation on his ideas. I think a few issues are conflated when really, they could stand to be teased apart and examined separately. First - I think in general it's more useful to look at the causes of ""diseases of civilization"" rather than just obesity which is honestly more of a cosmetic issue compared to diabetes, cancer, etc. Yes, obesity can be a marker for disease, but it's just one component. The ""obesity epidemic"" started up in the 1980s, but the diseases of civilization have been around basically since agriculture. I do think that perhaps there is some kind of (god help me, I can't think of a better term) ""perfect storm"" in regards to the obesity epidemic, but Taubes doesn't really focus on why the sudden ballooning up in the past 30 years.Second - all weight gain isn't the same. He touches on this some in talking about weight gain during adolescence vs. adulthood, but I didn't feel like he really distinguished the physiological differences between harmful weight gain (belly fat) and the more benign (girls putting on weight in puberty, steatopygia, etc.). I mean, it's all driven by insulin (so he says), but I think insulin ""just works here"", much like cholesterol does. I think there must be some other puzzle piece that's missing.Third - that all carbohydrates fatten in the same way. This is kind of tied up into the above. Admittedly, he does dance around this issue saying that it is ""refined"" carbs that might be the culprit, but most of the time he fails to distinguish. I personally think that starch in and of itself is fairly neutral health-wise (though not necessarily weight-wise). Sugar and grains, however, are not. It's pretty obvious that humans have been eating hugely varied diets from close to zero-carb (Inuits) to very starch heavy (Kitavans) and still avoiding diseases of civilization. So I can't entirely buy into ""it's the carbs, stupid!"". Since he is so wedded to his carbohydrate hypothesis, Taubes doesn't even touch on some of the other ideas floating around out there like excessive omega-6 consumption which I think is emerging as a real nutritional villain. (Among the more cutting edge nutrition scientists that is, the USDA has pretty well shown it cares more about lobbyist dollars than hard science, otherwise we would not be told that it is perfectly acceptable to eat 11 muffins a day as part of the grain-based diet.) He also doesn't seem to consider that maybe there is something that breaks our endocrine systems and this leads to reduced insulin sensitivity. There is also zero discussion about the psychological side of weight gain. His ideas pretty much entirely suppose that people only ever eat when they are hungry which is not true.Other take aways - Exercise needs a PR makeover. I think once you shift away from the idea that exercise is for weight loss and instead emphasize that exercise is just for good health then people might be more willing to give it a shot instead of jogging for a week, seeing no results, and giving up (*cough* me). Salt could use some help as well. The salt=high blood pressure hypothesis is not really accurate (and I believe Taubes has written about this previously), but I don't know enough to really expound on that. I've read that it's entirely crap, and I've also read that there maybe a fraction of the population that is ""salt sensitive"".Maybe some of the points were addressed in more detail in GCBC and now I've forgotten, but I left this book feeling mostly confused and a little disappointed that Taubes has pretty well declared that his mind is no longer open. There are two other fellows, Stephan Guyenet and Kurt Harris (neither of whom has a book out yet) whom I greatly admire mostly because they revise the way they think about this issue all of the time. Still the two of them seem to agree that it's fructose, gluten, and PUFAs that are the problem, not just ""carbs""."
50,0307272702,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1695415-brian-connell,4,"A great read that challenges conventional nutritional thinking, mainly around attitudes to carbs, fats and exercise, and especially challenges the thinking that to lose weight you simply need to make sure that calories in are less than calories out.To make his case, Taubes walks us through several topics, including the history of thinking about obesity and how it might be cured, observations of differences in cultural diets and incidence of obesity and disease, the relationship of genetics to obesity, and finally the science of cell metabolism and what causes fat to be stored in cells (and subsequently released for use as energy).In terms of cell metabolism science says that increased blood sugar levels lead to increased insulin secretion which in turn leads to fat absorption in cells. Carbs elevate blood sugars and thus carbs make us fat. Evidence is also provided that dietary fats (even the ""accepted as evil"" saturated fats) do not lead to cell fat accumulation, and that consuming fats can actually lead to desirable effects in blood cholesteral profiles by reducing total triglycerides, lowering bad LDL and increasing HDL (which as any sufferer of heart disease will tell you are all good things in terms of reducing risk of a heart attack). This all leads to a meat/fish is good for you conclusion. Vegetarians are likely to disagree with this book unless completely swayed by the scientific evidence presented. A favorite quote from the book deals with what is conventionally viewed as the most evil of fats and goes as follows: ""if you replace the carbohydrates in your diet with an equal quantity of lard, it will actually reduce your risk of a heart attack. It will make you healthier"". Yikes! Really? Now thats a challenge to conventional thinking ... End result is that to lose weight the recommendation is a lower carb higher fat diet. It says to eat lots of meat, fish, chicken (keep the skin on!), other fowl, eggs, and lots of leafy green vegetables. To reduce carbs the recommendation is to avoid grains, flours, breads, pasta, rice, dairy (including milk which is high in carbs), potatoes, sugars, starchy vegetables and even fruit (high in sugar). Throw in the observation that exercise is good for your health but is not a good mechanism for reducing weight, and you've basically thrown conventional weight loss thinking out the window. Of course this type of nutritional advise is not what government sponsored food guides and doctors have recommended since the 1960's - but Taubes points out there is ample evidence (pun intended) that conventional nutritional advice is not working. In fact there is scientific evidence to support the low carb high animal fat diet, one quoted example being the 2007 ATOZ study by Stanford University, which concluded that a low carb high fat diet (similar to the Atkin's diet) was most beneficial in terms of weight loss and blood cholesterol profiles. Taubes' points out that the director of the ATOZ study was a actually a 25 year vegeterian and called the study results a ""bitter pill to swallow"". The ATOZ study results presentation is at the following URL and was an interesting way to spend an hour - especially the first five minutes which gave a graphical presentation of how obesity in the US has been progressing since 1985:http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eREuZE...So tomorrow morning I am having a no regrets breakfast of eggs, bacon and coffee - hold the home fries, toast, jam, and OJ. And I will forever look at my low fat breakfast of a bowl of corn flakes and skim milk in a different way - counting carbs. Can't wait to see what science says next."
51,0307272702,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3418651-cathy,1,"“Why We Get Fat: And What to Do About It” is one of those books which could be helpful for the people struggling with obesity or overweigh, but it isn’t because it really fails in the scientific level. This book is just a promotion of the hyperproteic / low-carb diet. Don’t get angry, there were a few things right. The insulin explanation is right. And yes, when you are fat you tend to overeat, because there is a massive production of leptin that gives you a sense of dissatisfaction regarding your usual intake. But this we know for years and years. There wasn’t any news here! So, yes there is a hormonal component. But there isn’t just that! That is just narrowing down. There are other factors, such as genetic, family history, diet, exercise, psychological factors… Regarding the scientific level there were said a few things that hit a nerve in me, these are just the most important ones:1- There is no hard evidence that the hyperproteic / low-carb diet is better than any other diet. Yes, they initially work, but they aren’t any better than the others types of diets prescribed by health technicians. Usually what occurs is that after the diet, people tend to gain even more weight than they had before. 2- When you present a book like this and you just use reports from a few people, you are presenting low evidence. Case reports are accepted has evidence but they are low. You need hard evidence to actually prove something! 3- There is prove (High level of evidence) that exercise and diet actually work. But the type of exercise that you prescribe is adapted to the person in question, as is the diet. So don’t be a moron and work out. Is so good for you. And when you do it you have more endorphins in the body, so you’re happier too.Regarding the Public Health issue, the poor people are fatter, because the cheapest food is the unhealthiest. Fast food is cheaper, has some components to taste better and are more addictive. Also, they have a huge marketing. So, the major cause is that. Also, you don’t need to go to the gym. You can work out at home and you can run or walk in the street. Finally, I had a huge problem with the condescending tone. The comparison with the judicial system was just wrong and silly. I’m sorry to say, but Gary Taubes shouldn’t write about health. Mostly, because he has no knowledge about it. And also because he is offensive to the whole bunch of persons who studied health for a lot of years, just to get called idiots and narrow minded in this book. "
52,0307272702,http://goodreads.com/user/show/20608923-shoshanah-marohn,4,"This is a very dry, very informative book that will probably totally change your life. I may never eat a cupcake again! It goes through history and shows how carbohydrates have always made people fat, and then up into the present, he shows how our whole ""low calorie and exercise"" idea to stay thin is just a lie! It's actually a bit shocking. You should exercise for enjoyment and because it makes you happy, but it really doesn't make you thin- who knew? I can say from my own experience of dieting and exercising, though, that I believe it. I think the aim of this book is just what the title says, to explain why we get fat and what to do about it. He definitely achieved the aim of the book. I'm very clear on the whole concept of carbohydrates making you fat, now! I gave it four out of five, because I think even informative books should be entertaining. This book is not at all entertaining.My favorite part of the book was when he went through all of these reasons that it really isn't your fault if you're fat. Your weak willpower and laziness had nothing to do with it. You are not lazy or weak willed. That is a theme that I can get on board with! It is hard to justify eating so much meat, environmentally and also just the death toll of animals. I personally raise a lot of my own meat, and I encourage you to find local farmers who use human practices, if you do eat meat. In the end, he really has shown a huge kind of mass delusion about the whole idea of ""calories in/ calories out."" He seems to think we should never ever ever count calories. Another thing I'm all on board with! It sounds a little bit crazy at first, but the evidence he produces is really compelling. This book was boring, but I do think this was an excellent book to have read, and I really recommend it. It's not a diet book so much as a justification of eating a certain way (low carb) for your health. I'm looking forward to better health and thinner thighs. "
53,0307272702,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1185486-josh,4,"More great writing by Taubes replete with eloquent analogies and aphorisms explaining complex chemical and physical processes in layman's terms. I think if I didn't know this principles worked based on my own experience I would start this book and then go on to ""Good Calories, Bad Calories."" The slaying of the myth that the calories in/calories out via the misapplication via a law of thermodynamics was particularly well done. The dissection of the ideological overlay of sloth or gluttony attributable to weight gain was excellent and give a sense of the ideology of some of the bad science that has literally been killing Americans for several generations now. I would say this is a good book to read twice because so much of the presentation of the facts of fat and obesity are counter to what we grew up to understand; it takes a lot of ""unlearning"" in the first read, and then you can start digesting more in the second take. Some of the key quotes:""To put it simply, the question we should be asking is not why some of us get fat but how any of us avoids this fate."" In wiping out the calories in/calories out argument ""If you asked me this question (why does a room get crowded) and I said 'Well because more people entered the room than left it' you'd probably think I was being a wise guy or an idiot."" ""Had we been discussing disorders of growth, why some people grow to be 7 feet tall and others never make it to four feet - the only subject of discussion would be the hormones and enzymes that regulate growth. And yet, when we're discussing the a disorder in which the defining symptom is the abnormal growth of our fat tissue, the hormones and enzymes that regulate the growth are considered irrelevant"".""We don't get fat because we overeat, we overeat because we get fat."" "
54,0307272702,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5665469-heather-doherty,5,"This book is a must-read for anyone who struggles with weight. Taubes is an emminent science journalist who has been studying and writing about obesity for the past 4 years. He synthesizes the research done over the past 2 centuries in an engaging and accessible manner for the non-scientist and comes to some remarkable conclusions. He provides compelling evidence that the calories in-calories out model is a fallacy, that eating saturated fat will not increase your risk of heart disease and that we do not get fat because we have no willpower or motivation. As a fitness professional and a scientist, I have spent the past 15 years talking, reading and experimenting about eating for weight loss and I am thrilled that Taubes' conclusions confirm my own. If you want to lose weight (or not gain it in the first place), insulin is the enemy. Briefly, insulin acts to partition the calories you take in. When levels in the blood are high, the body is programmed to store fat in the fat cells, and not to release it even if there is inadequate nourishment available for the body's other cells. What causes high blood insulin? In a word, carbohydrates, but especially those containing flour and sugar. Taubes endorses a very low-carbohydrate diet, similar to The Atkin's Diet, for the obese and provides evidence that carbs are actually a greater cause of heart diease than saturated fats. For the rest of us simply avoiding all processed sugar and all grains, or even just flour, will keep us lean for life. "
55,0307272702,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2566394-canterbury-public,5,"This book makes sense. Yes, it is a bit much to take in but the low-carb diet is a very good one especially for diabetics. Your meals do not have to be boring. Your meals do not always contain meat, any green leafy vegetable will do. A lunch of fruit and nuts fine also. I have eaten all types of foods on a low-carb diet. I for one refuse to take a food out of my diet and after reading this book you find that you really don't have to. Potatoes and pasta are still part of the diet but just in smaller quanties depending on how they effect your blood-sugars or weight.So much of this book makes sense. Aerobic exercise is certainly a must but not solely as a diet. Weight-lifting is a necessity. I am slowing learning to eat foods that are in season and have realized that just by cutting out processed foods my health has improved tremdeously. Cutting out processed sugars has stopped my terrible cravings and helped me control my eating. I find I really would rather have fresh fruit rather than cakes and cookies. If I really want baked sweetness I make it myself so I know what ingredients have gone into it.Low-carb diets are not restictive like most people think. People need to read beyond the first chapter of the Atkins Diet to understand how it works. The best part is this has become my way of eating for so long now that I never feel I have cheated even when I eat ice-cream when our local shop opens in the spring. Everything in moderation."
56,0307272702,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4446624-christian,5,"Why We Get Fat, is part history, part science, part public health policy, part diatribe, part self-help . . . all centered around consuming carbohydrates. It argues forcibly that our body treats carbohydrates as a toxin and we are more evolved to consume proteins and fats, than the ""nutrition"" experts have been telling us. The book lays out scientific and historical reasons why we chase two healthy/lifestyle ideas at our peril, Counting Calories / Exercising to lose weight and consuming Fat is unhealthy. Both of these ideas, the author shows, are factually invalid and potentially unhealthy. This book is not going to be embraced by Vegans, Vegetarians, or Dietitians. . . but is worth reading, as it lays out some important ideas that can't be ignored as Western diets and processed foods are leading more and more people into life long battles with obesity, diabetes and chronic ill health. Why We Get Fat, is aimed at the lay reader, but does a good job of presenting scientific arguments that are not overly simplified. It is a quick and pleasant read that I hope will find it's way to changing the how we look at our Western eating practices and the dieting industry. Oh, and by the way, what harm can it do to try the suggestions for a few months and test the thesis of the book. You've probably been eating pizza, drinking coke cola and avoiding fat long enough.. even if you eat healthy, you may be surprised by some of the misconception you've grown up with. I was."
57,0307272702,http://goodreads.com/user/show/51146470-samantha,5,"I think most people kinda understand that carbs are not the best thing for us especially sugar! We see articles and might read a book here and there. This was such a great read especially because it wasn't coming from a doctor trying to sell a diet and or products. Taubes is a science journalist and he brings out many studies that support how high fat, protein, and low carb diets are what we need to lose weight. I found it fascinating to see research that was done in the late 1700 and throughout the 1800 that supports this also. He is also the author of the book Good Calories, Bad Calories. Why the science behind calories in vs calories out is bad science and how and why semi starvation diets don't work in the long term. He is not a doctor and this is not a how to dieting book. It is just very informative. He would be for a KETO/PALEO diet. The only suggestion he makes is in the appendix for what type of diet you might follow. He states that there are many books and cookbooks out in the market that you could find that follow this type of diet. The Appendix is from Lifestyle Medicine Clinic Duke University Medical Center the ""No Sugar, No Starch"" Diet: Getting Started. I highly recommend this book even if you are not overweight."
58,0307272702,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1958821-david,4,"Taubes makes a pretty persuasive argument that a major (if not THE major) cause of the obesity epidemic is easily-digestible carbohydrates. Parts of the book deal with dietary science notably insulin as the main hormone affecting weight gain. The part of his argument that I find most compelling is that millions of years of evolution have programmed our bodies to eat as our hunter-gatherer ancestors did rather than eating refined foods.I didn't give the book 5 stars because I noticed a couple instances where the evidence didn't lead to the conclusion he drew. Specifically, Taubes tries to draw a conclusion that indigenous people -- Inuits specifically -- didn't have Western diseases (some forms of cancer, Alzheimer's, diabetes) before being introduced to Western diet. I find the evidence on this sparse and the experiments difficult to control. Perhaps Inuits didn't have as good record keeping or perhaps lower water and air quality from becoming Westernized led to cancer and other things. I also found the way that Taubes described the calories-in/calories-out dietary thinking as a straw man argument."
59,0307272702,http://goodreads.com/user/show/906332-donald,4,"Taubes stated that he wanted to write a book that anyone could read, not just a scientist. He hit the mark with this one. Why We Get Fat is concise and accessible to all. The information on metabolism is understandable, and Taubes takes you through the scientific experimentation effortlessly. By far the most interesting topics, however, are the explanations on why public health ""experts"" have been so reluctant to change their message in spite of a conspicuous lack of evidence supporting their advice. I had never really considered the impact that government ""dogma"" would have on research funding, for example. In recent years I have read books on cholera, the discovery of antibiotics, and timekeeping as a way to track longitude. In every case, supposed authorities suppressed valid solutions to the problems for decades through their unwillingness or inability to see that they may be wrong. Taubes convinces that we are seeing this same pattern today, and that given the available and mounting evidence to the contrary, proponents of the ""low-fat"" or ""calories in calories out"" line of thought may well be viewed as close-minded prideful fools in future history books."
