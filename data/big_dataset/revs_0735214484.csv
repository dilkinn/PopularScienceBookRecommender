0,0735214484,http://goodreads.com/user/show/96244200-mark,3,"Disclosure: I won this pre-release copy in a drawing from the publisher.The book wasn't badly written, but for me it was something of a slog. I've enjoyed similar books in this genre more, the sort of pop-psychology-self-help mashup including books like ""Willpower"" (Baumeister/Tierney), ""The Upside of Down"" (McArdle), ""The Power of Habit"" (Duhigg), among others. There was nothing distracting in the style of ""Range"" that failed to work for me. But the presentation often left me wanting more, arguing in my head against the point the author was making. It often felt like being led down a garden path, and asked to ignore things on the edge of the trail as meaningless distractions.Part of the challenge confronting the author was in tackling a deconstructed subject. In the opening chapter, Tiger Woods and Roger Federer are presented as juxtapositions in how to become the best in their respective sports. Woods is raised on golf obsessively from an early age, while Federer is allowed to explore all sports, until he settles on tennis much later. Woods exemplifies the narrow specialist, while Federer stands in for the generalist. As a reader, I kept complaining that they were both raised on sports generally, and that both were clearly encouraged to develop talents by sports-obsessive homes.And the reading went on in this spirit throughout, with quite impressive, accomplished individuals described in broad outlines, predominantly having achieved success as apparent outsiders rather than very, very narrow specialists who had rarely been permitted to pursue interests beyond the narrow confines. This often felt like an anecdote held up as a contrast to a caricature. The supporting research mentioned frequently felt more vague than persuasive. And as a result, for me the book was mostly frustrating.It was not all a loss, however, as the author certainly shows significant benefit of applying far-flung knowledge to unanticipated problems. He clearly demonstrates the tendency of narrow specialists in our increasingly specialized society to become blinkered by their own learning to the point that they can no longer step outside their fields for a fresh view from a different perspective. He also shows how institutions like NASA can succumb to a narrow-minded, specialist group-think.I can't say that I regret pushing myself to read all the way through. But I felt I didn't get any particular insights from it, much less suggestions for how to get greater range, or how to make better use of my own more generalist background. Yet it may well benefit readers who've come to believe that specialization is all there is or should be in life."
1,0735214484,http://goodreads.com/user/show/13212975-randall-wallace,2,"I’ve staked my entire adult life on following the generalist’s path instead of the specialist’s, so I hoped this book would answer my basic questions: What about the role Neuroplasticity plays with keeping the following people analytically extra-sharp: The Polymath, the Multi-Instrumentalist, and those like Noam Chomsky, composer Elliot Carter, Aristotle, Leonard da Vinci, or Bertrand Russell all deeply learned in multiple fields (range), yet known for changing how we understand, hear, or see things? Zero on Neuroplasticity. Ok, then what will David say about how generalists best can pull deep multi-disciplinary analogies through their multiple points of reference? Meh, nothing of note. How about this: Generalists can see the big picture. They can see the forest for the trees. They can tell us deeper stories of our times. They are more apt to see macro. Society is further atomized by specialists, while further integrated by the generalist. How do you make systemic change to avoid extinction without generalists? How do local areas survive economic collapse without generalists? How do you prioritize at the highest level of society without generalists? I’m just making stuff up fast that I wanted to hear but this book had none of it, so what did this book teach me? Some cool facts like:When you think your favorite Van Gogh’s paintings, you are thinking of only the last three years of his life. Wow. At his death, Michelangelo “left three-fifths of his sculptures unfinished”. Edison had over 1,000 patents, most were unimportant. “Sandwiched between King Lear and Macbeth, Shakespeare quilled Timon of Athens.” Jackson Pollack “was literally one of the least talented draftsmen at the Art Student’s League”. That led him to writing his own rules. Lots of stumped creative teams benefit from bring in outside knowledge like InnoCentive (google them). Iowa, not traditionally known as the hot bed of American music and culture, once had more than 1,000 opera houses! MRI scans of jazz musicians show that during improvising, their internal criticism was suspended, unlike during practice, when they identified errors and corrected them. “There is no entrenched interest fighting on the side of range.” – Well, that is because elites don’t want oppressed masses with “range” out-lobbying corporate lobbyists by sheer endless volume (as Ralph Nader discusses in depth with Chris Hedges on In Contact – RT). If you have true range, you are more likely to want to oppose corporate power, capitalism, militarism, and all undeserved power, because your outlook becomes bigger. Luckily for elites, even though everything from ancient pre-history to today is all at your fingertips, the average American can’t find Europe on a map of the world - there’s today’s range. A lot of this book is telling the reader that, when involving techniques of problem solving, there is no one answer, nor is there one place to look for answers. David uses “quitters never win” as an example. Many top minds quit what they were doing and changed jobs to finally succeed, and so for them, quitting made all the difference. With this mindset, you fail when you don’t have the courage to leave a dead-end situation. In other words, there are strong advantages if you don’t consider your path fixed. Although, some say Einstein was “destined for fame” as a Swiss patent clerk, others say he made a good call in switching. Premature optimization means, specializing in a field before you know yourself well-enough. For many Americans, their jobs didn’t exist when they were kids and so to reach them they took many paths. As David says, those many paths travelled gave us range.In conclusion, this book has no stories of activists with range, nor stories of progressive or radical change makers who affected great change by linking many disciplines: MLK linking racism, capitalism, and militarism, Noam Chomsky linking language, power structure analysis, foreign affairs, journalism, economics, and all social and economic and social justice initiatives, Cornel West and Chris Hedges linking Theology to Social Justice, Radical Prophets and Philosophy. David never even mentions Intersectionality once. So, if you are reading this book to learn how humans are right now solving the climate crisis, fending off extinction, or any kind of activism through the range of of generalists, sorry, you are out of luck. Instead, this book is about how generalists help innovation, capitalism, and even the military. In one of David’s stories, a U.S. military team is requested to gain a speed advantage over “the enemy” in Afghanistan. Not “the opponent” but “the enemy”. Let’s invade a sovereign nation and give it the longest war in American history and after refusing to leave, let’s label anyone actively resisting our invasion and never leaving as “the enemy”. One reviewer called this groundbreaking and other called it breathtaking - what nonsense – the subject of this book is so important and yet I see it as a massive opportunity squandered. Range is needed in hundreds of ways to save the planet, why not mention it once in your book?This is a great defanged book for US elites to exploit – by employing generalists, both the military and multi-nationals can better pry open business opportunities in countries that can’t defend themselves. Each chapter starts with an easy story and there’s some People Magazine worthy quotes inside about tennis players, musicians, chess players, Darwin, Girl Scouts, and the Challenger disaster to keep the average reader quite content. If I wasn’t so busy hugging my American Flag made in China, I be saluting this brave book which, after giving minor nods to art, sports and culture, will keep any conservative or centrist reader on the straight and narrow of focusing on business and military applications (where the money to pay generalists is), without any embarrassing talk about applications for social or economic justice."

It aligns with what I try to do when I am coaching, in my stories, and what we’re doing with Mamba Sports Academy—create all-around athletes who can think critically and make assessments in real time to enhance their play rather than rely only on a narrow set of skills."
3,0735214484,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8369202-katie,4,"“Compare yourself to yourself yesterday, not to younger people who aren’t you.”An incredibly slow read for me but I enjoyed it a lot and felt like I was on information overload after finishing each chapter. Who knew that so many case studies and anecdotes could support having breadth vs. depth of knowledge? The author of course nods to the fact that it’s important to have both kinds of people (generalists and specialists), but his argument is against the prevalent thinking that we should pick an area of focus from a young age and keep at it.Some of the sections that spoke most to me involved communication across teams and disciplines. I honestly felt that I grew the most as a professional when working with and learning from colleagues who did very different things than me during their day-to-day; these relationships were especially rewarding when we could collaborate toward fixing a common problem. Epstein covers this a few different times, from a task as general as comparing your project against others within the company to get an understanding of how long it might take (and whether it will be worth it in the end), to the tradition of Monday Notes at NASA (notes submitted by engineers which were circulated so all divisions could see what problems others were facing).One of my favorite conclusions from Epstein was that teams need elements of both hierarchy and individualism to survive. Often, too much process focused on pandering to upper management leads to lower quality feedback from “lower ranking” employees (or in so many words, an erosion of trust). He calls this concept an “Allegiance to Hierarchy” and showcases how detrimental it can be, particularly through the examples of the Challenger disaster and the 2008 global financial crisis.As someone who enjoys working across teams, learning new things, and sees contextual information critical to doing my job, I appreciated Epstein’s argument that it’s important to have people who look across teams/projects to identify systemic issues. This is something I truly feel companies don’t value enough, and even though I’ve advocated for it myself, it’s not something I’ve often been encouraged to do.This is one of the few books I would actually recommend that everyone read! That being said, I can’t quite give it 5 stars because it really is a challenge to push through some of the research (I think the best approach is trying to read just one chapter per day so you have time to think about it.) Maybe it’s more of a 4.5 star read :)See more of my reviews: Blog // Instagram"

By the time I'm done working on a book, I have such a strong insider view of the project that it's difficult to be objective. I will say this: I worked extremely hard on it, and as a writer, researcher, and reader, I found it to be much more interesting than my first book. Most readers enjoyed that first book--at least according to Goodreads ratings--so I hope most readers will (as I have) enjoy this one even more."
5,0735214484,http://goodreads.com/user/show/13298726-michael-perkins,4,"The story of the new U.S. Open golf winner illustrates part of the thesis of this book. A range of experience is sometimes better than over-specialization. In the book, Roger Federer is another example.https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/17/sp...=======================This passage describes a key finding that is central to the book....James Flynn, is a professor of political studies in New ZealandFlynn’s great disappointment is the degree to which society, and particularly higher education, has responded to the broadening of the mind by pushing specialization, rather than focusing early training on conceptual, transferable knowledge. Flynn conducted a study in which he compared the grade point averages of seniors at one of America’s top state universities, from neuroscience to English majors, to their performance on a test of critical thinking. The test gauged students’ ability to apply fundamental abstract concepts from economics, social and physical sciences, and logic to common, real-world scenarios. Flynn was bemused to find that the correlation between the test of broad conceptual thinking and GPA was about zero. In Flynn’s words, “the traits that earn good grades at [the university] do not include critical ability of any broad significance.”“Even the best universities aren’t developing critical intelligence,” he said. “They aren’t giving students the tools to analyze the modern world, except in their area of specialization. Their education is too narrow.”As a patient, I see this in medicine. My father practiced medicine for 40 years. He used to say that medicine was as much an art as a science. The art is gone. No doctor I've encountered knows how to take a good patient history. Many times, as a result of my own research, I've asked my doctors ""what about X?"" ""Oh, good idea!"" Shouldn't they have the ability and knowledge to bring these issues up themselves? But this is true in many fields. ---------in late 2014, a team of German scientists published a study showing that members of their national team, which had just won the World Cup, were typically late specializers who didn’t play more organized soccer than amateur-league players until age twenty-two or later. They spent more of their childhood and adolescence playing non-organized soccer and other sports.It's not about the mythical 10,000 hours. The reason that elite athletes seem to have superhuman reflexes is that they recognize patterns of ball or body movements that tell them what’s coming before it happens. As the greatest hockey player in history, Wayne Gretzky, said: “I skate to where the puck is going, not where it has been.” Same is true of Steph Curry, who views the basketball court as a rapidly moving chessboard. He sees several moves ahead. ----------When we know the rules and answers, and they don’t change over time—chess, golf, playing classical music—an argument can be made for savant-like hyperspecialized practice from day one. But those are poor models of most things humans want to learn. Meanwhile, advances in artificial intelligence have already shown that rules-based human jobs will be the first to go the more A.I. is implemented. This reality was made shockingly obvious when a computer defeated the world champion Gary Kasparov in chess. Likewise, the international Go champion. And now poker. ----------RE: parents, psychologist Adam Grant noted that creativity may be difficult to nurture, but it is easy to thwart. He pointed to a study that found an average of six household rules for typical children, compared to one in households with extremely creative children.Darwin's father was a doctor who wanted his son to become a doctor. Darwin lasted only half a semester in med school. He turned to the church. He was a Bible literalist at the time, and figured he would become a clergyman. He bounced around classes, including a botany course with a professor who subsequently recommended him for an unpaid position aboard the HMS Beagle. After convincing his father that he would not become a deadbeat if he took this one detour, he experienced perhaps the most impactful post-college gap year in history. Decades later, Darwin reflected on the process of self-discovery. “It seems ludicrous that I once intended to be a clergyman,” he wrote.----------A recent international Gallup survey of more than two hundred thousand workers in 150 countries reported that 85 percent were either “not engaged” with their work or “actively disengaged.” In that condition, according to Seth Godin, quitting takes a lot more guts than continuing to be carried along like debris on an ocean wave. The trouble, Godin noted, is that humans are bedeviled by the “sunk cost fallacy.” Having invested time or money in something, we are loath to leave it, because that would mean we had wasted our time or money, even though it is already gone.----------There is “perverse inverse relationship” between fame and accuracy. The more likely an expert was to have his or her predictions featured on op-ed pages and television, the more likely they were always wrong. Paul Ehrlich's ""Population Bomb"" is an infamous example. He appeared on Johnny Carson's ""Tonight Show"" (20x), gave congressional testimony, and his theory was heavily sold in a cover article in The New Republic. The end result of this crisis, Ehrlich asserted, would be global nuclear war.----------The hedgehogs, according to political scientist Philip Tetlock, “toil devotedly” within one tradition of their specialty, “and reach for formulaic solutions to ill-defined problems.” Outcomes did not matter; they were proven right by both successes and failures, and burrowed further into their ideas. It made them outstanding at predicting the past, but dart-throwing chimps at predicting the future.---------the opposite of flexible intelligence is cognitive entrenchment.....Researchers in Canada and the United States began a 2017 study by asking a politically diverse and well-educated group of adults to read arguments confirming their beliefs about controversial issues. When participants were then given a chance to get paid if they read contrary arguments, two-thirds decided they would rather not even look at the counterarguments, never mind seriously entertain them.---------I liked the first 10 chapters of this book. In chapters 11 & 12 the author turns it into a business book with some extremely tedious cases studies that they do in MBA programs. It reminded me why I don't like and never read business books. So this a caveat for this book that removes one star from the rating.=============Poker & A.I....https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/11/sc...Excellent new documentary on A.I......https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5dZ_l..."
6,0735214484,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4213258-bradley,5,"In a lot of ways, this book is a vindication of everything I hold dear.Why? Well, granted, it IS a vindication of a mindset that rebels against going down any single rabbit hole to the exclusion of everything else in this life, which is basically another way of saying that specialists are generally unable to see beyond their own field. Being widely read, having wide experiences, and knowing a ton of different fields lends the person in question a much greater chance to make creative connections that most others will miss.The benefit of being a generalist is not lost on me. The more I learn across many fields, the easier I understand ANY field, even unrelated ones like cross-stitching and covariant loop analysis. Or the tensile strength of a willow tree to cognitive plasticity. It's not about knowing any one thing. It's about being able to see the forest for the trees. About seeing and correctly intuiting the bigger picture. It's about sussing out trends. Tossing out bad ideas... including a wide variety of tools in your toolbox and knowing which ones to throw away as the situation demands.It's about being adaptable. Being able to be creative. Using analogies. It's about cutting to the heart of the issue because you're able to SEE a problem that might cross many different fields and affect them all.In a specialist world, generalists still tend to outperform, across their entire lifetime, any specialist. Being able to cite everyone in your field does not predict how you would perform when encountering anything novel.So, who's in charge of hiring well-read people with strong critical thinking skills and temperaments conducive to thinking outside the box?Anyone?Hello? I'm right here!lol"
7,0735214484,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3461034-trish,5,"Now THIS is how you write a compelling non-fiction book! This has catapulted itself on my must-have shelf after the introduction alone!The topic is nothing new: specialized thinking vs. broad thinking. We have it in evolution in Darwin’s famous fitness of surviving species. It has nothing to do with size or teeth or muscle strength. Rather, it’s about adaptability. It also applies to thinking processes.Thus, the author examines the different psychological variations within the human population throughout history.We get athletes like Tiger Woods vs. Roger Federer (totally opposite upbringing, both highly successful), we get artists like Van Gogh or Miyazaki (both for the same point), we get the woman who saved the Girl Scouts of America, we get chess champions (not masters) vs computers, we get musicians like the orphans of one of the goodwill hospitals in Venice.There are many stories of people being successful (or not). All these stories - along with many studies - show that being a polymath is the way to go. Yes, there are some outliers (such as Tiger Woods), but generally speaking it’s better to nurture many interests and try out different things, taking risks instead of always just falling back on experience (though there is nothing wrong with experience itself, it's just that it doesn't help in every situation).Interestingly, I had to think of many experiences from my own life. For example, Germany has different kinds of graduations at high schools (science-heavy, art-heavy, general …) and I chose the general „Abitur“. Then I had to decide about my future and, after being told (and believing I couldn’t do what I wanted (yes, I’m regretting it, especially after this book), I studied linguistics. But I decided against a university as those students only study vocabulary and grammar - it was too narrow for me and didn’t promise good chances to get a job later, instead opting for a private school that taught geography, history, and politics of all the countries where the language I chose was spoken, plus IT and finance on top of that. It was definitely the right way to go though my degree is considered less than that with a university stamp (which isn’t worth anything when applying for a job though).Theoretical knowledge alone wasn’t worth as much as theory plus practical appliance so I „won“.I do regret not risking much more when I was younger, instead being talked into fearing failure. This book showcases that there necessarily isn’t any fault in making mistakes and trying one thing after another. An important lesson.There are some almost unbelievable stories in here. Such as the Navy SEAL the author met personally. Or the United States Military Academy West Point and how it had to adapt (completely misjudging the situation). Or how some people raised their children (not necessarily in a „bad“ way, the accomplishments are what’s unbelievable). To say nothing of NASA engineers having to puzzle over problems before the Challenger launch (we all know how that ended), or the professors trying to teach their students to not only interpret any given data but to ask if this is the data they indeed need.It also hints at what we need to do (change) going forward. Standardized tests like the US school system uses are the death of innovation. And other countries aren’t doing much better. People are no longer (if ever) encouraged to really solve problems but to categorize them according to pre-established templates. But life doesn’t always happen according to pre-ordained patterns. We need polymaths and unafraid ones as that.Personally, I loved the history lessons here. In telling the reader of certain people throughout history, the author managed to show the psychological differences he was talking about. Along the way, we even get a few exercises to solve. *lol*Moreover, the way events and theories are presented is downright thrilling and funny and down-to-earth. The writing isn’t simplistic but it’s also not unnecessarily complex. We get swept along at breakneck speed and I enjoyed every minute of this ride. Not many non-fiction books manage to break a topic down in such a charming way and convey so much information so successfully (if it’s not presented in a dry fashion, one is much more likely to remember it).Fantastic book!""Let them torture the cucumbers!"""

Try lots of things, read broadly, and fail lots of times. I agree with this formula for success.

10,0735214484,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1500718-ryan,3,"After encountering the 10000 hours theory (Gladwell), the grit theory (Duckworth), and the Tiger Mom theory (Chua), it seemed obvious to many that we should specialize as much as possible and as early as possible. Because Tiger Woods was unusually athletic as an infant and his father had him golfing as a toddler, the thinking went, parents who didn't have their children excelling at playing chess or the obo at a soon-to-be-grandmaster level by kindergarten were failures. Range: Why Generalists Triumph in a Specialized World argues against a knee jerk enthusiasm for specialization, it highlights the accomplishments of generalists, and it attempts to sort out why generalists are sometimes able to produce insights that elude specialists.Although I enjoy teasing Gladwell, Duckworth, and Chua, Epstein's book demonstrates that each of these theories, alone, is too narrow. Taken together, however, they rise. In speaking against each other they offer readers nuance and they further remind us of the dangers of generalizing from a small sample size (how replicable is Tiger Woods' career, really?). Range admirably nudges us to have a bit more enthusiasm for generalists. I worry that our culture is incapable of discussing any issue without resorting to some form of ""silver bullet"" discourse. Well, it can make sense to expose children (or adults) to many interests, and it is also the case that many professionals (and children) do very well by specializing. Grit, commitment, and grinding away at a longterm goal are admired traits for good reason, as is a broad curiosity.Our attempt to optimize life's path--worrying that 10 is too late to specialize--undervalues and underestimates human potential. Epstein considers cadets who joined the military, who seemed perfect for leadership, and who left. In fact, the ones who were highlighted as having the most potential to succeed in that program were most likely to leave. To be clear: they aren't washouts and went on to succeed outside of the military. As people learn about themselves, they reassess their values and options. Even if we could match ability with a career when a child is 10, such a program would still struggle because people are capable of doing more than one thing well.Random observations... First, Successful athletes seem to generalize until their mid to late teens before specializing. There may be evidence that specialization can occur still later. He highlights a British Olympic program that targeted late bloomers. (I'm not sure this supports generalizing so much as it reveals how difficult it is to successfully realize one's strengths as a child, but I still enjoyed that section.) Second, Epstein is convincing when he argues that many fields have become blinded within silos thanks to excessive specialization, and there is now an opportunity for professionals who eschew that path to produce unique insights. One man highlighted here uses computer searches to find areas of suggestive overlap between overly specialized fields. I'm not sure producing those insights will be easily replicated, but it does seem that specialization can blind us. Third, Tetlock's famous foxes appear, and the most interesting takeaway from that oft told story, aside from the importance of branding, is that these foxes often excel at creating networks that successfully revise each other's predictions. Maybe the best strategy for success, regardless of whether one's a specialist or a generalist, is networking so that one's opinions are tested but also so that they are heard and amplified.Although there was much I appreciated in the book... Range is written with generous margins, liberal spacing, and a breezy “did you know!” style that I’ve come to find tiring. The writing is engaging, but I enjoy “and now you know the rest of the story” biographies about as much as I do exclamation points. There's also too much of a ""how to succeed"" ethos in this book for my taste. Finally, Range is designed to appeal to people who are already skeptical of specialization/ enthusiastic about generalized skillsets. I worry that some of the appreciation of this book is just a soothing exercise in confirmation bias for generalists.3.5 stars."

12,0735214484,http://goodreads.com/user/show/35812962-kimberly-dawn,4,"This book absolutely fascinates while teaching new, novel ideas for learning. The ideas promoted here are totally contradictory to what we were taught in the past about learning. The new ways of thinking apply not only to the classrooms of today, but to sports, music training, and career preparation and advancement. The demands of today’s careers (and of future careers) have changed drastically. Critical thinking is now needed above all else. Specialization is not the way to advance in today’s world. Wide reaching, varied interests and pursuits give us more to draw from, which allows us to apply ideas from one area of learning to an unrelated area. There is a huge difference between deep learning vs. shallow, surface learning which doesn’t stay with us. It’s important to realize the attainment of deep learning is a very slow process. We learn not to make too much of quick and easy A’s early on: the importance of head starts has been overestimated. The pursuit of early A’s is seen as a form of instant gratification, which is not conducive to deep learning. Deep learning makes room for struggling. It is in the struggle that we learn. What is more, making mistakes actually proves beneficial to deep learning. This book is revolutionary and should prove interesting to anyone looking to prepare for a career in today’s world, or a second or third career. The carryover of skills and experience is seen as beneficial to a later career. "

In contrast, those professors who received worse feedback actually inspired better student performance later on."""
14,0735214484,http://goodreads.com/user/show/62390164-numidica,4,"It has lately become an article of faith among many people, especially certain type-A parents, that to do anything well, one must spend 10,000 hours (or some other arbitrarily chosen criteria) practicing the activity, from playing the violin to mastering a foreign language to becoming an outstanding soccer player. Single-minded focus is recommended by the ""tiger-mother"" school of thinking, and is unfortunately inflicted on many children by well-meaning parents. David Epstein has done extensive research to demonstrate that what appears to be obvious about becoming proficient in a sport, game, or academic pursuit, is actually far from obvious.Epstein researched a wide range of people who were successful in their fields, and he found the opposite of what many would expect; instead of the example of Mozart, who started learning the keyboard as a very young child and then continued with daily training for years, he found that most of those who achieved great success and honors in science, sports, or the arts were ""samplers"". They tried many different things before settling on their chosen field, and even after choosing their profession or specialty, they continued to dabble in hobbies or other interests unrelated to the field where they achieved success. And importantly, these people cited example after example where knowledge or experience in an outside interest or hobby gave them an unexpected tool in solving a problem in their chosen profession. Also, people with a broad range of interests tended to seek and identify data that did not fit, and they were willing, even eager, to identify problems with their own theories or systems in order to find a correct theory or more effective process. An example of seeking problems and investigating data that didn't ""fit"" was NASA during the Apollo Program. Werner von Braun asked engineers every week to write up their activities in a weekly one-page document, and to report any problems or anomalies they were encountering. Von Braun would often write comments on these papers and direct investigation into problems that had been reported; people who reported problems were viewed as part of the solution, not troublemakers, and von Braun used these reports to improve NASA's performance. Similarly, the most effective quality-improvement system I was ever a part of was as an engineer at Texas Instruments where, on a weekly basis, a designated engineer (me) would lead a meeting in which we asked manufacturing line employees, ""what are we doing wrong?"", and/or, what can we improve? If a manufacturing employee identified what appeared to be a process error or inefficiency, the engineer was required to investigate and answer the issue raised by the employee and to change the process if appropriate. It was often astonishing to me to see how easy it was to get large productivity or quality improvements through this process, and all it took was for engineers and management to check their egos at the door and seek the best solution.Epstein also explored the stark contrast between strict specialists and generalists in terms of finding correct solutions or forecasting outcomes correctly. Those who were narrowly focused on their chosen field tended to be less productive than those who dabbled in a variety of fields; notable examples are Steve Jobs and Roger Federer, but a survey of Nobel prize winners turned up the same kind of profile; almost all the Nobel winners had many outside interests from bird watching to amateur theater to playing a musical instrument, and these interests, despite taking time away from their professional work, were cited by the Nobel winners as actually enhancing their performance as scientists, economists, etc. Among children who were driven to specialization by parents, a notable effect of such early specialization is what appears to be burn-out. By virtue of being forced to immerse themselves every day in soccer, or violin, or foreign language, or chemistry, children often came to hate the thing that they were being forced to learn, whereas the samplers, like Roger Federer, who was not pressured at all by his parents, ultimately chose the sport he liked best out of five or six that he played as a child, and he did not definitively choose tennis until he was thirteen. By allowing him to sample many things, his parents helped him become the greatest tennis player of all time.All this points to the foolishness of forcing children or college students to specialize early. In an earlier age, say fifty years ago, it was quite common for colleges and universities to have a large core curriculum including math, history, sciences, English, foreign languages, and other courses with the intent of providing a broad rather than a narrow view, but the current approach to higher education has turned that on its head, with ominous consequences. It has become common for Nobel Prize winners to note that the breakthroughs they made would likely not occur in today's academic environment where each discipline operates in a silo without access to the insights of other fields of study. And studies of specialists showed that when confronted with problems in their theories or conflicting data, their tendency is not to investigate to look for error, but to double down on their own views.None of this is meant to diminish the value of specialists. I have a good friend who was first in his class in nuclear physics, and he is still contributing to the science of laser physics at a major university. He is a huge asset to society, but no one forced him to be a physicist - he does it because he loves it. Not everyone need be a specialist, but everyone needs to learn how to think, and Epstein shows that people think better, and are much better problem solvers when they have broad experience and varied interests.This book made me feel better about my early life, because I was nothing if not a sampler as a child. I had intense interests in a variety of areas, but after several months, or years, I tended to lose interest in most of the things I delved into. And any hobby that required a massive commitment of time, to the exclusion of other interests, quickly dropped away for me, because I was unwilling to give up the many other things I enjoyed. So I kayaked, I gardened, I played softball, I sailed, I swam, I was a runner, I built hundreds of model airplanes, I played tennis, I read hundreds of books, I had a neighbor who was an airline pilot and he taught me to fly, I lifted weights, I built dozens and dozens of model rockets which my friends and I then launched (occasionally starting fires), I had a chemistry set and did experiments, I played basketball (badly), I drew, I water-skiied, I shot a .22 rifle and became quite a marksman, I played golf well enough to make the high school team, and perhaps my most frequent activity was just wandering in the woods and observing the plants, birds, snakes, and animals I saw there. Altogether, one might say it was an aimless childhood. Academically, I did well, but not outstandingly well. Physics interested me, so I got A's in it. Calculus did not, so I got B's. I went to West Point (surprising myself a little by being admitted), and after two years found myself not sure about my choice, despite being ranked high in the class academically. I studied engineering, but I specifically disliked its narrowness of focus. I did not select my current profession until I was 32 years old, having been an Army officer, a product engineer, a procurement engineer, and a customer account manager. So in each new job, I felt like a bit of an imposter because of my lack of ""credentials"", a feeling which many of the people profiled by Epstein also admitted feeling. But I have also noted that I am frequently able to identify problems when others don't, and to see patterns, and to ignore structure and processes when logic says they should be ignored. This can be dangerous - as my dad said, if you're gonna be tough, you better be good, i.e., if you are challenging orthodoxy, you better have thought through your alternative solution. But alternative solutions are often what we need; solutions that go back to first principles and use basic logic to work to an answer. And generalists are far more likely than specialist to be able to do that.I gave the book four stars rather than five only because I thought some of the examples Epstein shared became repetitive - he could have shortened things down a bit. I also disliked his military example and did not agree with the solution, but that's nit-picking from an Army vet. His bit about firefighters dying rather than putting down their tools moved me deeply, as I have read the book he references, Men Against Fire, and I understand viscerally the instinct to keep one's tools in hand, even when survival would favor throwing them away, from my time in the Army. I wish the higher education establishment and our society generally would take the lessons of this book to heart, but I'm afraid we are wrong-headedly committed to the path of early specialization. Maybe this book can be part of a beginning to turn the ocean liner of educational practice back toward broader learning."

I loved Range"" - Malcolm Gladwellreads the backcover of the book. It started 5 years ago really, picking up Blink, and reading my first Malcolm Gladwell book talking about the power of intuition and what it actually is. The journey went through ""Thinking, Fast and Slow"" by Daniel Kahneman questioning a lot of functional wisdom and how biases make our judgements myopic, ""Black Swan"" by Taleb talking about the power of probabilities and our total lack of understanding of a basic concept that drives most of our decisions, ""Travels"" by Michael Chrichton talking about his fascinating career and travel adventures taking him to places, being part of a lot of different experiences, ""Dao of Capital"" by Mark detailing the power of cicuituous path in life and investments instead of aiming for short term wins, landing here with 'Range'. Inside Amazon, as much as we are a data driven company, our boss Jeff Bezos made a famous statement - ""If the data and anecdotes are in conflict, I tend to agree with anecdotes"". That became a driver for some of the decisions we made even in our current team, some of my past projects. Some of the stories beautifully narrated by Epstein in this book echoed a similar idea. Epstein weaves multiple stories so vividly to bring his point home about the power and strength of breadth and exploration in a world that is increasingly moving towards specialization and head start. I haven't heard a better argument against the famous quote 'Winners don't quit'. I picked up few music recommendations, new leaders to read about and follow and other book and paper recommendations along the way. A quick read filled with many real characters and their conventional wisdom questioning life stories. Seattle Library's peakpicks continues to recommend me such gems. "

Offering a wide-ranging wealth of information and research Epstein shares data, as well as his opinion, on how to become and stay successful in a constantly evolving world. What surprised me a lot was how compulsively readable it was and despite being a work of non-fiction Epstein can sure engage you in an almost mesmerising way with his narrative.For many years we have been told that specialisation in a certain area, whilst foregoing most or all others, is the key to success — theories such as the 10,000 hours rule prevail for now, but this book goes some way to rebutting and changing that view. Citing the latest research and referencing famous figures the author pens a thought-provoking and essential read for our times. It's an intensely engaging and fascinating book packed with accessible tidbits of knowledge and Epstein explains things in an understandable and eminently readable fashion. Range is a book I will remember for it's helpful, novel ideas and its important message that all is not lost should you not have spent those hours plugging away in a specialised field. Highly recommended. Many thanks to Macmillan for an ARC."
17,0735214484,http://goodreads.com/user/show/39827654-josh,4,"One of my favorite quotes by Albert Einstein is, “In theory there is no difference between theory and practice. In practice there is.” Range: Why Generalists Triumph in a Specialized World by David Epstein is about the latter half of that quote. Range introduces the concept of wicked domains (or as I like to them, reality) where you are faced with imperfect information and erratic feedback yet must somehow still devine a solution, preferably a successful one. Furthermore, learning occurs mostly through a coherent yet completely inaccurate summary of events, the narrative fallacy. So how can we better ourselves? How do we solve the most pressing issues of our time when there is no evidence that our solutions are working? Range doesn’t provide any easy answers but suggests the solution is, at its heart, to follow evolution. Take opportunities to expose yourself to new thoughts and ideas to supplement deep and purposeful learning in a narrow course of study. Range is a thoughtful and well-researched book with examples spanning from athletics to academia to business to government. Range is further proof that sometimes the best ideas come from outside the box."
18,0735214484,http://goodreads.com/user/show/12925436-annie,3,"I give this book 3.5 stars. The point of this book is that specialists do well in a ""kind"" world, where rules are clear and feedback is immediate (like playing golf or chess). Generalists do well in a ""wicked"" world, where rules are unclear or unknown and feedback is not immediate (like practicing medicine). Therefore, a cardiologist with a wider range of knowledge (like nutrition and physiology) would make a better doctor than one who is focused only on acquiring more technical knowledge about the heart. Unfortunately, the author does a poor job of supporting this premise. The stories and studies in the book really support the idea of being exposed to a wide range of activities and experiences instead of any specialization at a young age. This would give a person a better foundation so that later in life, that person can find an area of expertise that is a fit and can draw on that varied, past experiences for innovative solutions in their area of expertise (instead of a myopic view of the world through the perspective of their specialization)."

22,0735214484,http://goodreads.com/user/show/36489698-r-nair,5,"The best thing this book can teach you - practice does NOT make perfect.Here's why-Tons of books talk about how early specialization is the key to success in life and a majority of parents are seen pushing their kids into activities at an early age to give them that 'career advantage' later on in life. David Epstein trashes this idea so thoroughly in this book that I feel it should be mandatory reading for couples trying to have a baby. Epstein starts off with the poster boy for early specialization - Tiger Woods, who was already winning golf tournaments by the age of 4. His success led to training centres across the world for babies that incorporated the 'Tiger approach' - basically begin training the moment the sperm cell fertilizes the egg. Epstein talks about the flip side of the coin, great athletes, musicians, scientists who are practically the 'Tiger Woods' of their chosen domains but who weren't even interested in the fields they are now famous in till late in life. A good example is Roger Federer, possibly the best tennis player on the planet, who didn't take tennis seriously till his late teens. Until that point he was sampling all types of sports including football and basketball, even refusing advanced training in tennis so that he could continue playing with his friends on a lower skill level.So here's the crux - specializing early on in life (being a 'specialist') may bring success, no doubt. But those who have experience in diverse fields (the 'generalists') are the ones you can expect to achieve the greatest amount of success in any field. And this message is critical in our world where educational institutes are busy churning out individuals with narrow, non-transferable skill-sets with no basis in abstract thinking or cross-disciplinary creativity. This dearth reduces human flexibility when it comes to broad unpredictable problems to the point that we all are becoming more similar to Artificial Intelligence than the other way around. Why? Because AI can learn and use tactics to be used over and over again, but the moment the rules become flexible and the tactics require adaptation to changing unfamiliar patterns, AIs are well known for being blatantly unsuitable for the task. We all like to think that such tasks are the domain of humans and will remain so, because 'creativity'. But considering how much of our training is geared towards non-abstract, repetitive, familiar problems that schools and Universities drill into us in the name of specialization begs the question, is something uniquely human being lost between the lines?Studies done on musical students ranging from prodigies to novices shows that genius level musicians didn't practice any more than amateurs at the beginning of their careers. They only increased their practice durations after having sampled multiple instruments and choosing the one they liked. Countries where students are compelled to choose a specialization in the last two years of high-school learn the skills for that particular career and are encouraged to stick to it for the rest of their lives to achieve success, but in countries where students continue sampling different fields even in college have been seen to be just as successful with more of them actually staying in their chosen fields. NASA (a hub for specialists) spent 30 years trying to predict solar particle storms and the problem was eventually solved by a retired engineer who had worked with scientists and had a general idea of multiple fields. Famous musicians like Pianist Dave Brubeck, guitarist Django Reinhardt or jazz musician Jack Cecchini never had any formal musical training. 'Polymaths' - people with specific areas of expertise but with a broad knowledge of other domains have the most number of patents as per the records of the U.S. Patent office. Even in the field of comic books, the best comic artists are not the ones with the most experience but those who have had exposure to the most number of different genres. My favourite example has to be of Physicist Andre Geim, who used to spend his Friday nights performing random experiments unrelated to his field of study and eventually discovered graphene after peeling off scotch tape from a piece of graphite. He levitated a frog under magnetic fields once for fun before that. He ended up winning the Nobel Prize for the first experiment and an IgNobel Prize for the second, Brian Clegg's  The Graphene Revolution: The Weird Science of the Ultra-thin goes into much more detail on this. All in all the message here, brilliantly argued, is this - true elites, irrespective of their eventual area of expertise, tend to engage in diverse fields early on. They are known for their curiosity and interest in seemingly completely unrelated domains and suppressing this knack in them by parents or educational institutions is a cause for worry for all of us. The world needs both specialists and generalists to progress. This book makes an excellent case for nurturing the generalists just as much as we do the specialists.Maybe the most decisive part of a candidate's C.V. from the point of view of a recruiter may not just be the 'Achievements' but one ignored by most applicants and recruiters alike - 'Interests and hobbies'"

24,0735214484,http://goodreads.com/user/show/75748905-elizabeth,5,"A generalist may know nothing about everything, but one can argue that a specialist knows everything about nothing. Today's world is increasingly specialized, but Range: Why Generalists Triumph in a Specialized World does a magnificent job of showing that broad knowledge has distinct advantages over depth. This is not an original concept, but David Epstein presents an easy-to-read compilation of innumerable anecdotes and case studies, and each holds their own as compelling. For the nerds, there's plenty of tangential trivia (Van Gogh made his greatest works only in the last 3 years of his life!) to satisfy, but Epstein also manages to elucidate new psychological perspectives on familiar subjects. He explores musicians, athletes, military, scientific researchers and inventors, and video game designers, to name a few. It would be an impossible task to cover every field, but he certainly encompasses a vast range that demonstrates his point: these fields are rife with specialists, yet generalists shine in unexpected, delightful, and vital ways. However, what struck me most was how the insight of Range hit an immensely personal note for me. Having attended one of the top public STEM highschools in the nation, I knew of parents who would start prepping their children with Kuman, admissions prep classes, and the like in 3rd grade. This is simultaneously frightening and disturbing to me. Does a 3rd grader know that they're interested in STEM? Some of Epstein's strongest points are demonstrating how the race to get a headstart can be damaging and has vast ramifications for how we raise up our next generation. My parents wouldn't let me take ice-skating lessons because they said nothing would come of it. I was 12 at the time, and that was too late in their eyes. This kind of perspective—that one should specialize early and fast to achieve success—is counter to the most fulfilling education for kids, and Epstein provides critical evidence to show the benefits of an alternative. He doesn't provide clear-cut binaries. It's not always better to have breadth rather than depth, and Epstein points out situations where specialists thrive and where specialists are essential to the functioning of generalists. Ultimately, let this book stand as a comfort to those people who don't quite know where they're going...“The precise person you are now is fleeting, just like all the other people you’ve been.” There's no need to scramble to place yourself in a narrow box because there's an important space for the generalists out there too."
25,0735214484,http://goodreads.com/user/show/732347-kelly,0,"Growing up, whenever anyone asked me what I wanted to do with my life, I'd say either something super sarcastic or ""nothing."" Because the fact we expect people to know what they want to do for their lives before they're 18, 21, 25? Is bananas. You don't know who you are or what you like or don't like yet (add in that you need experience to GET experience in today's global economy and it makes it worse). So Epstein's premise is one I really agreed with already and I found his exploration of why cross-disciplinary knowledge to be validating to my belief that together, all of our strengths solve problems better than being super specialized in a niche arena. I listened on audio at 1.5 so can't speak too much to the performance other than it worked. I appreciated the idea of ""hedgehog"" vs ""fox"" for types of people. In no way does this book say those with highly specialized skills and knowledge aren't good but rather, they also benefit from working with generalists to collaborate and solve problems outside their field -- and even within their field. Worth reading for anyone who feels the value in collaboration and a breadth of knowledge. Also great for those who, like me, like doing a lot of things and still don't know what they want to ""do"" when they grow up but are, indeed, doing something they love BECAUSE they get to apply so many of their interests and talents somewhere.

Over time I've developed an understanding that mastering one field (mine was sales) and then developing myself within adjacent fields (management, strategy, marketing, writing, public speaking) is an optimal strategy.

Since people ask me for advice on various topics like career development I need to correct myself: if I told you that you should specialize I might have been totally wrong.

We need birds and frogs working to explore it”. As indicated by the title the book argument basically revolves around how people with wide range of knowledge and diverse experience flourish in a world populated by a highly specialized people. In each chapter the author backed up this argument by either sharing a story or some studies.  I liked the opening of the book, how the author started with familiar idea going through Tiger Woods and Laszlo’s daughters successful experience of “Starting something at young age gives a head start”. Linking these stories to the “Kind environment learning” by illustrating how the same reasons behind this approach success can be turned into limitations with catastrophes sometimes when applied in other domains which required ( wicked learning). The first chapters was intriguing especially about the influence of economical and social changes on the educational system. I was highly interested in this topic and the stories he shared about scientists, NASA, Van Gogh ( gonna read his biography soon),.... . However, i got bored at the last chapters as i felt he was repeating himself and i did get the idea which was awesome: “We need broad people with at least one area of depth” which i totally agree with as the world we live in has shifted it is demands from acquisition of structured knowledge to mastery of skills aka the 21st century skills.

Debunks the general applicability of the 10000h rule and deliberate practice for knowledge work (e.g. the wicked world) and shows with a lot of case studies that often top performers are the result of a larger broad experimentation phase, followed by late specialization. I pretty much enjoyed all of them from Roger Federer, Vincent Van Gogh, Gunpei Yokoi (the Gameboy inventor), Johannes Kepler (the father of modern astronomy), Frances Hesselbein (a CEO by accident who took over the Peter F. Drucker foundation) and others.Also follows Kahneman/Tversky (Thinking fast and slow) and Chip Heath (Decisive) regarding the quality of expert forecasts and predictions. One star less because the last third felt a bit low on insights to me (mostly because I've already knew them from other books). So take the 4 stars with a grain of salt. It's a great book :)"
30,0735214484,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3250759-paul-fulcher,3,"David Epstein's Range is a follow-up to his The Sports Gene. The sub-title How Generalists Triumph in a Specialised World rather explains the book's message, and his opening example contrast Tiger Woods (already a confident and dedicated golfer by aged 2) with Roger Federer, much more of a dabbler in different sports. Epstein suggests early specialisation is generally the exception not the rule, and its value confined to certain narrow domains (he calls them 'kind' learning environments) which are reasonably predictable, and much less so in the, much more common in real-life, 'wicked' environments. In that sense the Polgar sisters are very much the exceptions that prove the rule, given the nature of the game of chess.One illustration he uses that, was personally resonant as a mathematician is that class-learned maths, often fails miserably in the real-world since problems are no longer presented neatly alongside the technique you are expected to use to solve them. So he advocates a much more explorative approach to learning, including the benefit of failing and falling-behind.The book goes on to consider a range (appropriately!) of related ideas, including suggesting that short-term planning is more important than long-term career goals. Perhaps my favourite quote in the book, related to this concept, comes from Paul Graham, the English-born American computer scientist and programmer, entrepreneur, venture capitalist, author, and essayist and co-founder of the seed money startup accelerator, Y CombinatorInstead of working back from a goal, work forward from promising situations.Although I note Graham has previously said that the ideal age to start a start-up is between 23 and 38 (http://paulgraham.com/start.html) which seems to rather go against the spirit of Range.""Range"" rather contradicts the key concepts in two other similar books in recent years, although Epstein, commendably, explains why he disagrees and indeed where the other concepts are still applicable:- the ""10,000 hours"" rule, whose origin can be traced back to Anders Ericsson's paper The Role of Deliberate Practice in the Acquisition of Expert Performance, but which was widely publicised by Malcolm Gladwell's Outliers: The Story of Success. Ericsson later published a book Peak: Secrets from the New Science of Expertise, including a clarification than 10,000 hours wasn't a magic number and focusing more on the role of deliberate practice (https://www.salon.com/2016/04/10/malc...), but Range would still take a different approach.Interestingly Gladwell himself has provided a blurb for this book: ""For reasons I cannot explain, David Epstein manages to make me thoroughly enjoy the experience of being told that everything I thought about something was wrong. I loved Range."" -- and The Tipping Point- ""GritGrit"", indeed Range advocates quitting as often the right and, in the longer-term, more productive strategy. Epstein has pointed out that the author of Grit herself suggested last year, “don’t confuse the healthy development of a work ethic with premature commitment to a singular passion,” (https://characterlab.org/tips-of-the-...) but it should be said that her comment was really confined to childhood, also commenting that ""in adulthood and even late adolescence, there are tremendous benefits to specialization,"" which Epstein would generally disagree with.Style-wise this is the usual collection of anecdotal stories and (perhaps less here than in some other books) scientific/statistical evidence, largely selected to fit the story. It was striking to me that one piece of evidence - the well-documented long-term trend of an increase in IQ scores in the Western world - was cited both by this book, and the previous non-fiction book I read, Superior: The Return of Race Science, to reach completely different (and to an extent opposing) conclusions. Slightly more unusually, several of the anecdotes use the author himself as a exemplar, which slightly grated with me.One might question why policymakers aren't focusing on introducing the techniques this books advocates, such as Superforecasting: The Art and Science of Prediction, into public policy in the UK. Of course, one person has made that his mission - the controversial Domimic Cummings (see e.g. https://dominiccummings.com/the-odyss...). But, compared to Epstein, Cummings does seem to take a rather prescriptive approach to the new techniques he advocates, particularly the greater use of statistical methods: indeed one of Epstein's most interesting case studies is on the Challenger disaster / Carter Racing business case study where Epstein argues that, contrary to the normal lesson drawn The Challenger decision was not a failure of quantitative analysis. NASA's real mistake was to rely on quantitative analysis too much.Like most such books (indeed almost all I've read) it is hard not to conclude that 80%, or more, of the useful content can be gained in 20%, or less, of the time from reading a summary or watching a TED Talk: see https://youtu.be/BQ2_BwqcFsc, and my 3.5 rating reflects this.But a worthwhile read and a very interesting concept."

33,0735214484,http://goodreads.com/user/show/111566858-greta,5,"“We learn who we are in practice, not in theory.”What is better: getting a head start and narrowing down early on a specific field or exploring different options, gathering informations in different fields ? This book teaches so much about performance, success, education and not being afraid to quit the path you‘re on, if it‘s not the best fit for you. It's perfect for all students, insecure about switching their subjects or struggling with which major to choose. David Epstein looked at the success stories of exceptional achievers in all different kind of fields and makes a strong case against narrowing down too early. Here is what this book teaches me:Specialists only get better through their extensive experience, when they work in a domain where patterns constantly repeat. Where feedback is provided easily, consequences are immediately visible and where are no unknown variables. As soon as patterns don‘t clearly repeat, feedback is delayed or inaccurate and unpredictable human behavior is involved (like in the big majority of our life’s) experts have greater difficulties to react to changing circumstances and to abstract their knowledge to solve new occurring problems. Successful adapters are circuit breakers, avoiding the same patterns. They have range.Education today is too narrow and we are not taught to interleave and apply broader concepts. The more the learner creates abstract models and the less they rely on particular examples, the better they become at applying their knowledge to abstract information. We benefit from running through a trial and error phase. We shouldn't settle down on a path that doesn't fit to us. We should sample and gather experience before we specialize.Outside the box thinking develops with experiencing different fields and being able to apply concepts from different areas of life. A head start is faster but learning is slow and short term struggle in studying leads to long term benefits. We learn better when we try to solve problems our self even if we fail completely. In school studying is too easy. Teachers give too many hints and don‘t encourage the own problem solving but rather present patterns and rules to problems that already have been solved. Rather than being able to abstract in order to solve new problems that didn‘t exists in that form before and which is the foundation of all development of science, students are only able to solve problems they saw in that form before. ""Grit"" is work ethic and resilience combined with consistency and knowing what you want. It‘s often claimed that Grit is an indicator for success, and head starters show a lot of grit. But late starters that struggled and changed their paths show to be the exceptional achievers. Learning stuff is less important, than learning about yourself. Match quality information can‘t be gathered if we don‘t explore. Those who explore and don’t narrow down, will faster gather feedback. We fail if we stick to tasks that don‘t fit to us and don‘t have the balls to quit, instead of recognizing that there are better options available for us. Before we start something we should define under which circumstances we‘ll quit and do so as early as possible. Struggling happens if we are forced on things that don‘t match to us. Consistency for the purpose of consistency isn‘t helpful and changing something increases the chances of finding the right thing.We should focus on who we are at that moment, our current motivations and interests and what we want to learn. Then we should decide what the best opportunities are in this particular situation. We should think short term instead of long term. Our work preferences stay not the same because we change and most of our personal changes happen between in our twenties. Early specialization is making a match for someone who doesn’t exist yet. We work best under an environment that suits us and we learn who we are not in theory but in practice. We should act first and then think. Test and learn and not plan and implement. Get an idea, evaluate it and eventually quit. Experimentation has advantages. Great successors also have great fails. Don‘t feel like you‘re behind, everyone progresses at a different pace. You probably don‘t even know where you‘re going yet, so feeling behind doesn’t help. Most successful people didn‘t follow a straight path either. Start to plan experiments, approach your own projects and be willing to explore as you go in your own speed. Consider abandoning your goals entirely should the need arise. A diverse group of specialists can not replace the contributions of broad individuals, because they rely on them to provide outside of the box thinking. There is nothing wrong with specialization and we all specialize to some extend. But sources of experimentation and self exploration are sources of growth, creativity, abstract problem solving and innovation.""Our work preferences and our life preferences do not stay the same, because we do not stay the same.”"

In this complex world, it's the Generalists, those who engage in diverse fields that would ultimately stay ahead. In the Outliers, Malcolm Gladwell has popularized the 10,000 hours theory. And how starting a specialized path early and doggedly sticking to it makes great athletes and innovators. In Range, Epstein is saying you don't have to agree with that.Epstein is instead making a case for dabbling in a variety of things in order to excel in one. In other words, to be a champion, a virtuoso or a Nobel laureate does not require early and narrow specialization, rather, it is those who pursue different fields that mostly ends up great achievers or innovative thinkers. It's the generalists and not specialists who are better positioned to excel, argues Epstein.The book also discusses the necessity of quitting an unfulfilling job. Though, people say ""Quitters never win"", but the research as pointed out in this book shows that quitting something that’s unrewarding or unfulfilling and moving on to something that’s a better fit makes people happier. But here's my overall impression: This is another of those books that makes a generalized theoretical conclusion from cherrypicked research findings and carefully selected success stories. In any case, I have advised myself to always take with a pinch of salt ideas propagated in seemingly opinionated books. Having said that, this book was engaging. The author's arguments are crisp, and his writing style and supporting anecdotes were engaging. And frankly, there's something different about this book from the rest. You kind of trust the author and comfortable with what he's saying.A quote from the book: ""Alexander at my age had conquered so many nations, and I have all this time done nothing that is memorable,” he supposedly said. Pretty soon, that concern was a distant memory and Caesar was in charge of the Roman Republic—which he turned into a dictatorship before he was murdered by his own pals. It’s fair to say that like most youth athletes with highlight reels, he peaked early. Compare yourself to yourself yesterday, not to younger people who aren’t you. Everyone progresses at a different rate, so don’t let anyone else make you feel behind. You probably don’t even know where exactly you’re going, so feeling behind doesn’t help""."

Here I was feeling like a failure with a variety of disconnected academic and professional experiences under my belt. There is still hope! Even better, what I've done instinctively and unknowingly can give me an edge when solving wicked problems. I got lost a few times when the author delved really deeply into the world of science research but overall I thought he used a variety of great examples from diverse fields. Like Vivaldi's orchestra women - mind boggling! Highly recommend this non-fiction read. "
36,0735214484,http://goodreads.com/user/show/14626124-noor-ali,3,"Simply put, there was nothing really exceptional about this book. It was insightful in some aspects and a number of ideas introduced by the author really managed to impress me but overall it fell flat for me. At first the book presents you with a very interesting argument but each chapter feels unfinished and lacking. The author uses examples and case studies as a method of proving his arguments in each chapter but as the book advances it gets very tedious and redundant. It took me sheer well power to finish it and I don’t think I would have managed to do so if I haven’t switched to the audiobook version (which was great btw, the narrator did a great job). Also, what I don’t enjoy about these kind of books is that they suffer from the Malcolm Gladwell syndrome. The author focuses on the thesis he is trying to prove and selectively chooses the case studies that support his points and totally ignore all the other variables and the contrary point of views. And somehow all of these authors sound like smartasses and use the same know it all tone of writing. It’s actually both irritating and baffling.Upon finishing the book, I’m still not convinced if or why generalists would triumph as the author claims. As a generalist myself, I lowkey wanted to believe what the author was trying to sell here as it would have made me feel better about my own life choices and decisions. I guess I’ll never find out or I’ll have to look elsewhere for answers."
37,0735214484,http://goodreads.com/user/show/22467646-shobhit,5,"This book resonated with me perfectly. In my profession (Software Development), there is an increasing demand for specialization. There are back end engineers, front end engineers, devops, data engineers, data scientists blah blah blah. I never felt comfortable with a label. The entire field of computer science is interesting for me. I also read a lot of books related to history, politics, biography, psychology, physics, philosophy and any well written book in general. I used to feel guilty for spending time in unrelated fields but I had made peace with it. This book gives me a new hope. It convinces me that my broad ranging interest is not a weakness but a strength. This is a feel good book if you have a diverse range of interest. It says that having range makes you more innovative. I think the people who have a broad range of interest don't do it because they are trying to be more innovative. They do it because it is fun. This is my only complain from the book. It talks about people with diverse interests from a utility point of view. It didn't even mention once that people dabble in different things for fun. "

40,0735214484,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3809399-stormin,5,"This book was amazing. It was incredibly well-written, had mind-blowing information (all of which actually made sense and was heavily backed by research), and it's going to have a big impact on my life. Honestly, a couple of parts early on in the book almost made me cry because it was like someone telling me: It's OK, you haven't missed out on all your amazing life opportunities just because you didn't start training for them when you were 5.So, here's the outline of the book.The first chapter contrasts Tiger Woods (who specialized in golf from a very early age) and Roger Federer (who played tennis young, but also played a ton of other sports and didn't specialize on tennis until much later in life). They're both dominant in their sports, and so Epstein uses them as two models for achievement: the Tiger path says you've got to start as early as possible and maximize your training in one thing. The Federer path says you should actually experiment with lots of different things and delay specialization until you find a good match.More broadly, Epstein argues that early specialization--and expertise in general--only works in ""kind"" environments. That is, systems where the rules are clear, the moves are restricted, and the feedback is immediate and obvious. Chess is a textbook example, which is why computers dominate chess. ""Wicked"" environments, by contrast, are those where the rules are unclear and/or changing, where moves are unrestricted, and where feedback can be delayed and hard to interpret. In other words: real life. From there, Epstein makes a fascinating argument that the world (i.e. the human world) is actually getting more wicked as time goes on. Premodern people only cared about immediate, day-to-day concerns. As a result, they're awful at abstraction. Some of the illusions that bend the brains of modern people don't even work on premodern people at all (like the Ebbinghaus illusion) because we (moderns) adapt to our wicket world by getting really good at abstract reasoning. This, according to Epstein, accounts for the mysterious Flynn Effect (IQ scores are rising year over year and have been for a century, but nobody knows for sure why).Epstein then talks about the benefits of cross-training, how the most effective learning is learning that appears inefficient (difficulty enhances recall, and teachers who assist their students to short-term excellence degrade their long-term prospects), the pitfalls of experience (Kepler's advances came primarily from going well beyond evidence based on analogies), the limitations of grit (refusing to quit is a bad idea if you consider the possibility that there might be something better for you to work on), the importance of outsider perspectives (even in highly-specialized research teams), the value of lateral thinking (getting the most out of obsolete technology was the genesis of Nintendo as a game company), the shortfalls of expertise (focusing on Tetlocks damning evidence that experts are truly awful at predicting the future in a wide variety of disciplines), and then what might be the most interesting to me: a chapter about learning to drop your familiar tools.That chapter was incredibly vivid, as it depicted how numerous wildfire fighters have died over the years because when told to drop their tools and run, they refuse to set down heavy packs, chainsaws, etc. and as a result can't outrun the flames in emergency situations. A similar thing happens to sailors who, even when told to discard the steel-toed shoes when abandoning ship, often refuse and drown.Epstein goes from there to the Challenger explosion. I learned the standard explanation of this in undergrad. The standard explanation says that they had all the data that they needed to realize that low-temperatures were dangerous, but they failed to look at the *successful* launches (in addition to the failures) and so didn't draw the obvious conclusion that the low temperature was going to be dangerous.Epstein has a different take. He says that they actually did look at that data, but that it's not as meaningful as people believe. The details are technical, but the point is that they really only had two relevant datapoints to tell them if the low temperature would be dangerous. Even though the two datapoints were highly suggestive, two datapoints isn't enough to draw statistical conclusions, and so the subjective evidence was discarded and Challenger blew up.It's really contrarian to say that an overreliance on hard data can be the downfall of an organization, but Epstein makes the case and he makes it well. It fits with kind of my over-arching life philosophy, which is that there are no cheat codes. By that I simply mean that there is no one rule (e.g. ""Ignore subjective interpretation and only rely on quantifiable data"") that will always be the best approach in all situations. We never get out of the trap of having to take life on its own terms, as irreducibly complex and full of unpreventable novelty.The last chapter is about deliberate amateurs, and it's a good one, too.This is a mildly anti-expertise book, but only in a sophisticated and careful way. If we've got a kind environment: let the experts do their thing. But expertise isn't a panacea, and our over-reliance on it can have disastrous consequences. If you check into the ER with chestpain, your odds of survival go up if there's a major cardiology conference and all the cardiologists are away. Why? Because they have a hammer (stents) and so everything (chest pain) looks like a nail to them. Their expertise leads to blinders leads to unnecessary treatment based on an assumption that they know more than they do.It's a liberating thesis in many ways, because it says that even if you're not a formal expert, you can--if you work hard and know what you're doing--contribute. That brings a sense of duty to it as well. We can't treat experts as modern-day priests who take the uncertainty and ambiguity out of life on our behalf. We all have a responsibility to lend our talents, our time, and our best efforts to solving problems around us, even when we don't have a specialized degree in the right field.And maybe, just maybe, I have a shot at becoming a really good fiction writer even though I didn't start writing seriously until I was 37."
41,0735214484,http://goodreads.com/user/show/22063968-saniya,4,Truly a comfort to know that doing random shit accumulates a wealth of diverse skills as opposed to single minded specialisation. i’ve never operated that way. unfortunately despite sending this book to my dad he was not convinced so cannot give it full five stars. you gotta convince a brown dad to change his opinion to make the five star cut. 
42,0735214484,http://goodreads.com/user/show/50897805-ana,5,"I do not agree with the title as the book also emphasises the importance of both worlds. The metaphor of frogs (specialists) and birds (generalists) will stay with me for a while. The latter help out building bridges across different areas of knowledge while keeping an eye towards future and innovation.And also being a fan of change, the ideas of alternating context is smth i can really relate to: you either bring new skills to an old problem; or a new problem to old skills. Wise words!"
43,0735214484,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8510035-erik-germani,3,"Like a Gladwell book, Range has a bunch of scientific anecdotes that would do well at a cocktail party. Which is perfect, because the warmly parental thesis statement is one that anyone will drink to. To wit: ""don't worry if you aren't hyperspecialized, there's value in being a generalist."" I found that advice timely, but the self-improvement monster in me didn't find a lot of red meat in here. Once I came to grips with that, I enjoyed the anecdotes for what they were. Here's a fun one: Finnish doctors gave people fake meniscus surgeries, to see if these trims were really helping patients. So they knocked them out, made incisions, did nothing to the meniscus, and sent these folks off to rehab. They had the same outcomes as people who actually got surgery!Here's one that drove me nuts. Chapter 6 is devoted to Vincent Van Gogh, but Epstein refuses to call him by his name for a full five pages, apparently to build suspense. ""The boy from the Netherlands"", as if that could be anyone but Van Gogh, is, to Epstein,""an example of match quality optimization, Robert Miller’s multi-armed bandit process come to life. He tested options with maniacal intensity and got the maximum information signal about his fit as quickly as possible, and then moved to something else and repeated, until he had zigzagged his way to a place no one else had ever been, and where he alone excelled. Van Gogh’s Grit Scale score, according to Naifeh’s assessment, was flush with hard work but low on sticking with every goal or project. He landed in the 40th percentile.""So that should indicate there is some ""TED talking"" happening in this book, but it's much more tolerable when Epstein is on his home turf of sports & science."
44,0735214484,http://goodreads.com/user/show/32547404-jasmine-sun,3,"disclosure: I definitely read this seeking confirmation bias. many, many people have encouraged me to specialize early and gain expertise (build personal brand, become more irreplaceable, etc.), but pursuing depth just doesn't suit my personality / work style / phase of life right now. after all, the point of college seems to get a 4-year break to learn broadly without the urgency of application, and I don't want to select a specific field without trying the others.given that context, this book was deeply comforting. he discusses kind vs. wicked domains, the importance of analogous knowledge, and the beginner's mindset, using examples from sports to science to gaming. at the same time, Range gave me the same frustrations as a lot of pop-psych/self-help books. it's extremely anecdote-heavy (and many anecdotes lead to the same point), and is way too long. individual success stories are nice, but how do I know that they're representative samples? and how often was the counterfactual true: inexperienced innovators messed up, or were saved from failure by domain experts? I don't think Epstein really answers these questions, adding generalization vs. specialization to the same list of endless and unresolvable debates as the 40 hour workweek.so maybe 4 stars for me and 3 for the world? or 4 if you skim :)"
45,0735214484,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2527265-david,2,"As a 20+-year-veteran of the education racket, it seems blindingly obvious to me that forcing most people to choose a career or vocation at a very early age and then setting them to endless hours of drilling is a recipe for misery. And yet, we have parents strong-arming children into violin or piano lessons at a tender age, and children committing to a particular subject area for a lifetime of study while barely in their teens. This book talks sense about this topic, admitting that while a few souls will no doubt benefit from bullied by Tiger Parents into the legendary 10,000 hours of practice, most of the rest of us will be equally-productive citizens if we just pursue what interests us within normal society-dictated parameters.On the other hand, of all the anecdotes about how someone brought knowledge from one field of endeavor into another field of endeavor, exactly none of them got their bright idea from reading a book. This was disappointing, because I still look forward to the day when some insight I got from, for example, the years long ago I wasted spent reading every short story ever written by Henry James will lead to some astonishing insight in a completely unrelated field which will both improve the world and yield an obscene pile of mazooma."
46,0735214484,http://goodreads.com/user/show/58357473-kim-elder,4,"In our increasingly complex world one is pushed to specialize early in regard to study and career and to follow the 10,000 rule when playing a sport, or learning a skill, such as playing an instrument. Epstein argues rather for broad interests and skills and late starts in specialization. There are certainly times for specialization and he does mention that, but his main thrust is supporting a generalist approach. He firmly supports his point with research and plenty of stories of successful athletes, musicians, scientists and business people who have succeeded not in spite of their generalized training but because of it. Although some of the research is a bit tedious, he makes a very compelling case, and I found the book both insightful and encouraging. His points reminded me of Charlotte Mason’s education philosophy, in particular her ideas that a child must have a ""full and generous curriculum"" (think broad) and that ""education is the science of relations"". Giving a child this broad education allows them to make connections between things. These connections are what Epstein posits allow for the generalists to triumph over the specialist."

You don't have to have it all figured out. Go deep and wide. Follow no path and connect the dots afterwards. I can dig it. However, this book falls short in that it’s easy to ascribe meaning retroactively to famous lives. For every Van Gogh. How many wandered fervently and never transcended to greatness? But I think that question doesn't make a very good book. Just be wary of books claiming to provide insight when luck is a better explanation. Don’t think that because you are doing everything differently, you are going to be famous or rich . Sometimes those who wonder are just lost. Doesn’t mean you can’t enjoy it. I do think this book strongly makes the case that there is no ""defined path,"" there is only life, and you must do your best to live in it.

But that’s not the case for range, it frames concepts in interesting ways and supplements with engaging examples. Range advocates for breadth in skills, advising against the modern workplace stress for specialization.Trying and getting good at a variety of things eventually leaves people much better even at tasks that need ‘closed skills’ such as chess or violin . When it comes to career choice he speaks of quality match and how early specialization is a risky step that doesn’t make sense to make for most people. Same goes for breakthroughs in specialized fields where an interdisciplinary approach can better aid specialized research as people with interests outside their field can apply solutions from unthinkable sources.Only comment is that it is quite a slow read and some stories could have been summarized."

52,0735214484,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5686119-book,4,"Range: Why Generalists Triumph in a Specialized World by David J. Epstein“Range” is a provocative look at the misconception that specialization and head starts are the sole source for success. Best-selling author David J. Epstein takes the reader on a journey of what it takes to succeed in a world obsessed with specialization. This stimulating 351-page book includes the following twelve chapters: 1. The Cult of the Head Start, 2. How the Wicked World Was Made, 3. When Less of the Same Is More, 4. Learning, Fast and Slow, 5. Thinking Outside Experience, 6. The Trouble with Too Much Grit, 7. Flirting with Your Possible Selves, 8. The Outsider Advantage, 9. Lateral Thinking with Withered Technology, 10. Fooled by Expertise, 11. Learning to Drop Your Familiar Tools, and 12. Deliberate Amateurs.Positives:1.	A well-written, well-researched book. Epstein has a gift of maintaining the reader’s interest.2.	A fascinating topic, why generalists succeed in a specialized world.3.	This is a fun book to read. Epstein is a gifted author that knows how to keep the reader’s interest via a combination of interesting facts and stories.4.	Plenty of studies and facts to support the author’s main arguments. “One study showed that early career specializers jumped out to an earnings lead after college, but that later specializers made up for the head start by finding work that better fit their skills and personalities.”5.	Create cognitive dissonance but in a good way. 6.	Debunks the myth that one requires a good head start to succeed. “Our greatest strength is the exact opposite of narrow specialization. It is the ability to integrate broadly.”7.	Addresses key issues in today’s society. “Flynn’s conclusion: “There is no sign that any department attempts to develop [anything] other than narrow critical competence.””8.	The paths to excellence. “The psychologists highlighted the variety of paths to excellence, but the most common was a sampling period, often lightly structured with some lessons and a breadth of instruments and activities, followed only later by a narrowing of focus, increased structure, and an explosion of practice volume.”9.	Keys bits of educational information. “Excessive hint-giving, like in the eighth-grade math classroom, does the opposite; it bolsters immediate performance, but undermines progress in the long run.”10.	Interesting concepts. ““Match quality” is a term economists use to describe the degree of fit between the work someone does and who they are—their abilities and proclivities.”11.	What conmen know. “Writer, psychology PhD, and professional poker player Maria Konnikova explained in her book The Confidence Game how the sunk cost mindset is so deeply entrenched that conmen know to begin by asking their marks for several small favors or investments before progressing to large asks.”12.	The impact of ageing. “Adults tend to become more agreeable, more conscientious, more emotionally stable, and less neurotic with age, but less open to experience. In middle age, adults grow more consistent and cautious and less curious, open-minded, and inventive.”13.	Philosophy to live by. “We learn who we are in practice, not in theory.”14.	Interesting look at innovations. “Big innovation most often happens when an outsider who may be far away from the surface of the problem reframes the problem in a way that unlocks the solution.”15.	Key conclusions. “Where length of experience did not differentiate creators, breadth of experience did. Broad genre experience made creators better on average and more likely to innovate.”16.	Forecasting. “The average expert was a horrific forecaster. Their areas of specialty, years of experience, academic degrees, and even (for some) access to classified information made no difference.” “A hallmark of interactions on the best teams is what psychologist Jonathan Baron termed “active open-mindedness.” The best forecasters view their own ideas as hypotheses in need of testing. Their aim is not to convince their teammates of their own expertise, but to encourage their teammates to help them falsify their own notions. In the sweep of humanity, that is not normal.”17.	The key to healthy organizations. “So when Geveden became CEO, he wrote a short memo on his expectations for teamwork. “I told them I expect disagreement with my decisions at the time we’re trying to make decisions, and that’s a sign of organizational health,” he told me.”18.	The power of cross knowledge. “To recap: work that builds bridges between disparate pieces of knowledge is less likely to be funded, less likely to appear in famous journals, more likely to be ignored upon publication, and then more likely in the long run to be a smash hit in the library of human knowledge.”19.	A key point of advice. “Compare yourself to yourself yesterday, not to younger people who aren’t you. Everyone progresses at a different rate, so don’t let anyone else make you feel behind.”20.	Notes included. Negatives:1.	Repetitive.2.	No formal bibliography. 3.	At the end of the day, this is not hard science. 4.	It’s hard to top his previous book, “The Sports Gene”.In summary, Epstein provides compelling arguments that support his main argument that in most fields generalists are more likely to succeed than specialists. He crosses many domains to support his main theme and does so while keeping the reader enthralled. It’s a lot of fun to read. I recommend it!Further recommendations: “The Sports Gene” by the same author, “Outliers” and “The Tipping Point” by Malcolm Gladwell, “Quiet” by Susan Cain, “Thinking Fast and Slow” by Daniel Kahneman, “Grit: The Power of Passion and Perseverance” by Angela Duckworth, “The Power of Habit” by Charles Duhigg, “Originals: How Non-Conformists Move the World” by Adam Grant, “Drive” by Daniel H.

53,0735214484,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2166820-kim,4,"Slightly different form of book review, but bear with me . . .When I was a freshman in college, some unknown force took me out of my comfort zone to an ice rink for a work study job. I signed up for the women's club hockey team and learned how to drive a zamboni. By the time I was a senior, my mother criticized me for not have worked at a law firm or doing other ""relevant"" work to being a lawyer. While I felt that I had learned so much from my experiences on the ice, all of a sudden that comment made me feel behind.When I began law school, I was surprised to learn that there was no pursuit of ""specialty"" while attending school, and that in fact your entire first year of classes was completely planned out for you. But then the minute you graduate and enter the world of working in law firms, almost immediately, by default to where you land your first job and who you work for, you end up in an area of specialization, likely to stay there your entire career. As a result of law school, I felt that the firm life for me was a not a quality match. Unlike most of my classmates, I ended up working almost immediately as an in house counsel and very little of my work involved in depth pursuit of any areas of the law, including business. And for years, I felt behind.While I never pursued the traditional career path after of law school, I have always felt that I benefited from, as they say, learning how to think like a lawyer. The Law School Admissions Exam actually tests the taker on Analytical and Logical Reasoning (as well as reading comprehension) and law school itself denies specialization (with some exceptions). I was surprised this was not really investigated in this book, or that it was not compared as a potential resource to model a new curriculum for medical school from. Maybe in the next version . . .All in all, most of my adult life I have felt behind. And then all of a sudden . . .I didn't. I enjoy my job and all the experiences I have lived through from it. I do not regret the path I took, even though it took me a long time to understand its value and appreciate it. And now, after reading this book, I feel both vindicated and encouraged to experience new things, expand my reading base (and not feel an ounce of guilt for all the fiction fare!) and meet new people. "
54,0735214484,http://goodreads.com/user/show/12086858-yousif-al-zeera,4,"This book is crucial as it seriously challenges the assumption of ""specialization"". While specialization works well in ""kind"" environments, it usually falls short when it comes to ""wicked"" environments which mostly the case in most domains. ""Well-rounded"" individuals by virtue of their ability to connect things between interdisciplinary areas are in better shape to further progress sciences and technologies. "
55,0735214484,http://goodreads.com/user/show/14551209-dan-connors,4," In many ways, specialists rule our world. If you find a niche or specialty, you've got it made. But can you take this to extremes? Can you create a chess champion by training a child from birth in chess maneuvers and little else? When does specialization work best and when do generalists shine? These important questions are looked at in David Epstein's book.  Epstein looks at the cult of the head start, which in some ways has given certain children a decided advantage in school, sports, and social situations. Starting them early and fast in certain disciplines, like a tiger mom pushing her cubs, places them above other kids temporarily. But the author says that many times the other kids eventually catch up, and given their better read on what they're capable of and what the world has to offer, eventually pass up the early achievers.  The world is broken into two types of experiences that we have to navigate. Kind ones like math, chess, and golf, play by certain rules that the more you practice the better you get. In those environments specialization takes advantage of the predictable nature of the game and maximizes results. Unfortunately, most of the world is the other type of experience- wicked. In wicked environments things are decidedly unpredictable, and what worked yesterday could be useless today. In these situations prior practice not only doesn't help, it hurts because people fall back on earlier patterns, wasting precious time before figuring out a new approach is needed. Here is where the generalists shine, because they can use their more varied experiences to synthesize new approaches.  Epstein draws from real examples of successful musicians, athletes, and artists who went through what he called a ""sampling period."" Rather than dive right in from childhood, the sampling period allows people to try their hand at a variety of activities before finally settling in on one thing. This is basically the idea behind liberal arts education, where general information about the world is pumped into ALL students so that specialists have more tools in their tool belts once they start working on problems.  The book spends a refreshing chapter on failure, changing your mind, and grit. Failing is not necessarily bad. Too many stay in bad situations rather than admit they made a mistake and discard all the training and investment they had in getting there (sunk cost fallacy). Long term goals always have to be adjusted as we grow and the world changes. Switching can be good and those that do it report it was one of the best things they ever did. There is no failure if you use the lessons from it to move forward.  The author talks about something called Innocentive, where outsiders are given problems that have stumped specialists. Their fresh viewpoint sometimes comes up with the perfect solution. This is basically the argument for diversity everywhere all the time. When you lose diversity, you narrow your options for finding the best solutions.  Specialization can fool you into thinking you know everything. You know a lot about one situation, but your brain is unaware of what else might be out there that's unexpected. This is how we got the 2008 financial crash, the Iraq war, and many other blunders. The Dunning Kruger effect has been profiled many places, and it states that people who know just a little about something can get overconfident because they don't know what else is out there. The author goes into Phillip Tetlock's research on prediction, and how specialists and experts were no better at predicting the future than anyone else in his famous study.  So what can be done about this problem? Because so much time and money is spent on creating specialists, we will always tend to listen to them, even when they might be wrong. In arenas that might be considered complex, unpredictable and wicked, we need to rely more on generalists. Generalists can pull from their varied experience and create new solutions that are unique and powerful. Specialists need to be challenged to think outside the box and not be afraid to drop their assumptions to focus on a better solution when necessary. The author tells the tragic story of firefighters who refused to drop their tool when faced with a rapidly approaching firestorm. Those that did, survived, but those that didn't were too slow to escape.   This was an enjoyable and informative book. It was thought-provoking and made me want to expand my horizons even more. None of us is capable of seeing every possibility, but diversity, variety, and creativity will help us when the unexpected happens."

One of those books where you might intuitively know about his conclusions, but it’s nice to see some reasoning behind them."
57,0735214484,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3677821-pete,4,"Range : Why Generalists Triumph in a Specialized World (2019) by David Epstein is an interesting book about the value of not being overly specialised and focused on one thing.The book starts by pointing out how Tiger Woods took up golf at an early age and how this example is picked by many as an example of how mastery of a subject needs to be done. Epstein compares this to Roger Federer who played many sports before focusing on tennis. Epstein states, with some evidence, that stars like Federer are more common than stars like Woods.Range then looks at how some tasks like chess, that have great feedback and that are well defined can be suited to specialising and diving deep into one thing. However a lot of what we value highly, like creating new companies, scientific breakthroughs, writing interesting new books and management is more 'wicked' in nature with immediate feedback being poor and requiring synthesizing knowledge for a myriad of sources.There are interesting digressions into the world of music where it's shown that many top musicians played multiple instruments with great skill and moved skills from one area to another and found new insights doing so.Epstein also talks to a number of scientists, academics, managers and people in many other roles who have had careers that moved from one area to another and he points out that this often benefited them greatly.Range is a well written, interesting book that makes its points with style. Epstein makes a strong case for trying lots of things and deliberately trying to widen our horizons. The book is also filled with interesting stories about people in many different fields. Range is well worth a read. "
58,0735214484,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5742005-siddhartha-kumar,3,"Find this review - and some more - on my website here.---------------------------------------------Started with a tightly-knit structure, but faltered at the end. The last few chapters were a slog to get through - mostly because of numerous ""business-class"" style case studies. Main takeaway? Other than the central idea around which the book revolves (and succinctly mentioned as the book subtitle too), the idea of interleaving is what struck me the most. I had already read about this particular method in Michael Nielsen's brilliant post on Anki (Augmenting Long-term Memory) and it was interesting to read about it formally in the book. Interleaving is the technique of mixing up your learning in varied environments so that it makes some unusual connections that you'd normally won't think about - and might come in handy when you are faced with a problem in a new environment you haven't previously encountered.In the end, ""Range"" suffers from the same deficiencies that a lot of other pop-psychology/self-management books suffer from - too many anecdotal evidence and case studies. A reviewer here on Goodreads summed it the best - ""Finally, Range is designed to appeal to people who are already skeptical of specialization/ enthusiastic about generalized skillsets. I worry that some of the appreciation of this book is just a soothing exercise in confirmation bias for generalists.""Still, I'd recommend it to people who (like me) are skeptical about their tendency to dabble in too many disparate fields at the same time - this might be the soothing pill that you were looking for."
59,0735214484,http://goodreads.com/user/show/51329997-christina,4,"Though the underlying hypothesis around the value of generalist experience is actually rather intuitive, I found ""Range"" to be an articulate and novel contribution to the conversation around the methodologies of success that isn't particularly prevalent today. The book does read like a very standard nonfiction book: ""hook, thesis, case study/anecdote, case study/anecdote (x100), thesis"", and the examples run on a bit longer than they need to, and sometimes don't necessarily have particularly unique messaging in each. But a lot of Epstein's messages ultimately resonate with my own life philosophies, and were helpful for some of my own thinking about my career and interests. My favorite takeaway, one that spans my views around work, relationships, friends and life in general is this: ""Start the proactive pursuit for match quality"" - and be generous to yourself in the time needed to find that match. ""Range"" is a fun read for noodlings - I recommend!A couple of my favourite quotes below: ""Our work and life preferences do not stay the same because we do not stay the same.""""You have to carry a big basket to bring something home.""""Good judges are good belief updaters.""""The best forecasters view their own ideas as hypotheses in need of testing.""""The process culminated with more concern for being able to defend a decision than with using all available tools to make the right one.""[Being ""outcome accountable""]""Compare yourself to yourself yesterday, not to younger people who aren't you.""""You probably don't even know exactly where you are going - so feeling behind doesn't help."""
60,0735214484,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1925924-catriona,5,"Experience is never wasted I found this riveting in all the best ways non-fiction can be: extremely readable, endlessly fascinating, thought provoking, leaves a lasting impression and you see the world a little differently on the other side of it - things once in darkness are illuminated. Personally, Epstein made me feel comforted that all was not lost if i hadn't completed my 10,000 hours in a highly specified domain by now and that a gradual whittling of specialism, rather than a laser focus from an early age, can be just as (if not more) likely to work to your benefit in the long run. Our world is more complicated than ever, full of ever changing and nuanced problems where analogies from other domains can help us tackle problems in novel ways (treating tumours with ancient military strategy anyone?) that can lead to greater, faster leaps in understanding and measurable progress. Epstein argues that those who haven't narrowed their experiences prematurely will provide the biggest benefit to the modern world around them, at least in terms of creative and complicated problem solving. Should the urban legend that is the 10,000 hours to greatness, finally be put to bed? Does rigid repetition of procedure make us less likely to be successful in a unfamiliar situation? I'm not sure who is right, or who is right for me - but i do know i am as inspired after reading Range as i was with Gladwell's Outliers and i reckon it deserves the same level of curiosity to be applied to it."
61,0735214484,http://goodreads.com/user/show/61808093-alexander-rivas,4,"I am so grateful this book was written because I feel that I fall in line with the thesis of how some people achieve more when they have a wide range of interests they pursue. I always battled with the 10,000-hour theory because I am the type of person that is always starting and stopping interests I have. A specific example would be the way I read books. I don't just read a certain type of books, I read all types of books, which in my opinion helps me read more and increase my joy for reading as well. That is why reading case study after case study in this book of people that don't ascribe to the 10,000-hour rule but still achieve massive success was important for me. I no longer feel bad that I don't stick to something until I master it because that path is not for everyone. It is very rare that there is only one path to anything and I think being a professional or achieving success has many paths. I have the bias of being someone that would benefit for this book and can see why others who believe in deliberate practice repeated until perfected would not agree with this book. It is always good to be aware of all the paths that why you can make a conscious decision on how you will approach your journey to success. "
62,0735214484,http://goodreads.com/user/show/76014-raghu,3,"What makes a person highly accomplished in a particular field? Is it because they are geniuses? Or Is it because they have a natural aptitude for it? Or is it because they work hard at it to the exclusion of everything else, with a single-minded devotion from a very young age? Malcolm Gladwell popularized ‘10000 hours of deliberate practice’ to reach the expert level of accomplishment. He gave Bill Gates and Bill Joy as examples. But admirers of John McEnroe and Bobby Fisher would differ saying innate genius will get you to that level, whether you toil in practice. Some others say you need to love what you do to achieve greatness. Only then your efforts will bear fruit. And then, there are scientists like Albert Einstein who started rather late in life. He did badly in a polytechnic and worked as a clerk before taking the world by storm. Parents of young children naturally concern themselves with this question. They would want to do the right thing that results in their children realizing their potential. Author David Epstein looks at whether one misses the bus if she does not zero in on a chosen field and specialize in it from a young age. He also looks at whether there are disadvantages to dabbling in multiple disciplines before choosing a domain later in life. He looks at problems that the world throws at us and identifies what one needs to solve them and innovate ideas. Epstein says that we face problems in this world in both ‘kind’ and ‘wicked’ environments. Chess, Go, golf, playing classical music, or playing Jeopardy are examples of kind environments. Here, we know the rules of the game and answers. They don’t change with time. Getting an early start and specializing in a narrow field would be highly efficient in such environments. Instinctive pattern recognition skills work powerfully in problem-solving here. Problems in economic, environmental, and political issues make up what he calls ‘wicked’ environments. A problem whose solution requires a great number of people to change their mindsets and behavior is a wicked problem. The Covid-19 epidemic is a splendid example. The rules of the game in this environment are often unclear or incomplete. There may or may not be repetitive patterns. Even if a pattern is present, it may not be obvious. We receive feedback often late, inaccurately, or both. This environment changes fast. Conceptual reasoning skills that can connect new ideas and work across contexts are necessary to negotiate this world. Broad early experience and delayed specialization are more conducive to solving problems in these environments. Tiger Woods started playing golf at two and specialized in it as he grew up. Author Amy Chua popularized the ‘tiger mom’ notion where one takes the child young and encourages her to specialize in one field, like playing the violin or the piano. Along with the ‘10000-hour deliberate practice’, this approach gained currency as the one to follow if you want to achieve greatness in a field. Epstein says that these examples show success in kind environments. But the world in which we live and face problems confronts us mostly with ‘wicked’ environments. Hence, it is important that we don’t get sucked into choosing a domain early and specializing in it. The author cautions us against the lure and illusion of a ‘head start’. He advises that we should go through an early sampling period trying out various things. In his opinion, one can start sampling even if he is 20, 30, or 50 years old. Only by trying a lot of different things, we will spot the activity that appeals to us most. Then we can focus our energies on this specific domain. Roger Federer is the prime example of this approach. He played many games till his early teens and then chose tennis as his calling only around the age of thirteen. We all know where he is today. Epstein bursts a few other myths along the way. He challenges the “winners are not quitters” maxim. That a change of interest, or a recalibration of focus, is an imperfection and competitive disadvantage is absurd. Responding to lived experience with a change of direction is equally important. It involves a particular behavior that improves your chances of finding the best match. By “quitting”, a person looks for “match quality”, which is the degree of fit between an individual’s abilities and interests and the work they do. It is important for one’s sense of fulfillment and performance. Epstein challenges the idea that experts in a narrow domain are great forecasters. He says that his research has shown they were bad at short-term forecasting, bad at long-term forecasting, and bad at forecasting in every domain! Big innovation most often happens when an outsider who may be far away from the surface of the problem, reframes the problem in a way that unlocks the solution. A vast number of anecdotal examples from a variety of fields such as sports, science, medicine, Artificial Intelligence, support the author’s thesis. This makes the book easy and engaging to read. Still, the plethora of detailed examples can get somewhat tiresome after reading half the book. I felt that the author could have argued successfully about his themes in about a hundred pages less. One could get the impression that the author is discounting specialization. It won’t be a correct assessment. Epstein says it is unnecessary to “catch them young” and start as early as 3 or 4 years old. One can take one’s time in finding ‘match quality’. However, focused attention in that chosen domain is then necessary to produce significant accomplishments. Roger Federer, once having chosen tennis, must have put in over 10000 hours in deliberate practice to become World number one. Even the eminent physicist Richard Feynman took a year off to work in Max Delbrück’s biology lab at Caltech in genetics. I am sure he worked there as a specialist. So, even though the author highlights the importance of generalists, specialization has its importance.Before I came across this book, I had always believed in a well-rounded, broad-based education, and having a variety of interests. I have also been skeptical of domain experts and their forecasting skills about the future. This book mostly seems to reinforce these views. That is why I feel this book didn’t tell me anything new or revolutionary. Still, it is well worth a read."

Specialization vs generalization is one of those topics where I've heard a lot of contradicting arguments, both side supplied by facts and captivating anecdotes. What I appreciated about this book is that it provided under what context each side can hold true. The delineation of ""Kind"" and ""Wicked"" environment provided an aha moment as to when each wisdom/axiom/perspective makes sense. There's more to the book than that, and I thought this book made a great companion to Adam Grant's Originals. A few other thoughts I wrote down that I'll take with me as lessons:- Learning is the most efficient in the long run when it is the most inefficient in the short run- Headstart comes fast, but deep learning comes slow- To fight biases, use the outside view- Let them torture the cucumber - embrace range an efficiency"

The arguments and discussions show that, especially in the new world with the constantly expanding knowledge and the new challenges that we constantly face, having a general knowledge would be a net gain in the long run. The book also touches on some other related topics, like how groups of experts regress to their old tools and procedures when facing a completely new challenge, or how group-think can reinforce beliefs and rules, which can fail when a new “out-of-distribution” challenge is faced.In the end, this book advocates a generalist approach in life, and argues that it is OK (and even necessary) to have numerous and varied interests in life."

67,0735214484,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7976341-suman,4,"By the time he retired, Sachin Tendulkar had spent over 25 years of his life playing cricket. He started early (remember the famous picture of the kid Sachin in black & white), peaked early (debut at 16) and stayed on top for the rest of his career. Malcolm Gladwell once exampled folks like Tendulkar and theorized that specialist geniuses seemed to fit into a pattern. They spent 10,000 hours of their life practicing the same thing. These people specialized early and exhaustively until they got really good at it. The 10,000 hour theory got a lot of traction. Once the world wore the 10,000 hour glasses everything and everyone clarified into an easy explanation within this theory: Mozart fit into the 10,000 hour spectrum; Tiger woods too. Except of course, it did not explain everyone. Let's take the example of a well known tennis player covered in the book. As a boy this person played squash, dabbled in skiing, wrestling, swimming and skate-boarding. He also played basketball, baseball, table tennis, badminton, soccer and some tennis at school. The point is that he didn’t start playing tennis exclusively until it should have been too late. By the time he got serious about tennis, others his age had coaches focussing on them. It didn't matter. Roger Federer is still playing tennis at the highest level, long after his peers have retired. The world it seems, doesn’t always need specialists specializing early and then staying there for the rest of their lives. That hyper specialization has its shortcomings has been covered in other popular books before. In Thinking Fast and Slow Nobel prize winning psychologist Daniel Kanheman included examples on how specialists were sometimes encumbered by an inside view. What is it, you ask? Hyper specialization trained specialists on specific circumstances that became their experience pool. When confronted with a new situation, these experts depended on drawing from that experience pool, forgetting that such experience was finite. This is the fallacy of the inside view. Epstein covers this in a complete chapter called Thinking Outside Experience quoting Kanheman’s specific research. In this sense Range is a book for our times: it is non-fiction, peppered with catchy examples built on an edifice of hard reliable research. Oh, and it provides easy to do solutions. One way to avoid the inside view is to use as many analogies comparing the problem to experience outside of your current experience. It helps you move away from surface similarities to identify deep structural similarities with other problems or solutions. Epstein is exhaustive in his attack on specialization and in championing the cause of generalization. Just take a look at the chapter titles: The Cult of the Head Start, How the Wicked World was Made, When Less of the Same is More, Learning Fast and Slow. These first four chapters cover the childhood of a generalist, highlighting the need for their necessarily slow pace of learning (head starts only train you to pick patterns, they don’t teach you how to learn), the case for a wide base of learning (skills learnt in activities never go waste. Musicians who learnt to play many instruments before honing in on one, usually accomplished more) and the reason why all this is important while stepping out into a wicked world (the ability to think in abstract terms is a skill that distinguishes a simple world from a complex one). Perhaps having identified himself as a generalist, Epstein champions the cause too fervently, making you wonder if there is some cherry picking of facts going on. But I did find myself going on, for this is an engaging read. It is filled with examples ranging from Vincent Van Goghs pre-painting life to the outsider status of the Nobel Prize winning Chinese national Tu Youyou, who won the prize in 2005 for her discovery of Artemisinin, used to cure Malaria and who was known as the professor of three nos: NO post graduate degree, NO membership in a science academy and NO research experience outside China. Even his tools come through examples: like in the chapter Lateral Thinking with Withered Technology he examples the legendary game designer of Nintendo who being a tinkerer often used existing tech as a starting point to make something new where engineers would have gone for shiniest new tech. However, I often wondered when Epstein would get to the overarching question of why? Why should anyone: you, me or anyone, generalize? Often I had the sense that Epstein measured the usefulness of his ideas by how successful they were. Even when he talks of rank amateurs failing initially, there is a sense that the story will have a happy ending. This was a paradox for me, for while suggesting that immediate success should not be a driver for choosing a profession or path, Epstein was simply pushing the measurement of success to a later date: a more convenient time. But such advice ran counter to his own examples. Vincent Van Gogh could not have chosen to be unsuccessful today simply to be ultra successful tomorrow. Those measures could not have mattered to him. So I chose to draw my own conclusions. It pays to generalize because at a practical level the world is always more complex than previously mapped. At a poetic level the world is fascinating in all its areas. That alone should be a reason enough to be an explorer, to be a generalist. "
68,0735214484,http://goodreads.com/user/show/51634776-dax,4,A great counter piece to the daily productivity books preaching ascetic deliberate practice as the only route to success.
69,0735214484,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4925589-cyn,3,"When I contemplate books like Range (or Blink or Quiet or any book that looks at how people think and operate), I often find myself contemplating whether or not they offer any true value to society. Or really, if they even succeed at what they set out to accomplish. In my experience books like this often make for interesting and enjoyable reads, but only that. At best, they may bring attention to some aspects of science the layperson doesn't think about, but at worst, they're self-help books masquerading as pop-science, looking to justify the insecurities and quirks of every day people. This isn't to say that books like this aren't valuable, but they often don't succeed in what they preach, especially when there are far more successful examples in the genre (think Nudge or Misbehaving). The question then becomes -- are books that don't succeed creating more a disservice to people by lulling them into a false sense of knowledge or education that's actually inaccurate, lacking in nuance, or just plain wrong? I imagine this comes down to personal opinion, and I certainly know mine.While Range is certainly a thought-provoking and intriguing read, it should come with a disclaimer, lest people not recognize it as the pile of confirmation bias without any sense of subtlety that it is. Anecdotal stories make for strong narrative, and there's no doubt Epstein is a compelling writer, but the cherry-picking of research and situational experience leads this story into dangerous territory of blind belief rather than true cognizant exploration of an area. Perhaps it's that Epstein is a writer and journalist rather than a researcher, but with an educational background in science it's incredibly frustrating that he often comes close to identifying his own confirmation bias, then seemingly hides it away before it can interrupt the crux of his narrative. While there's obviously citations at the back of the book that readers can pick apart at their leisure, it feels detrimental if not downright criminal of Epstein to cite studies and situations with the expectation that readers either do their own research or take him at his word. For sure, it mirrors the irresponsibility of science writers, who often cite research as truth without offering context or detail as to sample sizes, significance, comparative studies or replicated studies for readers to understand whether the finding is truly significant or just a statistical anomaly further founded by poor research design methods. It's egregious throughout, with Epstein giving minimal opportunity for counter thought, made worse when it's clear that many less cynical readers will likely take what's on page for the pure truth rather than thinking critically about the opinion being sold. All that critique said, it's not hard to understand why so many people enjoy this book. It offers insight (no matter how unproven) into a subject important to nearly any human ""non-elite."" That is, it helps us ask the question (and understand) of why some people are more ""special"" than others. Is it our fault we're not ""specialized"" or at the top of our group in something, and therefore considered highly successful? Citing the terrible ""10,000 hours"" research in passing (Can we please stop referencing this one? It's so incredibly flawed) Range argues that generalizers see more benefit in the long run. The generalization the book sinks into itself is mostly simplified stories aiming to give hope of ""success"" to the masses while failing to cite other potential external factors, lest we all forget that even if he is a ""generalist"" in Epstein's terms for coming to tennis late, Roger Federer would have likely found equal success in any sport he chose, not just because of exposure, but he's an incredibly athletic and dedicated individual who operates above the average. This seems to the case of most of the generalist success stories cited in the book. Epstein cites a number of exceedingly talented and successful people, but we must ask if its less perhaps because they have broad interests and more because they are the kind of people who would be talented at anything that they do because of a certain combination of other personal traits and qualities. There's no proper measure for this to be sure, so while Epstein may be fine saying so as it supports his argument, the lack of any justifiable, measurable, and testable proof leaves me skeptical. Epstein does offer some decent insights into quitting, but it's also possible the most dangerous takeaway in the book. While like Epstein, I believe a lot of parents force children into hobbies and activities without letting them quit or try new things, Epstein's view borders on absolutist. There are a number of things people do throughout life that they want to quit and are likely forced to upkeep. But sometimes the skills and experience acquired should out-value that personal needs. It may not lead to ultimate success in the field, but being forced into things in formative years can help children in the long run. An example -- a woefully shy child, I hated two things: Public speaking and karate. And yet I was often forced to do both. As an adult I'm not great at either. I have learned to enjoy both. But most importantly I learned a number of valuable skills and adopted some important attitudes I would not have had I not been exposed to these avenues. Similarly, while parents should exercise caution when managing their child's activities in forcing them to do something, they should think carefully about what they take away from them by letting them quit something too soon, else they miss out on the valuable award of an experience because they didn't go through one particular difficult time. Ultimately, Range alarmingly succeeds in a field that it actually should fail in. That is, its a compelling story that appears to have convinced a number of people (at least, based on reviews) that it's underlying point is true, despite a lack of evidence. Meanwhile, it doesn't offer the benefit of proper exposure to a subset of study most people aren't typically exposed to. In this missed aim, I think Epstein captures his own failure in this regard in one of his narratives. The difference between succeeding in Jeopardy and curing cancer is that in Jeopardy we know the question. Similarly, Epstein seems entirely unsure of the real question (is it why generalists succeed? Or should it be DO generalists succeed?), and thus can't adequately address it. As for Epstein himself-- if his goal was to write a best seller, then it can be posited he's seen great success. if it was to educate, then he's sorely missed the mark. "
70,0735214484,http://goodreads.com/user/show/50034389-kyle-vanetten,5,"I wanted to put a review in to say that I am giving this 5 stars for 2 main reasons - 1) I enjoy any book that has good illustrations, stories, and generally engages me in parallel ideas to compliment its own points. As a speaker, I found myself jotting down interesting notes from stories and studies that I might use someday in my own teaching. And 2) I think the idea of specialization as the best way is one that was pretty ingrained in me growing up that always contradicted what I felt internally. I was the kind of kid and student that wanted to play as many different sports as possible, and I have never been content to focus in one area of study (but have always admired those who can/do). It was liberating in a way to hear a counter-argument to the accepted norm of hyper-specialization. As someone who also works in the church, I think hyper-specialization is also an issue for the way we train our leaders and in turn lead the institution of the church, and I think the idea of this book translate well to that context as a corrective."
71,0735214484,http://goodreads.com/user/show/16891475-samantha,4,"A compelling examination of the case against specialization within a fascinating variety of disciplines. The argument in favor of a generalist approach and against specialization in sports has long been debated. After hearing the author of Range speak expertly on this particular facet of the topic, I was desperate to see the theory in its more expanded form in the book, where it would be applied across multiple disciplines. The result is a mixed bag, though largely positive. Some of the disciplines Epstein chooses to focus on are both fascinating to read about and provide excellent examples of the theory he is seeking to prove. I found the sections on the figlie del coro, Nintendo, and the Carter Racing problem to be especially interesting to read and demonstrative of the theory Epstein is postulating.Some other disciplines discussed felt less rewarding. In some cases this is because the topic wasn’t personally of interest. The book is mincingly precise and a tad dry, so it stands to reason that any topic which doesn’t grab you personally might drag a bit in the reading. I didn’t factor that into my overall feelings about the book, because it’s not the author’s responsibility to cater to my specific areas of interest. Where he does lose me at times is in the sections where the argument he makes almost appears to support the opposite perspective. One might assume exception that proves the rule and whatnot, except that it happens multiple times in the book and isn’t presented as such. It’s a minor gripe in terms of the pleasure of reading the book and the quality of information included, but a larger one when related to the overarching theory the author is seeking to prove. In all I mostly enjoyed this. It’s not terribly dry or difficult to parse, and while some sections fail to compel, the book mostly delivers both as an entertainment product an as an information source.*I received an ARC of this book in exchange for an honest review.*"

generalist
. I was on a university search committee (holding a place for my boss) and the candidate simply stated, ""I am a generalist."" It was 1989. The word jolted me; like he was proud of what seemed to me a deficiency. Epstein, whose writing recalls Malcolm Gladwell, delves into the paths of athletes, musicians, engineers, and others, looking at evidence that seems counterintuitive relative to early specialization.

Range builds a solid case for why folks who have a broader knowledge of many-a-thing tend to triumph over those with very specialized knowledge on one thing. I personally hadn't read any books/articles/studies or whatnot that came to this generalization trumps specialization conclusion before, so it was an interesting viewpoint to mull over and learn more about. My favorite chapter was Learning to Drop Your Familiar Tools, which starts out by presenting the famous BSchool case, Carter Racing. I worked on this case when I was in Bschool, so I was all too familiar with the premise of it. Essentially, the decision a group of students needs to make is whether or not fictitious Carter's race car should compete in the biggest race of the season, which is happening in one hour from the time the case is handed to the students. The pro-race reason is prize money and fame (duh) and the anti-race reason is engine failures that don't have a clear root cause. After some debate, most students will decide to go forth and race, but that's when the professor will give the big reveal: 1. all of the information was not automatically handed out, and it was up to the students to ask for a key dataset that was available but that wasn't given outright and that 2. Carter Racing is actually an analogy for the Challenger shuttle launch, which tragically exploded in 1986, killing seven people. It's supposed to teach students the dangers of jumping to conclusions when you don't have all of the data, and it certainly worked on me. But Epstein took it a step further and really blew my mind with this spoiler:(view spoiler)[The data was more ambiguous than the case leads students to believe, because in the Challenger, the O-ring failures (which is the equivalent of an engine failure in Carter Racing) were of two different varieties - erosion, which was not deadly, and blow-by, which was. In conclusion, ""The Carter Racing study teaches that the answer was available, if only engineers looked at the right numbers. In reality, the right numbers did not contain an answer at all. The Challenger decision was truly ambiguous."" Mind. Blown. (hide spoiler)]I really dug a lot of Epstein's stories and found them quite fascinating, even if I'd heard a solid handful of them via Podcasts over the years (Epstein must be a This American Life and Freakanomics fan too!). But I wasn't convinced of Epstein's main argument: that generalization is usually better. He definitely gave examples of some pretty smart and famous folks that got to where they are/were thanks to generalization - Roger Federer, Charles Darwin, Johannes Kepler, Vincent Van Gogh, and (oh, haaay!) David Epstein. Buuuut he also gave examples of some pretty smart and famous folks who thrived being specialists too - like Tiger Woods and Some Chess Champion Who's Name I've Forgotten. And although the stories were interesting and fun to read, it really felt like as stretch to say that they backed up the author's point about generalization being better. For example, there's a story about an Olympic athlete and a muscular dystrophy patient who have the same genetic mutation. It's a great story! But does it really conclude that generalization is better? I guess if squint at it really hard, it might?The most disappointing part of this book is the conclusion, titled Expanding Your Range, which is a whopping 4 pages long. After reading 286 pages of stories that kinda-sorta backed up Epstein's point of how generalization triumphs, I was thinking okay... and? What am I supposed to do with this information, exactly? What does this mean for me? I was hoping for Epstein's take as to how our society as a whole could shift towards gaining and utilizing more generalized knowledge, but that's not what I got. ""Approach your own personal voyage and projects like Michelangelo approached a block of marble, willing to learn and adjust as you go, and even to abandon a previous goal and change directions entirely should the need arise."" Um. Gee, thanks."
78,0735214484,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7154232-phil-sykora,5,"If you want to get better at anything, this book has some important advice for you.If you're on Goodreads and you're into this type of book, you might recognize me as the guy who wrote that 
Peak: Secrets from the New Science of Expertise
 review, so you might be thinking it's blasphemous for me to say that I like this book, since I benefited so much from deliberate practice.To that, I'd argue David Epstein isn't exactly attempting to dismantle K. Anders Ericsson's research. You can still benefit from both; Epstein is just reframing the fields to which deliberate practice applies. In his  interview on the Art of Manliness podcast, he said that ""deliberate practice is great, you should do deliberate practice."" In Range he describes multiple instances where organizations and teams have prospered because of the ""frogs and the birds;"" that is, the specialists and the generalists. This isn't about the evils of deliberate practice. This is about acknowledging the importance of dabbling in a wide variety of fields so that you can find the right fit. He's just saying that, in fields where feedback isn't immediately obvious, there are a host of other factors that influence success. And I think he's right.I used deliberate practice to study short stories and grammar. I made flashcards out of every single term in the back of the McGraw-Hill Handbook of English Grammar and Usage and I tore apart short story collections by Neil Gaiman, Stephen King, and Kurt Vonnegut, making notes in the margins and sometimes literally memorizing entire paragraphs (particularly ""Changes"" in Gaiman's Smoke and Mirrors, which is a masterpiece, but I doubt I could recall a word today). In time, this type of deliberate practice -- or narrow specialization -- turned me into a published short story writer.But, unfortunately, the short story market isn't very big. Using deliberate practice to get better at short stories and grammar made me better at short stories and grammar, but it didn't transfer to a whole lot else. I needed another way to pay the bills in the meantime. (Before I have the necessary life and literary experience to become a #1 New York Times Best-Selling Author, that is.)I'm now a freelance writer who works on a variety of different projects: ghostwriting articles about different real estate financing options, interviewing hard-working retail workers for MIT, technical writing for a water softening company, and copywriting for a premium cigar service, among others. It's not always the most interesting or consistent work in the world -- and there are certainly days I wished I had gone into programming so I could be retired by now -- but at least I get paid to write. That's a lot luckier than most.My point, though, is what do you notice about all those projects above? Besides the fact that they all contain words, they're completely different. It's like when, in Range, Dartmouth business professor Henrich Grieve wanted to study the best comic book authors, he found:""The answer (in addition to not being overworked) was how many of twenty-two different genres a creator had worked in, from comedy and crime, to fantasy, adult, nonfiction, and sci-fi. Where the length of experience did not differentiate creators, breadth of experience did.""There's something to be said about writing book reviews and short stories and content for cigar companies, just as there's something to be said about writing in every genre you can. The world is changing rapidly every day, and there's no telling what the future has in store. By working in a variety of fields, you improve your ability to adapt -- which is probably more important than being insanely good at just one thing.Besides the main idea of Range, though, there are so many fascinating anecdotes that make it worth reading: the figlie del coro of 18th century Venice, for example, NASA's numbers-oriented work culture, and Epstein's own rags-to-riches story as a small 800m runner in college.Just a genuinely good book. Maybe the best I've read this year."

The author does not fall into the trap of being preachy and promise some lofty life transformation post reading this book. Instead, he takes us on a journey through the lives of a few people and organisations to drive home his point of importance for both generalists and specialists. In a world where everything seems to be about deeper specialization, he believes that innovations can be unravelled by just lifting your head and looking at things happening in the other trench. In particular, the chapter that delves into organisational behaviour through a deep dive into NASA will be among some of the top chapters I have read in recent times. Although I might be contradicting myself here, I felt that maybe just a sense of direction on how one can master the art of analogies would have been super helpful to readers interested in taking the first step towards being a generalist.

There’s a glorious simplicity in them, and we applaud the focus and dedication of these superhuman achievers. It can leave those of who us can’t lay claim to such single-minded commitment feeling like under-achievers. If you’re more of a generalist, if you try out lots of different sports or even careers, you can’t expect real success in any of them, right? Wrong. Drawing in stories from many different fields – sports, science, education, art, the military – Epstein shows a consistent principle at work: those who can draw on a broad base of experience, who can make connections outside the specialization of their field, are consistently those who solve the world’s most wicked problems. Child prodigies may excel in skills such as golf, chess or music, but in the messy real world, full of ‘wicked problems’, over-familiarity, repetition and pattern-matching can only take you so far, and sometimes it can be disastrous: Epstein gives the graphic example of experienced firefighters dying in a forest fire because when things went unexpectedly wrong it simply didn’t occur to them to drop the 100lb-plus of tools they carry so they could run away more quickly. They saw their tools as essential to their usual fire-fighting routing, and they couldn’t drop the tools of their expertise even when they were clearly not serving them. It’s a powerful metaphor for a cognitive limitation that afflicts most specialists facing a wicked problem. He makes an important point about creativity, one of the most highly-valued skills in a disrupted world, as machines become more capable of taking on routine tasks. Creativity consists of making new connections, and to make a new connection requires experience beyond the domain at hand: ‘Modern work demands knowledge transfer: the ability to apply knowledge to new situations and different domains. Our most fundamental thought processes have changed to accommodate increasing complexity and the need to derive new patterns rather than rely only on familiar ones.’He also has good news for anyone who’s ever quit – a course, a career, a relationship: sometimes, he argues, quitting is the absolutely right thing to do as you accumulate more data about yourself. The ‘Never give up’ mantra has merit, but it can also blight lives: it may well be that in giving up one path for another, the lessons you take with you become your superpower. One point Epstein doesn’t make explicitly is the case for the value of the humanities in a world that currently values ‘hard’ subjects, those that can be immediately and obviously linked to profitable outcomes, even though research consistently shows that schools that prioritise ‘soft’ subjects like music and art see improved results across the curriculum as well as better engagement and social skills. I hope educational policy makers are reading and taking note. It’s a well-written book packed with engrossing (if occasionally over-worked) stories and making an important and timely point – it does occasionally feel as though the focus is more on the stories and less on the point, but that’s a minor irritation. Perhaps a more fundamental problem is that he fails to address the elephant in the room: for every brilliant unlikely connection there are thousands of unhelpful ones. A bit more guidance on maximising the chance of finding the useful connection up front rather than simply recognising it in hindsight would have been welcome... "

This coincides with my love of trivia and jeopardy. Also, my admiration of those who have ""range"" (Grandma Davis who could undoubtedly butcher a farm animal and sew a lavish prom dress all in the same day, an ortho surgeon who also plays in his own rock band, my Oxford-educated high school English teacher when she casually mentioned she was certified in bovine artificial insemination.) This has also lead me to believe that I am missing something--- so many friends and family are very good at one thing or have chosen a very specific career/educational path. I have trouble holding interest in just a couple things, preferring to be a jill of all trades; mistress of none. So yeah, not writing a book review, but just leaving you with thoughts about why I chose the book and why I liked it. :) This has long-been one of my favorite quotes:""A human being should be able to change a diaper, plan an invasion, butcher a hog, conn a ship, design a building, write a sonnet, balance accounts, build a wall, set a bone, comfort the dying, take orders, give orders, cooperate, act alone, solve equations, analyze a new problem, pitch manure, program a computer, cook a tasty meal, fight efficiently, die gallantly.

I was persuaded, but when my daughter was born, I had a decision to make. Do I put a chessboard in her crib? Do I lock her in her room with a Latin textbook? Do I sign her up for piano lessons or put her in gymnastics before she can walk? No judgment to those parents who've taken this course, but I went the other way. I allowed her to be a kid. Try a bit of everything, decide for herself what she likes. Enter David Epstein. Epstein challenges the pop-wisdom that specialization counts for everything. Sure, Tiger Woods and all, but golf isn’t like life. Most things are more complex, and the broader our experience, the better equipped we'll be. This is very intuitive on reflection, and it validates my instincts with my daughter. Glad I ran into this book. Notes:recommended by Holy PostLibrary Challenges the idea that ""perfect practice"" or ""1000 hours"" leads to greatness. instead this only works in pattern-based things like golf or chess. Our greatest strength is the exact opposite of narrow specialization. It is the ability to integrate broadly.

(52)In totality, the picture is in line with a classic research finding that is not specific to music: breadth of training predicts breadth of transfer. That is, the more contexts in which something is learned, the more the learner creates abstract models, and the less they rely on any particular example. Learners become better at applying their knowledge to a situation they’ve never seen before, which is the essence of creativity. (76)for learning that is both durable (it sticks) and flexible (it can be applied broadly), fast and easy is precisely the problem. (85)Reposition was less important than struggle (89)the most successful problem solvers spend mental energy figuring out what type of problem they are facing before matching a strategy to it, rather than jumping in with memorized procedures. In that way, they are just about the precise opposite of experts who develop in kind learning environments, like chess masters, who rely heavily on intuition.

85,0735214484,http://goodreads.com/user/show/88872320-andrew-norton,4,"Specialisation is a key feature of the modern era. Nobody can perform all the tasks needed to support a complex society and economy. Few people are competent in more than a tiny percentage of them. Most develop narrow clusters of skills and knowledge, in which they became relatively competent and efficient. This division of labour’s contribution to economic wealth was a key insight of Adam Smith’s Wealth of Nations published nearly 250 years ago, and it remains true today. But specialisation has drawbacks as well (as Smith also argued), and David Epstein’s Range: How generalists triumph in a specialised world is a clearly-written journalistic contribution to that literature (though I find feature-article storytelling a little tiring at book length). Epstein highlights specialisation’s limits for creativity and problem solving. Narrow but well-developed knowledge and skills can deal well with situations that are routine or resemble previously-solved problems. But narrow expertise can be inadequate or dangerous in other circumstances. Epstein provides many examples of how generalists – or perhaps more accurately people with some significant experience outside of the most-obvious specialisation – can provide the fresh thinking needed for innovation and problem-solving. Range is being promoted as an argument against the ’10,000 hours’ of practice needed to achieve success in a field. It may reassure obsessive parents that they don’t need to start their kids very young in a specific sport, musical instrument or whatever for them to be successful as adults. But this is not really an argument against specialisation, but instead against premature specialisation. Epstein makes the sensible point that trying lots of things can teach us what we are good at and what we enjoy and can persist with. But people who need to work for a living must at some point stop self-discovery and start specialising. Although a specialisation may not last for an entire working life, well-paid jobs can rarely be done without significant education and experience. But Epstein is right that the more specialised we become in our work the harder it can be to see other ways of looking at what we are doing, or how our activities into a bigger system. This book appealed to me in part because a few years ago I came to the conclusion that my own work was suffering from these problems. Since then I have made much more of an effort to read widely outside my major specialisation."
86,0735214484,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8200244-megsie,4,"Chicken soup for the polymath's soul! I VERY much enjoyed this book, and honestly I was not expecting to, given that the pull-quote on the front is from Malcolm Gladwell and I cannot stand Malcolm Gladwell. This book is a gentle, good-humored, deliciously dorky exploration of the ways that people learn, discover, innovate and create that don't follow the linear paths we have come to expect. As a science person chronically insecure about not having specialized early enough, or focused hard enough on one topic, this book totally boosted my confidence and made me feel great. I feel like usually when people write books about a ""phenomenon,"" research is directed at that phenomenon like a firehose and what comes out is a very boring book that hits the same point one million times. This book is playful; there are lots of fun stories and none of them are like, ""you should be like this one very creative man!"" Instead they're like, ""hey look we all have different paths and taking a meandering one is fun and enjoyable, and may also lead you to a great discovery!"" He keeps sight of the importance of joy and experimentation, two things I love about science (and music!) that it is easy to lose sight of when you're immersed in academic culture.Anyway, it was good. I subtracted one star for being reminded of Malcolm Gladwell on the cover, for some sections at the end that compared ""thinking outside the box"" to some decision analysis scenarios that I don't think are a great parallel, and for comparing a psychology experiment to Beyoncé (we shall never speak of it again).I received a complimentary copy of this book from the publisher through a Goodreads Giveaway. Enter the giveaways, folks! They're fun!"
87,0735214484,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9146810-paul,3,"Range by David Epstein promotes the idea of learning and experiencing broad experiences and education over the idea of narrow focus. Epstein bases this hypothesis on the fact that most of today's jobs and skills have patterns that are hard to discern and where feedback is difficult to receive. These are called ""wicked"" environments and he believes that having a broad education and skills in many different areas will set the individual up for more success later down the road. In other words, the more experiences you have, the more experience you will use to analyze situations to become successful. The narrow focus of specializing in something for 10,000 hours in order to be great at it works but only in certain fields. When it comes to getting a job, inventing something, or discovering something meaningful, using the experience from many avenues of life is more inclined to deliver success. The book is told in a case study fashion where he takes diverse examples of individuals that took the broad range approach and were successful with it. Overall, I think that the way that Epstein wrote the book is approachable, scholarly, and easy to digest. It does get a little repetitive though. Do I think that Epstein has a point? Yes, of course, he has a point, but it all relies heavily on the desired outcome of the individual. The meticulous practice of a very narrow skillset will produce results in that given field just as a wide range of learning will give results in more ""wicked"" fields. I think what Epstein is encouraging the readers to do is to think about their path in life and how we might think differently in accomplishing those goals. He is also speaking to the people that fail often, that failure is a part of growth and the journey. Just because an individual doesn't stick with a passion wholely for their entire life doesn't mean they won't be successful in something else later in life. A good book that is worth a read or a listen that gets a little repetitive and maybe doesn't take into account all the different variables of how people become successful in what they do. Basically, whether you are a specialist or a generalist, the key is to not give up, and keep growing and learning. "
88,0735214484,http://goodreads.com/user/show/908968-ryan,5,"In this world of increased specialization, we believe that narrow focus on one activity or field of study is the best way to be productive, successful, and contribute to society. “Range” by David Epstein argues against these ideas and makes the case that generalists are more successful and make more contributions than specialists.I’ve always thought of myself as a bit of a dilettante, with undergrad degrees, advanced degrees, work outside of these fields, and even different hobbies. I took pride that I was a “Renaissance Man” and that I had a wide experience and view of the world. However, I secretly wondered if this approach hurt my success. I was so encouraged to read this book that argues that truly successful people are generalists who combine different views, ideas, and areas of study to make great leaps in advancement for society.Epstein uses a number of examples from sports to science to illustrate his point. When we specialize, studies have found, that we focus so narrowly that we don’t get outside viewpoints and the resulting echo chamber prohibits real advancement. By combining different experiences and ideas, we can get true innovation and real advancement. The author then explains that this will be more important in the future. Computers and automation will soon take over all of the repetitive, specialized skills and do it better. But generalists will be able to cross different areas of humanity to create truly new ideas and invent more solutions to problems facing us.I thought that “Range” was a great book with a lot of interesting anecdotes and compelling insights. It was recommended by Austin Klein and Ryan Holiday on their year end lists of best books. I agree with their recommendation and I think this book is encouraging to anyone who has diverse interests and didn’t follow a clear path. ★★★★★ • Audiobook / Hardcover • Nonfiction • Listened to Audiobook on Scribd, borrowed from the San Jose Public Library. ◾︎"

Its thesis, however, is an interesting one, which Epstein hammers through with numerous case studies. Of course, it suffers from the usual drawbacks of the genre: stretched analogies, culling of detail in service of the Narrative, limited discussion of scientific evidence, if at all. That said, even in this sphere, Epstein strikes me as one of the more sensible ones, having, among other things, debunked Gladwell’s 10,000 hour rule though his earlier work. tl; dr: excellent anecdotes, limited life applicability.

90,0735214484,http://goodreads.com/user/show/26825646-isabella-zink,5,"I read a lot of popular science books, and this was definitely one of the more interesting ones. Not only did I actually learn a lot of new information (many of the other books I’ve read cover the same studies), on a personal note it definitely brought some relief for my own anxieties. I’m one of the those people who seems to switch interests at the drop of a hat, although if you look closely you can see how they are related. When I read Duckworth’s  Grit , I questioned whether or not I was a gritty person due to the fact that my interests varied from year to year. I couldn’t really tell whether or not I was quitting something because it was hard, or if I was moving on because it wasn’t a real interest match. After reading this book, I’m much more inclined towards the latter attitude. I’ve been reluctant to commit to one specific thing for the sake of ‘stability’ (or a cost-sunk fallacy) because I don’t want to miss out on something else that may fit me way better. This idea of sampling interests suits me just fine for the moment. On some levels, this book also sort of contradicts Cal Newport’s book  So Good They Can’t Ignore You  which discourages readers from ‘following their passions’ and instead demonstrates how to make the most of your life/job by growing to love what you do. He argues that you shouldn’t expect to find a ready-made job based on your passions; instead, your passion follows from hard work and experience. In Epstein’s book, he takes the stand that sampling many different things is the best way to go. While working at something else to pay the bills (or something that actually is interesting in its own right), explore other paths through hobbies, and maybe start over in school or in a new career. Overall, I prefer Epstein’s idea about sampling until you find what works for you. Maybe intensely commit to something for a short period of time (hello micro-fixations my old friends) or dabble at something on the weekends. That seems like a much more fun way to live than pouring all of my energy into something I may grow to like more because I’m loathe to lose my head start. "

So, this review might suffer from confirmation bias. :)Around the world, early specialisation is a favoured strategy to discover your life's work. You'd be invariably told to find 'what you want to do in life' as soon as possible and then double down on it. Well, this strategy might not be optimal. It is okay to take your time trying out different things before deciding how you want to contribute to the world. The book is full of examples where people with 'range', i.e. multiple perspectives were able to solve problems which the domain experts were not able to solve. Stories where some 'outsider' made a contribution to a field because being an outsider gave them freedom to be actively open minded about problem statement. The author advocates that world need specialists as well as people who can connect the dots and see the forest in addition to the trees.In a world, where people carry humanity's knowledge in their pockets, you need more people who have range in their thinking.This book is also a ""calm-down-it's-okay"" message for people who focus on one thing maniacally until they find next thing to focus on.

They “broaden the curriculum and produce students with a deeper understanding of the material.” It also made their courses more difficult and frustrating, as evidenced by both the students’ lower Calculus I exam scores and their harsher evaluations of their instructors.""Also this:""In one of Kornell and Bjork’s interleaving studies, 80 percent of students were sure they had learned better with blocked than mixed practice, whereas 80 percent performed in a manner that proved the opposite.""This is pretty cute:""In crisis, Swanson saw opportunity. He realized he could make discoveries by connecting information from scientific articles in subspecialty domains that never cited one another and that had no scientists who worked together.

He shows how people who follow non-linear career/skill paths often thrive later in life. I thought there were a couple of profound insights into understanding “calling” as it relates to ministry. Is any calling – whether to medicine, law, or ministry – so great that it can supersede natural human development and change? Epstein argues that calling is much more fluid. How can we predict how circumstances or human development will change our perspective on our calling? It makes sense that a Christian college student falls in love with college ministry and feels called to vocational ministry to students … yet it also makes sense that person’s sense of calling would shift once they hit their early 30s. If our view of vocational ministry calling is irrevocable, I think it can lead to cognitive dissonance and disillusionment. I’m not sure if this idea correlates with the number of people who go to seminary and find themselves doing something else five years later, but it’s food for thought. Definitely had the thought that if I have more school in my future, maybe instead of a PhD I'll get an MPP instead. Enjoyed listening to this book!"

This book makes the case that we need both types, specialists and generalists--working together--in order to solve humanity's greatest challenges. I feel so much better now about being a generalist/experimenter who's sampled from a variety of disciplines (and musical instruments) and who reads widely. In fact, going forward, I'm going to give myself permission to try even more things. Side note: The book talks a lot about the value of using wide-ranging analogies in order to describe little-understood problems. We owe modern astronomy, among other things, to the power of analogies. I love that. When I was a teenager this guy I worked with at a summer job told me repeatedly, ""Your analogies make no sense."" From time to time I'd think back to his comments and assume I drew these unlikely connections between things because I was a poet, and that it was strictly a language thing.

It turns out that while we love the stories of early achievers and prodigies, there are as many (if not more) stories of late bloomers and generalists who have big impact.There are a lot of example stories (a little bit too many to be perfect, in my opinion). But the biggest insight in the book is to understand the difference between ""kind"" environments and ""wicked"". Kind environments have fixed rules and follow repeatable patterns. Chess and golf are good examples of this. Wicked environments are variable and have unavoidable uncertainty. Starting a new business and writing a book are like this. The choices are too broad and you're trying to do something new, not repeat something perfectly. For kind environments, start early and stay narrow in your focus. For wicked environments, avoid over-focusing and learn how to bring in ideas from adjacent spaces."

But if you've ever spent any time invested deeply in long-term development (sports, kids, yourself), so many of the topics covered in Range are likely real issues you've encountered. Do I specialize early, am I missing out by not committing down one path, should I even bother with some interest that isn't directly applicable to my work or field of study? There's a lot of pop psych about head-start approaches to development but not much which validates what you come to realize with age is still a valid and useful path to success: breadth and experimentation.The next time some coach or trainer tells you how imperative early specialization is, this is the book that will help you feel more comfortable at dealing with a culture hellbent on being first rather than growing into skill and talent."

The narration and storytelling kept me interested, but that's about it. It hardly went deep into the generalisation vs specialisation apart from ""Try many things before settling onto one"", and ""More diverse knowledge helps in the uncertain world"". The gist of the book could be a short article if you strip all the biographies. Especially when you understand that some bios are actually irrelevant and not really about the generalisation. The world needs both and both can triumph and both can fail. So we're kinda left with that we started. So do whatever and succeed, kinda? I mean, I'm not exactly sure I have any takeaway for myself or for raising my child apart from what I already knew: it's best not to settle down and develop yourself in different directions.

David Epstein walks through story upon story of how generalists are innovating life forward in a world with increasingly ""wicked learning environments"" through interdisciplinary prowess (or trying and failing a lot in a lot of different things - not glamorous compared to specializing and getting really good in one thing). His writing style is similar to Malcolm Gladwell, whose endorsement of the book is front and center on the cover - ""I loved Range"".

We have all heard about how certain people have become masters in their field by training in it from an early age. What this book makes clear, is that while this is possible in certain narrow areas, e.g. chess and golf, it is uncommon for masters in other, more chaotic, fields to have become so through a narrow focus. Rather they have tried out several things, giving them a broader range when reacting to new situations. Similarly, breakthroughs in areas are often not done by people specialised in one narrow aspect of that area, as they cannot make the connections to other relevant fields.In a time where education seems to be aimed at getting people to specialise as soon as possible, Range is an important book, and well worth reading."

In my career I've worked in retail, at a call center, and a supermarket. I went to a year of Bible school. I flunked out of University for computer science. I went to a polytechnic school at age 23 to get a diploma for computer systems technology, then got my first software job. Even in that job I've been a bit range-y. I was a scrum master, a team lead, an engineering manager, and an independent contributor at various points.This history lesson is only important because it shows the range I have been able to gather so far in my life and career. Before reading this book, I thought that those different experiences were bad or a waste of my time. Now, I understand that they were important because they gave me more ways to approach problems and come up with solutions.The book is excellent. David starts with the example of Tiger Woods vs. Roger Federer, early specialization vs. late specialization. He quickly generalizes, however, and only returns to this specific idea (early child sports development) later in the book. The rest of the book works around a concept I hadn't thought about before: Kind (something where a desired outcome is achieved by repeated effort on the same thing, think of golf or chess where either the rules (chess) or your opponent (golf, where you don't really have one) is fixed) and Wicked (where desired outcome is achieved by in many possible ways and isn't easily reproduced by doing the same thing over and over - think scientific research or, perhaps, tennis) environments. Software development never felt so wicked.I'd recommend this to most people: parents raising children, young folks trying to ""figure out what to do with their lives"", and people like myself who are a bit of each :) If you've always thought you were a generalist, you gotta read this one!"

I also really enjoyed chapter 10 on Charles Darwin and the new perspective it gave me. Also, I felt it helped that I had read many of the books he'd referenced so I had that prior knowledge for the 'discussion' the book brought. Some of the thoughts I liked and would like to remember from the book are:*With critical intelligence, intelligence was too narrow. Must be taught to think before being taught what to think about. *Repetition less important than struggle*Ease is a sign that you're not learning*Short term struggles for long term gains*Facilitating learning by making connections*Winners (those who've reached the apex of their domain) quit fast and often when they detect a plan is not the best fit and do not feel bad about it. And in this instance we fail when we don't have the guts to quit*You have to carry a big basket to bring something home (a mind kept wide open will bring home new experiences)*I know what I am when I see what I do*Trying things is the answer to finding your talent*Relying on data too much can be catastrophic*Read outside your field, everyday something. *Communication really happens in the carpool/lunch*Don't feel behind*Compare yourself to yourself yesterday*Approach your own goals by adjusting as you go.

Above all, I found this book to be incredibly validating. I am interested in lots of things, and I sometimes struggle with feeling I should be better at only a few things. But I honestly can’t help it: my brain has too many tabs open. All the time. Epstein left me feeling comforted. So many interesting, memorable people have a curiosity that cannot be confined to a single discipline, and it is that very diversity of pursuits that drove them to their greatest achievements. I’m hardly Roger Federer, or Michelangelo, or Gunpei Yokoi (if you don’t know him, you’ll learn about his fascinating life in the book). But who knows? Maybe I could be, one day. Epstein gives me hope. “Approach your own personal voyage and projects like Michelangelo approached a block of marble, willing to learn and adjust as you go, and even to abandon a previous goal and change directions entirely should the need arise. Research on creators in domains from technological innovation to comic books shows that a diverse group of specialists cannot fully replace the contributions of broad individuals. Even when you move on from an area of work or an entire domain, that experience is not wasted.” (p. 290)So solidarity to the nerds. And the dilettantes. And those who would call themselves both. Maybe you’ll change the world - or maybe you’ll just be a well-rounded, curious human. That could change the world too. "

A MUST buy & must-read.What's stunning inside:- The reversal of 'deeply ingrained' concepts in the world such as ""specialise or super specialise; start early, only use data (I'm a culprit), correlation of early age & success & the curse of trying too many things"". This book proves that all these hypotheses have an alternative.- Compelling real stories & cases. The ones I found fascinating: Van Gogh's spectacular timeline; The blunder at Nasa (over-dependence on data), the shocking cases of fireman 'not dropping their tools' even to survive.- The deep study on why 'quitting is NOT bad'.- The Case Study on ""To Race or Not"" is spectacular. It brings out one of the biggest reasons we all fail...(won't spoil it here).- The larger point of what succeeds. RANGE means a large spectrum of thinking, people, counter views & the larger point that 'everything doesn't have to fit' into neat places. There is glory in not being perfect or prepared or early.- Parents - please read this book to understand that you NEED NOT 'curate' & plan your kids' lives minutely & fret if they WANDER. It may be good for them."
135,0735214484,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5917740-nilesh,4,"Range has an important message: generalists have a vital role to play in our society across fields. It has many engaging anecdotes and supposed myth-busters. The author never deviates from the central thesis, which should help many skeptical readers take away a few good arguments at least. I liked the book and its message enough to give it a four-star rating, which is also because of my strong belief in the message. This theme is rarely well supported in popular books, another reason behind my excellent rating. The rest of the review is more about its shortcomings and my disagreements, though.Through a variety of narratives, the author glorifies the successes of generalists while indirectly belittling specialists. Let's leave aside definitions of terms involved for the time being. The author refuses to discuss the objective realities. Becoming a specialist is hard. In a way, all those who don't specialize can call themselves generalists. Every society likely has a vast majority that will not fit the tag of specialists. Such non-specialists, who would want to be counted as generalists, might have the success rates among them - however defined - far lower than the rest. Narrating the success of a handpicked does not make a case for one type or against another. As the arguments above indicate, one cannot run away from the definitions of generalists and specialists. And, the book does. There are extremely few cases like Tiger Wood, where someone is massively talented only in one field and from a very early age. Almost all successful people (barring few exceptions) feel they were underdogs before some serendipitous/unexpected success, are creative because of their ability to transplant knowledge from some other field, and have been ""quitters"" in that they were unsure about their final destiny until a point. More often than not, the author's generalists are skillful in more than one, maybe up to four or five fields. They would eventually make one field their own, like Federer in Tennis, while transferring some of the skills developed elsewhere. Are these the only generalists in the world? And, by this definition, how many are genuine specialists?The author misses many arguments on breadth versus depth in his journey. He completely misses the risks of trying to be a generalist without having adequate toolkit or costs involved. "

Here are my main takeaways: Experience simply did not create skill. Repetition did not cause learning. Group recurring information into chucks. Creative achievers tend to have broad interests. Detail prior knowledge is less important than a way of thinking (Fermi Question exercise). Struggle is more important than repetition. Struggle = learning. Mixed study: struggle now, better the longer term learning. Mix over block. Interweave! Sank cost can cost ya! Know when to stop loss. Don't plan and implement. Do first, then think. ""A person don't know what he can do, unless he tries. Trying things, is the answer to find your talent.""Frogs and Birds. We need different perspectives.

Useful stuff for (to-be) parents as well as professionals, students, aspiring athletes or artists who feel “behind” or unsure about their careers. Epstein provides the reader (listener in my case) nice range of various successful people who definitely haven’t followed the Tiger Woods path of early specializing but dabbled with a whole host of interests over decades before striking the proverbial homerun."

This book wastes so much potential. A book on this subject has the power to shake the grounds today's progress belief stands upon.In Range, David Epstein tries to make the argument for generalization and the importance of breadth over depth in knowledge and expertise. He does that using a number of studies and a lot of stories of generalists from both history and today.I liked this book, it confirmed some of my thoughts on the topic and I learned new things as well. It is also quite entertaining and interesting to learn of stories that counter the norm.However, Epstein doesn't go deep enough. This subject is huge and shrouded in so much mystery and, as he himself acknowledges in the book, it doesn't get near enough attention. He doesn't rely on scientific backing enough and he doesn't attempt to answer some big questions, how does breadth function in the brain for instance.My criticism for this book is that it is more focused on selling and introducing the topic than going deep, disillusioning society, and answering how questions.I do recommend this book, though, especially to academics who are only aware of the importance of hyper-specialization.."

I have absolutely no idea how Epstein found all these stories and data, but he manages to systematically dismantle the misconceptions about the ""10,000 hour rule"" (that you can only be good at something by deliberately focusing on only that one narrow thing) in a thorough and entertaining way. He traverses the domains of music, athletics, science, and leadership to tell story after story of incredibly successful people whose lives were characterized by anything but deliberate practice along a linear narrow path. Along the way, Epstein cultivates a love of curiosity and learning for the sake of learning, showing that the greatest challenges of almost every domain are likely to be answered by those bold enough to look outside those domains. Because the book is so new, Epstein also interacts with and builds on the last decade of leadership/psychology writers (Dan Pink, Daniel Kahneman, Angela Duckworth, etc.) quite well. For those whose passions are broad, fickle, and meandering, you might have just found your new favorite popular psychology book."

The most important thought provoking argument author poses is that we are always from the beginning till death are taught what to think and never taught with how to think/learn .?, which is an important issue to ponder about to bring out the infinite energy in a human being ,which I think."

And that exactly what has led me to convert my reading way for the book, from the kindle reading, to the audio book. But however, this book deserves to be read."
