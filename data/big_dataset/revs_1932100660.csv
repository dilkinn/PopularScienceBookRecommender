0,1932100660,http://goodreads.com/user/show/84621-rachel,2,"UGH! I totally loved this book as of page 150 or so! At the beginning you find out about this really interesting research that showed that feeding milk protein (casein) to rats encouraged them to develop cancerous growths after the rats had been exposed to a carcinogen called aflatoxin, and the cancer barely grew at all in rats that were fed low amounts (5% of calories) of casein. The cancer also barely grew at all in rats that were fed low to medium to high amounts of PLANT protein (wheat protein and soy protein were tested). I thought they were going to do a lot more tests to find out the effects of OTHER animal proteins besides casein (what about whey protein, fish protein, beef protein, chicken protein, etc), and I thought they would do tests with other carcinogens besides aflatoxin. Since the results were so dramatic, you'd think all these other studies would have been the natural offshoot. But Campbell doesn't ever mention these follow-up studies which surely must have happened. Or if they didn't happen, then why not? It doesn't make any sense that scientists would not pursue these very provocative and promising research questions. I am perplexed by this. Either Campbell left the information about the follow-up studies out of his book, or they simply didn't happen. If it was the science-medicine-government-industry complex that BLOCKED any further research, then Campbell had every opportunity to explain that, but he didn't. Also, it makes no sense because there are plenty of organizations like Physicians Committee for Responsible Medicine and PETA that would have the money to sponsor the research. OK, maybe not PETA, as they wouldn't approve of doing experiments on rats, but these research conclusions are just way too groundbreaking. You know, ""Diets Rich in Dairy Products Accelerate Cancer Growth."" and ""Plant-Based Diets Prohibit Cancer Growth."" There are so many scientists who have already made their money and don't need to be slaves to the power establishment and who would LOVE to be responsible for conclusive research like this; they could win the Nobel Prize, for sure! So either the follow-up research was done, and it wasn't conclusive, which would explain why Campbell left those details out, or ... well, it just makes no sense why no one would have investigated it further. UGH!The book is okay in general, especially for people who want reassurance that a vegan diet is healthy. Also, reading this book helped encourage me to eat healthier, more whole foods, not so much refined sugar and added oils. I'm very thankful for that. I also found out that my cholesterol at 167 is not that great and I need to get it below 150. But ... I got rather annoyed with the author because he keeps saying that a whole-foods, plant-based diet (vegan) is the HEALTHIEST diet, and he didn't give any scientific evidence for that. I'm vegan and I definitely wanted to see that scientific evidence, but it wasn't there. And note that unlike other people who got bored and skimmed through parts of it, I actually read every word of every page, all the way through from beginning to end, including the appendices. If I had only flipped around in the book and saw him claiming that he has already proven (in other chapters) that the vegan diet is best, I might think, ""OH, that's probably true, I haven't read the whole thing 100%."" Well, I DID read the whole thing 100% and he did not prove that a vegan diet is best. What he showed is some correlations between cancer rates and heart disease rates in various countries; the more animal protein and animal fat you eat, the more cancer and heart disease you get. OKAY, point taken, but it doesn't show that eating a vegan (whole foods) diet is any better than, say, a 95% plant-based, 5% animal-based diet. In fact, even in the studies with rats, they had almost no cancer growth when they had only 5% of their calories from milk protein (casein). They only got the high amounts of cancer growth when it went up to 10% and 20%. So it looks like low amounts of dairy products are actually OKAY, according to the rat studies. I just hate that Campbell goes from showing us these really interesting studies and then takes a leap to say that 100% plant-based diet is the best.He also provides as ""evidence"" some studies by Esseltyn and others who REVERSED heart disease by putting people on restricted diets. This is good news and throws egg in the faces of all the stick-in-the-mud doctors who think drugs and surgery are the only ways to treat disease. OK, cool. But I noted that most of the restricted diets weren't totally vegan, the people were allowed small amounts of meat and dairy every day. In cases like this, Campbell always said something like, ""Well, if the results were that good, imagine how good the results would be if the diet was 100% vegan."" Well, that's just imagining. Where is the evidence that the 100% vegan diet is better than a mostly plant-based diet? I don't think there is any, otherwise he would have shown it to us. So what gives him the right to go around saying that a 100% vegan diet is the best? And acting like he has the research to back it up? And probably fooling some people in the process? Ooooh! It makes me angry.Now for my ""most obvious"" gripe. I thought the book was going to be mainly about all these exciting results of the China Study, since it says THE CHINA STUDY in big letters on the front. One would think! As I read the first 140 pages (which are NOT about the China study), I simply thought I was being given the background info, as surely we were being led up to a big discussion about THE CHINA STUDY. So I was shocked by the time I get to the 200's pages, and we were moving on to other topics. It was then that I checked the Table of Contents, and came to a shocking realization ... the 15 pages where the author talks a little bit about the China Study (in the mid-100's pages somewhere, I don't have the book with me) is ALL YOU'RE GONNA GET. What the heck!??? Even in those 15 pages, he actually doesn't even stay focused on the topic of THE CHINA STUDY. He spends quite a few paragraphs within those 15 pages, discussing Esseltyn and Atkins diet and other stuff. I couldn't believe it. Also, when I read about the procedure of the China Study, it just doesn't sound very good. They pooled together all the blood from people in 2 cities in each county and based their statistics off of that. So even though they took blood samples from 100's of people, they only ended up with about 65 data points to compare. This is because they couldn't get enough blood from individuals to test all the factors that they wanted. So if they took all the vials of blood and mixed them, they got a combined sample of several pints of blood from people from that county. And that was enough blood to do 100s of tests. But if there were some people in the county who ate a lot of animal products, and others who ate mostly plants, and you got survey data from all those people .. well, now you have to average their eating habits and make a composite ""average"" diet for someone in that county. You can't compare the disease rates of people who ate well in the county vs. people who ate poorly. All you can do is compare one county's pooled blood sample to another county's. So .... maybe the reason why T. Colin Campbell doesn't talk much about the China study, in his book entitled THE CHINA STUDY, is that the results there are not very conclusive or persuasive. I was thinking I should read Junshi's original research published in 1990, but I googled it and found a summary of its shortcomings here:http://www.beyondveg.com/billings-t/c...The above web site seems to be all about busting the myths and ""fanaticism"" of vegan and raw food diets, etc, so be aware of that. Nonetheless, the points it brings up are the same ones I was thinking of as I read about the techniques employed for the China study research. Oh, I found another review that sums up many of the criticisms I have.http://www.westonaprice.org/bookrevie...This review actually brings up another important point ... Campbell makes a big deal about how dairy is linked to autoimmune diseases, but what about the links to wheat and gluten? Unfortunately, Campbell generalizes that if milk protein is bad, then all animal protein is bad, whereas he generally assumes that plant protein is good.Oh, the guy who wrote that review above is Chris Masterjohn, he's the author of a fanatical PRO-CHOLESTEROL site! So that guy is biased, also! His web site says that low cholesterol diets are bland and boring! As if????http://www.cholesterol-and-health.com/Despite Masterjohn's obvious bias on his web site, his review of The China Study seems fair and even-handed. He gives 48 references in his review, although I haven't checked them. (Hey, I'm just trying to do a quick write-up!) The gist of his review agrees with my feeling as I read the China Study, so despite my skepticism regarding Masterjohn's underlying agenda of promoting cholesterol consumption, I think the information he provided is probably correct. Taken with a grain of salt, of course.Anyway ... back to T. Colin Campbell's book ...It turned me off that Campbell seemed so biased toward a 100% vegan diet; he SAID his beliefs were based on science, without providing the scientific evidence. He STARTED to provide compelling research, and then he stopped. It's a total bummer.And I'm disappointed that the book says it's all about the China Study, when it is not. And maybe it's because the China Study wasn't really worth writing a book about.However, I give it 3 stars instead of 2 because that stuff at the beginning is really interesting. And it did get me motivated to eat healthier. I am on a quest to lose 10 pounds in 10 weeks and get my cholesterol to under 150! And it's due in large part to the motivational and compelling parts in the first half of this book.Still, I might put it down to two stars. It was a pretty big disappointment.  And for the Vegan Book Club ... I know you said you wanted to do this for a future book selection ... I've got no opinion either way, since I've already read it now ... I suggest checking the links above and deciding for yourselves if you want this or a different book. While I do have my criticisms, it certainly would make for a good discussion!"
1,1932100660,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2033234-kara,1,"Whew, where to start with this one! I do feel compelled to explain why I see this book as a one star. it is frankly bad science. I think most people would read this book and seriously feel scared, he most likely wrote it with that purpose in mind. Many of my thoughts stem from years of math and statistics classes, years of working with statistics in environmental engineering, some come from the dozens of research studies that I’ve read over the years, some come simply from being a die-hard critical thinker. I truly question everything I read (and as a result can drive my ownself nuts). I don't want you to think for one minute that I think I have all the answers to what we “should” be eating. I eat based on what I personally feel is the best odds for health. This changes and evolves, and I definitely struggle with a sweet tooth (I think refined sugar may be the worst evil of all the foods, yet I love it, go figure),. If I speak my truth, based on everything I’ve read, researchers and health professionals that I respect and trust, I do strongly belief that quality meat rich in omega 3’s is the healthiest source of protein for our bodies. I would eat more fish if I didn’t feel so much concern over toxins in our oceans and thus our fish. Grass-fed beef has a better omega 3 fat profile than grain fed beef,but without the toxins of the wild fish. This is what I eat predominantly for meat.Who knows, maybe further research will come out to show that a no-meat diet is best, but I really do not believe that any science so-far proves that to be the truth (from a health standpoint). So if you really want to know why I think this book is bad science, here is a start (tip of the ice berge to be honest). Epidemiology is a good tool for predicting future outcomes for large communities, but is terrible for predicting individual causations. He even admits himself (very quietly and sort of as a side note) that there are incredible amounts of variables that confound the results.Correlations does not equal causation (this is basic statistics, yet almost all of his data is based on correlations. (Rich people eat more meat than poor and rich people have more cancer than poor therefore eating meat causes cancer……don’t even get me started on how this poves nothing)The author definitely says many things that I agree with and are scientifically backed up by lots of other studies. That’s a big thing for me, I don’t trust anything until it has been shown repeatedly in unrelated studies. The Standard America Diet (SAD as they call it) is certainly dismal. Processed and refined foods are terrible for us and he talks a lot about that in the beginning of the book. This is all very, very true. I’m not vegan (obviously) but I would consider a vegan diet and a whole-foods diet more closely related than most. Both attempt to eat whole fruits and veggies, lots of omega 3’s, fibre, and adequate protein. But there are also many technically incorrect statements this books makes, as well as leaps of logic that are truly unscientific. I could actually be more forgiving of minor technical errors, but the data has been presented in a way that I believe is irresponsible.  I would imagine anyone who would take the time to read this book as it stands would certainly be afraid of dairy. I am not. When you start looking into the real data and how it was interpreted that the problems start to surface and I lost faith in the rest of his possibly accurate data.Anyway, most people don't take enough interest in their diet to even read one book or they are not open minded enough to consider whether meat, or wheat or big macs are good for their health. I'm not emotionally tied to my “diet” and I read a lot, so I am happy to read and consider what is best for my personal health. I want to believe I am open to change. Sorry for the rambling review."
2,1932100660,http://goodreads.com/user/show/336271-alison,2,"I haven’t read the whole thing yet. I have skipped around a bit and I probably won’t finish it. I am reading it because my sister in law read it and wanted my opinion. At first I had an open mind about what he had to say, but the further I got in to it the less I liked it. The first thing was the evangelical tone of the writing. You can almost hear Amazing Grace being sung in the background… I once was lost, but now am found… Then he completely disses anyone who believes that fiber can contribute to anemia by calling them “experts” in quotes. There are a lot of real experts who have done some very good research that shows that plant components can impair mineral absorption. He demonizes animal foods, backing up his claims with epidemiological data and rat studies. I find the rat studies rather believable, but I’m not sure he is interpreting the epidemiological data entirely correctly. There are so many factors involved I have a hard time with is attribution of all diseases of affluence to animal foods. There are MANY factors (dietary, lifestyle, and environmental) correlated to animal protein intake that could just as easily be the problem. Most likely it is some combination of factors. China is so different from the US and Europe that I don’t think that you can make a straight comparison. I don’t think that the answer is to start eating like a rural Chinese peasant. The thing that bothers me the most is that he almost completely ignores the possibility and probability of malnutrition among the millions of Chinese people who are consuming these very spare vegetarian diets by attributing it to parasites and saying that it could be prevented by public health projects to provide clean water. He talks about how great it is that the girls in the villages reach menarche in their late teens and that it isn’t so important to be tall. He misses the point that it isn’t tall per se, but the other impairments that go along with not reaching your genetic potential for height.He does make some good points about the typical American diet. We eat too much overall. We eat too much meat and fat and not enough fruits, vegetables, and whole grains. Anyone taking Nutr 101 should be able to tell you that. It is no secret. In the rat studies it looks like the benefits of a low animal protein diet taper off at/below 10% of calories from animal protein. That is still a fair amount, not low protein, but less than what most Americans eat. I think that there is a diminishing return to the reduction in animal protein he talks about. He spends the last section of the book making it sound like there is some national conspiracy among scientists, industry, and policy makers to keep Americans sick in order to make money. I don’t think so.Over all I am unconvinced. I think that he has over reacted and I still think that you can get the benefits of a vegetarian diet by eating lots of fruit and veggies (including soy) and whole grains while incorporating smaller amounts of lean meat and dairy."
3,1932100660,http://goodreads.com/user/show/38894-jennifer,5,"Wow! Time to start cutting down on animal protein! This is a well supported (with real scientific evidence) on the dangers of eating animal protein...from cancers, to arthritis to osteoporosis. It also provides good insight into how some in the scientific community, government and industry work together to keep valuable nutritional information from the public. The most interesting and surprising point for me was the dangers of milk and how increased milk consumption can actually cause osteoporosis. This book is written in a style appropriate for both doctors/scientists as well as the average public. "
4,1932100660,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2293734-flying-monkey,2,"I really wish Campbell would have included the most compelling data from this study. But for some reason he left if out his book. Below is a study co-authored by Colin Campbell and is derived from the Cornell China Study. Comparative Biochemistry and Physiology Part A 136 (2003) 127-140Fish consumption, blood docosahexaenoic acid and chronic diseasesin Chinese rural populationsYiqun Wanga, Michael A. Crawforda,*, Junshi Chenb, Junyao Lib, Kebreab Ghebremeskela,T. Colin Campbell, Wenxun Fanb, Robert Parkerc, Julius LeytondThe conclusion of this study (same Cornell China Study) was that consuming fish was one of the strongest indicators of overall good health. Fish had the strongest correlations with decreasing chrnonic disease, Cardiovascular disease, and cancer. I’m giving this book 2 stars due to Campbell excluding this data and therefore misrepresenting the study in the book. "
5,1932100660,http://goodreads.com/user/show/87791-linus-thomas,5,"Wow. What an impressive book! This book looks at what ails us and what is truly the cause. Based on well over 750 studies done over a 35 year period by various researchers, doctors, etc. it highlights the true cause of many of our cancers, diabetes, aches and pains: animal protein. This isn't a ""vegan rules; meat eaters drool"" kind of book. This is empirical data that proves that our diet overall and animal proteins specifically are the root cause for most of the diseases/ailments of affluence. Additionally, this book looks at the effect and results of the various industries that depend on the continued promotion of animal proteins (e.g., dairy, meat, fish, politicians, drug industry, medical practises -- specifically surgery). It also highlights the misinterpretation of many researchers of the results of studies and using a reductionist view (i.e., pulling a single fact or point out of a study rather than looking at the whole; consider that many of our health headlines identify single causes/cures -- Vitamin C, alcohol, etc.) At the least, read it to be informed. That's the biggest problem right now. It's not that hard to live healthy on a whole food, plant-based diet/lifestyle. "
6,1932100660,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1102467-lauren,5,"To go from a dairy farmer who went to college to learn how to make animals produce more milk and meat, to a human nutrition expert promoting a whole foods, plant-based diet as the key to human health and disease prevention represents a remarkable shift in beliefs, career path, and personal behavior. This book tells the story of that shift - the story of Dr. Campbell's life and career as a scientist who was persuaded by what the growing body of nutrition research (including the groundbreaking epidemiological study he led) demonstrated. As he tells his story, he explains the science in a way that is explained for the layperson while still presenting a detailed analysis.What I liked about this book, more than other books with a similar message, is that Dr. Campbell doesn't come across as a zealot determined to make.you.understand.dammit the glorious truth he has to share with you, the poor unenlightened dupe. He doesn't try to shame the typical Westerner for his/her diet - first of all, he begins the book explaining that he started out as exactly that: the typical (mid-)Westerner who believed that cow's milk was nature's most perfect food. Second of all, he presents a concise yet thorough case for just why the typical Westerner probably hasn't heard about all of the peer-reviewed, objective research presented in The China Study and why most people can't shake the opinion that animal protein is a necessary component of the human diet, even after they're confronted with evidence that it does more harm than good. (For a less concise and more thorough case, I recommend  Food Politics by Marion Nestle). Rather than zealotry, Campbell's tone is science-based and fact-oriented. He does have an opinion, and he is building a strong argument for a whole foods, plant-based diet, but that argument is the result of the story he's telling, rather than the starting point for an effort to prove a pre-conceived opinion. When I read this book, I was already vegan, and I had already read a number of other books, articles, and web resources with the same essential message, so the book didn't need to persuade me of anything I hadn't already heard. But what I am grateful for, and what I got from this book that I hadn't before found so completely anywhere else, is a careful, thoughtful, detailed and organized look at the science behind all the claims and pronouncements. Other books and sources say ""numerous scientific studies show..."" and my instinctively cynical mind (I am the daughter of a scientist, after all!) doesn't completely trust that the science is being faithfully represented by the claims. The China Study takes the time and the care to go through those studies and to explain how those studies show what they do. So what I liked about this book, I guess, is that I found it to be a trustworthy source of objective research that, ultimately, reassures me that I have chosen a genuinely healthy diet and lifestyle.I would love to hear what my omni friends think! I can't wait for your reviews!"
7,1932100660,http://goodreads.com/user/show/170671-jonathan,5,"The most important book I've read in a long time. Changed the way I eat. Strongly recommended, if you're interested in the latest research on nutrition and health, disease, cancer, energy, and longevity. I came to this with an eager and open mind, since it was highly recommended by someone I respect greatly, Art Eggertsen, founder of ProBar. I have long been seeking out the best approach to nutrition for two reasons: 1) maximize athletic performance. I am an avid cyclist, formerly a fanatical triathlete, and always love to feel healthy and fit. 2) I have a history of cancer in my family, having lost both my parents 6 weeks apart to cancer in 2004. Insights into decreasing the risk of cancer for myself, family, and friends, is paramount.The book has some unpopular themes - unpopular with big established industries like meat and dairy, and the media, politics, and world of business they influence. However, as our recent presidential inauguration demonstrates, a time of change is upon us. Hallelujah!"
8,1932100660,http://goodreads.com/user/show/647499-brooke,5,"This book is based on years of research, both in the real world and in labs. It is basically about the remarkable relationship between the foods we eat and cancer, heart disease, diabetes, and other illnesses. It is information that food companies, doctors, drug companies, etc. don't want you to know about.On a related note, if you have not seen the documentary ""Super Size Me"" yet, I highly recommend you go rent it. The DVD also has bonus features. Go to the extra interviews and watch the interview with Eric Schlosser (author of ""Fast Food Nation""). It is a little long but important."
9,1932100660,http://goodreads.com/user/show/90906-lauren,1,"Before I go any further, you should know that his conclusions are very similar to the diet from my favorite Nutrition book, ""Eat, Drink, and Be Healthy."" Dr. Willett uses more reliable scientific data to advocate his diet, which is mostly whole plant foods, with healthy vegetable oils (like olive and canola oil) and a small amount of fish added. Like Dr. Campbell, Dr. Willet found that dairy products and meats - especially those high in saturated fat - should be avoided, as well as products with refined flour. So really, they are not all that different. However, Dr. Campbell's ""The China Study"" is so flimsy in his scientific logic, that I wanted to point out a few things to you, so you don't embrace his book as fact.Dr. Campbell seems to find his proof in two things - his study about protein-eating rats, and The China Study. First, with his rat study, he compared rats on a diet of 20% casein protein, and other rats on a diet of 5% casein protein. Those rats on the 20% casein diet got cancer, and those on the 5% diet did not. Well, his experiment was done correctly, but his conclusions are pretty far-fetched. First of all, as humans we don't consume anywhere near that much casein - we would have to be on an all-dairy diet to even begin to approach 20% casein protein in our diet. And his own experiment showed that consuming less than 5% casein is perfectly safe and does not cause cancer. Since our protein consumption comes from a variety of sources, I think casein protein consumption for most people is well below the amount that would cause cancer. Another thing about this study is that Campbell jumps from his casein protein study to conclude that all animal proteins must be bad. Yet, he only studied ONE type of protein - the kind found in milk. He did not study the proteins in chicken, fish, beef, etc., all of which would be vastly different in molecular structure. Comparing beef protein to casein protein is ludicrous - even if one caused cancer, why would he conclude that the other did, too, just because they both come from animals? If he thinks that his study on casein protein proves that we shouldn't eat meat, then we better stop breastfeeding our children, too, because I'm sure the proteins in breastmilk are much more similar to dairy proteins that meat proteins are!Okay, moving on to the China Study. Campbell says in his book that through this study we can look at correlation, but not causation, and he is right. There are way too many variables in this study to come even close to proving anything - especially not a diet as specific as Campbell is suggesting. The diets of the people in China are so dissimilar to ours that it is like comparing apples and oranges. There is no way to prove that the Chinese are healthier because they eat less animal products - it could be because they eat more fish, or because they consume less gluten, or because they don't consume as many sugary foods, or even because they eat more seaweed. There is just no way to know, absolutely. We can say that the Eastern Diet is, on a whole, more nutritious, but we cannot pinpoint which aspects of their diet are the most beneficial. The only thing Campbell can do with this data is encourage us to eat exactly what the Chinese do (and I don't want to eat fish heads and dog). On a similar note, Campbell includes lots of graphs showing how various diseases are increased in countries that eat more animal products. But these countries also eat more refined products, sugary desserts, are more sedentary, etc. - we just don't know what combination of these factors are causing the diseases. Meat may play a factor, but it also may not. There are way, way, way too many variables in this study to make any conclusions about the health of animal products.My final qualm is the fact that Campbell is advocating a vegan diet based on the China Study, yet the vast majority of Chinese are NOT vegan. So, he can use the China Study to encourage us to eat more whole grain and vegetables (and cut out the refined junk), but he absolutely can NOT use the China Study to encourage us to cut meat out of our diet. So, the only ""evidence"" left is his rat studies, which I have already shown you are faulty. (Whew, I wrote a lot!)"
10,1932100660,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1320412-alison,5,"Wow. I mean...wow. This book should be required reading for anyone who...well... eats (especially the average American). I just finished listening to the audio version, and I'm ready to go back to track 1 and give it second go. I'll probably get the print version at some point, for reference, but I'm SO thankful an audio recording exists, because – to be honest – I'd probably just skim through the printed book and not really get the full impact of what Dr. Campbell has to say. The basic premise is: eat a plant-based, whole foods diet (basically vegan) and enjoy a long, healthy, disease-free life. But that's not doing the book justice. Many of the studies cited are just mind-boggling. I found my mouth hanging agape on more than one occasion during the listen.Throughout, I couldn’t help thinking of my family. My father, an organic farmer who also happens to be a very Midwestern meat ‘n potatoes guy, who survived a major heart attack in his 50s and regularly takes cholesterol-lowering medication. And my mother, a former RN who has been on disability for years due to crippling rheumatoid arthritis. My brother, a trained chef who eats organic and avoids artificial sweeteners, but can’t give up his meat. And his son, my little nephew, who at ten months of age has been transitioned to raw goat’s milk, because his mother (wisely) doesn’t trust anything made with cows milk for babies (though I’m not sure if goat’s milk is that much better). I kept imagining their reactions to this book, if I could get them to really take it in. Would it change them? Sad to say, I doubt it...at least in my parents’ case...their habits are too ingrained at this point, too much a part of their identities. That will likely be the case for most meat-eaters, if they could even be persuaded to give this book a shot. But I applaud T. Colin Campbell for putting this information out there, for those of us who will read it and take it to heart. Even as a long-time vegetarian, my diet is certainly going to take some adjusting, and I look forward to one day being happier and healthier as a result.For a free excerpt and more information, visit www.thechinastudy.com."
11,1932100660,http://goodreads.com/user/show/911636-j,0,"see bottom for updateFor openers, I'm biased because I already believe that for me to be a vegetarian is better for the animal, better for you, and better for me. So I find myself wanting to believe this book. I also found a possible conflict of interest: the author is on the advisory board of the Physicians Committee for Responsible Medicine, a group that reportedly gets funding from People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals. And the book advocates a diet that avoids animal products.Having said that, I think Campbell's main message is probably right, which is that a plant-based, whole foods diet is the most healthful and that animal foods are harmful. Some results that he cites are remarkable -- like patients with type 2 diabetes going on a more plant-based diet and then no longer needing insulin treatments. He also makes the case that animal protein is simply bad for long-term health, which is why he discourages consuming dairy products. The end chapters about the behind-the-scenes workings of the health and food industries are interesting, too. I recommend the book, but even more strongly recommend trying vegetarianism or veganism to just see for yourself. You can always go back to eating meat.Update (September 2012) A well-cited critique of this book, excerpt below, can be found here: http://www.fourhourworkweek.com/blog/...The China Study contains many excellent points in its criticism of the health care system, the overemphasis on reductionism in nutritional research, the influence of industry on research, and the necessity of obtaining nutrients from foods. But its bias against animal products and in favor of veganism is a preexisting bias that results in a mainstream book intended—first and foremost—to convert. It displays hallmarks of bad science used in the same fashion by the very industries it criticizes."
12,1932100660,http://goodreads.com/user/show/83445-lisa-vegan,3,"I have to say that I was not in the mood to read this book. In fact, I’d decided I wasn’t interested in reading it at all. When it first was published I’d heard good things about it so I bought it, but then heard some negative things and put it aside. However, my real world book club decided to read it as our October selection so I read it, but I was not enthusiastic.I was a bit irritable reading this as I felt as though I should be taking notes and memorizing material as I would while reading a textbook for a class, and I longed to be reading fiction instead. However, the book was better overall than I’d anticipated.First the bad: I was warned that this was not a “vegan” book but the authors completely lost me when on page 242 fish is in the category to minimize consumption, not eliminate it, after spending the rest of the book advocating eating 100% plant products. Well, fish are animals, not plants. the authors claim that for losing weight or maintaining an ideal weight calories don’t count so much if one is eating a whole foods plants only diet, and I know this to not be true.Also, reading this made me anxious. I haven’t taken that great care of myself for the last 5 ½ years, ever since I suffered knee injuries from running too much. Perhaps had I read this 5 ½ years ago, I’d have felt empowered rather than frightened. This is not the book’s fault of course, but it did diminish my ability to enjoy the reading experience.Now the good:I liked how he talked about his life and work; it kept the book from being too dry.There’s a lot of excellent nutritional information included, including the dangers of consuming animal protein (worth at least a star all by itself) and other lesser known nutritional knowledge. Also, there’s important information about the lack of nutritional education for medical professionals, the power of the food industry to keep Americans eating unhealthy foods, and other cogent arguments for recommending a 100% plant based diet. A lot of diseases and conditions are covered, with nutritional reasons for their occurrence and nutritional solutions for their improvement or cure.Not much of the information was new to me. The two areas that gave me something to think about were what was said about the role of genetics (less than I’ve always assumed) and information about supplements (I have to rethink what supplements I take, which will involve some more research on my part.)The research he’s conducted and evaluated was more sound than I expected, for which I was grateful.What a shame that immigrants to America so often give up their healthier national diet for America’s often inferior fare, which is something I’ve often thought.Most importantly, this book has gotten some people to become vegan or adopt a diet with many more plant products and fewer animal products, so I can’t really criticize it too strongly. So, I do hope that many people read this book. If everyone self educates with the information this book provides, at least they can make a truly informed consent about how they choose to eat.Oh, and I usually read books cover to cover but I did not read the References on pages 369-404."
13,1932100660,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1235883-lisa,3,"An interesting read. Comparing how what we eat affects our health. Brad and I mostly skimmed it. I think the author makes alot of assumptions. He is trying to convince us to be vegans, but cannot prove that NO animal products is the better that 10% animal products. What it did was make us go back to the word of wisdom and compare. I hadn't realized how little meat we should eat...""Flesh also of beasts and of the fowls of the air...to be used sparingly; And it is pleasing unto me that they should not be used, only in times of winter, or of cold, or famine."" (sec. 89 vs. 12-13) So after reading the Word of wisdom again Brad and I have decided to cut our meat consumption down to once a week and eat more whole grain and vegetables and fruits. The kids aren't very excited but they will get used to it! I give it 3 stars for helping us realize what we should be doing! Save yourself the time and just read section 89. unless you would like to read about his studies and how the government nutrition boards are in the pocket of the meat industry."
14,1932100660,http://goodreads.com/user/show/49521790-ayse,4,"Very interesting study. We all know at this point already that Eating fresh and organic veggies and fruits, and unprocessed food, Staying away from sugar and Minimizing animal products are the best you can do for your diet."
15,1932100660,http://goodreads.com/user/show/20015365-may,4,"Disclaimer: This high rating reflects my naive impressions back in 2016. I would probably give it 1-2 stars on a second reading. Rachel's review..................................................I have very mixed feelings about this one!Is animal protrein the culprit behind the scenes? Does it cause cancer, heart disease, hypertention, diabetes and autoimmune diseases? It sounds like a very far fetched idea, but the correlations are overwhelming!! The first part of the book is more about animal experimentation and how even after administring aflatoxin ""a carcinogen found in rotten nuts"" lowering animal protein intake from 20% to 5% effectively decreased the promotion of cancer in these animals. It places emphasis on the fact that it's protein, not saturated fat nor cholesterol as isolated elements.Then it moves on to the China Study and how it was conducted. Frankly, this part was a great disappointment. I was all psyched up to read the details about this amazing, extremely comprehensive study ""as the title obviously says"", instead I got very little information; correlations showing that the inhabitants of rural China who consumed less animal protein and more plant based foods had lower rates of cancer and other diseases of ""affluence"" that plague the west. Correlations are undoubtedly important, however, I wanted to come across something I didn't already know. It was stated earlier that animal protein can stimulate cancer promotion, but why? What happens on the cellular level? What are the mechanisms? Perhaps they're still unclear, however, correlation -no matter how strong they might be- do not equal causation! Bearing in mind that cancer is a multi-factorial disease, it is very hard to conclude that diet can reverse -or even inhibit- such a complicated process, unless we know exactly how it happens. Same thing could be said for autoimmune diseases. Nonetheless, this book contained some valuable information, such as:Consuming diets high in protein and fat transfers calories away from their conversion into body heat to their storage form -as body fat (unless severe calorie restriction is causing weight loss). In contrast, diets low in protein and fat cause calories to be ""lost"" as body heat. In research, we say that storing more calories as fat and losing less as heat means being more efficient. I bet that you would rather be a little more inefficient and convert it into body heat rather than body fat, right?Well, simply consuming a diet lower in fat and protein can do this.--------Plant-based foods are linked to lower blood cholesterol; animal-based foods are linked to higher blood cholesterol. Animal-based foods are linked to higher breast cancer rates; plant-based foods are linked to lower rates. Fiber and antioxidants from plants are linked to a lower risk of cancers of the digestive tract. Plant-based diets and active lifestyles result in a healthy weight, yet permit people to become big and strong. -----------Now we can combine some really interesting observations on body weight. A plant-based diet operates on calorie balance to keep body weight under control in two ways. First, it discharges calories as body heat instead of storing them as body fat, and it doesn't take many calories to make a big difference over the course of a year. Second, a plant-based diet encourages more physical activity. And, as body weight goesdown, it becomes easier to be physically active. Diet and exercise work together to decrease body weight and improve overall health.-----------------Insulin-like Growth Factor 1 (IGF-l), is turning out to be a predictor of cancer just as cholesterol is a predictor for heart disease.Under normal conditions, this hormone efficiently manages the rates at which cells ""grow""-that is, how they reproduce themselves and how they discard old cells, all in the name of good health.Under unhealthy conditions, however, IGF-l becomes more active, increasing the birth and growth of new cells while simultaneously inhibiting the removal of old cells, both of which favor the development of cancer. So what does this have to do with the food we eat? It turns out that consuming animal-based foods increases the blood levels of this growth hormone.There's more: when men also have low blood levels of a protein that binds and inactivates IGF-I, they will have 9.5 times the risk of advanced-stage prostate cancer, let's put a few stars by these numbers. They are big and impressive-and fundamental to this finding is the fact that we make more IGF-I when we consume animal based foods like meat and dairy.The second mechanism relates to vitamin D metabolism. This ""vitamin"" is not a nutrient that we need to consume. Our body can make all that we need simply by being in sunlight fifteen to thirty minutes every couple of days. In addition to the production of vitamin D being afffected by sunlight, it is also affected by the food that we eat. The formation of the most active form of vitamin D is a process that is closely monitored and controlled by our bodies.This active or ""supercharged"" D produces many benefits throughout the body, including the prevention of cancer, autoimmune diseases and diseases like osteoporosis.Animal protein that we consume has the tendency to block the production of supercharged D, leaving the body with low levels of this vitamin D in the blood. If these low levels persist, prostate cancer can result. Also, persistently high intakes of calcium create an environment where supercharged D declines, thus adding to the problem.-----------In the last third or so it moves to the relationship between science, industry and government. I was shocked at the fact that personal profit plays a huge role in withholding scientific information from the public. Dairy, meat and fast food industries don't want people to switch to a plant-based diet since that will damage their business. So they will do whatever they can to discredit, prevent or refute any scientific research advocating such a diet. Drug companies will use reductionism, that is, isolating certain nutrients as beneficial for health, and start promoting supplements to gain money. Doctors care more about their ego and old maps of thinking instead of trying to accept valid discoveries about nutrition and disease, they will go to great lengths to avoid prescribing such an economically efficient, health-friendly diet to their patients, and to even greater lengths to prove that drugs and surgery are the answer to health problems, despite the accumulating evidence that this is not the case. It turns out that the link between diet and disease has been established a very long time ago. In a conversation between Socrates and Glaucon written by Plato, Plato clearly states that ""we shall eat animals only at our own peril. Though it is indeed remarkable that one of the greatest intellectuals in the history of the Western world condemned meat eating almost 2,500 years ago, I find it even more remarkable that few know about this history. Hardly anybody knows, for example, that the father of Western medicine, Hippocrates, advocated diet as the chief way to prevent and treat disease or that George Macilwain knew that diet was the way to prevent and treat disease or that the man instrumental in founding the American Cancer Society, Frederick L. Hoffman, knew that diet was the way to prevent and treat disease.How did Plato predict the future so accurately? He knew that consuming animal foods would not lead to true health and prosperity. Instead, the false sense of rich luxury granted by being able to eat animals would only lead to a culture of sickness, disease, land disputes, lawyersand doctors. This is a pretty good description of some of the challenges faced by modern America""All in all, although this book wasn't really about the China Study, it provided good insights on the effect of animal protein on various diseases. It also proved that not all medical/industrial figures operate with our best interests at heart, so one should be wary of statements in favour of dairy and meat. Until conclusive evidence is found on the merits of animal protein -which I doubt will happen- I'm going to remain a vegetarian consuming mostly raw plants, and hope for the best. A final quote from The China Study:""I believe the world is finally ready to change. We have reached a point in our history where our bad habits can no longer be tolerated. We, as a society, are on the edge of a great precipice: we can fall to sickness, poverty and degradation, or wecan embrace health, longevity and bounty. And all it takes is the courage to change. How will our grandchildren find themselves in 100 years?Only time will tell, but I hope that the history we are witnessing and the future that lies ahead will be to the benefit of us all."""

We start off with the usual Pollan-esque call to disregard looking at individual nutrients and just eat whole foods. Wait, scratch that, protein is bad! Oh sorry, I mean, animal protein is bad! Oh whoops, my mistake, I only did my experiments using casein and rats and from there extrapolated that all the animal protein ever will give you the super-cancer. It is at this point that I stopped reading. I didn't even get to the China Project itself.I like to think I'm open to new ideas, but those ideas really need to be backed up with something a bit more substantial. I totally buy that a whole foods diet, especially one rich in vegetables, is best. In fact, I don't know anyone who disagrees with that one. The other parts are all quibble-worthy, and I'm constantly learning new things and changing perceptions of things I had taken for granted. All in all, I spent more time reading what other people had to say about this book than actually reading the book. If you're looking for a good takedown, look for Anthony Colpo's. "

Challenging the current scientific paradigm, biochemist T.

It thought it was very well written. I enjoyed all of the research articles, and could easily understand the conclusions the authors were trying to make. This book does have an agenda, and a certain point of view. What I'm trying to get at is there is a bias, so take it with a grain of salt."
19,1932100660,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2199404-andy,1,"The authors could be right about the benefits of a vegan diet, but ""The China Study"" is not strong evidence for their argument. Basically they state that poor, rural Chinese people have low levels of cancer and heart disease [no surprise there for a pre-industrialization population], then make this huge logic leap that the explanation is low animal protein intake. How do they know it's not one of many other possible explanations? For instance, how do they know animal protein intake isn't just a marker for overall ""Westernization""? They don't even try to sort this out. If you just read the Wikipedia page about epidemiology (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epidemio...), you could design better research than ""the China Study."" In addition to the glaringly obvious failure to control for smoking, for example, there are many other problems with their methods.-It's hard to believe, but from what I could understand, they pooled all the blood together from 50 people at a time (not the results-the actual blood!!!). From a medical lab testing standpoint, this is not kosher. It's not comparable with other research. Who does that? Would you do that? Please tell me if I'm wrong about this because it's painful to think about. -The pooling of blood means their sample size is not 6,500 as advertised, but really 150 (6,500 divided by 50). -They look at a very very big number of variables (367) relative to their sample size. This is a red flag for ""data torture."" -They did not get detailed diet histories on all the people because they thought diet histories were not reliable. Uh, this is a diet study!-They use (the bizarrely obtained) blood tests as surrogates for dietary intake, assuming that they can tell from a blood sample what a village's intake of various nutrients was. Again, who does this? If you're going to invent an unorthodox new way to measure something, you need first to show that it is as accurate as standard measures. -They assume that diet has not changed in the villages in the 60 years since the childhood of the people being tested. -They are not in fact comparing Chinese with American people, since they have no American people in the study. -Within the Chinese people, according to their assumptions, few have a high-animal-protein diet, so it's hard for them to compare high/low levels of their main variable, yet that would be necessary for saying something about their hypothesis. -I could go on...The following book summarizes various nutrition studies that are more rigorous and informative. 

These books cover some basics of health research design.

20,1932100660,http://goodreads.com/user/show/47188780-kathleen,4,"This is the science supporting a Whole Foods Plant-Based Diet. It is compelling and filled with study after study on how diet dramatically affects one’s likelihood of getting cancer, suffering heart disease, developing diabetes and contracting many more chronic illnesses associated with a Western diet.Of note, the Campbells are not fans of vitamin supplements as they are “never the same as eating the whole food, which provides the natural network of health-supporting nutrients”. Further, they recommend eating a panoply of fruits and vegetables—the greater the variety, the better.Dr. Campbell is not afraid of challenging agribusiness with its powerful clout in Government and business. In fact, he is a bit of a curmudgeon concerning the marketing of meat and dairy, and the tendency of the media to promote a specific ingredient or food component (eg., Lycopene, olive oil) as being the means to combat disease. These rants comprise the last third of the book.Regardless, this is an inspiring book to move to a low-fat Whole Food Plant-Based diet. Recommend."
21,1932100660,http://goodreads.com/user/show/779321-chanelle,5,"This is a must-read for every American. You will love and hate reading this book at the same time, because once you are presented with the facts about how our Western diet is killing us, you will never be the same. This book provoked me to read more and more about it, and after all the reading I've done on the benefits of a plant based diet, my shopping list to the grocery store is forever changed.I've always tried to eat from a spiritual point of view, I figure we are only supposed to eat the things that the Earth provides for us, and I included animals in the picture, but only sparingly. I was under the assumption, like most Americans, that you need animals for protein. I've had my eyes opened though, and now know that we don't need animal protein at all, and the high quantities of it in our diet is actually what is making us fat and killing us! The fact that we all buy into the belief that we get protein from meat is all a result of a brilliant marketing plan by the meat industry, very well done on their part. I personally had no idea that you get much more, and much better protein from plants.I am so grateful for this book, although as I was reading it, I knew my life was changing. Before reading this book, I had toyed with the idea of trying a vegan/vegetarian diet, and now this book was the tipping point for me. I really have enjoyed searching out new recipes featuring veggies as the spotlight instead of the afterthought on the plate. Who knew they were so good!! Another book I'd recommend is ""In Defense of Food"" by Michael Pollan."
22,1932100660,http://goodreads.com/user/show/47804-roxanne,5,"Several prior reviews give excellent and extensive critiques of the methods and assumptions made in this book. I won't reiterate them, I'll just add my own thoughts.Dr. Campbell doesn't recommend fanatical adherence to a vegan lifestyle. While he does suggest that it's easier to eat 0% animal protein than it is to eat 5%, he also suggests relaxing about incidental animal products that may be found hiding in food (meat soup stocks and egg in baked goods, e.g.). This is not in keeping with PETA's rigid stance. He also (very briefly) defends the animal experimentation that led him to pursue a lifetime of dietary inquiry; also not PETA party line. His recommendation is to relax, but not to plan for meaty meals. Others have mentioned that he makes the leap from very low animal protein to zero, and I agree this is a valid criticism. Campbell does address this, and admits there is no zero-animal data for his claim. However, even forward-thinking doctors do not usually believe that their patients will follow a meatless diet, and so may not prescribe one. A low-meat diet may be considered as radical as is practical. I'd love to see a prospective study of vegans; what a coup that would be.He does not discuss fish, yea or nay. A personal story he includes from a friend involves the incidental consumption of fish paste in some foods he enjoyed while improving his health. I would have preferred more discussion of fish. His studies mainly implicate dairy.All in all, the book is powerful enough to have sent me back to a nearly-vegan lifestyle. I'm not giving up the fish oil yet. In the past, I found eating fish to be a slippery slope, food-with-a-face-wise, but I feel like fish oil's place in my diet is important. I'll stay open."

24,1932100660,http://goodreads.com/user/show/13244359-donna,3,"Update 2nd read: I think I liked this one more than the first time I read it. Parts were still annoying, but I enjoyed his dedication to his field. ------------------------There were things I really appreciated about this book and then there were things that really pushed my buttons. So where to start?The good:I liked the passion the author has for this topic. He has dedicated his life to research so that he can better educate people (and all health care professionals) on obtaining and sustaining health through a plant based diet. I liked the research aspect of this, but it was peppered with so many of my pet peeves, the eye rolling was getting out of hand.The bad: While I can appreciate his own work in the research field, I had a hard time with all of the finger pointing and nay saying. He put down EVERYONE and their research that differed from his own. This felt like a whistle blowing book, but I have to wonder, if his intended audience (meaning the general public) is really the right target for that kind of thing. I know that I'm not that audience. I just want info and then I can make a choice, if anything here could be implemented on my part. His own personal fight with the medical community at large and his lack of acceptance in that community would have been better suited for an autobiography.He tried to clarify the conflicting data that exists out in the research-universe.....eat this, then someone says, ""No, don't eat that,"" ......do this, then someone says, ""Don't do that."" While he brought it up a few times, he never answered the questions he posed. He also used scare tactics. It reminded me of another book I've read recently on this same thing and they also used scare tactics. But instead of being up in arms about eggs and chicken, this author chose ""DAIRY"" as his do-not-eat platform. And instead of every one dying of diabetes and Alzheimers, in this book it was cancer and diabetes. Was this new information? No, even though he made it sound like he is the only one sailing the ""nutrition"" ship. I can give this 3 stars for the overall message of eating whole foods. I just didn't appreciate having to wade through the negative stuff. I don't think one has to slam others to elevate their message. It usually has the opposite effect on me. I need to stop here because now I'm thinking 2 stars."
25,1932100660,http://goodreads.com/user/show/796425-jeanette-again,5,"This book changed my life, literally. The writing is a bit scholarly at times, but worth working your way through for the information.Previous reviews give enough info, so I won't duplicate.I strongly suggest Eat to Live by Joel Fuhrman, M.D. as the ideal companion to The China Study. Fuhrman clears up anything that might have been confusing in The China Study, and explains the best way to choose your foods for nutrient density."
26,1932100660,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1645403-ana,5,"Eat to Live (by Joel Fuhrman) mentioned this book/study more than a few times so I checked it out. Wow. We have changed a lot of things in our diet because of this book. Not only do meat and milk have a lot of calories but they are loaded with cholesterol and cancer feeding properties. So glad I read this. I can't say enough about this book. It basically backs up the diet that Daniel in the OT ate and is right in line with the Word of Wisdom--lots of fruits, vegetables, grain and legumes and little (if any) meat. The show ""Forks Over Knives"" is an abbreviated version of The Cancer Study. We watched it on netflix then had our kids watch it. Our teenage sons quit whining about going to a mostly vegetarian diet once they saw this and I noticed that when we had potatoes one of them chose butter buds over butter to put on his. When I started cutting meat and dairy from my diet four months ago it was to lose weight but I didn't think much about how it would help my heart, circulatory system, mind, eyes, etc. Now (after losing 21 lbs) I feel very differently. I feel better and have more energy and feel very keenly the importance of taking care of my body and not trashing it with the typical American diet. I don't mean to offend anyone who eats the high fat, high meat and dairy diet most Americans eat but there it is. Most Americans are overweight and suffering from one (or more) chronic conditions like heart disease, diabetes or cancer. It does NOT have to be that way!"

Having said that, it is not nearly as dry as a text book, but definitely puts forth more data for the reader versus hiding it in the bibliography.

People who love their meat are often turned off by it, but I he has strong scientific basis (which he conducted himself) to support what he is saying about an optimal diet. After reading this book I know that I will no longer have any problems with weight. Also, I found a greater motivation to eat healthy besides losing weight, and that is to prevent disease. The correlations between food and heart disease, obesity, diabetes, autoimmune diseases and cancer are astounding. As Campbell said the solutions to many diseases is ""at the end of our forks."" I eat now to do my part in preventing these diseases for me and my family. It was truly a life changing book for me. I hope others appreciate his life work as well. "

Almost all of the programs are no charge to the clients. A few things cost such as the 5K run/3K walk or the occasional fundraising banquet sponsored by such corporate organizations as McDonald’s.

31,1932100660,http://goodreads.com/user/show/15681284-greg,4,"Basically a book about veganism. First 1/3 to 1/2 is very interesting. Basically correlates increased animal protein consumption (which in itself is correlated to how ""advanced"" countries are) to increases in the Western diseases (cancer, heart disease, etc). Shows correlations both across countries, and over time. Basic premise of the book is that our shitty health is a direct result of overconsumption of animal protein. Animal protein in developing nations is more like a treat, and the Western diseases are almost unheard of in those areas. Also debunks some myths about vegetarianism (mainly, not being able to get enough protein).- animal protein converts directly into growth for the human body. Great when you're a kid (explains why we're so big while everyone else is so small and skinny), but mostly unnecessary once you're grown- book starts with meat, but eventually attacks all types of animal protein (e.g. dairy, eggs)The main problem of the book is that it starts overreaching, and making insane claims that vegetarianism is the cure for everything. This is hard to believe for several reasons- there is no discussion about processed foods, which are also a staple of Western diets but not developing nations- even though people in developing nations may not be suffering from Western diseases, they are by no means healthy. Some researchers have described such people as riddled with a lifetime of disease and infection- the rhetoric against animal protein gets excessive, with the author eventually advocating against all types of animal protein. Yet many primitive and developing cultures eat such animal proteins without adverse effects.- the author essentially claims that all diseases (hear, obesity, diabetes, cancer, autoimmune, etc) can be cured by cutting meat out of the diet. There may be some truth to this, but I doubt it's that simple. Again, what about processed foods?"

I never stopped to think about it, but all the diseases that developed countries get that undeveloped countries don't are pretty much due to the differences in our diets. These disease include heart disease, diabetes, cancer, macular degeneration, autoimmune disorders like MS, Lupus, rheumatoid arthritis, ankylosing spondilitis, etc. Alzheimer's, and other chronic inflammatory diseases. There's massive evidence that all of these diseases plus obesity can be prevented and reversed by eating a whole foods plant based diet. That's all you need to know. Now I've saved you buying the book. But if you aren't convinced, read it and see.I've changed my diet over to one that's entirely plant based, and already I feel much better.

It is not, however, preachy, and even meat lovers will gain some good information related to thier diet and long term health."
34,1932100660,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5496066-ashley,1,"I read this book ages and ages ago. I was experimenting with different diets while trying to manage a health issue, including vegetarian, meanwhile my mom was testing out raw veganism. I was curious. Why didn’t I review it then? Well, partly because I took an awful lot of notes I’d now have to sift through, but mostly because I didn’t want to step on any toes. People have very strong opinions on the subject….and I super don’t care what those opinions or choices are. By that I mean I an not interested in a debate, or even a discussion really. I don't read in order to tell others what to do. Why review now? Like I said, I took a lot of notes. Pages and pages. Pages I’d like to throw away now. Besides, there’s a few other books that take incidentally opposing views (meaning I didn't have a vendetta or anything) that I’ve read and would like to review without being accused of being unfair. But first, a disclaimer. I don’t care what you eat. You shouldn’t care what I eat. I make my dietary choices based on personal research and experience. I’ll go ahead and assume you have as well. Look at us...being adults. Did we make different decisions? Maybe. As you may have guessed by the number of stars, I didn’t find this book in the least bit convincing and have not adopted the recommended lifestyle. That doesn’t mean I think everyone should eat like I do. Gracious no. We’re all different. Lest you think I’m clueless: my family is unusually full of vegans and vegetarians going back generations. My husband and I even tried it. It was a disaster. So. Do I believe it’s the diet for some people? Absolutely (though if you’re living on French fries and processed fake meat get out of my face, I'm not talking to or about you)!! Especially the very sedentary. But not everyone. I also very much don’t approve of any making life altering decisions based on hysteria inducing documentaries (which most reputable nutritionists would agree with), or social media. However: I don’t fall for ads, I don’t buy processed foods. If you were to look in my grocery cart the basket is full of colorful, fresh, locally grown veggies. Just listening to my body I generally don't eat meat about half the time. The review:I think this is one of those books where if you are already convinced that veganism is the way to go, you will feel vindicated, justified, superior. If you aren’t convinced, you will see the holes in the science. This book was written several years ago. Diet books don’t usually hold up well over time. That is, unless the book says: exercise, drink water, get sleep, eat a wide variety of non processed food in moderation. Books don’t usually say that though. People want some sort of diet to ascribe to. Some authority that says what is right and what is wrong. Some science is sketchy right away, some is absolutely legit and has withstood the test of time. Much of it has been disproved in other clinics. For example the ‘eat clean’ movement (which holds truth at it‘s core but has morphed into an entirely different beast), or most of the comments about cholesterol and sugar.The book is called the China Study. It is barely about the china study. It’s more of a collection of rants by a paranoid man who thinks the government and doctors everywhere are out to get him. He does include a few pages of his research. I kept waiting for him to get to the conclusive part. Colin T. Campbell. Isn’t it ironic that the author of the' vegan Bible' is himself, not vegan. He has gone on record saying he doesn’t identify with vegans and in this book he even says he usually doesn’t consume animal based foods, but on rare occasions he does. He advocates whole, plant based diet, devoid of nutrient supplements. I do agree if your diet leaves a hole that needs to be filled with a vitamin, it’s wrong. Our food should fill all our needs (it‘s also a little odd that later in the book he recommends vegans take B12 and vitamin D when he rants against any supplements earlier). Also he isn’t an animal rights activist. He comes out and defends his use of thousands of rats in his study. How a plant based diet became synonymous with vegan I don’t know. I’d consider myself plant based, it is what I mostly eat after all. And I'm not the only one confused. Recently I saw a headline to the effect of: scientists find a plant based diet decreases heart disease! 'Interesting,' I thought. And read the article. Here's the description of the diet they considered plant based: ""Lead researcher Dr Kyla Lara, from Mount Sinai Hospital in New York, said: “Eating a diet mostly of dark green leafy plants, fruits, beans, whole grains and fish, while limiting processed meats, saturated fats, trans fats, refined carbohydrates and foods high in added sugars is a heart-healthy lifestyle and may specifically help prevent heart failure if you don't already have it.”'... Sooooo exactly how I eat, but not the diet Campbell suggests. I do think a lot of his research has been misrepresented, and I suspect there’s a lot of people who use the China study as their reason for veganism, but who actually never finished the book. For example when he promotes a high carb diet, he’s not saying go get yourself a frozen vegan lasagna, tofu burger, or eat a package of Oreos. In fact he’d be horrified if you read his research and did so. So much of the book is the author listing credentials and inflating the ego of his readers. Anyone who doesn’t follow his lifestyle are simple minded sheep, but those who agree are obviously more intelligent. He attacks other people who have promoted books while doing the same himself. He appeals to the readers vanity. He says those who want proof will be ‘disappointed and confused’ but those ‘seeking truth’ will be amazed and enlightened. Well…yeah I want proof. That doesn’t seem unreasonable...Campbell goes on and on about how he studied this for 27 years! That seems like a long time but in reality it is considered as not nearly a long enough period of time to form the majority of his conclusions. In fact it’s a common complaint of researchers that to form real conclusions diets should be studied over generations. As in about 100 years minimum. At one point he actually talks about how he finds a shortcut to help him not spend a lifetime in research. Fact is it would have to be a lifetime study to hold weight. So his claims of being able to deliver a longer life, are completely unsubstantiated. And maybe this is where my life influences my view. My bologna loving great grandma recently died at age 100. It’s her lifelong vegetarian sons that have been plagued with cancer, clogged arteries, diabetes, and heart disease. I laughed when he quoted the Indian physician McCay that said Indian forces who ate less protein were weak and thus lost to the British. He’s laughed at. Dr. Campbell mocks him. You know who said the same thing, only more forcefully? Gandhi. Why not quote him? Oh right, because he’s supposed to be the saintly father of modern veganism. The fact that he periodically 'took a break' is ignored. I digress. So. The science. Other more educated (and vegan) reviewers also found the science sorely lacking, so don’t think I’m being a jerk. I compared my notes with theirs, skipping the meat eaters, before writing mine. The author says ‘Correlation does not equal causation‘ so many times, but only when convenient, only when it disproves one of his opinions. There rest of the time he happily views correlation as causation. Straight away (page 5?) there’s a problem. Two groups of rats. Both given the toxin aflatoxin. One group was given a diet of 20% protein (derived from milk), the other 5% protein. The lower protein group did better and the author concluded ‘Tada’ nutrition trumps chemical carcinogens. Obviously protein is the killer! No so fast. This is overlooking how the body synthesizes anything. You aren’t testing protein, good or bad- but rather if a and b mix is it bad. The answer is yes. A+b is bad. But what if I don’t have enough ‘A’ to allow the reaction to continue for long? Now those results are vastly improved because the chemical reaction has been cut short. So the protein isn’t a killer. Aflatoxin plus protein is (A+B). And where do we even get aflatoxin? Foods like peanuts, legumes, soy, quinoa, nuts, corn. Interestingly the circumstances that cause it to develop are mostly in Africa and Asia, it’s more highly regulated here. So his entire study is based in a location that has a toxin we know reacts with protein, but that isn’t much of an issue here. Chinese are consuming a toxin that when combined with protein will make them develop cancer? Can’t imagine how that will change data (I'm rolling my eyes). By the way. Aflatoxin is formed when food is piled and left to break down. Symptoms of aflatoxin exposure: food allergies, autoimmune disease, inflammation affecting the heart, damage to liver and kidneys, viral hepatitis, growth impairment. The author says don’t worry about this toxin. Don’t eat animal protein. In my mind a better conclusion to draw would be, we need better farming and food storage techniques. Eat fresh. Adding detoxifying foods like carrots and celery need to be promoted. He says this was the defining moment of his career, yet it seems flawed. His finding wasn’t that protein causes cancer, but that if you ingest high levels of aflatoxin AND protein, you increase your risk of cancer. In this case protein acts as the enzyme that unlocks the cancer causing powers. But without the lock, the key is worthless. That is basic high school biology. And the protein that is the most effective key? Casein. The rats who didn’t get cancer were on a low, NOT zero, animal protein diet. This suggests a simple reduction would be enough. Often times in biology a lot of something will kill you, a little will help you, and none will kill you. The later studies of Casein all are cancer causing only with a common element, a liver damaging disease. Campbell acknowledges it was Rats dosed with Aflatoxin or suffering from HBV that reacted to casein that way. Later he points to how rats dosed with known carcinogens also developed cancer. Shocking…? Campbell says things like “casein, and likely all animal proteins”. Hold up. No. There is no scientific proof that you have offered so I’m going to need you to stick with what your research has shown. Every test he did was done with Casein, a milk protein. There’s also the fact that rats actually don’t digest milk well, so are they sick because it's dairy? Maybe try something they'd actually eat. When referring to yet another liver damaging virus that when exposed to casein can cause cancer he says: “the virus provides the gun, the bad nutrition pulls the trigger.” Well wouldn’t it be better to remove the gun, in this case hepatitis B? No gun, no trigger, no problem. Some conclusions seems silly. Being astounded that when the body took in less protein there were less enzymes (which are made up of proteins) and cells grow slower (enzymes trigger each step of cell division and protein forms genetic material). How are any of those conclusions shocking? And I found it so odd that one second he’s astounded that 100% of rats had cancer at two years old (the animal protein! The horror!), and a couple pages later openly states that’s exactly how long rats usually live before dying of cancer anyway. Wait so….what exactly did you prove? That with or without animal protein rats are probably going to die of cancer at about two years old? Yeah, I learned that in my Pre-vet class thanks.There were other issues. The sample size for the china study seems large, 6,500 adults. But it calculates out to be 100 people per county. It just isn’t large enough or long enough to know anything conclusive. In another study it was 18 people. There’s also his lengthy discussion of cholesterol. From what I’ve read elsewhere most doesn’t hold up. He talks about bad and good cholesterol, in fact recent studies have suggested there’s no such thing and pointed to a complete reversal of past beliefs of the subject. Cholesterol is a sort of blood vessel scab produced in the liver. It isn’t food derived. High cholesterol therefore would suggest damage the body is trying to repair. Now, here we see that all important organ, the liver again. Yet again a damaged liver and cholesterol production would be faulty, a faulty liver that we’ve already seen appears to be more supportive of cancer. Once again, the only thing his research suggests is those with a compromised liver should likely avoid casein. This was one of those times recent studies disprove his theories. Recently scientists have said it's sugar consumption that raises cholesterol. Another thing to remember is cholesterol is involved in hormones. Balanced hormones, balanced cholesterol. Have you noticed how many couples struggle with infertility?He makes other claims, not derived from his own research. Such as how we should all be on a high carb diet. Well, you can. Maybe your body would love it. Mine would shut down. It’s his blanket statements that bother me so much. Again, science has recently shown sugar (carbs!) can lead to cancer. In study after study the benefit was found in reduced amounts. In one study the participants could have egg white and yogurt. I’m not at all sure why such a study would be viewed as proof that we should be vegan. Again and again we read “near vegetarian”, “almost vegan”. Okay so lets say what they really are. Not vegetarian. Not vegan. He says things like, if being almost vegetarian worked so well, imagine how much better it would be to go full vegan. That’s not scientific. Basically study after study has proven moderation is key, and he’s pushing for more. When talking about obesity Campbell repeatedly refers to how some vegans and vegetarians carry less weight, yet study after study has proven those things are not connected. In fact the general consensus is that these are more health minded individuals. There is also a growing concern about those who have anorexic tendencies turning vegan. It's a lot more socially acceptable to say ""i can't eat that, I'm vegan"" than to say ""I can't eat that, I don't eat"".Campbell also acts like animal protein will definitely lead to Alzheimer’s. We know so little about the disease. Years of study and we can’t even slow it down, yet he acts like he’s got it all figured out. He talks about necessary nutrients found only in plants, but a recent study also found a protein found only in milk is a sort of prevention. It seems to me the solution would be…eat both! Campbell laments that we’ve left the wisdom of the past behind, when Greek athletes were vegetarian- This surprised me. It contradicts everything I thought I knew, so I looked it up. Sure enough…most greek athletes followed what we’d view as the Atkins diet. In fact one runner was so superior that his diet of meat only became a popular fad among the wealthy. Besides, even if they were all vegetarians...they weren't vegans, and I'm not a male athlete so it holds no relevance. At the end of the day, Dr Campbell himself said, “ do I think that the China Study findings constitute absolute scientific proof? Of course not.” and “it does not prove that diet causes disease” He also says: my advice is to try to eliminate all animal-based products from your diet, but not obsess over it. Good enough for me. He even acknowledges most of the health benefits are only proven for low, not ’no’, and that it very may well be you do receive all of the same benefits. The thing is, there are so many factors, and each of us are different. There is no one thing killing us, everything is. It makes me think of one recent study, that there’s more dementia found in people living near highways. How do you account for that sort of thing in research? How much is local diet, geography, or things we haven’t even thought of? As he says, ‘genes give us our predispositions” He even acknowledges some studies are showing there’s no relation between plant intake and cancer (such as colorectal cancer). Other sited studies showed no association between intake of meat or dairy products and breast cancer (strange when he all but said those were the actual cause). In fact he laments the study of one nutrient at a time, how that is flawed, making many of the same arguments I did when he was exclusively studying protein and casein. He says how important to view results in context, but never really does so himself. So where does this leave me? Well, when the author himself admits his book isn’t scientific proof, though he did effectively show to eat in moderation and protect your liver…that’s just what I’m going to do. This book isn’t interested in the morals of whether or not you eat meat. And that was refreshing (each of us have our own belief system which often influences our morals. For me I believe it belongs only to God to determine what is right and wrong, good and bad, moral and immoral, cruel or kind. That’s all I have to say about the subject here.)One last thing. I’m going to let you in on a open farming secret. Farmers…they just want to make a living. Whether they be animal or vegetable farmers. If all of a sudden vegan meals are popular, guess who they’ll cater to? They’ll re-brand as sustainable, cruelty free, etc. As many of the popular buzz words as possible. I was raised on a potato farm. All of a sudden they’re being advertised as gluten free. Uh…yeah. Since always. They basically can say whatever they want because most of those words do not have strict government guidelines for their use. The author seems to be under the mistaken impression vegetables are “low profit”. The wealthiest farmers I know are vegetable farmers. One farm in particular owns more land than some countries. A farm will grow a lot of one crop. But, nature doesn’t like to be that crowded. Just like in humans it encourages the spread of disease. So you have to spray for bugs. You have to shoot natural foragers. Farmers are allowed to hunt year round in most areas. It’s called a nuisance permit. So basically, if you buy your food from a major brand, an animal was killed. End of story. Be that the orangutans and rhinos of Indonesia who are losing their habitat for palm oil, or 'just' regular deer and woodchucks. Many ecologists agree the most sustainable food production would involve free range livestock in areas unsuitable for farming. So to me, promoting any sort of exclusive diet does damage to the environment, be that a meat heavy or zero meat diet.I have a cousin who is a licensed practitioner of Chinese medicine. He traveled all over China. I asked him if he felt the Chinese people are more healthy. He laughed. I asked if vegan Chinese are the most healthy. He laughed harder. And not in a delighted 'I found the secret to living forever and am so excited' kind of way. At the end of the day, we all have to make our own choice. Some will choose veganism and be delighted with the results. Other's won't. It's important for all of us to accept we're different and capable of forming our own decisions for our own body. Doesn't make either party better.PS-Please don't send me hate mail. I didn't include all my reasons for not being vegan. But I have more and they are valid. I don't want to debate or discuss or be belittled or condecended to."

Most of the dietary advice I already do, but I do think some take this too far to the extreme. I don't think it's because of the author though. Plz consider having a look at my vlog and subscribing: Youtube: Diary of a Speed Reader IG: WhereIsMayLingPreface 1: Diet books are perennial best sellers. Almost every popular magazine features nutrition advice, newspapers regularly run articles, and TV and radio programs constantly discuss diet and health.Preface: We spend far more, per capita, on health care than any other society in the world, yet two-thirds of Americans are overweight, and over 25 million Americans have diabetes, an increase of about 10 million since the first edition of this book.Intro: In the other group, they administered the same amount of aflatoxin, but then fed a diet that was only composed of 5% protein. Incredibly, every single animal that consumed the 20% protein diet had evidence of liver cancer, and every single animal that consumed a 5% protein diet avoided liver cancer. It was a 100 to 0 score, leaving no doubt that nutrition trumped chemical carcinogens, even very potent carcinogens, in controlling cancer.Intro: What protein consistently and strongly promoted cancer? Casein, which makes up 87% of cow’s milk protein, promoted all stages of the cancer process. What type of protein did not promote cancer, even at high levels of intake? The safe proteins were from plants, including wheat and soy. As this picture came into view, it began to challenge and then to shatter some of my most cherished assumptions.p. 4 ""Contrary to what many believe, cancer is not a natural event. Adopting a healthy diet and lifestyle can prevent a sizable number of cancers in the United States. Old age can and should be graceful and peaceful.""This might be extreme language. Wish he would have demonstrated in animals or something else to prove the statementP. 21"" They function as enzymes, hormones, structural tissue, and transport molecules, all of which make life possible. Proteins are constructed as long chains of hundreds or thousands of amino acids, of which there are fifteen to twenty different kinds, depending on how they are counted.""P. 22 ""The answer is human flesh. Its protein has just the right proportionate amounts of the needed amino acids. But while our fellow men and women are not for dinner, we do get the next “best” protein by eating other animals. The proteins of other animals are very similar to our proteins because they mostly have the right proportionate amounts of each of the needed amino acids. These proteins can be used very efficiently and therefore are called “high quality.” Among animal foods, the proteins of milk and eggs represent the best amino acid matches for our proteins, and thus are considered the highest quality. While the “lower quality” plant proteins may be lacking in one or more of the essential amino acids, as a group they do contain all of them. The concept of quality really means the efficiency with which food proteins are used to promote growth. This would be well and good if the greatest efficiency equaled the greatest health, but it doesn’t, and that’s why the terms efficiency and quality"" This relationship between materials to make a human and efficiently. Intriguing in light of the bill bryson book.p. 26 There was, however, a nagging problem with these tasty legumes. Considerable evidence had been emerging, first from England8–10 and later from MIT (the same lab that I had worked in),11,12 to show that peanuts often were contaminated with a fungus-produced toxin called aflatoxin (AF). It was an alarming problem because AF was being shown to cause liver cancer in rats. It was said to be the most potent chemical carcinogen ever discovered. So we had to tackle two closely related projects: alleviate childhood malnutrition and resolve the AF contamination problem.p. 28The families with the most money ate what we thought were the healthiest diets, the diets most like our own meaty American diets. They consumed more protein than anyone else in the country (high-quality animal protein, at that), and yet they were the ones getting liver cancer!p. 30 As we do observational and interventional research, we begin to amass the findings and weigh the evidence for or against a certain hypothesis. When the weight of the evidence favors an idea so strongly that it can no longer be plausibly denied, we advance the idea as a likely truth. It is in this way that I am advancing an argument for a whole foods, plant-based diet (WFPB). As you continue reading, realize that those seeking absolute proof of optimal nutrition in one or two studies will be disappointed and confused.p. 59 - The abstractp. 76Many studies have shown that earlier menarche leads to higher risk for breast cancer.37 Menarche is triggered by the growth rate of the girl; the faster the growth, the earlier the age of onset. It also is well established that rapid growth of young girls often leads to greater adult body height and more body weight and body fatness, each of which is associated with higher breast cancer risk. Early age of menarche, both in Chinese and in Western women, also leads to higher levels of blood hormones such asp. 77 Nonetheless, when hormone levels among Chinese women were compared with those of British women,41 Chinese estrogen levels were only about one-half those of the British women, who have an equivalent hormone profile to that of American women. Because the length of the reproductive life of a Chinese woman is only about 75% of that of the British (or American) woman, this means that with lower estrogen levels, the Chinese woman only experiences about 35–40% of the lifetime estrogen exposure of British (and American) women. This corresponds to Chinese breast cancer rates that are only one-fifth of ...morep. 84 The authors of these books advocate keeping dietary carbohydrates as low as 15–20% of total calories. By definition, this means that they are advocating very high-fat, very high-protein diets; the only way to make up the other 80–85% of calories is through fat and protein. Fifty percent of the calories in the standard American diet already comes from fat and protein, and these books’ agenda is to raise that number even further.p. 92 There is, however, a problem with the idea that consuming animal-based foods is a good way of becoming bigger. The people who eat the most animal protein have the most heart disease, cancer, and diabetes. In the China Study, for example, animal protein consumption was associated with taller and heavierI people, but was also associated with higher levels of total and bad cholesterol.II Furthermore, body weight, associated with animal protein intake,I was associated with more cancerII–III and more coronary heart disease.II It seems that being bigger, and presumably better, comes with very high costs. But might it be possible for us to achieve our full growth potential, while simultaneously minimizing disease risks? (less)p. 97Virtually all of the evidence on how diet and nutrition works to produce health or disease is reductionist evidence because reductionism is the normal strategy for doing this researchp. 195Something is amiss, though, because those countries that use the most cow’s milk and its products also have the highest fracture rates and the worst bone health. One possible explanation is found in a report showing an impressively strong association between animal protein intake and bone fracture rate for women in different countries.2 Authored in 1992 by researchers at Yale University School of Medicine, the report summarized data on protein intake and fracture rates taken from thirty-four separate surveys in sixteen countries that were published in twenty-nine peer-reviewed research ...morep. 331 John finished his formal medical education having had only one hour of nutrition instruction, which involved learning which infant formulas to use. His experience confirms every study that has found nutrition training among physicians to be sorely inadequate."

I have been interested in this subject lately, so the information in the book was good BUT so very boring to read, no practical applications provided, and the author was so annoying (he lets you know about every 3rd page what a distinguished researcher he is and how amazing his work is or give you the stats on his distinguished collegues) I haven't actually finished it and probably never will.

42,1932100660,http://goodreads.com/user/show/135430-lauren,4,"I'm really glad to have finally read this book. I bought it a while back, but had put off reading it because it looked fairly dull. (I know, judge a book by the cover, right?) However, between a friend telling me how it converted her parents to a more meat free lifestyle, and a few people question why I'm not drinking milk and warning me about how dangerous it is (despite my nutritionist saying the *only* reason I'd need milk at this point is to gain weight faster, which is something she says I don't need to do), I figured it was time to dive into the book. And it was good! It's far more engaging and narrative than the cover would lead you to expect. It's full of all kinds of information based on many, many studies (the references section is 35 pages long). And it all jives with what I have learned to be true since researching diet and vegan health (for about the last 10 years now). I would warn readers, though, that the author might come across as conceited, simplistic, and naive. He goes on and on (throughout the book) about the awards and honors he's had. I totally get it; he has to build credibility for his research and case. I just don't typically like that type of self-aggrandizing. He also simplifies information a lot, and at times comes across as naive. I completely get that he needs to simplify the findings. Otherwise, it'd be a book written for scientists rather than us ""regular"" folks. But the over simplification made it seem like the ideas might be simple, too, or maybe the research was to start with. Towards the end he came across as naive when he talked about the science/medical/government industries that impact food. I find it hard to believe he'd be that naive after graduate school... maybe it's just that he wants to explain things to others who might be, so he couched it that way. But, really. Of course there are lobbyist working for the animal industries which go on to impact governmental reports and what research is funded. Despite feeling that the author was a bit egotistical, simple, and maybe naive, the information was very good and thorough. Many studies he cited had me thinking, ""yes, but what about variable X,"" and then he would address that variable as well. The references section cites many recent articles (to when the book was published) as well as a few older, more foundational ones. The basic summary of the book is: for your health you should eat more plants and whole foods; avoid animal proteins. So I'm feeling more confident than ever about the way I eat, and am actually trying to cut out more sugar and white flours as a result of reading this book. I wish I could share this book with some people I know with specific health issues described in the book, but I do think the writing would come across as too harsh and a bit like propaganda to just recommend to someone without their having an interest in it to start with. But for those who are concerned about things like heart disease, cancer, auto immune disorders, osteoporosis, (and on and on), and are interested in adapting their diet to avoid these illnesses, this book might just be for you.

43,1932100660,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1161667-shel,5,"The China Study provides a rebuttal to diet plans such as Atkins and South Beach, but tellingly it's not located on the same shelves as these books. You'll find it in the nutrition section. Campbell is to diet and nutrition advice what John Gottman is to relationship advice (a scientist who provides a reasoned analysis of what works after investing a lifetime of the research in the subject and walking the talk in his own life). It's sound advice not sensational.The China Study won't tell you anything you probably didn't already know or intuit about what to eat. Fruits, vegetables, and whole grains are good for you. Eat a variety. Don't go hungry. You can't get enough of these healthy foods.""Eating should be an enjoyable worry-free experience, and shouldn't rely on deprivation,"" Campbell says.What is startling though is how good these good foods are — so much so that the preventative effects of these foods trump genetics. They stave off heart disease and cancer. These and many other diseases are not inevitable, but can be prevented, even treated, by eating only healthy foods. Campbell makes the case in chapter after chapter of compelling research.For an interesting comparison read this with Ray Kurzweil and Terry Grossman's Fantastic Voyage: Live Long Enough to Live Forever. Kurzweil also argues that illness and infirmity are not inevitable with age although his approach relies on a barrage of supplements and technological innovation. Kurzweil says technology will save us whereas Campbell says nature provides. Noting the appetizing color of fruits and vegetables that contain the antioxidants, which shield our bodies from disease, Campbell says, ""Whether you believe in God, evolution or just coincidence, you must admit this is a beautiful, almost spiritual, example of nature's wisdom.""Campbell also offers some behind the scenes insight into how nutrition information gets researched and passed on to the public and why we get mixed messages and confusing information about what to eat. But ""good food and good health is simple,"" Campbell says. He boils all the studies and research down to one sentence, ""...eat a whole foods, plant-based diet, while minimizing the consumption of refined foods, added salt and added fats."""
44,1932100660,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4074458-kris,3,"The high-level message is: eat a vegan, whole foods diet. But I'm not quite sure what to think of this. Overall, it felt like a good read, and fairly scientific. There were parts that seemed somewhat iffy, skimming over details, and generally lumping together ""animal protein"" vs not, especially when I saw a table with noting in a comparison of ""animal protein*"", that * meant ""excluding fish"". So that became less clear. One thing about the book itself I didn't find especially useful was maybe 10-20% of it just talking about the problems with our establishment, both in terms of government, medicine, and some of the science/research/dietary literature. I mostly just skimmed over that commentary. It seems like this guy has a huge amount of data as his disposal, due to the study conducted, the main motivation behind this book, but then I still end up with some skepticism. So I start Googling around, as is probably worth doing after reading any sort of dietary/health book, and find that there's stuff all over the place. Lots of blatant haters of course, no surprise, but some fairly scientific, such as http://www.cholesterol-and-health.com.... But then there's a Wiki article which has mostly a summary and some things to its credit, https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Chi..., and then a JAMA article which supports it somewhat, but credits the idea of eating fish https://archinte.jamanetwork.com/arti.... One of the big points of disagreement that a few of these articles note is this detail on correlation between some dietary components and cancer, with animal protein being only very slightly correlated, and carbs being much more highly correlated. And that just leaves me wondering.Overall, like I said, not sure what to think - it seems with this, the more I read, the more there just seems to be very little agreement, and a wealth of uncertainty."
45,1932100660,http://goodreads.com/user/show/851962-ryan,4,"I would say this is an interesting (and possibly life-changing) book, but as with many books with a strong message, it is highly divisive. While the majority of people who have read it seem to respond favorably, it is far from the definitive work proving beyond a shadow of a doubt that veganism is the only path to good health. I think that the most important (and entirely accurate) message the average American could get from this book is to eat less animal protein and move towards more of a plant-based, whole foods diet. I really don't know how people can reasonably argue against that. The more difficult questions to answer, however, are: 1. How little animal protein should we eat? and 2. Is the level of animal protein in one's diet really the most important nutritional predictor of whether cancer or heart disease will develop? Although the author offers a reasonable amount of scientific evidence to support his answers (which are 0% and 'yes'), I think the data are still incomplete. The human body is far too complex to pin a staunch theoretical position on primarily correlational research (on humans). Further (non-partisan) research is certainly needed. In the meantime, however, I will certainly do my best to move towards the plant-based, whole foods diet, but there are no guarantees that you'll be seeing an enthusiastic vegan by this time next year.

46,1932100660,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1212796-heather,5,"I thought this book much more powerful than Eat to Live in showing the benefits of a vegetarian diet. I thought the graphs and studies very effective and even downright scary. After reading this I was highly motivated to work on cutting meat and dairy from our diet. We're doing it slowly though since all my kids would rise in revolt if we quit cold turkey. And so would my lasagna loving husband.I didn't think this as preachy as Eat to Live, but it is a little much at times. I just took what I needed and left the rest there. It did read more like a scientific journey than a personal one but was still very easy to read and understand. I so wish there were some recipes or menu ideas. I get the ""here are basic suggestions"" thingy, but honestly, if you're used to a meat and dairy diet coming up with delicious vegetarian recipes is painful work. I know, I've been at it for a few months and we've had some truly horrible meals!Well worth reading if you're interested in health, but only if you're willing to make a change because this will convince you that one is needed. As in all things though I think there needs to be moderation. Use this as a jumping off point and make it work for your family."
47,1932100660,http://goodreads.com/user/show/502678-gail,4,"After watching ""Forks Over Knives"" and reading several books about The China Study, I finally decided to read it myself. It was worth the effort to go to the source. His research as well as his personal story... his description of the efforts that the medical, research, and academic community went to block his work (and the work of others that validated his), was very compelling. It is hard to pretend that the information he imparts is irrelevant. He challenges every one of us to identify what is important to us and to what lengths we are willing to go to be healthy as well as good stewards of the planet. It is hard to find people today who have the courage to take on the power of the industrial food complex...which includes politicians as well as academics. He exposes how much ""research"" is actually promotional material funded by food interests. I work in health care. I'm a clinician. Every day I see the effects of greed and a refusal to address root causes of our deteriorating health. The China Study helps you understand why ""health"" care will never change and why we continue to get fatter and sicker. This is a must-read if you care about your health and the health of your family. Highly recommended. "
48,1932100660,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1425235-emily-mellow,4,"fantastic info so far. Definitely informative and clear.I started skipping stuff later on. too much repetition of stuff I already know. I understand he is really trying to make a point, but the reiteration is tedious.It's unfortunate because I do think a better written book might be more successful in getting the very important message across about eating a plant based diet.The science in this book is indeed groundbreaking, and maybe I'm just not ready to be a vegetarian is the real problem. I do feel guilty now every time I give my kids milk, and we have decided not to buy animal products ourselves (though because of WIC and meals with family we will still have plenty of dairy and meat). I'll be almost glad when we're done with WIC, even though I'll miss all the free food, but then we'll be deciding on our own food choices much more, and for sure eating a higher percentage of fruits and veggies, which WIC basically ignores."
49,1932100660,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2169723-jayme,3,"After all of the hype in the vegetarian world about this book, I have to say I was a little disappointed. I really liked reading about Campbell's work in nutrition and this book does contain a lot of really awesome information. From what I understand of Campbell's studies though, his work focused on the effects of dairy on health. But in his book, Campbell tries to smush dairy protein and animal protein under the same harmful to your health umbrella. For me, the book would have been more effective if he stuck to his research on dairy and left arguments about animal protein to someone else, or added more information to show why animal protein would also be harmful to your health. I'm not really convinced animal protein is harmful as long as it is in moderation, like everything else. The better arguments are really environmental and ethical."
50,1932100660,http://goodreads.com/user/show/465910-claire,5,"EVERYONE should read this book. Seriously, everyone! It lays out well-documented reasons to eat a plant-based diet, touching on the relationship between nutrition and cancer, heart disease, diabetes, as well as other diseases. T. Colin Campbell reached this conclusion after years of nutrition research; he did not set out with an agenda, which I think makes this book great for people who are skeptical about the merits of a vegan diet. It was also well written and makes the science easy to understand and absorb. It's the type of book that you read, and immediately want to recommend to everyone you know. So go read it if you haven't already!  "
51,1932100660,http://goodreads.com/user/show/289521-gil-bradshaw,5,"This book sort of blew my mind about food and nutrition, until I started explaining it to people. Then I felt like an idiot.Me: ""There is this new author who seems to be legit and his teachings totally blew me away and taught me things that no other nutritionist ever has.""Wife: ""Oh yeah, what does he talk about.""Me: ""He talks about how you should eat your vegetables and whole grains instead of red meat, processed foods and dairy.""Wife: ""So what's surprising about that?""Me: ""I'm telling you, it's a totally new way of thinking and living.""Wife: ""Eat your vegetables and whole grains?

This book will open your eyes. There's no going back. My 14 year old son said: This book has ruined my life. Reader beware. Backed by solid research and a no-nonsense attitude, Colin Campbell makes an excellent case for eating a plant-based diet. He says some people might think this is very inconvenient. Well, he adds, having a major, chronic disease is also very inconvenient. Point taken."

A little scientific in places, but hey, facts are good. Too many diet books are full of opinions and biases. This was written by a guy who knows his stuff and has no other agenda besides getting the info out to the public. Ever wonder why one day butter is good, the next it's bad? Do you know what diseases of affluence are? Did you know that the right diet can reverse heart disease? Read this book. Then you'll be able to make educated decisions about what you eat."

The main focus is on the plant-based diet which has proven to be the main source for conquering them. Author has compared the diets of Western ""rich"" countries and those countries that are still developing, and found out that the countries with diet based on meat, eggs, milk tend to have high correlations of cancer, heart and other diseases. A highly recommended and eye-opening reading. "

It's interesting, most of the people who gave it a bad rating didn't read much of the book at all.
