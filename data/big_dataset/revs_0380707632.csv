0,0380707632,http://goodreads.com/user/show/54103953-archit-ojha,5,Factual and delightful!I can't get enough of Stephen Hawking's books. Recommended reading. Full 5 stars!
1,0380707632,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2105523-bob-nichols,3,"Hawking searched for a single substance that underlies all of reality. This might be found at the beginning of the Big Bang (or pre-Big Bang moment?), a point at which gravity pulled all matter-energy into a singularity. Here, the density is so great that the matter particles (electrons, quarks, neutrinos) and three of the four (2) force particles (gluons, photons, W-Z bosons) lacked differentiation and were in some philosophical sense something that was ""One,"" something that preceded ""the Many"" that, post Big Bang, differentiated over time.What this Hawking quest leaves unanswered (or not discussed by Boslough), is what creates the Big Bang explosion? Physicists know that with the electro-magnetic force, like charges repel and unlike charges attract, and presumably something similar happens with the quarks within the nucleus; physicists also know that the collapsing process of larger-scale stars push particles beyond a breaking point, resulting in supernova explosions. (3) Is there a connection between this forcing of energy-particles, in whatever form, into an incompatible ""One"" that results in the explosion process which creates ""the Many"" that differentiates over time? (4)Regarding this interest in pulling together the four forces, gravity is the outlier (in what sense for the physicist I don't know). The forces that interact at the atomic and subatomic, microscopic scale involve attraction that allows for some form of merger and combination via the transfer of energy, or repulsion that preserves some form of independence/integrity. Gravity is said to involve only an attractive force. (5) It acts on everything, pulling matter-energy toward the center, in effect in a singularity and Big Bang scenario, overwhelming everything (all atomic, sub-atomic matter-energy). (6) What is it - what is the single underlying force - that pulls energy and matter together like this? If it is gravity, what is it about gravity that overpowers repulsive forces, allowing attraction to reign supreme? Is the singularity result (black hole or pre-Big Bang) the One? Or, because the pressure is too intense, ""the One"" is, in the end, unstable and explodes to create movement, change, differentiation and ""the Many"" in the cosmos?(1) ""Hawking, like most theoretical physicists, now believes that the secret of the most elusive of all goals lies in the very early universe, the period within the first trillionth of a second after the beginning of the Big Bang. It is there when the four forces we see in our cold, stable universe were probably one.""(2) Gravity, operating at the macro level, pulls energy and matter into a singularity via mutual attraction. Interestingly, under general relativity, while matter-energy is pulled into a singularity, in quantum mechanics, there is no point. There is only a field.(3) Hawking is known for his theorizing on black hole radiation, the seeping of energy out of a black hole. But if black holes are singularities like a pre-Big Bang moment, why wouldn't a black hole also explode? Boslough also writes that black holes ""as Hawking tells it, are rips in the fabric of space and time so dense and distorted by unimaginable gravitational forces that for years physicists believed nothing could escape from one, including light."" I don't understand what Boslough is stating. The ""rip in the fabric of space and time"" is rich in imagery, but it also suggests that the black hole is so massively heavy that it breaks through the ""fabric"" of space-time (whatever ""fabric"" means). The next question, is ""Into what?""(4) In a post Big Bang scenario, energy is radiated outward, dissipating across space and time, in a generalized, entropic process, though there's a localized clumping of matter and energy into galatic clusters, galaxies, stars and planets. Isn't this internally propelled movement? Is this (per Einstein's special theory of relativity?) the uniform movement of cosmic matter and energy that is then acted upon (accelerated), as Einstein theorized with general relativity, by larger-scale bodies of matter-energy that depress the fabric of space-time, which guide other matter-energy toward the center? Interestingly, the reference to entropy -- ""the amount of energy available to perform a physical task must always decrease,"" in a process of gradual ""inutility"" - seems to be defined in Earthly-human terms, as opposed, say, to a more cosmically-oriented process of ""heat death,"" which is the lessening of power differentials and therefore movement and change within fields of matter and energy.(5) Referencing Einstein, Boslough says that gravity is not a force ""in the usual sense."" Large masses do not literally pull smaller masses. Rather, they depress the ""fabric"" (which is?) of space-time, like a bowling ball sitting on a blanket, depressing it in the middle, and smaller masses merely following the natural trajectory in ""the fabric"" toward the center. The discussion of gravity is incomplete in this Boslough book. Heavy mass draws matter-energy into itself to a central point, but the Earth and planets are not drawn into the sun so other factors (distance per the inverse square law) plus speed and counter-pulling masses are also involved. Boslough also reverts to the traditional notion of gravity as a force when he references the ""tug-of-war between the powerful outward-directed force"" of a star's ""heat and radiation"" (electro-magnetic force, carried by photons?), and ""the strong inward-directed force of gravity."" Elsewhere, he refers to the pull of gravity on a person toward the earth and says that is the same as ""inertia of his body resisting."" Though gravity does not repel like an electric-magnetic charge, this statement suggests that gravity's attraction does have a flip side, which via inertia, resists (i.e., mutual attraction involves mutual resistance of sorts). (6) If a star has a greater mass (1.4 times or more of the sun), the (Pauli?) ""exclusion principle will be overpowered by gravitation....breaking atomic nuclei apart, destroying atoms."""
2,0380707632,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2290905-jimmy,4,"Every time a police car or fire truck drives by, I explain to the person I'm with that we are currently experiencing the Doppler effect...and then I get into how scientists are able to figure out that starts and galaxies are moving away from us based on the same principle. The response I get: ""You read too much.""I take it as a compliment, of course.In Stephen Hawking's Universe, David Filkin does an excellent job of explaining to the average person (meaning someone who doesn't study astronomy or cosmology for a living) the history of Newtonian physics, how we know dark matter exists, how we can 'find' black holes, and Hawking's Theory of everything. It even comes with pictures!I can't say that I learned too much, but that's mainly because I've already read A Briefer History of Time, where a lot of the information is the same. The good thing is that it's easier for me to remember this information. But if there's anything you ever wanted to know about today's science and how much we know about the universe, then this is the book to get. And who knows...next time you hear a siren, you might be able to dive into the principles behind the Doppler Effect!"
3,0380707632,http://goodreads.com/user/show/386130-glen,3,"Covers the basics of theoretical physics, such as the Big Bang , Big Crunch, black holes, bubble theory, and early history of the universe. Interesting stuff. Most of the book is written in layman language with the exception of the last chapter, which was a speech that Hawking gave at Cambridge. "
4,0380707632,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3483466-megan-tatum,4,"Loved this book! I checked it out from our local public library, which doesn't always have the most modern options. But even a nearly 30-year-old biography of Hawking was fascinating. It definitely makes me want to read more by and about him."
5,0380707632,http://goodreads.com/user/show/716403-ellee,3,"A good overview of Hawking's early work, but a lot's happened in cosmological physics since the book was published. It'd be a good warm-up for A Brief History of Time."
6,0380707632,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1208737-suzanne,5,"An essential read. No answers to the God question, but The Anthropic Principle and the Big Bang arguments are quite compelling!"
7,0380707632,http://goodreads.com/user/show/656515-michael,4,"This is a great, if a bit dated, explanation of theoretical physics. "
8,0380707632,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4436771-rob-waiser,2,A decent quick introduction to many of the concepts developed/studied by Hawking through the early '80s. Hawking's own books provide much more depth.
9,0380707632,http://goodreads.com/user/show/78882313-frank-davis,2,"I enjoyed it as a very brief overview of some of Stephen Hawking's early work and how his work relates to some important physical theories. The book is quite a bit outdated now although it was seemingly honest, considering various objections to theory. I also found the book quite repetitive which is amazing considering the book is only 126 pages. The quotes taken from discussions with Stephen were the thrill of the book for me. Not a bad read if you're after a very quick look at Stephen Hawking's early work."
10,0380707632,http://goodreads.com/user/show/26685888-stephanie,3,"It's a little outdated being nearly 30 years old but I'm interested in Hawking and the book was rather short. This was one of those books that I really had to concentrate on what I was reading. I found myself more than a few times reading over a section two or three times to better comprehend (or at least attempt to) what was being discussed. In some portions of the book, it was completely over my head. It was an okay introduction to Hawking."
11,0380707632,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8448607-leew49,3,"This is a well-written book by someone who had face to face interaction with Hawking and was able to discuss his research and theories with intelligence. Much of the book was over my head, but I did enjoy and, I hope, understand at a layman's level the chapters on relativity , black holes, the Big Bang, and Hawking radiation."
12,0380707632,http://goodreads.com/user/show/36130713-jeffrey-dill,5,"Great read. A little bit on Hawking, the man himself, and a lot bit on the theoretical research that defined his life."
13,0380707632,http://goodreads.com/user/show/80479656-erica-char,4,Really well written and brings vast science concepts down to a level that I think I maybe understood. Space time continuum is not my strong suit. But a quick easy read. 
14,0380707632,http://goodreads.com/user/show/92815698-danielle-page,5,i like this book
15,0380707632,http://goodreads.com/user/show/18742486-poedgar,5,Great intro to black holes and more:)
16,0380707632,http://goodreads.com/user/show/92669687-jaxon-dennis,3,This passage is all about the great scientist Stephen Hawking's life.
17,0380707632,http://goodreads.com/user/show/12878686-shounak-chatterjee,4,"A succinct of the scientific expertise of few of the brightest scientific minds of the human civilization, giving us the opportunity for a passionate glimpse into the greatest cosmological mysteries orbiting around the ever increasing conundrums emerging out of the vastness of the universe – How it was created? What triggered the initiation? What followed? And how it shall end?All scientific approaches ceases functioning as science delves deeper into the cosmic. This scientific paralysis leads to the beginning of religious, mystical and para psychological speculations. Science and religious faith has always been the adversaries of each other, each contradicting and demeaning the conjectures of the other with a great vehemence. Science and mysticism as what I feel should be complementary to each other, for the oldest outpouring of the human mind is the ideas and beliefs of the Eastern mysticism. Science is still being naive in not realizing that understanding Eastern mysticism might gain them with an insight into the cosmological reality. "
18,0380707632,http://goodreads.com/user/show/60420824-delia-bruno,5,I love science books
19,0380707632,http://goodreads.com/user/show/20312923-sirish,2,"Of the Science writers who I love reading, Richard Feynman, James Gleick, Mary Roach, Simon Singh, there is a common characteristic. There is glee in their voice that comes from a childlike excitement for knowledge, a naive curiosity that is bolstered by the personalities of the scientists/ authors. Science is just a vehicle for them to go on an intellectual odyssey, a tool that helps them find prospective paths to answers of our most fundamental questions.John Boslough reveres Hawking. He seems fairly erudite in Theoretical Physics. But it's one thing to know something, totally another to be able to convey about it in such a way that the reader's enthusiasm is lit. And there Boslough falls short. This is not a bad book as much an incomplete mishmash of all things Big Bang, Hawking's life and new discoveries in Cosmology. The difficulty level of the matter alternated between fairly understandable and way-over-my-head. Boslough didn't seem to have been clear about his target audience, or what exactly he wanted to talk about. Overall, not recommended."
20,0380707632,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5082258-eli,2,"This book was an interesting discussion of theoretical physics, focusing on Einstein and Hawking's own contributions to the discipline. So much of theoretical physics, however, is speculative. The science is perfectly valid, but whether it is true or not is another question. To answer this question one must refer to philosophy, history and the question of metaphysics. How old is the universe? Just because we can mathematically predict what conditions would be like if the universe were billions of years old, does that mean it really is billions of years old? What if God created the universe earlier than that? Must we always have a natural explanation for everything? These are the relevant questions.This is a good book for anyone who would like to be introduced to what theoretical physics - the stuff Hawking's works on - is about."
21,0380707632,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2876353-john-p,3,"This review is based on a re-reading of this 1985 book.Mr. Boslough has done a good job of putting together a short (150 pages), readable, and fast-paced overview of Hawking the person and the physics concepts associated with him.Because of the compact format, many, if not most, of the concepts are described too briefly for my taste although they remain interesting and flow logically enough.Recent observations and advances in cosmology have necessarily given this book an outdated feel. However, a person with a casual interest in the subject should be able to follow along easily and gain insights into Hawking's cerebral world of physics, thereby attaining a starting point for further study.I found a couple annoying typos, but only a couple."
22,0380707632,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8083573-craig,4,"I've always be fascinated with Stephen Hawking, for everything that he has overcome and for all that he has achieved, which would be remarkable in and of itself. While is book, a brief history of the universe looks interesting, it's size I feel is a bit daunting. So I thought this would be a good intro book, and it was very well written by John Boslough. In such a short book he shows not only many of Stephen's early work, but showed a bit of the man behind the theories, including little stories of his sense of humor."
23,0380707632,http://goodreads.com/user/show/12693827-justin-rose,4,"This book focuses mostly Hawking's science (as opposed to his personal life, etc.). Although this is written decades before the TV series ""Big Bang Theory"", it makes Sheldon seem all the more real. Boslough asks some real questions about science and God that Hawking does not shy from answering. Hawking talking about the physicists discussing the universe's past brought to mind theological dispensationalists discussing the cosmic future. They both use their imaginations to make their unfounded theories fit their assumptions."
24,0380707632,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7180139-titan,3,"I started this book like 5 years ago and only picked it up again today to finish the last three chapters. I don't have much to say about it other than it certainly gave my young mind a lot to think about when I first began it. The wannabe astronomer in me recognizes the wannabe astrophysicist I used to, well, wanna be. Both were invigorated as I read. "
25,0380707632,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1012525-harry,2,"Watered down and redundant rehash of the stuff covered much more entertainingly and more thoroughly by Hawkings himself in ""A Brief History of Time"" - don't waste your time with this one - read Hawkings' book..."
26,0380707632,http://goodreads.com/user/show/16151600-d-rae,4,"I am giving it four stars because the information is a bit dated. However, this is an excellent reference into the scientist Stephen Hawking and his achievements in his study of Black Holes. I highly recommend this for background info."

28,0380707632,http://goodreads.com/user/show/19680735-adam-jazzkamp,3,"A dated but decent read, an amuse-bouche to ""A Brief History of Time."""
29,0380707632,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6362932-laura,3,"Interesting and in very dumbed down language (where even I can understand this stuff). Hawking comes across as pretty arrogant, but he is Hawking. "
