They put copper, lead, formaldehyde and so much more in our food. Kids died from drinking milk. That’s so mind boggling that I had to reread the paragraphs focused on that. Paragraphs, plural, because it HAPPENED MORE THAN ONCE OVER SEVERAL YEARS. This author does an amazing job of compiling all of the information together in a cohesive form. There’s a inordinate amount of information within these pages and while it can get a bit dense and repetitive, it never lost my interest. I’m so glad I had the opportunity to read it and I’m going to make damn sure everybody knows to read it. FIGHT THE MAN!(Or just hold corporations like Coca-Cola accountable)"
1,1594205140,http://goodreads.com/user/show/155663-david,5,"This is an amazing book about Dr. Harvey Wiley, a chemist in the Department of Agriculture at the turn of the century. He worked tirelessly to keep food and beverages safe for consumption. A hundred years ago, adulterated food products were very common. Unhealthful--or even poisonous--additives stretched the volume of foods, making them devoid of nutrition, and even harmful. Sometimes the additives were employed to stretch the apparent volume of products. Sometimes the additives were used to prolong shelf life. Sometimes the foods were deliberately mislabeled, to trick consumers. And, some foods were processed under very unsanitary conditions. It was a very big problem. And it could be argued that the problem still exists.While Theodore Roosevelt was president, the first law was passed, aimed at these problems. The Pure Food and Drug Act of 1906 was passed was passed, to help ameliorate these problems. However, the law did not, by itself, fix any problems. The Department of Agriculture was still in bed with food manufacturers. And, there was no proof that food additives or adulterants were dangerous to health. And, in order to prohibit a manufacturer from adding a chemical to foods, it was necessary to first prove that the chemical was dangerous to health.Harvey Wiley, the head of the chemistry division at the Department of Agriculture, was the leading proponent of food safety and honesty in labeling. He formed what was known as the ""Poison Squad"". He had some rooms in the basement fixed up like a restaurant. He invited healthy civil servants to be served free meals there. Participants were admonished to eat breakfast, lunch and dinner at this location, and to eat nothing at any other location. Of course, free meals were a big attraction, but they realized that they would be participating in nutrition experiments. The cooks added different concentrations of food additives, with the purpose of determining who would get sick. These experiments showed that certain food additives were clearly dangerous, and therefore prohibited from use.Wiley's efforts at upholding the safety of foods made him a nationwide hero in the eyes of women. He had to constantly battle against the Secretary of Agriculture, who very frequently sided with food producers instead of siding with food safety. But Wiley's popularity made it difficult to fire him, although firing was attempted several times.This book is about the courage of this man who stood for food safety and honesty, above all else. It was an enjoyable read, engaging, and full of surprises. But, I didn't read this book--I listened to the audiobook. It is narrated very nicely by Kirsten Potter. I listened to the book while taking long walks from Arlington to Theodore Roosevelt Island. And the most amazing experience occurred while listening to the discussions between Harvey Wiley and Theodore Roosevelt, while viewing the super-sized statue of Theodore Roosevelt! The central circle on the island is ornamented by Roosevelt's statue and chiseled quotes by Roosevelt that show how progressive he was for his times. What a treat!"
2,1594205140,http://goodreads.com/user/show/61946844-amy,5,"During his successful 2016 campaign for the White House, Trump promised to have his cabinet ""submit a list of every wasteful and unnecessary regulation which kills jobs, and which does not improve public safety, and eliminate them."" His FDA commission, Scott Gottlieb, followed that promise by saying what while he recognizes the importance of food safety legislation he wants to ""strike the right balance"" in its implementation. Consumer groups now anticipate delayed and reduced protections from agencies facing deep budget cuts. The Earthjustice Institute has warned of the ""Trump administration's willingness to accommodate even unfounded and partial industry opposition to the detriment of the health and welfare of people and families across the country.""Such a warning, with its mix of theatrical anger and genuine dismay could have been written, almost word for word, by Harvey Washington Wiley more than a century ago. The sense of deja vu, echoing down the years, should remind us of the ways that food safety practices have dramatically changed in this country--and of the ways they have changed hardly at all. (The Poison Squad, pg. 289)I found this book while browsing in my local library and picked it up because public health is always an interesting topic to me. It took me a little while to get started on this book, but once I did I could hardly put it down. The Poison Squad follows Dr. Harvey Washington Wiley in his career primarily as chief chemist for the Department of Agriculture, explains how his research on altered and deliberately unlabeled/mislabeled products came to shape his advocacy for safe and pure (or, at the very least, properly labeled) food and drink, and illustrates for readers the parallels between the complaints and schemes of business of decades ago and the complaints and schemes of business today. Just like the Earthjustice statement could have been written by Dr. Wiley, The Poison Squad is littered with quotations from 19th and 20th century businessmen, their lawyers, and the their lobbyists, that could be written - word for word - by the industry-at-any-cost interests of today. I knew about a couple of the cases cited in the text - the poisoning of children with milk that had been 'preserved' with formaldehyde, the mass poisoning of mainly children by Elixir Sulfanilamide - but not the vast majority. Well written, informative, and very, very relevant, The Poison Squad was an amazing book and it is one that I would highly recommend. However, given that a good many of the descriptions are graphic, I have one caveat: I would try not to recommend The Poison Squad to someone who didn't have at least an ok tolerance for nauseating descriptions, the likes of which are extremely likely to cause intense revulsion at the very idea of some things once being considered 'food.' For example: Doctors continued to worry over continued reports of ""grocer's itch,"" a side effect of the deceptive practice of grinding up insects and passing the result off as brown sugar. Sometimes live lice survived the process. (The Poison Squad, pg. 66)The secretary [of agriculture, Wilson] also had endorsed a November decision to seize fifty-two industrial-sized cans of eggs preserved in a 2 percent solution of boracic acid. The Hipolite Egg Company of St. Louis sold these huge cans--forty-two pounds each--to the baking industry at a price much lower than fresh eggs. Hipolite specialized in salvaging dirty, cracked, and even rotting eggs for use in breads and cakes. The company was particularly known for using ""spots"" (decomposing eggs); mixing their contents into a thick, homogeneous mass; using boracic acid, a by-product of borax [the cleaning product also used for pest control] to halt further decomposition; and then selling the eggy soup by the can. (The Poison Squad, pg. 203)New options [for coloring agents] arose with synthetic dyes made from coal tars--dense, chemically complex residues left over the processing of coal...The new dyes were durable, cheap, and potent--and rapidly adopted by industrial processors of everything from fabric to food. (The Poison Squad, pg. 229)The organizers [of the pure food exhibit] decided to exhibit two thousand different brands presenting tainted food and drink sold in the United States. ...Minnesota and South Dakota sent sheets of silk and wool, each five feet square, brilliantly colored with coal-tar dyes extracted from a variety of strawberry syrups, ketchup, jams and jellies, and red wine. Michigan sent samples of lemon extract in which the manufacturer had used cheap but deadly wood alcohol as a base. Illinois provided more faked extracts, such as ""vanilla"" made only of alcohol and brown food coloring...Participating states provided forty brands of ketchup, labeled as a tomato product, that were mostly stewed pumpkin rind dyed red, and some fifty brands of baking powder that were largely well-ground chalk enhanced by aluminum compounds. To the fury of food industry executives, the fair's head of publicity, Mark Bennett, send out a news release titled ""Lessons in Food Poisoning,"" which noted: ""If you want to have your faith in mankind rather rudely shaken, take the time to look about in the exhibit of the State Food Commissioners in the south end of the Palace of Agriculture."" (The Poison Squad, pg. 115)This is a small sampling of just what I could easily find and could be easily understood from a relatively short quote. I personally think the text is all the better for including these details; they do not allow industry malpractice and unethical behavior to hide behind the veneer of polite wording. I think it is necessary the same way that Upton Sinclair's graphic descriptions of the Chicago stockyards and packing plants were necessary (The Jungle, as well as other information about it and the yards themselves are also quoted, by the way). But, because I know not everyone has the same opinion as me, I would try to take into account personal taste when making - or choosing not to make - a recommendation."
3,1594205140,http://goodreads.com/user/show/216284-mark,5,"Another superb book by Deborah Blum. Like her previous book, The Poisoner's Handbook, Blum dives deep into our recent past to show how different we were in some ways just a century ago, and yet how alike we are in many respects.The Poisoner's Handbook told the story of the birth of forensic science, along with the frighteningly common availability of murderous poisons in the early 1900s. The Poison Squad tells the story of the birth of pure food and drug laws in the United States, led largely by a single iron-willed man, Harvey Washington Wiley, although he had a lot of help from crusading reformers, muckraking journalists and state food inspectors.Wiley came of age in the late 1800s, when the desire of food manufacturers to provide cheap products in an age before refrigeration caused them to dose their food with preservatives that seem almost ludicrously dangerous today --borax, sodium benzoate, and even formaldehyde. For purely deceptive purposes, they also produced ketchup with no tomatoes, coffee with no coffee, and whiskey with no whiskey. At a time when American activists were seeking reform on many fronts -- women the right to vote, temperance committees a ban on alcohol, Teddy Roosevelt an attack on monopolies -- the pure food movement became another plank in this broad reformist effort, and Wiley was its leading figure.The title of the book comes from an experiment that Wiley put together while running the Bureau of Chemistry in the Department of Agriculture, which for ethical reasons might never occur today. To test how safe various preservatives were, he recruited volunteers -- mostly young single men working for the federal government -- and put them on a strictly regulated diet, with some in the group getting regular food and others adding capsules of whatever preservative he was studying. By doing this, Wiley was able to show the dangers of substances like sodium benzoate and formaldehyde -- none of his young men died, but some got very sick -- and refute the arguments of manufacturers that the preservatives were harmless.After years of campaigning, both through his bureau's careful testing and through his charismatic speaking appearances, Wiley finally managed to persuade Congress and President Roosevelt to pass a pure food and drug act. But once the bill was signed into law in 1906, the manufacturers did everything in their power to dilute it, and years of fighting and court battles remained ahead.Throughout most of this period, Wiley was saddled with a particular burden. His boss, Agriculture Secretary James Wilson, served under four presidents and was so industry-friendly that he blunted much of what Wiley was able to do, prohibiting him from publishing scientific findings, blocking him from speaking appearances, and finally appointing a special committee that had the power to overrule many of Wiley's recommendations.Despite all those roadblocks, Wiley became enormously popular both within his agency and with the broader public, and when he finally decided to leave government service, he was given a prominent position and much higher pay as a consultant and author for Good Housekeeping, then a powerhouse magazine for America's educated women.The magic Blum brings to these books is her ability to take government reports, transcripts of testimony and court hearings and other dusty tomes and bring them to life, infusing this critical change in our attitudes toward government regulation with humanity and drama. And while we no longer face borax and formaldehyde in our food, the elemental struggle between businesses trying to get away with whatever they can for profit, vs. the government preventing their worst excesses through regulation, remains just as powerful an issue today as it did when the Pure Food and Drug law was passed.Highly recommended."

5,1594205140,http://goodreads.com/user/show/25032671-kris,3,"This book focuses on chemicals like formaldehyde, sodium benzoate, Borax, and strong acids and dyes. There's also mention of arsenic, led, mercury, and copper. I wanted a little more about foods laced with blatantly crazy drugs we still think of today —like morphine, cocaine, and heroine.It sounds like these drugs were harming people, but the field was so new there wasn't documented evidence and studies to prove it beyond doubt. Once the research got started, it was damning. I was fascinated by the fact that volunteers willingly ingested poison for weeks on end just to help a scientist prove this stuff.Even the strongest conservative has to admit the government's role is to protect people from harm. And this stuff harmed. It isn't a question of enforcing regulation to protect health, it's a question of how much regulation is needed to protect health. It's obvious some kind of regulation was sorely needed during these times.But it's a far cry from the regulations on the books today. Blum would have you believe there's no difference between 1910 and 2010. Her leftist bias is clear, and every once in a while her voice pops out to pester at you annoyingly from the page (...Shame on those people who dare try to reduce regulations... It's so obvious you should think the way I do... How dare Trump do x, y, and z...). Blegh. This was clearly written in a post-Trump era. Luckily her bias was occasional, easy enough to spot, then proceed to ignore.I do wonder if people 50 or 100 years from now will look back at all the chemicals in our processed junk foods, alongside the increased rates of cancer, and call us crazy too.I also want to read:Pandora's Lunchbox: How Processed Food Took Over the American Meal"
6,1594205140,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1889783-emily,3,"This author's previous book is one of the most popular I've encountered, in that everyone I know who's read it, loved it. It was about the emergence of forensic medicine (and solving poisoning cases) against the backdrop of Prohibition-era New York. In this work she takes on a scientifically similar topic with a good deal less surrounding jazz and excitement. Early in the twentieth century, the food supply was far from the bucolic ideal we might imagine having existed before the emergence of junk food and factory farms. In fact, food purveyors regularly adulterated foods with all sorts of disgusting bulking materials, or added toxic substances like arsenic to achieve bright colors. Some foods were straight-up fakes. The book is full of hair-raising examples. For example, milk producers wanted to stretch their production. ""The standard recipe was a pint of lukewarm water to every quart of milk—after the cream had been skimmed off. To improve the bluish look of the remaining liquid, milk producers learned to add whitening agents such as plaster of paris or chalk. Sometimes they added a dollop of molasses to give the liquid a more golden, creamy color. To mimic the expected layer of cream on top, they might also add a final squirt of something yellowish, occasionally pureed calf brains."" (loc 236). ""Cloves"" were made of burned seashells or ""pepper"" from charcoal and sawdust--and there were few laws restricting any of these practices. Children were poisoned by milk ""preserved"" with formaldehyde.The main figure here is Dr. Harvey Wiley, who tried to use his role at the Agriculture Department to research food safety and bring about legislation to protect Americans' health. The fundamental problem with this book is that Wiley's career was long and slow-moving, full of bureaucratic maneuvers that don't exactly leap of the page like the juicy revenge poisonings in Blum's previous book. In his personal life, Wiley also romanced a librarian from the Library of Congress, which reads like a painfully prolonged case of mild sexual harassment culminating in the lady taking stock of her independent economic prospects and marrying him. Blum's writing, research, and story-telling are still well-done--this is just a topic that's going to appeal to fewer, and only more patient readers."
7,1594205140,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2141142-marieka,2,"This didn’t draw me in like I thought that it would. I generally tear through this type of book, but I’m maybe 5/6 of the way through and stuck, and I’m considering leaving it unfinished. Maybe it’s that it focuses too much on Dr. Wiley and goes into too much detail? I can’t nail down what exactly my issue with this book was, but I was somehow disappointed."
8,1594205140,http://goodreads.com/user/show/80750585-claudia,5,"Today, when talking about the safety of our food, we are concerned with MSG; high-fructose corn syrup; trans fats, synthetic sweeteners, artificial colors among others. In the late 1800's into the early years of the twentieth century, you would have been concerned more about arsenic, formaldehyde (yes, embalming fluid); salicylic acid, copper sulfate, and borax being used as preservatives. Coal-tar dyes to make the food appear fresh and bright. Saccharin to replace the more expensive sugar. Acetic acid replacing lemon juice. So-called neutral spirits colored, flavored and called whiskey. Nitrites to bleach flour to brilliant whiteness. Lead and a variety of minerals in candy. It is suspected that hundreds if not thousands of young children were killed by milk that was more chemical than dairy - the recipe could be a pint of water to each quart of milk after the cream was skimmed off. Add a bit of chalk or plaster of paris for whitening. Molasses to give it a golden color and to replace the cream, a squirt of something that may include pureed calf brains. And don't forget the formaldehyde! Yummy, isn't it? You don't want to know what could be in butter.Food manufacturers were certainly inventive with their additives. Sometimes the only thing missing in the product was what it was advertised and sold as. Of course, what it could include was mashed fruit and vegetable leavings. Charred rope. Sawdust. Crushed nut shells, ground insects and floor sweepings of all kinds. This book is about Dr. Harvey Washington Wiley, a chemist in the employ of the federal Department of Agriculture (the infant FDA) and his fight to eliminate toxic minerals and chemicals from the foods available to the American people. The same chemicals/additives, which were forbidden for use in Europe and Canada, flooded American food.And it was a long, exhausting fight. Utilizing the resources available, Wiley would create his 'poison squads' which would be volunteers who would take in the chemical investigated over a period of time and record any negative impacts on their health. The data would be analyzed and the report released to the public.Of course, the manufacturers fought hard and long. They were all about using cheaper materials instead of authentic, pure food products. Most were certainly were not willing to make the product a few cents more expensive but without toxic additives. But Dr. Wiley had his supporters as well - the AMA, women's groups, several Congressmen and Senators, various state-level secretaries of agriculture, newspaper journalists especially after the publication of Upton Sinclair's The Jungle which blew the lid off the meatpacking industry of Chicago. Fanny Farmer and her famous cookbook. H.J. Heinz that proved that food could be uncontaminated, tasty and appealing to the buying public.1906 saw the passage of the Pure Food and Drug Act but food industry lobbyists managed to convince industry-friendly politicians to basically weaken and gut the law. But it was a start and Dr. Wiley eventually lost his neutrality in his crusade for unadulterated and safe food which caused tension within the Department of Agriculture. Taking on Coca Cola for their cocaine and caffeine. Taking on the whiskey manufacturers. Saccharin and bread whitening agents.In the end, Dr. Wiley felt the best decision for him and his family was to continue his crusade through a job offered by Good Housekeeping magazine. He never saw the modified Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act of 1938 which corrected the Pure Food and Drug Act of 1906. Unfortunately, it took the death of more than a 100 people who were poisoned and killed by cough syrup sweetened by antifreeze. This is a vital book to read. Not just because of how far food safety has advanced over the years but how much more work needs to be done. Additional laws and updates to food and drug regulation over the years is in danger from our current administration as Trump promised to eliminate every unnecessary regulation and it seems that the FDA and its work is once again under fire. Only time will tell if it survives or is stripped of its authority and dominion."
9,1594205140,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2527265-david,4,"It is heartening to see this excellent new history getting favorable attention on the radio, in newspapers, in online journals, and in both food blogs and science blogs.In addition, there are already many reviews here on Goodreads that adequately summarize and elaborate on this book's fine qualities, so I thought I would allow myself the freedom to write a few words about what the century-old struggle for safer food in the US has to say about current unpleasantness. There are many similarities.It's hard to believe that anyone would construe the liberties we enjoy in the United States as permission to introduce known poisons, insect body parts, rodent excretia, etc., into food, but that's exactly what many food manufactures, big and small, did. Furthermore, attempts to limit known poisons, etc., from the food supply were treated as outrageous examples of government overreach and hysterical attention-seeking. Of course, from this distance, the champions of such “freedoms” look like the villains they were, and their arguments ring extremely hollow. We can only hope that people will be around in a century to give today's analogs the ridicule they richly deserve. Now, of course, the stakes are higher. Instead of simply poisoning an entire country, today's villains have the opportunity to wreck the whole world.This book also reminds how difficult it is to do the right thing. There are many pitfalls. For example, the book's splendidly cantankerous hero, log-cabin-born chemist Harvey Washington Wiley, was a thorn in the side of corner-cutters and quacks of all varieties well into his ninth decade. However, like a lot of people in the do-gooding business, he occasionally loses focus of the main goal and wastes precious time and resources on fringe issues. Wiley, for example, was an enthusiastic consumer of bourbon and pursued a strict definition of what type of restorative should be allowed to bear that proud label. I have been known to favor an occasional snort myself, so I appreciate his enthusiasm, but I recognize bourbon is (as is often said here in The Nation's Capital) not the hill you want to die on. Defending the purity of milk, flour, canned goods, etc., brings a rosy glow of mother- and baby-protecting saintliness to your advocacy. Bourbon – not so much. There are only so many hours in a day, so many battles you can fight. Choose wisely.Speaking of choosing your battles: Wiley knew that his cause was just, and he was for much of his life the smartest person in the room. As a result, he tended to shoot off his mouth and (another Nation's Capital cliché coming up) not suffer fools gladly. Most of the time, people who really needed defending benefitted from this tendency, but when you are in the room with the President of the United States, it's often wise to choose your words carefully, even if (perhaps especially when) the President is a bit of a tool. In Wiley's case, he unnecessarily alienated the affections of Theodore Roosevelt. The consequences were not disastrous, but even Wiley himself admitted that it would have been wiser to keep his trap shut. Finally, remember: the struggle never ends. It's natural enough, when long work results in success, to take a moment out to do a triumphant happy-dance, but remember while shaking what God gave you that your opponents are already looking for ways to roll back your improvements and undermine your good works. As happens similarly today, evil lawyerly minions who opposed Wiley managed to change the wording of legislation and rule-making so that strict guidelines were replaced with weasel words (e.g., “The guidelines now merely banned an undefined 'excessive' amount” (Kindle location 2430)). These words can then be litigated into meaninglessness, and/or cost pesky do-gooders a small mountain of legal fees.This is a fine book about a man whose life work benefitted others. In his lifetime, he received a certain amount of fame and monetary reward for his selflessness, but now he is largely forgotten, while names of murderous racists of the same period and earlier still grace our high schools and highways, and their graven images still infest our parks and public lands. Read this and remember someone worth remembering. I received a free electronic advance review copy of this book via Netgalley and Penguin Random House."
10,1594205140,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1462387-karyl,4,"I saw this for sale at B&N and was immediately drawn to it, so I requested it from my library. But before I could get to it, my DVR recorded the episode of American Experience titled The Poison Squad, which is about this exact subject. So if you’re interested in the subject matter, but you aren’t really in the mood to read, I would highly recommend watching that documentary. It features Deborah Blum, the author, so it’s a great summary of the material she covered in this book.Harvey Washington Wiley was a man on a mission. At the time that he became the chief chemist of the US Department of Agriculture in 1883, food safety in America was non-existent. Cows were fed the swill from breweries, and the resulting milk they gave was watery and lacking much nutrition. They were chained upright in their stalls and forced to give milk until they fell over dead. Canned food started with rotting and decaying scraps brought back to life with dangerous additives. Flour was bleached with nitrogen oxides, leaving large doses of nitrates in the resulting product, which couldn’t be baked out. Not only were there no laws regulating what chemicals and preservatives could be added to the nation’s food supply, but there were no studies showing how safe or dangerous they were, and there was no requirement for labeling the products either. Containers could have higher bottoms than they appeared to have, making consumers believe they were getting more in a larger container when they really were getting less. And the consumer had no idea exactly what was in the food they were buying, whether they felt it was safe or not; they couldn’t decide for themselves whether to ingest saccharine or copper sulfate or the nitrates resulting from bleaching flour because there was no regulation on any of it. Wiley wanted to change all of that. Initially he sought simply to label food products so the consumer would be informed regarding what s/he was ingesting, but once he started his Poison Squad, in which he fed a team of twelve young men a specific diet over time to test various additives, he realized that the US needed laws against these harmful chemicals. But as in modern times, various lobbies sought to have his research buried so they could continue to make money with impunity. It was mind-boggling, coming off the impeachment hearings in which the Republicans kept making various excuses as to why the hearings weren’t even legitimate, to read about congressmen against any kind of food labeling, with such inane statements of, “The American consumer doesn’t need the government telling him what to eat!” when Dr. Wiley was simply trying to request laws that caused the government to tell the consumer what was in his food so he could decide what he wanted to ingest. It just sounded all so familiar.It also makes me shake my head to know that there are so many people in 21st century America that don’t realize how literally dangerous our food was just over a hundred years ago. In the age of wondering about pesticides and organic farming and “all-natural” foods and folks looking for “raw milk” (ie, un-pasteurized, which I cannot even fathom wanting after reading this book), at least we don’t have formaldehyde mixed into our milk, the sweet taste of which covered up the fact that it was spoiling quickly without pasteurization or refrigeration. And it was this addition of formaldehyde, an embalming fluid and a poison, which killed children that drank the milk.This book is interesting, but it does get bogged down in a lot of names and data. I would actually recommend watching the documentary over reading this book because it’s just so much information that it’s hard to keep a hold of. That said, if reading is more your speed, I highly recommend this book. "
11,1594205140,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3726509-lis-carey,5,"This is the fascinating, alarming, and encouraging story of the first great round in the fight for food safety in the USA.In the second half of the 19th century, the food industry embraced the chemical industry, and preservatives, colorants, and substitutions became common. This might not sound all that alarming, as all those terms apply to things legitimately used in food now. However, at that time, milk could contain formaldehyde, jellies and jams might contain none of the claimed fruit at all and get their color from coal tar dyes, and there were no labeling requirements at all. Basic food safety legislation was making progress in Europe, but was completely squelched by industry efforts in America.In 1883, Dr. Harvey Washington Wiley was appointed chief chemist of the Department of Agriculture, and began a thirty-year crusade for clean, safe, and honestly packaged food. Under him, the agency began methodically investigating fraud in the manufacture and sale of food and drink. This included tests on human volunteers dubbed ""The Poison Squad,"" tests that probably wouldn't pass an ethics committee review now, but were for the time a serious early attempt at controlled testing with informed volunteer test subjects. Among the commonly used preservatives in food at the time, aside from formaldehyde, were borax (a cleaning compound) and salicylic acid (a pharmaceutical). Saccharine was used as a sugar substitute in food products that continued to be labeled, if they were at all, as being sweetened with sugar. Even honest labeling was seen as an outrageous infringement on noble American business.Wiley wasn't just fighting industry greed; he was often fighting politicians in the House and Senate, and even his own colleagues in the Department of Agriculture. On the other hand, he also had allies: the American Medical Association, women's suffrage groups, Fannie Farmer and other popular cookbook writers, women's magazines, and even those companies in the food industry, such as J.B. Heinz, who took pride in their products being manufactured to high standards with only the expected ingredients (ketchup made primarily of tomatoes, for instance.)It's a fascinating battle, with victories and setbacks, and Wiley himself is an interesting character. Nor is he the only interesting character here. It was never a one-man battle, on either side of the fight, and Blum truly does justice to the story.Highly recommended.I bought this audiobook."
12,1594205140,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3357765-jimmy,5,"The author gives many examples of deceptive food practices in the 1800s and the turn of the century. Here is one: Honey was often tinted corn syrup. Without laws and regulations, how would we stop such unscrupulous practices? A few years ago I heard a friend complain about laws in California that required honey makers to register with the state for quality control. They forget that there are reasons for regulations. The book is a tribute to the great Dr. Harvey Washington Wiley who in 1883 as a young chemist first wrote a paper exposing such practices. And guess who opposed him? The honey producers themselves. They thought it would do harm to their reputations. So the trade journals attacked him. All the while ignoring the fact that many ""beekeepers"" had NO BEES. A report on milk production in 1850 reads like a horror story. The cows lived in misery, and the children drinking the milk were sick and often dying. Wiley became famous as a chemist doing his best to expose such practices. He was hated by some as a man ""who is doing all he can to destroy American business. Lead solder was used to seal the seams of tin cans. Europe regulated the use of lead, but the US had no standards even for food. This libertarian philosophy continues even to today. We have many who want the companies to regulate themselves. A dose of history might get them to think again about such a philosophy. Medicines were often little more than flavored drinking alcohol. Legislation was constantly flouted. Businesses opposed even the idea of a pure food and drug act. Wiley found support from women's organizations. One area of concern was a famously stimulating soft drink known as Coca-Cola. They wanted the company to drastically reduce the amount of cocaine in its formula. It also contained caffeine. That is still a problem. https://teens.drugabuse.gov/blog/post... Upton Sinclair, another hero, had a grubstake of $1,000 (about $30,000 today) to work on a novel about the courageous workers of the Chicago stockyards who were fighting for better living conditions. He would spend 7 weeks in the stockyards dressing in the grubby clothes of a worker to blend in. He would settle down to write the most influential book of his prolific career: The Jungle. It was about a Lithuanian immigrant with the dream of a better life in America. But he is nearly destroyed by the horrendous working conditions of the fictional ""Anderson"" meat-processing company. That name stood for Armour Meats. The conclusion of the book is that the only way out is to embrace socialism.Sinclair wanted to focus on workers' rights, but it was the meat stories that affected the reading public. Once again, it showed that there is always a connection between social justice and good environmental protection. From Upton Sinclair's book The Jungle, we learn such things as how pickled beef had to be bathed in acid; the men working that line had their fingers eaten away by repeated exposure. Tuberculosis germs thrived in the moist, stinking air of the processing plants and spread from animal to animal. Workers occasionally fell into vats of acid and ""when they were fished out, there was never enough left of them to be worth exhibiting."" Sometimes a worker would slip into a vat and be ""overlooked for days till all but the bones of them had gone out into the world as Anderson's Pure Beef Lard."" Everyone knew he meant Armour's. Poisoned bread was put out to control the rat population. ""Then the rats, bread, and meat would go into the hoppers together."" One hero in the publishing industry was Isaac Marcosson, who pushed to have Sinclair's book published by Doubleday, Page, & Company. Sinclair was discouraged, even though his book sold well and made a great impact. He said, ""I aimed for the public's heart, and by accident I hit it in the stomach."" All anyone cared about was their food and not the workers who suffered miserably. The whiskey makers did not want to have labels to show the dyes, additives, and synthetic alcohol in their products. They warned it would hurt taxes. Manufacturers in almost every industry joined together to fight any sign of food, drink, or drug regulation. Some things never change. Passing the Food and Drug Act in 1906 did not end the troubles. Wiley would be attacked constantly for the rest of his life. Manufacturers would spend all their time and money trying to gut the law. Just like they do today with our Consumer Protection Agency, the Environmental Protection Agency, the Endangered Species Act, and every regulation on the book designed to protect us all. One other tactic still used today was to limit funding of these laws. Then there are not enough inspectors. Cheating continues. The exception often proves the rule. There was one man and one company that tried to do it right: Heinz. They advertised a ketchup free from additives. It costs a few cents more, but they convinced consumers it was worth it. His company fought for pure food and decent working conditions. The fact that he was the only one shows how bad things were. Cocaine was famously used in Coca-Cola. Also many ""soothing syrups"" for children were laced with morphine, heroin, and chloral hydrate. Same for cough syrups and asthma medications. I salute the heroic life of Dr. Wiley. He believed in the power of science to benefit society. He said, ""The freedom of science should be kept inviolate."" In today's world we could use that type of idealism again. The President of the United States of America fights science all the time, and his party and others enable him. The so-called libertarian/conservative movement supports them. There is nothing conservative about such people. Nothing. We need to carry on Dr. Wiley's fight and never give up. "

There is an enormous amount of information in this book, but the title is on point. This was absolutely the story of one man's single-minded crusade to achieve a better world for mankind. It is unfortunate that H W Wiley was not able to see his ideals working the way he envisioned them working during his lifetime. It is unfortunate that a better balance cannot be reached between regulation and letting business run wild. It is unfortunate that to this day, we are still a reactionary society...big business fights against regulation...the public keeps their heads buried in the sand...but then disaster strikes and everyone scrambles to right the wrong and fight future injustices. I feel that this was worth reading. A bit repetitive at times, but an accurate depiction of everything it takes to create and enforce a regulation that works."

19,1594205140,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6970638-sheri,3,"So I have come across this book several times as a good historical account of the development of the FDA. While current politics are highlighting the exact problems with big business and government officials (Trump defunding the EPA and deregulating pork manufacturers are two easy examples), this book feels sadly timely. Polices are always (it seems) a balance between protecting the lower classes and negotiating with big business: ""The story of consumer protection in the United States is often the story of a country playing defense, an account of government regulators waking up, time and again, to yet another public health crisis"".That said, the was an super easy read and gives a good historical account of the process by which Americans began to understand that adulterated food was not a good thing. I found it not compelling at times, but I have also been very busy and distracted this week with other things. I probably would have enjoyed it more at a different time.Overall it is an important and approachable book, but in this moment of COVID coupled with racial protests over our incompetent criminal justice system it felt like just another example of American individualist culture putting capitalist pursuits over equality for all."

Should be required reading for the naive libertarians who have forgotten what an unrestricted market will devolve into and the lengths it will go to protect itself. They still test food for floor sweepings to this day and we have the tireless efforts of the folks in this book to thank for that. I learned a lot from this book, including that Upton Sinclair's The Jungle was actually a socialist book and Sinclair was disappointed the public reaction was more about the meat rather than the workers. Docked one star since it felt a little repetitive due to structuring the story around Wiley's life, which was relatively boring, but definitely recommended.

Parallels to a lot of the same fights being waged against the food industry today (eg: added sugars, trans fat, labeling, “generally recognized as safe,” etc.) Would have liked a more generalized history of this effort rather than this rather narrow, semi biographical focus on one personality, albeit a key one.

This is both truly well written and a reminder how history repeats. if you hear about how good the food used to be, this book reminds you how good the food really was not. The Poison Squad: One Chemist's Single-Minded Crusade for Food Safety at the Turn of the Twentieth Century is history at its best. Told with a reporter's eye, but with humanity, Deborah Blum never lets the reader forget what is at stake. She spins a tale that reads like a well written novel, but never strays from the main pint of the book. This is the story of America's food purity law and the battle that started at the turn of the twentieth century and continues to this day.What comes across very well is this is the type of battle that is waged throughout American history. I was amazed at the companies that are under fire today were under fire then too. I am also amazed how certain brands were always industry leaders in both quality and purity. The same arguments portrayed the are used today. It is too expensive, it will not hurt the public, the government has no oversight to name just a few.The Poison Squad: One Chemist's Single-Minded Crusade for Food Safety at the Turn of the Twentieth Century is also about iconoclastic personalities. Dr. Wiley, the main focus of the book is so single minded, he cannot comprehend compromise.This is both an excellent history and an excellent read."
25,1594205140,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1392376-erin,5,"Listened to audiobook. I may be more interested in this book than your average American because I do work with agriculture regulations, but I loved this snapshot of the Dr. Wiley and the eventual creation of the FDA. It is both comforting and frustrating to see that the more things change, the more they stay the same. I believe there will always be an inherent friction between the public's and the government's tolerance for risk. With anything, there is no way to promise that risk and harm can be completely eliminated from any system, and this includes the American food supply. However, by funding research and using science to make thoughtful and effective regulations (i.e. with enforcement fully funded), we can mitigate great amounts of risk and make the food supply safe for the public.It is also interesting to see how ""owning"" your work in the government can really blind a person to the ever changing circumstances and inevitably hamstring their own work and mission. I'd like to shake some of my colleagues sometimes and say, ""You don't own this. This is not YOUR program. It is the program you manage for the taxpayers"". As soon as you add your own ego to your work, you can no longer be the objective manager/worker you were hired to be. If you want ego, go into private industry. If you are in public service, check your ego at the door. Dr. Wiley lost that objectivity later in his career and life and it made him less effective in his job."
26,1594205140,http://goodreads.com/user/show/81873043-e,4,"Clearly well-researched, it's a look into the life of Dr. Harvey Wiley and also the precursor department to what we know as the FDA today. It's both fascinating and horrifying, the list of preservatives and agents that industry manufacturers considered common to put in their food for the masses. No one will be surprised that half of one chapter is devoted to Upton Sinclair and ""The Jungle"" but how many people know that the federal government put Coca-Cola on trial? I'd recommend this book to anyone who enjoys history, chemistry or food."
27,1594205140,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9310118-jeimy,4,"This is billed as a fascinating story about how food was made safe in America, but I have to disagree with the second part of that statement. It is about how food was made safer. However, it doesn't take much for readers to see how much our capitalistic government bends to serve the whims of corporations. Food adulterations continue to occur. Read this book to understand how much has improved and ponder how far we still have to go."
28,1594205140,http://goodreads.com/user/show/15251834-camille-mccarthy,4," I enjoyed this book and thought the writing was pretty engaging. I thought the author could have done a better job connecting the food additives issues to today than the short epilogue at the end, but I thought she described Wiley's influence on the food safety issue very well. The book focused narrowly on issues of food safety and on Wiley's life, which made it a little hard to put this history into context with what else was going on at the time, politically. There was some mention of suffragettes, but only because Wiley's wife was famous for being one. I thought having more context might make the book more interesting for those who aren't so interested in hearing lists of chemicals that were in various foods - since I minored in Chemistry this was fascinating to me and I never got tired of it. I enjoyed the connection to ""the Jungle"" by Upton Sinclair, and I was glad the author included that part of the story, but I thought she sadly didn't connect Sinclair's socialist politics with the politics at the time. The way he is presented, he sounds like a lonely socialist man with outlandish ideas, but actually there was a strong socialist tendency in the US at the time, and the book ""Young Radicals in the War for American Ideals"" goes into some of this, though I think it, too, is overly simplistic.  If you enjoy this topic, a book that is extremely well-written, relevant to today, and incredibly necessary reading is ""A Terrible Thing to Waste"" by Harriet A. Washington, which focuses on environmental racism and how pollutants and poisons disproportionately affect Black and brown Americans and cause negative cognitive effects - it was one of the best nonfiction books I've ever read and I can't say enough about it.  This book goes into a lot of the nitty-gritty of how even in the turn of the 20th century, industry lobbyists had their crooked fingers in every aspect of government regulation, and even government scientists faced a lot of pressure to just tow the industry line and let everyone get poisoned for profits. I think the author is a little harsh on Wiley for saying he was too pedantic at times and didn't pick his battles - I think if you are a scientist charged with keeping a country safe, and you know that the safety of a nation hinges on your regulations, you have to be pedantic, and even so, he was only saying chemicals shouldn't be included in food items after he had provided substantial proof that they were causing harm. To me, there is no middle ground in choosing people's lives and safety over profit, and I'm glad he saw it that way as well. These days we have Monsanto lackeys in that kind of position, and even so we still have publications that are suppressed and scientists that are blacklisted for reporting their findings regarding the safety of some of these products, notably GMOs.  I found this book fascinating, not just from a historical perspective but for the sheer horrors of capitalism that are on display - this is another thing the book didn't really analyze, but rather takes for granted as a price of doing business, but should be emphasized - these people were using obvious poisons to make their food products more enticing, were killing people and doing physical damage with their poisonous adulterants, and then weren't even punished or taken to task because there was no law against putting poisons in food. How gross is that? "
29,1594205140,http://goodreads.com/user/show/50448-becky,5,"First sentence from introduction: We tend these days to cast a romantic glow over the foods of our forefathers. In such rosy light, we may imagine grandparents or great-grandparents thriving happily--and solely--on farm-fresh produce and pasture-raised livestock. We may even believe they ate and drank in a world untouched by the chemically enhanced and deceptive food manufacturing practices of today. In this we would be wrong.First sentence from chapter one: The sixth of seven children, Harvey Washington Wiley was born on April 16, 1844, in a log cabin on a small farm in Kent, Indiana, about a hundred miles northeast of the farm where Abraham Lincoln had grown up a few decades earlier. Premise/plot: The Poison Squad is a page-turner. It is the story of Harvey Washington Wiley and the FIGHT for food safety. Wiley wanted LAWS, REGULATIONS, OVERSIGHT. At the very least, he wanted FOOD LABELS that clearly and accurately listed WHAT was in the food (and drinks) being manufactured. Shouldn't milk be milk, sugar be sugar, pepper be pepper, and flour be flour? You'd think so--but that wasn't often the case. Manufacturers were ADDING things to their products--legally since there wasn't a law against--and people--sometimes children--were dying.Though the story mainly focuses on the early twentieth century--up through the first world war--the story begins in the nineteenth century. It isn't Wiley's story alone for he wasn't alone in his fight. There were good guys and bad guys. The manufacturers often were buddy-buddy with politicians. Politicians cared more about staying that way--protecting the interests of businesses and manufacturers--than about public safety. You'd almost think that politicians didn't have families of their own. Then again, this is also a story of class. It was mainly the poor whose food supply was effected. The ultra-rich could always buy fresh food--fresh meat, fresh vegetables, fresh fruit, fresh dairy products. Wiley's argument was that we should CARE what is in our food and care about HOW our food is being handled and processed.My thoughts: Fascinating. Compelling. Scary. Those words are how I'd sum up this biographical must-read. This is an incredible read. It has almost robbed me of any desire I had to TIME TRAVEL. If I ever do time travel, I think I'll bring my own food with me. It was SUPER-SCARY to read accounts about how UNSAFE food was. For example, today we may think that candy is ""unhealthy"" because of SUGAR but THEN candy was unhealthy because it actually-actually contained POISON. And that's just one example.I'd be surprised if anyone could read this one without starting to share facts or factoids with others. DID YOU KNOW? DID YOU KNOW? DID YOU KNOW? It's just a super-absorbing read that gives much food for thought.Food labels are something that most people take for granted. I know I did for most of my life. All that changed for me--a few years ago. I developed allergies to certain foods as an adult. I now read food labels super-closely. Knowing exactly what is in something is crucial. Wiley is a super-hero; his name should be better known and his work celebrated. "
30,1594205140,http://goodreads.com/user/show/72623806-nicholle,5,"I give this book 5 stars (out of 5). I loved the science/chemistry and history behind the story. The author is an excellent science writer and wrote such an intriguing story. The parts where she described the politics behind the story were boring to me (I cannot stand politics), but a necessary evil in order to describe how the story played out. This story is about chemist Dr. Harvey Washington Wiley and how he wanted to make sure that all food was safe, or at least labeled, from adulterants. Such adulterants were arsenic, dyes from coal tar, and boric acid (or borax), just to name a few. He was truly a man ahead of his time because during a time where most individuals (and even companies) were ignorant of science and most companies producing food only cared about making a profit, he strove to make sure food was safe from unnecessary additives (or adulterants) by actually testing the additives to prove that they were in fact harmful to people.Dr. Wiley set up experiments to feed a group of individuals adulterants, such as boric acid, by comparing that group against a control group not being fed adulterants. The data he and his team of chemists generated was not only rigorous and scientific, but also proved his hypothesis that the adulterants being added to food were in fact harmful to people. Taking this data a step further, he extrapolated that if these adulterants were harmful to healthy (male) adults, these adulterants were even more harmful to babies, children, and the elderly. Dr. Wiley fought almost his whole career against the politics of the unscrupulous lobby behind the companies making the adulterated foods. What I found so fascinating was that among the few companies that did mass produce food without adulterants was the company that made Heinz ketchup. The owner behind the ketchup not only wanted to make food without adulterants, but he also wanted to prove that making unadulterated food could be profitable, since that was the main argument behind the companies that adulterated food was that they could not be profitable. What I truly loved about Dr. Wiley was his desire to speak up about the chemistry behind the adulterants, without dumbing it down, to women. He wrote countless articles in magazines and publications geared towards women. He knew that getting women (who make up 50% of the population) on board with his cause would only further his fight in the political arena to achieve his goals. Dr. Wiley even married a suffragist and supported her desire to be jailed for her fight for women to vote.Another aspect I found so fascinating about this book is the role the government needs to play to protect the average American, or consumer, from unregulated business that cares more about profit than the health of the consumer by taking shortcuts. While I read this book the government shut down was occurring. And it also seems the trend in the current administration is to cozy up to big business that may or may not care about the average American consumer in their bottom line. Only time will tell if this is occurring, and unfortunately as history does repeat itself, who (and how many) will have to get sick and or die before government steps in to protect the average American consumer? "
31,1594205140,http://goodreads.com/user/show/56837139-brandon-polzin,3,"This book was an enjoyable narrative about a story that I never thought I would be interested in. The topic of food safety is a vitally important one, and I am grateful that a person like Harvey Washington Wiley had a lifelong goal of supporting food transparency for the benefit of the United States' citizens. I am a sucker for the time period in American History that a large portion of this book is set in, as Theodore Roosevelt is one of my favorite historical figures. He is painted as a protagonist in most of the other books that I've read, so it was amusing to see him portrayed in an antagonistic light here.All that being said, I felt this book had a few shortcomings. I may be spoiled after reading biographical narratives by Siddharta Mukherjee and Edmund Morris, but I felt illustrative descriptions of characters and settings were lacking in this book. I certainly was never bored, but it lacked the fiction-like and seemingly whimsical appeal of other critically acclaimed nonfiction narratives. It may be, though, that the nature of this story was not as exciting as those I am comparing it to, so I don't want to place the blame solely on Blum's shoulders.Another issue I had was the intermittent lack of focus/mislabeling of the book. The subtitle of the book (""One Chemist's...) implies that it is a biography about one man, that man being the aforementioned Wiley. Blum went into great detail about him, but would then move on to other parallel stories that coincided with the progression of food safety within the United States. This was obviously all relevant to the overarching story the book was trying to tell, but because of the excessive breaks from Wiley I felt this book should have been explicitly marketed as a story of food safety as a whole, not JUST as a narrative about Wiley. It's a nitpicky criticism, but I found myself being taken out of the story and thinking about it as I read the book.All in all though, I would recommend this book. I love that there was a ""cast of characters"" in the beginning to reference to whenever I forgot about a person's name or their significance. I also loved they way Blum used the story of food safety in the USA to emphasize the control that big business has over the way consumers act and think as a whole, and the importance of a dissenting opinion when everyone is all too eager to comply.I would rate this book a 3.5 if I could, but I'll round up because I'm feeling nice. I hope you can get your hands on a copy sometime soon!"
32,1594205140,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1468458-lisa,4,"So why do they bleach flour? Read this and you will find out and probably never buy bleached flour again. Having worked in QA in the pharmaceutical industry, I was familiar with the Pure Food and Drug Act of 1906 as the beginning of the regulation of pharmaceuticals, but hadn't really known that its major impetus was on food and I had never heard of the man who had such a big part of making it law, Dr. Harvey Washington Wiley. It was not just unclean production practices that put the food supply at risk of contamination. The dangers included what was purposefully added like heavy metal and coal tar food dyes, especially in candy; formaldehyde in meat and milk; preservatives that had never been tested for safety of human consumption; sugar replacements that had no caloric value; and other fillers added just to improve the profit margin. Some of these additives were even marketed to grocers and food producers solely based on their ability to be undetected and increase profitability by dilution of the actual food product or by masking spoilage. People were literally being killed by the food they ate. The book details just how adulterated our food supply was prior to this act, how much industry worked to keep it that way, how much politicians were unconcerned about the health and welfare of the common person, and how hard Dr. Wiley had to work to protect consumers. Some things never really change and the parallels to our modern world are easy to see. Industry does not, never has, and never will self-regulate if it means less profitability. There were some good guy manufacturers who were promoting pure food, such as H.J. Heinz Company, but they were the rare exception. Some of these same companies that were willingly putting our health at risk over 100 years ago are still in business: Armour, Swift, Coca-cola, Monsanto, McCormick. Despite the debt we owe him and his Poison Squad volunteers, they and Dr. Wiley have mostly been forgotten today. This book attempts to correct that. I fully appreciated the inclusion of historic photos, political cartoons, and food ads. It was especially gratifying to see the woman working in the chemistry lab in the early 1900's. Deborah Blum also includes Dr. Wiley's wife, Anna Kelton Wiley, who was one of the suffragists jailed by President Wilson. Are these hints at a future book on the womens' suffrage movement? I could completely see how this book could be born out of the research from ""The Poisoner's Handbook"" due to the pure whiskey issue. "
33,1594205140,http://goodreads.com/user/show/71163840-steven-meyers,5,"If you are under the impression that food was awesome back in the “good ole days,” then, man oh man, Ms. Blum’s book will relieve you of that misconception. ‘The Poison Squad’ shows how business greed and political chicanery worked hand-in-hand to place private interests over consumer safety. As the author states, “Fraud was not just pervasive, it was standard practice.” The decades-long fight over supplying consumers with information about what is in their food and the toxic dangers in it was enlightening but discouraging to read. Ms. Blum is a highly respected author who has written numerous books in the field of science. Her writing style is direct and easy to understand. The years covered are from 1844 through 1938. Buckle up, you’re in for a illuminating scary ride. During the mid-1800s, manufacturers and food processors discovered certain inexpensive chemicals could imitate foods and hide unhealthy diseased meats or other perishable products. Factory environments were hellholes, riddled with unsafe and unclean practices. Into this business atmosphere came Harvey Washington Wiley, a government chemist, who began experiments on the quality of foods, exposed business deceptions, and made the public aware of what their families were eating and drinking. Needless to say, company feces hit the fan big time. While Ms. Blum does center the book on Mr. Wiley’s actions, a plethora of other food safety advocates and detractors are also explained. During his three decades crusading against business chicanery he became a very popular and widely loved individual by the general public. Politicians and businessmen, however, would have liked nothing better than for Mr. Wiley to wind up in a can of corned beef or be fired. I never heard of the guy until I picked up ‘The Poison Squad.’ ‘The Poison Squad’ shows that there were responsible high-minded corporations such as Heinz who practiced and advocated for safe foods and there were plenty of nasty ones such as Monsanto who aggressively fought to allow their “additives” to remain in the market. The way companies acted about possibly having to supply consumers with ingredient information so they could make more informed choices, you’d think it was the next thing to Armageddon. It would be naïve to believe that those awful days are completely gone and corporations now place consumer safety over greed. Sure, like yesteryear, there are businesses that are good corporate stewards but like the old Russian proverb we should, “Trust but verify” before embracing a business’s assertions, especially when it comes to consumer safety. Greed has not somehow magically disappeared. In the author’s epilogue she states, “The story of consumer protection in the United States is often to story of a country playing defense, an account of government regulators waking up, time and time again, to yet another public health crisis.” In other words, once a sizable number of consumers bite the dust and it gets enough press exposure, then politicians and government act. Compared to the time period covered in the book, food safety has greatly improved. However, many businesses still focus on profit over public welfare is still very much with us. Ms. Blum has, yet again, written another highly informative work. Read it and weep."
34,1594205140,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2125854-becca-younk,3,"I loved The Poisoner's Handbook, so of course I had to read this when I spied it on display at the library. It's not quite as good, but still a compelling and interesting read. It's a bit scary to think about all the ingredients listed on labels that I wouldn't even be able to guess what they are, but at least they're listed! I can google them if I'm so inclined. Whereas previously, food manufacturers could just throw in basically whatever they wanted. The book follows Dr. Wiley at the Agriculture Department as he conducts studies in an effort to pass a Pure Food law. Dr. Wiley sounds great, he ends up marrying a suffragette, which is cool. I think where this book sort of falls flat is all the emphasis on the trials and the inner workings of the Department and politicians. It's interesting for awhile, and then gets a bit tedious and feels a little too much like office drama. While The Poisoner's Handbook gives specific examples of how poisons killed people, this book tends to just list deaths or illnesses as numbers. ""100 children died from such-and-such in Indiana"" type of thing, without going into detail. Food safety isn't as shocking as poisons, sure, but I wish there were more human impact stories. ""Cure-all"" medications are briefly mentioned, and it makes me wonder if Blum will write an entire book on those. Crossing my fingers she does, because that would be fascinating. Twice in the book Blum writes Midland, Michigan, as Midlands, Michigan. Once I can believe is a typo. But twice? It takes two seconds of googling to find that the headquarters of Dow is in Midland, no 's.' I find I'm very annoyed by the lack of caring to get a city name correct. Is publishing in such a bad state that there are no editors?"

She has an incredible talent for writing history and, in particular, making the areas of scientific history unbelievably exciting!After thoroughly enjoying her other book, The Poisoner’s Handbook, several years back, I was eager to pick up another one by her. The Poison Squad explores the unique history of food safety laws in the U.S. and the influence of historical figures on the creation of the Food Safety and Drug Administration — specifically Upton Sinclair’s The Jungle and Harvey Washington Wiley, the famous 19th century chemist who identified poisons in everyday manufactured foods we love to eat. The author also provides intriguing cases of food poisoning scandals by manufactured foods throughout the 19th and early 20th century. For example, in June 1899, the city of Cincinnati had to warn its citizens of an epidemic of stomach problems following the consumption of “embalmed” beef. “More than one thousand people had fallen ill in a single week after eating beef.” The culprit? Two new brand-name preservatives at the time that contained formaldehyde as a main ingredient. (p. 61) Truly a fascinating history! So glad we live in the times that we do! Highly recommended read. :-)"
36,1594205140,http://goodreads.com/user/show/28745526-allie,4,"I came across this book while at the Boston Science museum and knew I had pick it up. It took me several weeks to get through this book but, I still really enjoyed it. This book basically covers the story of Wiley and his fight for food safety regulations. It also discusses the effect politics can have on regulations and consumer protection as well as the creation of the 1906 Pure Food and Drug Act. It is quite alarming to me how we allow politics to impede the creation of regulations to keep people safe. This book provides examples of times when scientists and researchers were providing data about an adulterant saying, ""this can hurt you"" and industry saying, "" no it's fine"" and then politicians agreeing with industry. While we don't want to hurt business and our economy it is important to keep in mind that generally companies in industry are looking out for their own interest. Also I am so grateful for the safety regulations we have now. We don't have to worry about formalin in milk etc. One of my favorite quotes from this book was from Wiley in regards to the purpose of science which is "" to search for truth and thereby to elevate and improve mankind"". "
37,1594205140,http://goodreads.com/user/show/63521529-beth-menendez,5,"Solid 4.5 stars. I'm dinging it half a star because it is a scince-y book that can get a little dry at times and I think it may lose some readers because of this. However, for anyone who think that the Whole Foods movement and Clean Eating is a new fad, you are gravely mistaken. Deborah Blum does a fantastic job of making Dr. Harvey Washington Wiley come to life. Dr. Washington was the Chief Chemist in the Department of Chemistry and fought for YEARS trying to get congress to approve bills for the Pure Food and Drug movement. Before this movement it was completely legal to add preservatives to food so that spoiled food could then be served to the masses. Yes. Spoiled food. Since mass refrigeration was not really a thing yet, nor was any kind of safety guidelines for chemicals (whether used in food or drugs) all kinds of sketchy things were going on with food for the masses. Milk a little off? No worries, we'll put formaldehyde in it. Oh, was that cow a bit sick? No worries, we'll use some potassium nitrate (saltpeter) to keep it okay. It does not mater that saltpeter will actually kill you. It's cheaper than sodium chloride (table salt) so it's fine. Seriously. The stuff they put in medicines... eek. Just eek. So how does Dr Wiley come in? He began to protest that what manufacturers put in things was deceiving the populations. That maple syrup is not syrup. It's coal tar derived color agents (seriously) and water with a little sugar. Later with a lot of saccharin in it. Because it's cheaper. There were huge arguments over corn syrup as a cheaper additive to foods than sugar. Wait - aren't we STILL arguing about this. Yes, yes we are. After reading this book I am realizing how much has stayed the same and not changed a bit. Oh the topics might be a little different but the court case involving Coca Cola and their ingredients that were both addicting to people and toxic to them that went round and round could be replaced with the energy drinks of today all over the same chemical - caffeine.  The way that what we eat is literally influenced by who is in the White House was a bit of a shock. Dr. Wiley had harder times certain years simply because the president in office elected secretaries that made Dr. Wiley's job almost impossible. The fact that the main secretary to the USDA over him had ties to manufacturing making his job nearly impossible at the end of his term could have read like it was happening today. Upton Sinclair's book The Jungle was more than just a novel - it was a whistle blowing land mine that showed many what was going on with the ""food"" we eat. Even with that book selling thousands of copies there was much attempt to discredit Sinclair which were eventually successful because Sinclair was a socialist - he just wanted everyone to get a fair (clean healthy) shake. Manufacturers and lobbyists were not about to let this happen and so he became a pariah in Washington.  The one thing that resounded throughout the book is how much we fight over the minutiae until there is a national epidemic sadly has not changed. The 1906 original Pure Foods bill (Dr Wiley's bill) came into effect after many children died from the formaldehyde in the milk after YEARS of dying on the floor of Congress. The 1938 bill that beefed (no pun intended) up the bill came about after many children died from taking cough syrup that had been made with sweetened with diethylene glycol (antifreeze). Similar bills were passed in 1956 and 1971 after injury to women and children. Why do I mention this? Because we are STILL fighting this battle - remember when there was salmonella in the peanut butter? Remember how no one could eat salad last Thanksgiving because of E.Coli? Yes, we are still fighting getting clean, pure food from manufacturers. If that is not scary I cannot think what is. Before we look at the past with rose colored glasses we need to realize that the fight for balance of what is actually good for us and what can be had cheaply is still going on. For this reason alone, I highly recommend this book. "
38,1594205140,http://goodreads.com/user/show/63970501-maureen-caupp,4,"A very interesting read about the work done at the turn of the twentieth century by the United States Department of Agriculture to determine the contents of food and drinks, the impacts of the added compounds on health, and the continuing battle to regulate harmful additives and require truthful labeling. At the turn of the century food manufactures used dangerous preservatives such as formaldehyde in dairy and meats to cover up already spoiling products. Manufactures also used cheap synthetic dyes and flavorings to cut costs. For example ketchup often didn't have tomatoes and strawberry jam didn't contain strawberries. Instead both were any available food scraps left over (pumpkin rinds, apple cores and skins, etc.) dyed red.This book focuses on the efforts of the chief chemist at the USDA for over 30 years around the turn of the century who worked tirelessly and was a strong advocate for regulation and accurate labeling. It also goes into some of the legal battles involved in regulating additives to food and drink. Just like today whenever any regulating legislation managed to get passed into law manufactures pushed back to weaken the new laws. "

My coworker, now my manager, requested the library purchase it, and they did! So she borrowed it and said it was fascinating.Then when it came out in paperback, both blogs again ran blurbs, and I checked it out.I would consider this a must-read book. It details so much about common assumptions of the public, government, and business, and WHY government is absolutely essential to putting roadblocks into the path of capitalism.Some might say that the book bogs down a bit when it details all the different shit (sometimes literally) the Bureau of Chemistry was finding in food products, but it never repeated itself, and it honestly could have gone on forever. The borax, the salicylic acid, the lead, it just never stopped coming. The rise of industrial chemistry, while ultimately a good thing, makes me shiver in fear at what it would have been like to have been alive then.Absolutely loved the epilogue where the author warns against this presidential administration pointing out that it directly mirrors what Harvey Washington Wiley was up against.Those who are not students of history are condemned to repeat the past, indeed."

48,1594205140,http://goodreads.com/user/show/32057224-grace,3,"I think this is an important read to understand the politics and process behind the eventual creation of the FDA. It is essential to understand that throughout time, industry/corporations in masse have actively fought against protecting individuals if they perceived the requested change would have a negative impact on their profit. These corporations have expended significant revenue to market the political idea of the deregulation of all the things. This book is a great example of why, as a society, there is a necessity for many of the existing regulations. It also does a good job of highlighting corporations and individuals who were open to change and saw the value in a pure food movement and how it could be economically and socially beneficial. Personally, I think I should have read this slower and just read a chapter here and there. To some extent, the chapters and build up were formulaic and came off as a tad dense. This is likely because the majority of the book discussed how a food or beverage was adulterated and the steps taken to stop the incorrect labeling or toxic additives. The adulterations were often similar and the process of fighting the deceptions would be similar, ie. education of the public and the attempt to pass laws to prohibit the additives or mislabeling. Due to the somewhat repetitive nature, I think I would have liked to spread out this book. With that said, I still enjoyed this read and recommend it! If I could I would have given it 3.5 and probably would have been a 4.0 had a read it like I suggested above."

Wiley, a man I’d heard nothing about before. As in all of her previous books, Blum’s conversational tone belies meticulous research and attention to detail. Each chapter, charmingly epigraphed with a line or verse from a poem by Wiley himself, is filled with quotations from primary sources; ancillary characters are given their due. Decades of political warfare and industry opposition to pure-food-and-drug laws (familiar names such as Monsanto, Dow Chemical, and Coca-Cola all make unflattering appearances) are richly described.The hand-wringing ineffectiveness of early enforcement, endless concessions to regulation-hating manufacturers, conflicts of interest, and downright corruption in the Department of Agriculture and elsewhere are frustrating, unsurprising, and terribly modern, but I sometimes found myself equally exasperated by Wiley’s crusader-style single-mindedness (that word’s in the title for a reason).I do wish the book had focused more on Wiley’s later-life work with Good Housekeeping Laboratories and covered a bit more of the history of the Food and Drug Administration (newly founded at the book’s close and Wiley’s death in 1930). I wish Wiley’s work and that of the pure-food defenders was not still under continuous undermining more than a century later, as the Epilogue notes. And, tangentially, I would love to read a similar biography/history of Frances Oldham Kelsey’s half-century of work at the FDA. What a lovely parallel (or sequel) that would make."

This history of the fight for food safety laws in the United States is a disturbing page-turner that literally kept me up at night because I didn’t want to put it down.As food manufacturers in the late 19th century embraced chemicals as preservatives, sweeteners or colourants to keep food bright and tasty, they were under no obligation to tell customers what was in their milk or meat, coffee or candy. Whiskey might not even be whiskey. Children died after drinking “chemically improved” milk, canned meat sent to soldiers fighting in the Spanish-American war was described as “embalmed beef.” Formaldehyde was used to deal with the sour taste of milk and extend its life, while chalk was added to whiten it. Borax improved the taste of rancid butter, candy was coloured with poisonous dyes that included arsenic or lead. Saccharine (marketed by Monsanto more than a century ago) presented a health risk if consumed in large enough doses, which was likely because it was an unlabelled sweetener in many products: from soft drinks to jam to canned vegetables. There was no requirement for any food to be or even include what it said it was. Spices could be predominantly anything but the pepper or ginger promised on the bottle, which may include burned shells, charcoal and even floor sweepings. Honey was often tinted corn syrup, tea leaves may not be tea and “fraud was not just pervasive; it was standard practice.”Any effort to introduce safety testing or require a breakdown of ingredients was met with sharp resistance from industry, which often received a sympathetic ear in the White House across a handful of administrations. At the dawn of the 20th century, the manufacturer of a formaldehyde-infused preservative called Freezine argued that the public should just embrace whatever chemicals prevented food decay without question, noting “I wish to say that every one of us eats embalmed meat and we know it and we like it.” Weaving all of this together is a biography of chemist Dr. Harvey Wiley, who refused to back down in his quest for consumer protection. Wiley, chief chemist for the US Department of Agriculture, spent decades fighting for regulations, investigation and even basic labelling to inform consumers what was their food or drinks. The Pure Food and Drug Act, passed in 1906, was known to many as “Dr. Wiley’s law” although he is largely a footnote in history today. In his later years, Wiley was bitter about the struggle and the constant pushback from industry for any regulation. Pulitzer Prize-winning science journalist Deborah Blum has done a fabulous job of bringing this era to life and outlining the challenges facing Wiley and others who tried to spotlight the importance of food safety. It’s rare to celebrate the efforts of a civil servant, especially where those who work for the public good are often painted by politicians as an impediment to business, a consideration spelled out in Wiley’s day. It’s also very true in the 21st century, where the current president vowed to eliminate any regulation that kills jobs. The Poison Squad: One Chemist's Single-Minded Crusade for Food Safety at the Turn of the Twentieth Century is a first-rate thriller. 4.5 stars."
60,1594205140,http://goodreads.com/user/show/91545533-collin-lysford,3,"Everything old is new again, and this history of chemist Harvey Wiley fighting against food regulation echoes a lot into the present day. This book does a great job of covering the backroom wheeling and dealing that rises up to weaken what should be useful regulation. It's actually one of the rare histories that I think could have done with more author editorializing, not less. Poison Squad is at it's best when it's drawing out the obvious parallels with corporate opposition then and now, and at it's worst when it's putters slowly around the corners of Wiley's life.If you wouldn't agree with the statement ""corporate regulations are generally very beneficial to the average citizen, which is why corporations will enact targeted campaigns at great expense to stymie them"", I would highly recommend you read Poison Squad and learn how brazen things can get even about something as important and high-impact as the food we put in our bodies killing us or not.

The book is also very accessible and an easy read. First of all, some of the descriptions of contamination are truly horrifying. But in that way that makes you want to know more. It was interesting to me how some of the controversies and behaviors are come up over and over again. Some ingredients, such as saccharin, still debated about today. An excellent portrayal of man who was a genuine public servant. But it doesn't paint him as perfect. There were times when he was wrong, or over strident on an issue. Winning some battles at the expense of others that might have been better targets. The historic cast of characters was also illuminating. You can see how politics, both for good and for bad played and continues to play a major role in these issues. Definitely a good read. I strongly recommend it."

There is a frightening epilogue to this book where Blum indicates that the Trump administration is going out of its way to tear down all of the protections that were inspired by Harvey Wiley's efforts (and Upton Sinclair's The Jungle among others) because of course our con artist president only seeks short term gain.

Dr Wiley, chief chemist of the US Department of Agriculture, saw poisons and mislabeled ingredients in even the most common of foods. Two of the most dangerous things to consume at the turn of the last century were milk (laced with formaldehyde and gypsum) and candy (colored with arsenic and cyanide). Kids died, but no one wanted to interfere with American Business. You could get great bonded whiskey, or, at a lesser price, grain alcohol tinted with caramel. Why use expensive sugar when saccharin, with no food value, could be used? Dr Wiley and his tireless 6-person crew fought to get the additives out and the products labelled accurately. TR signed the Pure Food Act into law in 1906, but the Secretary of Agriculture, James Wilson (not the one who signed the Declaration of Independence) made the law as toothless as he could.

And, I have to admit, the book shocked me – I didn’t think that deception in food could be that bad!The Poison Squad is the story of Harvey Wiley, the father of the Pure Food and Drug Act. The early 1900s was a bad time for food – as the book puts it, ” ‘Honey’ often proved to be thickened, colored corn syrup, and ‘vanilla’ extract a mixture of alcohol and brown food coloring. ‘Strawberry’ jam could be sweetened paste made from mashed apple peelings laced with grass seeds and dyed red” and so forth.Given my interest in tea, I kept an eye out for fake tea and found something called “lie tea”. As the book describes it, “this substance, as its name implied, was an imitation of tea, usually containing fragments or dust of the genuine leaves, foreign leaves, and mineral matters, held together by means of a starch solution.”Ewwwww!Apart from the fake food, a lot of food was preserved with poisonous substances like formaldehyde, borax, and much more. One scientist in Wiley’s division “tested 198 samples of candy and found that a full 115 were tainted by the use of dangerous dyes, mostly arsenic and lead chromate.”Back then, food manufacturers argued against government interference in food regulation, arguing that these were harmful to the business. Additionally, they argued that it was better for the food to stay preserved than to have it rot (further) and spread diseases. It took Harvey Wiley and his poison squad, a team of volunteers who subjected themselves to the preservatives to see their effects, to prove that what was in the food was bad for the human body.You would think that once all these fakery and harmful preservatives were brought to light, the government would want to move swiftly and clamp down on these food manufacturers, right? Well, although the American public was rightly outraged at what they were eating, the government was strangely reluctant to act. Agriculture Secretary, James Wilson, thought that Wiley was too much of a crusader and even brought in a board of people whose purpose was to ‘review’ Wiley’s findings.I found The Poison Squad to be a fascinating read. It covers Wiley’s years in office and documents his battle to make sure food is pure. Wiley is extremely strict about food standards, perhaps so strict that harmed it his political career, but you have to admire him for it.If you’re interested in food safety, or just interested in knowing more about how food and the regulation needed, this is the book to read. It’s hooked me from the start and I couldn’t put it down. And while there was a pretty long list of people (long enough that the first few pages were a character list), keeping track of them felt natural. You don’t have to be a history buff to enjoy this.Disclaimer: I got a free copy of this book from the publisher via NetGalley in exchange for a free and honest review.This review was first posted at Eustea Reads"
67,1594205140,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3181581-lisa,5,"This book describes the work of Department of Agriculture chemist Harvey Wiley in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. Wiley worked tirelessly to get the U.S. government to regulate food producers and marketers, who were producing foods in highly unsanitary conditions and adulterating foods with substances that mimicked actual foods (pumpkin rinds, coconut shells), were intended to restore rotten foods (formaldehyde), were intended to preserve foods longer in that era of uncertain refrigeration (again with the formaldehyde), were intended to color foods to make them look better (copper sulfates, coal-tar dyes), or were intended to take up room in the package with a substance less expensive than the food product would have been (borax, floor sweepings). There were no requirements that products be labeled for contents or package weight. Food manufacturers and packagers strenuously resisted regulations and contributed to congressional representatives to convince them that such regulations were ""anti-business,"" although people were being sickened and poisoned and deceived. Women's organizations (in this pre-women's suffrage era) lobbied strongly for regulations, as did publications like Good Housekeeping magazine. The publication of Upton Sinclair's The Jungle in 1906 exposed sickening practices in the Chicago meatpacking industry and helped to pass the first, rather toothless pure food law, but it was a step on the way to the creation of the Food and Drug Administration and to the labeling and packaging requirements that we take for granted today. One thing that I kept thinking as I read this book, in this era of deregulation, is that businesses and industries will buy votes and do almost anything else they must to save money or make money--witness the oil industry and the dismantling of regulations to protect the environment--regardless of the effects on human beings, screaming all the way that they will be put out of business or that the government is anti-business if it tries to protect the people it is supposed to be serving. And the politicians pocket the money and fail to act, for the most part, until some lethal scandal occurs and the outrage of the people forces action. Let this be a warning to us that regulation can be a very good thing. The book essentially ends when Dr. Wiley retires, although there is an epilogue that traces more recent developments. I wish the author had gone into detail about recent years and the accomplishments of the FDA (such as keeping thalidomide out of the United States), but I guess she had to stop somewhere.

Shouldn't we know some of the original stories of resistance? Here's a great one that is new to me. This is the frustrating and inspiring tale of Dr. Harvey Wiley, the chief chemist of the agricultural department of the federal government. He pushed relentlessly for regulation for food safety and honest labeling. His motivator was the protection of the American public and being the best civil servant he could be. Trials awaited him at every turn, big business and his own government often seemed to work against him. Much of his efforts paid off and we today benefit from his tirelessness and ideals. Of course, with this new administration (Trump) we are in danger again. Let us be galvanized to fight for food safety and aware of the battle that was waged by people like Dr. Wiley. "

What hit me hardest were the businessmen saying that 1) labeling their product in the grocery store will kill their business dead, 2) complying with food regulations that keep formaldehyde out of children's milk will kill the dairy business dead, 3) maintaining standards of cleanliness at food production facilities - any standards - will kill the food business dead. Sounds *so* familiar to today's business folks, right? Anyway, I listened to this, often while cooking food that I'd purchased at a farmer's market or food coop because if I'd used processed foods while listening to this, I might not have been able to eat it.

I would like to think that most of the horrifying practices described in this book are now impossible thanks to government regulation... but having read the book, I know that would be beyond naive to assume. Blum chronicles the earliest stages of food regulation and policy in the United States by following the chemist who was the fiercest champion and advocate for ""pure food"" in America. The most shocking and distressing aspect of this story was the lengths that lobbyists, industry, and government officials went to in order to block the passage and enforcement of food safety laws, laws whose only goal was to protect citizens and prevent illness or death. Money matters more than anything else in this country, even more than people's lives, if the powerful and greedy are left unchecked. The book's epilogue, which alludes to the rollback of regulations by the disgusting creature that currently occupies the White House, capped the ominousness of the story by pointing out how little has changed since 1906.

I expected a book on The Poison Squad - on the food tests done by the precursor to the FDA to establish guidelines for the safety (or unsafety) of various preservatives. But the book spends very little time on that subject.A lot of it feels like someone trying to hit a word count - chapters and chapters of summaries of ""so and so submitted this bill and it was voted on and the vote was x to x,"" and ""this person thought this person was flirting with him but she wasn't."" There were three chapters of well-trod ground about Upton Sinclair writing ""The Jungle."" (In fairness, I did appreciate the nitty-gritty details of how it was financed, because I am the sort of person who watches a movie and then looks up its per-screen average.)I tried to take this book on its own merits once it was clear it was a dry history of the political efforts that led to the eventual passage of food safety legislation in the U.S., rather than a story of a chemist doing experiments. However, once I hit a chapter on Heinz's development of modern ketchup, a subject I have written about myself, I found so many factual errors in the first few pages that it made me question whether I could trust the other areas I know less about. (For the record: the idea that Europeans thought tomatoes were poisonous is an American myth, and the idea that the acidity of tomatoes but not lemons caused lead poisoning from pewter plates, which are part of Medieval Times and not a real thing in medieval times, is an even newer urban legend. I don't know why books are held to a lower fact-checking standard than magazines. You'd think it would be the other way around.)Disappointing."

Loved it. One of the best books I've ever read. Imagine my delight when I found this BookPeople staff recommendation! I of course snatched it up and was thrilled to put it on my TBR shelf. And then I saw that PBS had an episode of American Experience based on this book, and remembering how marvelous their treatment of her previous book was, I pushed this book up to the top of my pile. These books are very different, although they're structured similarly. They both follow chemists solving specific problems in a similar time period. For some reason, though, this book didn't capture me the way the other one did. Maybe because this book was about the fight for government regulations, which isn't the most thrilling of concepts. Learning how jacked up our food used to be was really eye opening and fascinating, though. We tend to think about the ""old days"" as having cleaner foods, before the advent of all of the preservatives and additives we have now, when in actuality, the additives we have now are a major improvement over the heavy metals and actual poisons that were used in our food at the turn of the last century. This was a really well-written book, and I learned a lot. It's just that, for me, food adulteration isn't as thrilling a topic as forensic toxicology. Nonetheless, I eagerly await her next book. "

I enjoyed this book but I am not sure that a wider audience would like it as much. Part of what I like about it is that because I have my own involvement with government policy, it soothes me to realize that its normal for there to be a struggle, and that in fact, everything that ever got done was like herding cats - that's just the way making change is. However, I feel that many general readers might be turned off by the bureaucratic back and forths, since these are more prominent in the book than the elements of science and biography, though those are there too. My favourite part of the book was the poison squad itself, who were not scientists but volunteers who ate their meals in the research centre so that changes in their health in response to different additives could be observed. I wanted to know more about those men as individuals. Oh, and I also feel it would be more intellectually honest to acknowledge that while many of the additives that Wiley fought over were later shown to be legitimately dangerous, some of them were not.

There are of course some industrial good guys--Henry Heinz, for example, and others who found they could make money off unadulterated goods and wanted to make sure they weren't unfairly undercut. But the story is very much about how little mattered aside from profit, unless the government had regulations with teeth. And then as now, the government was in large part in the pocket of industry. But with the work of good public servants, and especially with a lot of outcry from the public--notably, in large numbers, women--and the press, the government could be pushed to do what was right. However, the pushing had to--has to--continue to prevent backsliding. And the clear parallels with the present, the continuity with today's backsliding and struggle, are spelled out in Blum's conclusion.

Deborah Blum's book will shock and intrigue you as she goes through the life of Harvey Washington Wiley's whose research and strength pushed legislation to protect the current and next generation of Americans from terrible ingredients food companies added to make their food last longer or produce faster. You mouth will drop at her descriptions of formaldehyde being used in milk, green slime getting scrapped off canned meat, and whiskey using anything but distilled corn. If you still have a steady stomach, you'll be intrigued by the politics and lobbying used to help food companies keep these terrible practices.

His chemical work and political advocacy helped bring about the Pure Food and Drug Act of 1906 and government regulation that helps keep Americans safe and healthy to this day. Without Wiley’s work, unscrupulous food, drink, and drug manufacturers would have continued to adulterate these products with poison and sold garbage under false labels.

86,1594205140,http://goodreads.com/user/show/41221614-carissa,5,"A really, really good book that follows the career of Harvey Wiley and his crusade for food safety. It is astounding, if you weren't already aware, of exactly what was put into foods and drugs when no regulation existed. It is astounding, if not surprising, what manufacturers would do to protect their business over the health of the consumer. And it is astounding, if unfortunate, how much work had to be done to put consumer safety into law - and keep it there, a war started by Wiley and one that is not done, even today. I do not envy the foods of the olden days where thousands of children would die from drinking milk with no government action nor do I think we truly appreciate how we got to where we are today with food safety. That said, not only is it a wonderful book about food safety, but one that follows policy and politics and shows us that many of the battles we fight today are eerily alike to the ones fought more than a century ago.I read it through a mixture of a physical copy and audiobook. The audiobook is well done."
87,1594205140,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1519649-melanie-page,2,"The Poison Squad by Deborah Blum largely focuses on Dr. Wiley, a chemist who worked for the U.S. government in the Department of Agriculture for decades while he campaigned for a pure food movement. To be clear, he doesn’t mean pure food the way people mean “clean eating.” Pure food is an item that is what it says it is. If I buy a bag of ground coffee, it should be ground coffee. Not some ground coffee cut with sawdust, wheat, and dandelion seeds. If I buy milk, it shouldn’t have the cream removed off the top and replaced with pureed calf brains, water added to stretch the product (and chalk to keep the white color). These are two examples Blum uses (repeatedly, tirelessly) in The Poison Squad.The book opens interestingly enough with the line “We tend these days to cast a romantic glow over the foods of our forefathers.” It’s a good hook — modern eaters bemoan foods with more than a couple of ingredients, and scowl at the sugar added to nearly everything (low-fat yogurt, spaghetti sauce, canned beans, oatmeal). Wasn’t food just, well, more natural back in nana’s time? No, it wasn’t.The Food and Drug Administration was started by President Lincoln, but didn’t do much until Dr. Wiley got involved in 1883. He commenced with what the newspapers dubbed “the poison squad,” a group of twelve strapping young men with strong constitutions who would eat foods that had additives, usually preservatives used at the time, in specific doses. Every trial seemed to prove that what Americans ate on the regular was making them sick. The Food and Drug Act doesn’t pass until 1906. Very little was changed due to vague wording (what does “unfit for food” mean?), so Dr. Wiley continued to use his voice and fight government bureaucrats and big industries like dairy, places making canned goods, and Coca Cola.After teaching rhetoric to college students for eleven years, it’s nearly impossible for me to sit back and simply “enjoy” a work of nonfiction. I’m questioning everything from the sources to the diction. To me, it’s clear that Deborah Blum admires Dr. Wiley and wants readers to root for him, going so far as thanking him in the epilogue. However, Wiley’s opponents, including his boss, acknowledge that the more time goes on Wiley’s focus shifts to social activism, saying that certain additives should be banned from food and drink before he has the science to back it up. At other times, Wiley is so fastidious with his definitions that his opponents proclaim that bakers will soon be in trouble if they sell Lady Fingers, for fear that the production doesn’t include 100% female digits.Blum’s writing suggests I should feel no hesitation about supporting Wiley as a tireless hero. She uses the word “enemy” to describe Wiley’s boss, who was worried that Wiley had lost sight of unbiased scientific research. She uses the most dramatic examples to support her claims about needing government intervention to assure safe food and drink:Dairies near Indianapolis weren’t bothering with commercially prepared formulas like Preservaline. They were simply pouring straight formaldehyde into rotting milk. Then they sold it on the cheap to poor families and to budget-strapped facilities like orphanages. The practice had been linked to the deaths of more than two dozen children in Indianapolis orphanages.Of course I feel bad the poor people and orphans affected by bad business practices, but at the time all Americans who shopped in grocery stores or bought milk that wasn’t directly from a small farm run by an ethical farmer were affected by bad business practices. Regardless of who they are, everyone has a right to get the item they pay for, and not an altered or mislabeled version. Twice, Blum uses orphans to invoke the reader’s pathos and side with Dr. Wiley.More red flags went up when I read that Dr. Wiley grew tired of his boss and whomever was President of the United States at the time thwarting his efforts, so he takes a more lucrative job with the magazine Good Housekeeping, writing articles after being promised no one could edit his work in any way. Wiley notes that he can write whatever he thinks is best for Americans and have it published, including food and beverages with the now-prestigious Good Housekeeping seal of approval.Though he may recommend products with no ill intent, Blum fails to provide alternate sources that may reasonably question Wiley or his work. She lets readers assume that businesses are greedy, the government is in on it, and Wiley is a hero without giving an unbiased look at real objections businesses may have, such as the fact that many of the additives Wiley was against had not been tested to prove they were unsafe, and if they were, what dose is unsafe consumption.Much of The Poison Squad felt repetitive to me: lists of which foods and additives that were causing health problems, which people objected to Wiley and why, heading to court and winning a small battle only to be called to court again to be re-tried, and Wiley arguing with a boss he finds obstructionist. A small time period is covered in the chapters, yet readers learn little of American consumers, why the sitting U.S. president would reasonably oppose food and beverage protection bills, and the details of the poison squad tests — these are largely summarized despite the title leading readers to think they would be the focus.Blum teased me by summarizing the help women’s groups supplied to Dr. Wiley and mentions that Wiley’s wife became a famous suffragist at the time. Without those women protesting, organizing, and letter writing, Wiley’s first bill in 1906 likely would not have passed, Blum suggests. Their story is the one I wanted to hear. The Poison Squad is possibly a work for those interested in chemistry and legal affairs than I am and would best be further rhetorically analyzed by such a reader.This review was originally published at Grab the Lapels."

Deborah Blum reveals the story of one those facets of America: food and drug law (did you ever stop to think what “unbleached” flour means, or why labels are so proud of this fact? Mystery solved thanks to this book). Blum details Dr. Harvey Washington Wiley’s decades long quest (1880s-1906) for food and drug regulation, against always-formidable business owner foes and their governmental allies. Rife with truly disgusting historical detail--congealed rope sent as meat to American soldiers, insects in dry goods, formaldehyde in milk--Blum renders evergreen American philosophies about regulation and capitalism in stark clarity.

It’s The Poison Squad: One Chemist's Single-Minded Crusade for Food Safety at the Turn of the Twentieth Century. I know what you’re thinking … what does “food safety” have to do with the elevation of ‘greed’ to a moral imperative? Nothing I’m afraid. But what Blum’s book does do is describe a libertarian utopia in terms so vivid and compelling it will make your ‘taxation is theft’ poster look like liberal propaganda. She describes a vision of a possible future derived from the past. A time before any regulatory or enforcement mechanisms existed relating to the labeling or safety of the U.S. food supply. When grocers, packagers and distributers were free to do whatever they wanted … and what they wanted was to make as much money as possible through adulteration of the food supply.It was a time when the name on the food package didn’t have to match its contents. Thus:Ground spices might contain dirt, shells, twigs, leaves, sand, clay or floor sweepingsHoney and maple syrup might be nothing more than corn syrup and colorantVegetables could be made to look fresh and green with copper sulfateCitrus juice could be mixed with sulfuric acidTea might be dried leaves of any typePatent medicines contained things like opium, cocaine, grain alcohol, turpentine or laxativesMilk was often watered down then adulterated with gypsum, plaster of paris and pureed calf brains to make it look white and frothyThen there were the preservatives. Remember that this was a time before refrigeration became widespread. When people had cold cellars or ice boxes (literally, boxes with ice in them). But food still had to be transported from farm to market and spoilage was rampant. If you were lucky, the food was treated with less harmful substances like borax, if you were unlucky … formaldehyde or salicylic acid. Soldiers in the field would complain about receiving “embalmed beef” rations, and being sickened by the chemical odor when opening cans of food, and children would occasionally sicken or die from arsenic and lead used as dyes in candy. But the real tragedy is that these ingrates simply didn’t realize they were living the free-market dream. Liberty was ultimately curtailed with the ratification of The Pure Food and Drug Act of 1906, the first of a series of significant consumer protection laws which was enacted by Congress, and it’s only gotten worse since then. It seems the nanny state, as embodied in the Food and Drug Administration, doesn’t believe that ‘poison’ (aka ‘freedom’) has any place in the food supply. Sad.[/sarcasm]The Poison Squad is the biography of Harvey Washington Wiley, a chemist at the Department of Agriculture who launched a crusade against food adulteration and later served as the first commissioner of the United States Food and Drug Administration. According to Wiki: “ Many libertarian philosophers cite Wiley's work as a cornerstone to increasing the breadth and depth of state coercion in the United States, arguing that freedom in medicine, food, and the right to bodily self-ownership began a sharp decline with his measures. Which is ample evidence as to the absence of serious libertarian thinkers as well as why there are no libertarian governments in the world and never will be. As to the book, I thought the first third was quite good, mainly due to the salacious and nausea-inducing nature of Blum’s descriptions of horrible crap found in food. The latter two thirds largely details the political jockeying that takes place as part of getting a new consumer protection law passed, and was about as interesting as it sounds."
111,1594205140,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2827349-terry,4,"The Poison Squad is the 2019 Big Read Book for the University of Wisconsin-Madison campus. Deborah Blum provides a graphic history of the fight for the 1906 Pure Food and Drug Act and the subsequent battle over enforcement of the law, then popularly known as ""Dr. Wiley's Law"" named for the main character of the book - Dr. Harvey Washington Wiley. The late 19th and early 20th century featured food processors who discovered that chemical additives would preserve food but did no testing to determine how detrimental the additives were to human health. For example, formaldehyde was routinely added to milk and then sold to the poor and orphanages. In one case, this practiced killed 400 children in Oklahoma. Wiley, as Chief Chemist of the United States of Agriculture, waged a personal campaign against the adulteration of food and forcefully pushed for food labeling. Powerful forces were arrayed against him, including major food corporations, chemical manufacturers, grocers, whiskey blenders, etc. Year after year bills for pure food failed to pass Congress because of the lobbying efforts and moneyed interests of the food industry. Wiley's secret weapon turned out to be women. The Women's Christian Temperance Movement and strong female leaders such as Alice Lakey, Fannie Farmer, and others became strong proponents of pure, unadulterated food. The ""poison squad"" of the title refers to the health studies Wiley oversaw. Healthy young men, mostly government workers, were fed carefully monitored diets where specific doses of chemical preservatives were included. Wiley studied sodium benzoate, borax, saccharine, sulfites, nitrites, and a number of other chemicals. These were some of the first controlled studies of the effects of chemical food additives on humans. The eventual passage of the Pure Food and Drug bill in 1906 was a major, but flawed, effort to cleanup the United States food supply. The bill didn't address what constituted adulterated or even ""additive"". Enforcement was difficult - the federal government had to seize adulterated food and then prove in court there was a problem with it. Wiley worked at USDA for 29 years fighting internal politics and external enemies. Eventually, a much stronger piece of legislation, the Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act of 1938, creating the Food and Drug Administration, addressed many, but not all of the flaws of the earlier legislation. What is striking about this history is that we continue to repeat it -- even today there are strong political forces to accommodate industry and to find a ""balance"" between food safety and industry's demand for latitude in government regulations. This book provides an eye-opening view of where America's food supply has been and the need for constant vigilance to keep our current food supply safe for consumption. "
112,1594205140,http://goodreads.com/user/show/41674097-nick,4,"I enjoyed this history of the creation of the Pure Food and Drug Act of 1906. However, I feel like in many ways there’s more to the story and that the book becomes a bit too involved in the minutia in the daily politics of the Chemistry Bureau and leaves out a resolution for some of the points of the story. For example, what ever happened to all of the preservatives that Dr. Wiley suspected were harmful. Did the FDA eventually ban or limit all of these? The answer in some cases (borax, formaldehyde, etc) is yes. Others are less clear. Wikipedia says that Sodium Benzoate is generally considered safe. How and when did the public health community reach that consensus? Doesn’t this now accepted science which runs counter to Dr. Wiley’s advocacy suggest he may have been too zealous on some issues? Or was this just a limitation of the science that was available at the time?Similarly, when did saccharine fall out of use? And when did full labeling of ingredients on packaging become required? Was it a result of a piece meal approach (as suggested by the conclusion of the saccharine story) or was a there a major regulatory/legislative change? All of the discussion about what makes a whiskey - how much of this survived Prohibition? Did the repeal of the Volstead act create a definition that favored one whiskey group over another? When did refrigeration limit the need for some of these preservatives? The book later says that some Coal-Tar dyes weren’t restricted until the 1970s. Why did that take so long? It also seems to me there are a whole hosts of modern controversies that have vestiges of the pure (whole?) food movement. What happened to the that movement? How would they view the GMO labeling debate? Or definition of “organic” food? I also feel like some history of science is missing. The setup of the Poison Squad trials seems problematic for how modern medicine might approach the same question. Was this really the best science that could be done at the time? Did others in the academic community try to repeat and verify these tests? Do they reach the same conclusions? If they didn’t reach the same conclusions, what effect would that have had on the mechanism of regulation?"

Whiskey was nothing more than mixed ethanol with caramel coloring. Candies were dyed with toxic metals (lead and copper). Rotting beef, cheese and eggs were freshened up with mixtures of embalming fluid. Saccharin was the sweetener of choice (much cheaper than sugar) and was found in virtually all food stuffs. Commercial adulteration became pervasive, cascading a downward race to the bottom, forcing even reputable ""pure food"" retailers to cut with adulterants just to remain competitive.Countless people died (mostly children and the elderly) from these unsafe foods, practices and preservatives. The food industry profited exorbitantly for low cost additives; they became deeply invested and fought tooth-and-nail to stop any regulatory oversight. Such political-corporate cronyism inhibited consumer protection for decades. In the 1890s, Harvey Washington Wiley, a government chemist and untiring pure food advocate, mounted a safe food crusade enlisting the newly formed suffragette movement. After years of losses and dog-nosed drudgery they passed the Pure Food and Drug Act of 1906, an enterprising yet incomplete set of legislative guidelines for food safety. Much like today’s similarly defeatist drama of politico-corporate caucusing, enforcement of these safe food rules remained in legislative lock-up for decades causing countless harm and untold suffering. This book is the grave yet inspiring account of one government chemist's lifelong advocacy in the rapidly advancing, late industrial, age of chemical agribusiness.Recommended reading for all dietitians, safe (slow) food activists and naive libertarians."

It will definitely help curb your appetite! I discovered this book after listening to and enjoying another book by Deborah Blum. Dating back to the mid-1800's, this book follows the career of Dr. Harvey Wiley, the chemist whose crusade for safer food ultimately led to the creation of the FDA. Though I did find my mind drifting off at times while listening to it, the book was a fascinating look at the additives, such as borax and formaldehyde, which were once considered to be acceptable in our food and how sometimes common spices, such as pepper, contained very little - if any - pepper at all. I did feel there was a bit of repetition throughout the book - ketchup was mentioned frequently before the section devoted just to it, for example. I was fascinated at times by the logic of those opposed to stricter food labeling and amazed to learn how long big business has had it's hand in this aspect of the government. I didn't realize Monsanto has been around for as long as they have, for example. (Or that Nabisco was once called the National Biscuit Company - fun bit of trivia!). As someone who is allergic to sulfites, I found the part of the book addressing its use in foods to be very interesting. Whiskey has quite a history as to what can and cannot be called whiskey! Though this book primarily centers around the late 1800's and early 1900's, it still made me wonder what is lurking in our food and considered acceptable - are there still pumpkin rinds in my ketchup or nut shells in my ground pepper? What exactly are ""natural flavors?"" Given that it's mentioned in the epilogue, what is the current administration doing to our food we don't know about? Wiley's legacy is quite the story of mostly uphill battles and triumph, but he also faced plenty of defeat as well in his quest to make our food safer and get us to where we are today."
116,1594205140,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8679982-chris-conrady,4,"A poignant look at the clash between big business' quest for profit, the consumers' well being, and the governments' conflicted roll in the middle. Although the novel is really about the fight and passion of the formation of what is now known as the Food and Drug administration, this is a good study of capitalism, the need for government oversight and a look at what happens when there is none. It's really a classic story of good versus evil.Fortunately there are people like Doctor Harvey Wiley, who dedicated his life to the fight of protecting people from greedy, unscrupulous organizations that would get away with anything they could to make a profit without regard to the results on their employees or the consumer. Wiley was one of the first people to really look behind the curtain (and under the microscope) at what consumers were actually getting when they purchased a bag of flower, a gallon of milk or a container of cumin. It's unsettling at what some companies were doing to take advantage of the trust of the customer. Although the story does highlight the efforts of some of the larger companies and their efforts to fight these challenges to their profitable yet shady practices, it does show the huge gains of companies who used the newfound food safety knowledge to their benefit. What is stunning is how much this book that really addresses a time from the late 1800's to the early 1900's is eerily relevant today. Not just in the roll of the FDA in protecting the population from harmful food handling practices, but how other government agencies like the Environmental Protection Agency, or Federal Communications Commission, face the same challenges of battling strong companies with congressmen in their corner while looking out for the welfare of the people. And how much money has influence over policy."
117,1594205140,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1423196-jon-david,2,"Compelling narrative and excellent use of historical data. I have marked this a 2 star, however. The author has a clear bias towards Dr. Wiley and against Secretary Wilson - and a disdain for any with a hesitancy to use federal power. In the author's account Wiley can do no wrong. However, Secretary Wilson who tries to balance various interests while still protecting the consumer is often painted as an enemy. Secretary Wilson served under multiple administrations with very different policy preferences. I wish the book painted a more complete picture of the man. Due to the extreme bias, it's hard for me to believe everything else was portrayed with the appropriate context and in a fully honest way. Those who put harmful products in food and other consumable goods should be liable for their actions, of course, but effecting change through federal policy is seemingly getting more difficult. I think readers would be better equipped to deal with similar concerns today if the book provided more information on how impactful on the market all of the private writings, advertisement, and public education campaigns were, but it doesn't address that question fully - but rather, it seems these efforts were put in the context of growing public support for legal reform. We see that private organizations like magazines and competing businesses, like Heinz, found it profitable to call out the bad actors and inform the public about impure food. I think the average reader can make a bigger impact if we worked in community groups and other private organizations. But, this book, while even pointing out the negative externality of regulatory capture, points to the federal bureaucracy being the solution to all food safety issues - even when the rule of law, as enacted by a democratic government, has not caught up to what the regulators would like to implement."

Having listened to my husband's comments, I thought it would be worthwhile to read the book to get a better understanding of the issues. Although I never watched the American Experience, I feel certain I made the right choice.The Poison Squad is the story of an unsung American hero named Dr. Harvey Washington Wiley. He was a chemist who relentlessly pursued the investigation of food adulteration. In a way, it was like revisiting some of the issues with American corporate greed that we have today, except that the consequences were even more dire. Dr. Wiley worked in the late 1800's and early 1900's to analyze food and regulate ingredients that were harmful to the public. He was also the driver of food labeling. The stories are horrific and can be illustrated by the fact that arsenic was added to candy and lead was added to milk; they both killed children. The list goes on, but the bottom line was profits - corporations used cheaper products to lower their costs, but the products they used were largely untested and often poisonous.The ""Poison Squad"" refers to a group of healthy young men who tested food additives and often got sick. They were volunteers who were regularly fed diets that included ingredients that had never been proved poisonous. At every step of the way, Dr. Wiley was hounded by business leaders who resisted his research and tried to persuade politicians to reject his ideas and fire him.The book is well-written by Deborah Blum, who is the director of a journalism program at MIT, and although it dragged a bit with legislative issues toward the end, it was mostly riveting reading. The issues are so fascinating that I recommend watching the American Experience if you don't have time to read the book."
119,1594205140,http://goodreads.com/user/show/96062163-alan-kolok,5,"Excellent book!This is the story of Dr. Harvey Washington Wiley, a chemist that led USDA's Bureau of Chemistry at the beginning of the 20th century. The period, just after the gilded age of the late 1800's, was a time when food, as an industry, was gaining momentum. And with it came fraudulent foods, and the obfuscation of ingredients that comprised and preserved the industrial food supply. Whether it was whiskey that was little more than colored ethanol, coffee cut with chickory, canned peas kept fresh looking with copper sulfate, or meat preserved with formaldehyde, there were no Federal regulations relative to food safety. Into this environment came Dr. Wiley, the first true food safety firebrand of the modern era. Wiley was forced to fight the food safety fight on multiple fronts simultaneously, as he attempted to force industry to divulge the ingredients within their products, while at the same time he needed to battle his peers and superiors within the Federal government that were sympathetic to the needs of the food industry. What I really enjoyed about the book was Wiley's insistence upon food safety being driven by science, and while his employment of the Poison Squad was a bit sensationalistic when viewed through the modern lens, it was both powerful and scientifically sound when it was conducted in the early 1900's. The struggle for food safety has not abated over the last 120 years, and they continue to this day, though the chemical ingredients at the center of the issue have changed. The Poison Squad very eloquently describes the beginning of this struggle for product information and the implementation of quantifiable dose/response relationships into food safety.A very readable and well written book. I thoroughly enjoyed it. "
120,1594205140,http://goodreads.com/user/show/36354385-beth-walker,3,"Goodreads Read Harder Challenge 2019#5 A book by a journalist or about journalism My rating is highly subjective based on my enjoyment, not on the quality of the information. I tend to find most non-fiction rather dry, so don't let my mid-range rating dissuade you from reading this book if the topic interests you. The Poison Squad is an in-depth look into how food safety laws came about in the early 1900s, and how Dr. Harvey Washington Wiley lead the efforts to pass and enforce legislation to make food safer for consumers. It was interesting to learn about how different factions fought for and against the legislation, and how public opinion was turned to ultimately support more regulation. It was also fascinating to see how similar the process is to today, where industry interests continue to fight for less regulation and safety in favor of profit, and how difficult it is to rally the public to support safety causes. The author does her best to use Dr. Wiley as the central figure in order to tell a more cohesive story, but there are parts of the story where he is not so central, so it doesn't quite read like a straight narrative. Plus, in the middle especially, it gets a little slow before the legislation is passed, so there is a lot of back and forth with no progress. This results in plenty of names, dates, and organizations being mentioned, but it can be hard to keep track of. Also, if you are at all squeamish about what used to be put into food, you might not enjoy this book!  It's shocking what manufacturers were putting in food and selling to the public. Not a good lunchtime read, but at least we can feel somewhat confident that it's no longer happening (we hope)."
121,1594205140,http://goodreads.com/user/show/85311985-jamie-fuller,5,"This book was amazing on several levels. First, it was a fantastic summary/introduction/guided tour through the disaster that was America's food supply in the late 1800s and early 1900s. It covers all the ""fascinating"" bits like copper- and arsenic-based food colorings, as well as the more ""mundane"" bits like spoiled food or imitation products passed off as the real thing, and appalling tidbits like the wide-spread use of formaldehyde to ""restore"" or preserve spoiled meat and milk. That alone is worth reading simply for the staring-at-a-car-wreck goggling factor. Second, the authors did a great job of showing all the different parties who played key roles in cleaning up the food supply, willingly or otherwise, and all the ones who stood against such efforts (expected and unexpected). From housewives to government chemists to presidents to military leaders to lobbyists and producers in almost every industry, the lines did not split how one might expect and the history of it is both intriguing and inspiring. Even, dare I say, empowering. Third, the book creates an opportunity for people to explore and educate themselves on food-related issues in a less politically charged climate than we're accustomed to. You know that thing where fiction authors address social injustices or moral questions by setting up situations in fictitious lands or the future, and it makes it easier for people to have open, intelligent discussions about them because they aren't saddled with fears about political correctness or ingrained defensiveness of their political or religious affiliations? This book does that with food, and it's incredible. Everyone should read it, if only for that. "
122,1594205140,http://goodreads.com/user/show/13495334-dawn-tessman,3,"3.5/5 stars. The true story of Harvey Wiley and a group of young men identified as the ""Poison Squad"" who willingly ingested chemical preservatives and unsavory food substitutes found in diets at the turn of the century in order to bring the dangers of such consumption to the attention of the public. While the efforts of this group resulted in the establishment of the ""1906 Pure Food and Drug Act"" and later the U.S. Food & Drug Administration (FDA), it is disturbing to note that the risks these men took ended up being all in vain when loopholes in the legislation permitted the use of deadly substances once again. For me, this book was dry and a bit of a slow starter and, while it does pick up near the end, only slightly. It suffered, too, from a repetitiveness and disorganization and could have done with better editing. Many things I learned in the beginning are rehashed in later chapters multiple times. I also thought the writing lacked the charm of other historical accounts in which personal information about the individual(s) spearheading the movement is included for a humanizing effect. Yet, the history is fascinating and well-worth the time to discover! Perhaps viewing the PBS documentary of the same name would be a more enjoyable way to access that history, though.In short, a shocking, eye-opening story of food industry greed and immorality made even more frustrating by the fact that some of the offenses/abuses against the common man's access to pure/unadulterated food are still happening today.Note:  If you are drawn in by this book's shocking title and/or by the concept of one man's true-to-life quest for the good of all, I recommend The Butchering Art by Lindsey Fitzharris."

This book is the story of Harvey Washington Wiley who as Chief Chemist of the Department of Agriculture, led the way to the first real regulation of the food and drugs we eat. At the turn of the 20th Century, manufacturers, farmers, and conmen, were free to doctor foods and drugs. Upton Sinclair’s The Jungle, fictionalized the filth of the stockyards, but who knew that poisons such as arsenic, cooper sulphate, borax and formaldehyde were routinely used as coloring agents, preservatives and fillers to mask spoilage, mold and rot. Milk that did not contain milk; sugar that did not contain sugar; butter that did not contain butter and whiskey that had no whiskey. There was no requirements that labels list ingredients, servings or weights. Dr. Wiley became a hero to consumers in efforts to reveal what the public was ingesting. He had to fight chemical manufacturers, meat packers, his bosses, various presidents to attempt to stop the public from being poisoned. The names are still familiar, Armour, Monsanto, Coke, on the side of the manufacturers and Heinz and Good House Keeping on the side of the consumer. It is easy to look at the seemingly naïveté of the people of this era. However, with the Trump administration rolling back regulations and inspections of our food supply and clean water and air, we could easily be slipping backwards. "
124,1594205140,http://goodreads.com/user/show/883722-jan,4,"A very fascinating look at the food industry in America- and the crusade to make it safe for consumers. Led by the indomitable Chief Chemist Harvey Wiley, it details how tirelessly he worked during the turn of the 19th and early 20th century to bring about laws and reforms for 'pure food.' Food was regularly 'adulterated'- everything from coffee, whisky, candy, flour, milk, meat, butter, canned goods, spices, syrup, catsup, which lead to sickness and death for countless Americans. Detailed in the book is the fight for better regulations, labeling, and holding the food producers accountable. Companies that are still around today are just emerging in the time frame of the book- Coca Cola, Swift, Armour Meats, Monsanto and Dow (preservatives and dyes.) HJ Heinz was one of the first companies to offer a catsup that wasn't loaded with harmful ingredients. Most notable, however, are the marked similarities to our own time- politics, profit over people, regulation (and deregulation), special interests, public outcry and protests, and push back from industry. Wiley was a bulldog- and his work made a huge difference in the lives and health of Americans. Interesting fact- in his later years after retiring from federal service, he went to work for Good Housekeeping magazine, writing a column about food safety and having veto power over any product advertised in the magazine. If it was worthy it earned the Good Housekeeping Seal of Approval."

Inspirational and detailed, present and future activists must read and learn. I have a few thoughts based on reading the book. Too much is still the same - - big buck lobbyists curry favor with decision-makers to the detriment of the citizen. Food safety is still an issue, and nutrition is a sister to safety. Our leaders have not created a plan to de-incentivize fast food, calorie-dense foods, and non-nutritive food choices; big efforts are needed to combat the obesity of America. The leading cause of death by 2030 worldwide is expected to be nutrition-related disease. While some countries starve, we eat the wrong foods. We need universal health care, but we need wellness programs with smart nutrition favored over the bad habits. We also need action to fix our broken election methods that permit big buck groups to donate to candidates. The candidates, if elected, have inevitably biased relationships that affect policy-making. No more donations. Facebook and Instagram and Twitter are cheap ways to get a candidate’s name and positions known. Let’s figure out a better way without big campaign budgets.Pharmaceutical safety, global environmental health and sustainability and so many more issues need the tenacity and integrity of an army of Harvey Washington Wileys.

She also reminded us of common practices/ social perspectives ""back in the day"" that put the whole story in perspective. 1) For instance, women were not allowed to vote, they had zero way to influence their local surroundings, state and national policy. The women's club movement was a means to shape and influence education, temperance, child labor, juvenile justice, legal reform, environmental protection, library creation ...phew! 2) Also, I was struck that journalists were 98% on Wiley's side --I think now how newspapers are OWNED by corporations trying to screw over their workers and readers. Also, at the time, one went into journalism to mostly to advocate for the people. Journalists back then earned meager paychecks and were considered blue collar workers because they had to operate machinery (telegraphs, typesetters and printers) and there was other manual labor, such as sales and delivery. I guess I think of journalists having degrees in journalism and/ or communications...or they get their job via nepotism. I appreciate how all her research and skills produced such a readable and engaging tale. All the political, federal and corporate layers *should have been* a convoluted drag... instead, she cranked out a page turner."

What is hopeful is that there have always been earnest and moral individuals fighting for the well-being of the people. What is sad is there have always been greedy, corruptible and callous individuals who want to make money even at the expense of people's health.I found that reading about Dr. Wiley at the turn of the century was inspiring. How he developed his ""squad"" to investigate and push back against unhealthy practices in the food industry. Deborah Blum did a great job researching about this time and illuminating what was happening concerning the experiments of food ingredients and the politics. It reminded me of Sinclair's The Jungle, Schlosser's Fast Food Nation and Moss' Salt, Sugar, Fat.The politics was disturbingly similar to modern day's politicians backing business and avoiding common sense regulation at the expense of the public's health. These food manufacturers come across as idiotic or indifferent based on today's standards of food purity standards. Hell, they even thought labeling was unnecessary even after people were literally poisoned. Sad that politicians can't see the same thing happening today - or maybe they do and don't care. How many times does one have to see the same thing repeated to know which is the wrong side of history."
128,1594205140,http://goodreads.com/user/show/350358-laura,4,"Blum does it again (see her earlier Poisoner's Handbook for a different take on the subject of poison) with this book on the push for government regulation of food safety and the impact of Harvey Wiley on the developments that eventually led to pure food laws and more. Wiley is a flawed figure, for sure, but his consistent and stubborn insistence on holding food manufacturers accountable for their practices and labeling must be admired. His decades-long crusade for pure food laws, including testing suspect food additives on young men in controlled environments (who came to be known as ""the Poison Squad""), resulted in frustration and pushback from many within the food industry and government, but he was also instrumental as a leader in getting pure food laws passed and ensuring that consumers had the knowledge to determine how they could buy and keep safe food. Government may not be perfect, but thanks to Harvey Wily and those who followed, food safety is something they got right—at least in principle. Would I recommend it? Yes! I think this is a really interesting background for understanding some of how we got where we are today as far as food, marketing, and government regulation. It also makes me think what a miracle it is that our grandparents and great-grandparents survived if they weren't producing most of their own food. Yikes! "

It's also memorable for the amazing character of Dr. Harvey W. Wiley that is presented in the book. It's interesting how many of the compounds used in foods that are are discussed in the book (caffeine, saccharin, sodium benzoate, corn syrup, nitrate, and other preservatives) have been the subject of later controversies as well. Perhaps the epilogue could have brought up the more current status of these (how is flour now bleached? How are such high levels of caffeine in energy drinks now justified? What about sodium benzoate, which the FDA now recognizes as ""Generally Recognized as Safe""? Why about saccharin, which is still pretty commonly used? As an aside, it's truly amazing how far we've come in regulating clinical trials.I would have liked a longer epilogue. The book makes it seems like the use of any preservative is a negative, but in more recent times, they have prevented many food-borne diseases (botulism, listeriosis); this would have been nice to have been acknowledged.

This year’s and last’s scientific picks really worked my brain and required more time and concentration than I normally dedicate to a book but it was well worth it. The Poison Squad is an in-depth look at the work of early food and drug science and regulation in the United States beginning around the turn of the 20th century.Maverick Dr. Harvey Washington Wiley fought tirelessly to develop a protective system that ensures the safety of consumers and the question now is who will continue that fight in light of current administration that does not care about health, safety, the environment, ethics or morality.Subplots in the book: Wiley’s wife, Anna Keltin, was awesome. She was an early library clerk/librarian at the Library of Congress and suffragette, and Good Housekeeping was rad in a way that I did not appreciate until now.Benefits today due to Wiley’s work:Food labels. Safety testing of new products. Food poisoning outbreaks are monitored and traced. Tainted foods are subject to recalls. Criminal prosecution if food and drug manufacturers cause harm. These same principles are now applied to other protective measures like environmental protections. Thank you, Dr. Wiley and the poison squad!"

I purchased it because I work extensively with hazardous materials. I have read a few snippets about the adulteration of food products and was familiar with the embalmed beef episode during the Spanish American War and the disgusting practices in city based 'milk factories'. I was unaware of the degree to which chemical additives had permeated the food supply. Rather than enhancing the food quality or diets, they were profoundly detrimental to consumers, particularly children in the case of heavy metals in food coloring. The book describes the founding of landmark legislation to protect consumers and undermining of that legislation by big business and their political hacks. The story is told through the life of Dr. Wylie, of the Chemical Bureau of the Department of Agriculture. It was also interesting to find out that Heinz was a leader in pure foods. The only drawback with the book is that I would have liked to see a bit more information on the chronic effects of the chemicals discussed.This will go down as one of the best books that I have read in 2019. I highly recommend the book for anyone interested in the history of food adulteration, government corruption, and the politics of the early 20th Century. I will definitely look forward to more of this writer's work. "

Reading this will make you an ardent advocate for stronger regulation, not relaxing it. Can you imaging a review board (IRB) now allowing Wiley’s testing of adulterants on healthy volunteers?I’ve regularly written about food safety from the infectious disease or outbreak perspective. This is the other side of the coin, with fraudulent and dangerous food additives.Drug development for safety and efficacy was the focus of much of my professional career. Counterfeit medicines also have a huge overlap with Infectious Diseases, as illustrated by the growth of artemisinin-resistant malaria.Blum’s thoroughly documented, engaging—and at times nauseating—read, is a must-read for anyone who is concerned about health and safety-- in particular, of children. It is graphic, of necessity.The Poison Squad is a call to arms for more safety and protection for whistle-blowers, not a laissez-faire government.Well-deserved acclamation and placement on “Best Science Books” lists."

This book is important in revealing how horrific unregulated capitalism can be. No food industry was exempt from protecting profits at the risk of endangering human life. Children were dying, people were poisoned--with no consumer protection from the government or recourse through the courts. Enter Dr. Wiley, pioneer of pure foods, a tireless advocate of food safety. His story, and the story of the horrors of the Chicago stockyards, formaldehyde-preserved milk, and arsenic-colored candy is eye-opening in terms of the lengths the industry would go to for profit at the expense of safety. The second half of the book however becomes slow and bogged down in details of political infighting and litigations. I struggled through the last 50 pages. A more detailed investigation into one of the more egregious poisoning events may have been more engaging. ""The Poisoner's Handbook"" is better structured as such and remains my favorite of this author's work. "

It explains the science behind the adulterants in question as well as weaving a compelling narrative that steers for a balanced portrayal of people's reasons, so much as they could be known. It so clearly drives home the point that many businesses are truly looking for profit, even at the cost of the well being of people. The examples provided are at times both horrifying and humorous (brains in milk), but the point is also made (even by people at the time) that those who pay the cost for this profit the most are the poor. It often took major tragedies to create the outrage/political will to handle any issue, and the ground had to be fought time and again in case after case. This book is relevant both as history and to our world today. When you think about government and what it does or asked about what point it serves, this is an example to remember. "

These statements, horrible as they may seem, are the true story of the US food world in the late 1800s/early 1900s. It was due to the unwavering efforts of one Harvey Washington Wiley (and his many supports) that these unsafe, unsanitary and (quite frankly) disgusting tactics were put to a stop with the passing of the National Pure Food and Drug law. But his enemies in the US government and business world did not make it an easy journey for him. This is one of those books that is both fascinating and horrifying, and it gave me a deeper appreciation for the current food safety laws we do have. Well researched, great audio narrator. Overall I’d say worth reading. "

I was wrong, it was a great read. Recounting the history of food adulteration and the battle to consumer protection during the late 19th and early 20th century sounds like bland stuff, but Ms. Blum produces a well researched and written story of Dr. Harvey Wiley’s crusade during his time that is just as relevant today as it was at the turn of the twentieth century. One can’t escape the parallels of the huge power wielded by rich men and corporations who made their fortunes and built their businesses at the expense of the public, and how politicians protected the monied interests as opposed to their actual constituents. Frankly, these echoes of the past sadly reminded me of our current state of affairs. It reminded me how often history repeats itself, and that when we bemoan the present and romanticize the past, we are losing sight that the more things change, the more they actually stay the same. A sad truth brought out in a very good book."

At first I was worried this book would just be story after story of gross things being added to food and making people sick, but once it gets going it's more of a biography of Dr. Harvey Wiley who I'm ashamed to admit I had never heard of prior to this book.That said Blum doesn't tether herself to Wiley alone, and she's happy to wander off for extended periods discussing other characters, court cases or historical events I think the book is richer for it. In her depiction of Wiley, she tries to present him as a complex and flawed individual, which I appreciate, but he still felt pretty flat to me as a character.Also the afterward where Blum uses the events of the book to take some swipes at the Trump administration felt a little half-assed to me."
138,1594205140,http://goodreads.com/user/show/51042996-jeff-wong,5,"I learned a ton from reading this book. The author chronicles the efforts of Harvey Washington Wiley, a chemist, who became the greatest advocate for food safe in his time (during the turn of the 20th century) during the presidencies of McKinley, Roosevelt, Taft and Wilson. The novel, ""The Jungle"" by Upton Sinclair also comes out during this time and aided Dr. Wiley's cause to some degree. His work lead ultimately to the creation of the Food and Drug Administration as well as the ""Good Housekeeping Seal of Approval"". It's also another historical rendering that lets us know that the government is only ""for the people"" IF the people continue to hold the government accountable. Corruption and undue business interests affecting government regulation is no different now than it was back then (and probably will be in the foreseeable future). It will make you re-think how you view the food that we eat and how things have greatly changed. "

It was well written and there was lots of stuff about the struggles to have safe food that I was completely unaware of. I think we are meant to be encouraged by Harvey Wiley's commitment to battle big business and our elected officials who favor big business over the common man. I came away discouraged however, given the current political climate which leans toward fewer protections and less regulation. In her epilogue, Blum writes, ""This sense of deja vu, echoing down the years, should remind us of the ways that food safety practices have dramatically changed in this country -- and of the ways they have changed hardly at all."" Monsanto was very influential at the turn of the century and they still are ...... It saddens me.

Formaldehyde in the milk, arsenic in the candy, copper sulfate in the canned peas, and saccharin in virtually everything - all these facts are laid out and induce an instant recoil of revulsion. The attempts by the purveyors of these assaults on an unwitting public to deny the facts, cover-up their worst excesses, and deny the truth by any means available, provoke righteous outrage.Considering the current all-out attack on any and all regulation being conducted by our current administration, the message of this book couldn't be more timely."

CocoCola did have cocaine and huge amounts of caffeine and was involved in a lengthy trial in 1909, claiming their formula was secret and could not be revealed. Bottles sold as vanilla extract were brown-tinted water. Milk had whitening agents. Sickening examples one after another after another.One man in particular named Wiley led the crusade for clean food for many years against the slaughterhouses, filthy factories and purveyors of death-dealing items.

So I didn't necessarily find the details of just how unsafe our food used to be shocking, per se. But the topic is both very interesting and, as Blum wisely points out, still relevant. Even today there are attempts to relax food safety standards in ways that have consumer ramifications. It's important to be aware of why we have the standards that we have so that, as Blum urges us, we can continue to hold food and drug manufacturers accountable for our food, drink, and medication. Blum does an excellent job crafting a historical account that is relevant in our current era as well. Occasionally the writing is a little diffuse, and I found myself confused in some of the chapter where we were continuously introduced to new people, but I still learned a lot about the history of the FDA!"

Around the turn of the century There were no regulations for food safety. Poisons were included in food to improve the color or act as a preservative. Foreign substances were used as cheap substitutes for spices such as walnut shells ground up and sold a pepper. This book chronicles the actions of a small group, working for the government, that were attempting to regulate food, drink and medicine. A prime example of government working for the betterment of society. Unfortunately, just as many politicians, in the pocket of special interest groups, fought against this group of scientists. Sadly, this continues to this day. Healthy food, clean water and clean air should not be political issues. We all drink the same water and breathe the same air, conservative or liberal.

It's a fascinating look at the how and why the Food and Drug Administration was formed. My main take-away from the book is overwhelming gratitude for Dr. Harvey Wiley, a chemist in the Agriculture Department who unceasingly advocated for safe food and drug legislation. It was easy to compare the government's struggle to balance science, consumer advocacy and business interests back then to the current day issues.It's an interesting piece of history, but the book focuses mainly on Wiley's life and advocacy and there is a lot of detail. At the end, the book touches briefly on some more recent food scares and policy issues. For me, I would have preferred a longer section on some of those items. However, I suppose those are left for another book - or as I imagine, quite a few student papers written on those topics."

I read ""The Jungle"" years ago and knew some of the history of good safety in the U.S., but Blum's superbly written, thoroughly researched book is a real eye-opener, not just in the evolution of food safety regulations, but in how history under the current administration is doomed to repeat itself. As I read, I was dismayed by how current policies parallel those of the past when science was ignored in favor of industry interests and profits over consumer protection.

It's a very thorough and alarming account of the food industry at the beginning of the 20th century working really hard to keep costs by adulterating food to the point of literally poisoning consumers. Dr Wiley's crusade to enact legislation that would force companies to be accountable for their actions is admirable and his tenacity is incredibly impressive. That said, for a book about such horrifying subject matter (the stuff found in milk was just repulsive), I didn't find myself particularly gripped by the story. Perhaps because it's so focused on legislation, the pacing can get a bit slow, and I found myself losing focus more than once. However, if you're willing to put in the time, it's definitely interesting to get a better understanding of the roots of our modern standards of food safety. "

The definition of what’s “injurious” to health is still vague and constantly contested. It’s disheartening to read that the burden of proof has always been with the government, rather than the companies that manufacture compounds for human consumption or use.Although food regulation has a happier ending with the establishment of the FDA, I can see many parallels between this and the fight for human impact studies being carried out by the EPA now. Thankfully, the food industry has adapted to and overcome stringent regulations- something tells me manufacturers can do the same if PFAS, TCE, alkylphenol, etc. standards are passed."

You mean we really have to put the food or drink we're selling into the food/drink we're selling? Do you know what that'd cost?Really, Harvey Wiley should be a lot more famous than he is.

I can't imagine how many letters, newspaper and magazine articles, and documents Blum must have sifted through, because it seems like every paragraph in the book has at least one quote from a contemporary source. This not only gives the work in the book weight, but it also suggests the personalities of the various characters, particularly Harvey Wiley, and shines a light on all the political intrigue happened at the Bureau of Chemistry. All that research can, however, at times slow down the momentum of the book.

If I had paid better attention to the subtitle, I might have realized that Dr. Harvey Wiley himself is the central subject of the book. And thank the stars for him and his crusading. He dedicated his career to protecting consumers from food and beverage manufacturers who sought to keep secret the fact that they were using unhygienic practices and dangerous chemicals in their products.But the book still wasn't quite what I expected and I can't see myself recommending it in general -- it will likely only appeal to American history/government/public health nerds.

It’s scary to think there were no labels on food or ingredients listed. All that we take for granted. Until the first pure food and drug law in 1906, lots of food was not what you think it was. This is an important book to read during these times where the science is not in question about safety (not just food and drugs, but waste, climate change) but this administration seems to think so.

The creation of the FDA was a long and torturous road of failed legislation—Wiley didn't live to see the creation of the agency in its present form—and Blum meticulously lays it all out to get to an underlying point, which seems to be that government representatives have always been in bed with corporate interests.

The focus in the book is on Harvey Washington Wiley, a noted American chemist best known for his leadership in the passage of the landmark Pure Food and Drug Act of 1906, but it also chronicles other “good guys” and bad guys.

The subject of the book, Harvey Wiley, was totally unknown to me before reading, and Blum did a fantastic job of illustrating both the person and his outsized impact on our society.

It's interesting to see what influence he garnered at the national level. He backed strong legislation to protect food systems. I wonder what a more grass roots effort would do to change food systems such as widespread disinterest in food additives or preservatives that have unscrupulous pasts.

I am not referring to the spoiled milk and decaying meat “refreshed” by formaldehyde, or the candy dyed with lead and copper, or ... (don’t want to give away too much.) It’s disgusting how so many people and so many organizations were able to successfully push back and fight regulations intended to make food safe. For decades. Wow. I see many parallels with today’s fight against Covid-19, and as the author noted, the fight for environmental regulation. It just breaks my heart. I gave the book 4 (not 5) stars because I was hoping for more of a science and gross-factor type read. I should have known this was a political read. I learned a lot and am grateful for the knowledge. I wish the whole country (planet?) would read this story on the fight for/against human health."

I had to remind them that I was reading about events from 100 years ago. The fight for pure food and medicine is a more drawn out fight than I learned in high school. I learned that after publication of The Jungle that the FDA was created. New, weak laws were enacted, but it took years of fighting to get our food, drink and medicine pure, read safe. I recommend this book strongly. We all need to know about Harvey Washington Wiley and the young civil servants who volunteered for the poison squads.I won a copy of this book through Goodreads."

It is not just story of food safety, it is a story of a movement to have safe food. It involve people in the government, among activist and corporations. The battle for food safety is a long one, corporations fight against it. But the people wants it, government in the middle. Occasionally on the side of corporation, but with some inside for the people. There is a hero in the story. In a way, it is not too different from struggle to a cause now. This book is a good reminder that many causes take a long time to do, and need to involve many people. Not just corporations, not just government, also the people. Highly recommended"

This book is rich with details that will keep readers engaged in the story. Wiley was a character, and his big personality and tireless efforts to protect the American public from harmful food and drink practices is one of the many strengths of this book. Deborah Blum is clearly an excellent researcher, and this book was so fascinating. It is amazing how political scandals over 100 years ago mirror current scandals we have today. Highly recommended to fans of history, chemistry, or politics. "

While at times a catalog of details, this book is a page-turner. While a serious academic historical account, it is laced with the personal side, subtle humor, and critically related threads (such as the women's suffrage movement). It remains remarkably nonjudgmental or partisan. I learned a great deal and reflect on my past lack of knowledge in this area despite being a physician who works to improve community health on a scale larger than with individual patients. "

The beginnings of his campaign coincided with Sinclair Lewis's scathing depiction of the Chicago meat packing industry. Deborah Blum compellingly tells the story of Wiley's lifetime long crusade to improve the quality of American food, drink, and drugs and to rein in corporate America's never ending attempts to add unhealthy ingredients. She traces the history of the 1906 Safe Food Act and the interesting cast of characters on either side of the battle."

The book begins with a list of people mentioned in the book and for some reason, the audiobook did the same thing. (I would have recommended ending with that or skipping it, it's impossible to follow aurally.) The book starts after the list.I was never so appreciative of labels and the Food and Drug Administration than after reading this. Wow. For all the weird stuff that gets in our food now, it's nothing compared to the turn of the 20th century and what went on then. It was interesting to see the Pure Food group and how it echos the Organics and local foods movement today. "
170,1594205140,http://goodreads.com/user/show/51505304-sherrie,5,"Deborah Blum has such a gift for taking complex, potentially dry and boring subjects and turning them into clearly told drama. Normally science talk puts me to sleep, but she does a fantastic job of breaking it down into easy-to-understand language and helping the reader see what's at stake. I thoroughly enjoyed this book, and it made me grateful anew for all the food safety laws and regulations. The epilogue was a sobering reminder that we can't sit on our laurels and complacently assume these problems are now behind us, but that food safety remains an urgent concern, and that the Trump administration is even now working to weaken regulation. "
171,1594205140,http://goodreads.com/user/show/56602370-girlymcgirlface,4,"I loved the book. Some parts were a tiny bit confusing, particularly the character intro in the front, I wish it had been in the back because it felt like I was bombarded with names that meant nothing to me yet. Also, numbering the character bios and super-scripting which name goes with which bio would have been very helpful for the first few chapters. Overall, once I got past that and had the cast of players set in my mind it was a very good read. Incredibly informative, I'm going to give it to my very conservative father for his birthday to see if having Republicans as the heroes of the story will get him on board with the idea of government regulation for the good of the citizenry.

172,1594205140,http://goodreads.com/user/show/815844-rosa,3,"The first part of the book is so powerful, the second half made me loathe that US food and FDA policy is made my Congress and at the whim of political gain. This book should have sections that are required reading for food/agricultural policy students. Absolutely essential reading if you want to understand why people are addicted to conspiracy theories about food and pharmacological practices in the USA. Folks, science literacy matters, but so does our ability to move science policy forward—this book does a great job showing us just how bad we are at both. It’s a miracle we’ve survived as a species.

Focusing on the USDA's regulation of food and drugs from the late 19th to early 20th century, the story has eerie similarity to much of today's political climate as industry backed legislators battle (often winning) against those who put the consumer and American people first. Any dry overly political portions of the book are balanced by hair raising descriptions of ingredients and manufacturing conditions that would be beyond unthinkable today"

There are forces at work now doing their damnedest to undermine food safety on multiple fronts. Our FDA and USDA have been taken over by corporate forces that are bent on complete deregulation. Even now, USDA inspectors are being fired and the meat industry, slaughter houses included, are being allowed to ""inspect themselves"". Poisons are being sprayed on monocrops and vegetation near water sources in insanely unsafe amounts.This is a history of those who actually fought, and won, for safe food, beverages, drugs and practices that promote the General Welfare.

After almost 4 mths, they are still unable/unwilling to provide a timetable for when I can expect an answer.At this point, I believe that I have given them enough time, so for the benefit of other potential, current or past readers of this book, here are the main discrepancies between Poison Squad (PS)’s Version of the Facts (‘PSVF’) and the facts as described in Oscar Anderson’s ’The health of a nation’, published by University of Chicago Press in 1958, page 246 (‘HON') - The source of the relevant PSVF’s passage according to the book’s notes. To be clear, it is possible that these statements were taken from (an)other source(s), but I cannot obtain these from Deborah Blum (DB).At the end of PS Chapter 13 entitled ’The Love Microbe (1910-1911)', PSVF claims that:1- On July 11th, 1911 President Taft asked Wilson to inform Wiley et al. of the charges against them (HON claims this occurred on July 7th, 1911 - HON’s version of the facts ties with the New York Times database of past articles, while PSVF’s does not, see below)At the beginning of PS Chapter 14 entitled ’The Adulteration Snake (1911-1912)', PSVF claims that:2- Wilson asked McCabe to deliver the news to Wiley et al. - (Nothing of the sort in HON)3- Wilson asked McCabe because he did not want to deal with the problem himself - (Nothing of the sort in HON, obviously since point 2 is not even mentioned)4- McCabe waits until Friday July 15th, 1911 to deliver the message to Wiley et al. - (Nothing of the sort in HON, based on the very tight timeline between President Taft’s decision - July 7th, 1911 according to HON - and the leak in the New York Times later on - July 12th, 1911 - it seems unlikely that there was much delay in the charges being presented to Wiley et al. especially when one considers that this sequence of events occurred with the technological resources of 1911)5- McCabe waits until this date because he knew that Wiley was not present and that he therefore would not need to personally confront Wiley on that day - (Nothing of the sort in HON, obviously since point 2 is not even mentioned)6- McCabe asked Bigelow or Kebler to deliver the news to Wiley - (Nothing of the sort in HON, obviously since point 2 is not even mentioned)7- McCabe asked Bigelow or Kebler to do so because he didn’t want to do it himself - (Nothing of the sort in HON, obviously since point 2 is not even mentioned)8- Wiley was not at his office on the Friday, when McCabe informed the others of the charges - (HON describes that Wiley et al. are all informed of the charges on the same day, Saturday)9- Kebler found out about the charges prior to Wiley - (Nothing of the sort in HON, Kebler is not even mentioned in HON’s account)10- Bigelow felt a certain way prior to and after conveying the news to Wiley - (Nothing of the sort in HON)11- Wiley and Bigelow had a walk on or around the former’s farm, where Wiley would have explained why the news Bigelow brought made him happy - (Nothing of the sort in HON)12- The New York Times article that initially broke the story of the charges against Wiley et al. was published on July 20th, 1911 - (HON does not provide a specific date in the text, but in the notes, only the July 13th and July 17th, 1911 New York Time editions are referenced - I have independently found The New York Times article in question, but it is dated July 12th, 1911 - conceivably printed in the July 13th, 1911 edition - in any event at least a full week earlier than the PSVF)--- Update Feb/24/2020 (1 star... more like zero star)I reached out to Penguin, the book's publisher, this morning requesting clarification, since the author cannot or will not provide an answer. Having reviewed Oscar Anderson's 'The Health of a Nation' (HON) - page 246, the passage's supposed source, there are significant discrepancies even with the dates, therefore in the absence of a specific source (which the author refuses to provide), it seems essentially clear that end of Chapter 13 / beginning of Chapter 14 have been materially changed versus the HON version. Which version actually happened? --- Update Feb/17/2020 (1 star)Still no news from the author, I think at this point the implications are pretty clear. At least one key passage is uber-dubious to me.--- Update Feb/12/2020 (2 stars)While it was an entertaining read, I have strong suspicions that - at least some of the - data presented is of dubious quality. I am in touch with the author, but so far I have not been able to get satisfactory answers to my basic questions... I would be highly careful in using/quoting anything from this book.--- Original Review (3 stars)Entertaining and Instructive...What I disliked:- In the edition I read, there were some issues with the dates listed, the few that I did check with the New York Times database don't match sometimes by just a day or two, but sometimes by a pretty significant amount. It is surely innocent, however it raises concerns as to the reliability of the historical facts presented, and I would encourage anyone needing to use this material as source for further study to verify the underlying events' dates.- It's rather subjective, but I personally felt that the love shown towards Heinz and its laudable commitment to quality, is a bit overdone and I would not be surprised if some readers feel that there's a bit of 'product placement / infomercial' advertising happening here (though Kraft-Heinz surely needs all the help it can get these days, sadly)."
176,1594205140,http://goodreads.com/user/show/63043654-allison,4,"A story about the fight to put some standards in place regulating food and labeling, basically balancing public health needs and commercial interests. Seems like the story followed the career of one chemist at the USDA in the early 20th century and then mostly stopped after he retired. I guess the moral here is that when given the opportunity, businesses will always choose to protect their economic interests over nutrition and food safety for consumers. Seems that nothing has changed there. (I learned that Monsanto has always been an evil company.)Great narrator; she also did White Trash by Nancy Isenberg, Brooklyn by Colm Toibin, and Dark Money by Jane Mayer."
177,1594205140,http://goodreads.com/user/show/76700421-lizabeth-j-johnson,4,"Blum did a great job of describing the challenges that Harvey Wiley faced as head of the Chemistry Division of the USDA from the late 1800s to the early 1900s. What I found most interesting was that there was so much public support for Wiley's crusade against toxic additives in food, while it was largely corporations (including an early incarnation of Monsanto) that were aligned against him and other food purity activists. And, of course, corporations often had allies in Congress and other governmental agencies, including the USDA. It's a timely and optimism-inducing read since we're once again facing determined corporate efforts to remove regulations intended to protect consumers."
178,1594205140,http://goodreads.com/user/show/51418600-scott,3,"This is an interesting book. It reinforces how hard it can be to get government to not be captured by industry, and makes me appreciate regulations that I've taken for granted, such as accurately labeled food and drink, food that doesn't kill me, etc. And the same fights we've had in government today were happening then, in exactly the same way: government agencies whose roles are intended to protect consumers are thwarted to actually menace consumers and protect industry. People like Wiley are so precious, and are so uncommon! Blum does a good job presenting the character of the times, she tells an engrossing story. I definitely would read other books she has written."
179,1594205140,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1397999-tj,4,"This book serves a couple of uses. First, it's an effective diet book. You'll be looking at all your food suspiciously. And it's also a damning indictment of removing federal regulations. I was a little disappointed that the science was less featured than it was in The Poisoner's Handbook: Murder and the Birth of Forensic Medicine in Jazz Age New York but the history lesson is timely and relevant. "
180,1594205140,http://goodreads.com/user/show/32238318-patricia,3,It very interesting. It's hard to believe what was passed off to consumers as food in the late 1800 and 1900. The labeling of food we are accustomed to now was a hard fight. Food manufactures fought labeling and adulterations of food and drugs again and again. Sometimes people died from additives. The manufactures did not care. Now we can feel fairly safe that sugar actuarily is sugar when listed on a food label. Same for many other products. One dear to my heart is maple syrup. Now you can read a product label and know you are getting corn syrup disguised as male syrup. 
181,1594205140,http://goodreads.com/user/show/57288-nick-ertz,3,"This is a good lesson on politics that is germane even today. Here is the birth of the FDA. Without two things, it wouldn't have happened. The chief chemist (Dr Wiley) was the great advocate supported by a vast majority of consumers - who were vocal. The villains were big food business in cahoots with the lawmakers and the bureaucracy. You can be glad today that you don't have formaldehyde in your milk and many other things. Lessons here need to be applied to the gun laws and environmental protection. Read and learn."
182,1594205140,http://goodreads.com/user/show/14070102-nicole,3,"So here's the thing: I read The Poisoner's Handbook, which she wrote a few years ago. I thought it was extremely well written, informative, engaging, etc. This book?I was confused....there was a lot said on Wiley's stand against sodium benzoate but not so much on how it turned out. It's still in our drinks today, so I'm assuming that means it's safe? Was Wiley indeed a single-minded crusader? This wasn't the only loose thread. It was very interesting but not nearly as good as it could have been."
183,1594205140,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6405571-barry-bridges,5,"The March selection for me from Just the Right Book is literally just the right book for me. A mix of science, history, and crusader changing the world for the noble cause of improving the quality of life. Staggering knowledge of what business was doing to consumers, what politicians were doing to protect business, and how much continues to my lifetime. In spite of so much change, so much technology, little has changed. The only lesson we learn from history? Well, you know the answer. Those wanting to return to the nostalgia, romanticize past certainly need to think again on that desire."
184,1594205140,http://goodreads.com/user/show/12000072-steve,5,"Great science writing about unsung heroes of food safetyI loved this book. It has everything I expect in good science writing: science that is clear and well-explained, historical background, politics, and biographical information about the protagonists. Indeed this book is mostly about politics and the steps taken to help improve food safety in the US. The main protagonist, Harvey Wiley, is an unsung hero, but hopefully Deborah Blum’s book will make people more aware of him. I strongly recommend this book for anyone interested in science."
185,1594205140,http://goodreads.com/user/show/44772264-matt,4,"Poison Squad is a biography of Dr. Wiley's life with a focus on his (and contemporary) food safety efforts. It is an interesting book with a well researched narrative that should remind us how bad things can get without regulations. However, I wish it had a little more philosophical discussion on what are good ways to regulate, and what can go wrong with regulation, rather than being a pure ""this is what happened"" narrative - I would have appreciated a little more critical analysis of the history rather than just statement of facts."
186,1594205140,http://goodreads.com/user/show/535124-maryann,4,"Interesting biography of Wiley, with great detail regarding the food safety issues of the time. (Often thought she might be writing about TODAY, rather than the 1800-1900s.) Was impressed with how Blum took the reader through the food industry, government, media, and consumer perspectives. Wiley turns them all on their ears and shook America into government and industry FOR the people rather than for their own interests. Interesting read, often redundant, but certainly informative and fascinating. Good read!"
187,1594205140,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2130032-daniel-r,4,The high level of food safety we have today hasn't always been the case. This book traces the origin of the pure food movement and the role Dr. Harvey Wiley played in helping get such legislation enacted. The resistance by so many groups is staggering given the negative consequences of ingesting tainted food. More importantly the sacrifice that so many young men went through to verify the toxicity of additives is astounding. Seeing the struggle between public interest and business hasn't changed much in the last century is the hardest thing to stomach.
188,1594205140,http://goodreads.com/user/show/24042542-pgreisen,3,The book is very interesting and fascinating and without knowning anything about the start of FDA this gives a very good description of the issues the american food industry battled back then. Wiley is clearly an interesting character and very idealistic - impressive that he doesn't just quit but keeps fighting for what he believes. The historical facts are well founded and how it draws up parallels to today is very interesting indeed. It probably deserves 3.5 from me - it is not my main interesting but it did keep me fascinating from start to end. Worth a read. 
189,1594205140,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6412584-kelly,5,"This is probably a little dry if you’re not excited about the subject matter, as there are a lot of names and dates and details. There’s no challenging science. The story of Dr. Harvey Wiley as a public servant crusader for a safer food system was fantastic. You get a sense of him from details shared and it helps bring the subject to life. The Poison Squad itself is only a portion of the book, it is really the story of Dr Wiley’s career. I would appreciate a ‘sequel’ that talks about the current state of food regulations and ingredients and manufacturing. "
190,1594205140,http://goodreads.com/user/show/644427-tracy,4,"Blum is not my favorite author - she tells a story in a straight-forward manner with few of the literary flourishes I tend to enjoy, even in non-fiction works. That said, the topic of this book was quite interesting (and horrifying), and was a quick read once you got through Wiley's early life and into the Poison Squad years. It's truly a stomach-churning work, however, and also depressing as you realize that we are just repeating history in many ways, and how evil corporate profiteers and the legislators who support them are exactly the same 100 years later."

Seriously, another book that made me sick to my stomach. It is amazing that only through the hard work and seriously strong will and perseverance of a few people that we now have ""safer"" food on the shelves. I say ""safer"" because not not sure that flaming hot Cheetos could even qualify as food, no less safe. A classic example of what happens when big business/profits and the government/lobbyist's are in bed together. Yikes!!!"

And the reader feels pretty good about that progress. Right up to the epilogue, where Blum reminds us that in 3 short years Trump and his cohorts are plunging us back to a time where government legislation served the interests of businesses that can afford to buy off the legislators, rather than the American people.

193,1594205140,http://goodreads.com/user/show/23632502-cathy,2,"I would consider this more of a biography than a history or a presentation of ""social problems,"" which is how our library catalogs it. The book itself was a compelling read and a quick read for nonfiction. I agree with the other reviewers who wanted more information about the men in the Poison Squad, the effect of additives on their bodies, their recovery, and whether or not those additives are still in use today.I would have given this 3 stars except the plethora of reviews questioning the veracity and authenticity of the author's sources has given me pause."

This book also details politics and consumers versus industry that can be filed under ""the more things change, the more things stay the same."""
205,1594205140,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4606766-scott-johnson,4,"This was just a solid micro-history. The epilogue commenting on the Trump administration's assault on these hard-won consumer protections was a bit out of place, with a clearly different tone, but very relevant.Just throw this book at every libertarian you know who squawks about the glory of the free market and how government regulation does nothing but impede business. Wiley is rolling in his grave right now with our constant attempts to roll back a century of progress."
206,1594205140,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4700589-crystal,5,"Borrowed this book months ago and begun reading it, the amount of times I've gasped, widened my eyes and cussed at what companies placed in their products. I've just started a subject called 'Healthy Public Policy' my appreciation and admiration for figures in history such as Wiley himself have only grown since. One thing for sure, never take the food and health safety regulations for granted. Amazing read, definitely recommend. "
207,1594205140,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7787964-kent-archie,4,"Reading this really makes you appreciate the FDA. Back before the 30's, there were essentially no rules concerning food production. If the milk was a little old, just put in some formaldehyde.Want greener peas, copper sulfate is the answer. And why not put lead based dyes in candy.When politicians talk about removing regulations to encourage innovations, this is the world they want to go back to.Harvey Wiley is a true hero."
208,1594205140,http://goodreads.com/user/show/83792166-lisi-waukau,4,"This was a dense book - good, interesting and engaging - but dense. We read it as part of a workplace book club and I enjoyed it, but had a hard time finishing due to the amount of brainpower I needed to read. Definitely worth picking up and reading if you're interested in where your food comes from, how we label and talk about food and what ""good"" food is, but give yourself a few hours at a time to really get into it. "
209,1594205140,http://goodreads.com/user/show/67810670-laurie-sand,5,"Gripping.How a story about a chemist that spans the years between 1880 and 1930 can be described as gripping, I don't know, but there it is. Blum flawlessly brings together science, history, and politics to tell the story of how this country struggled for decades to regulate its own food supply, and the story of the flawed man who never stopped crusading for ""pure food"". The book is particularly timely as we enter a new era of mania for industry deregulation. A must-read!"
210,1594205140,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5803547-anne,4,The history of food safety in the U.S. is shocking! The author tells the story of Harvey Wiley and his efforts to protect the consumer. He went to battle with many lawmakers and the industry leaders that were pressuring them. Unfortunately it always took poisonings and deaths to finally get the attention of Congress. The book is very thorough in recounting history and therefore is heavy with the names of all involved. 
211,1594205140,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5733449-joanne,5,"Non fiction book. Very interesting. Especially when you hear people say they wish we could go back to the old days before our food was processed. The main focus of this book is without some oversight all of these food/beverage companies only cared about the bottom line. The food was laced with so many bad things. The ones that suffered the most were the young, poor and old. Oversight of our food is crucial. And labels need to be read."
212,1594205140,http://goodreads.com/user/show/80076479-chelsea-sue,4,"Engrossing read, definitely inspired me to get more involved in advocacy. And so prescient for today’s time! Highly highly recommend! The only reason I docked a star was for the lack of reminders of who the characters are (so many new people are introduced, it was sometimes hard to remember who was who. Blum referred to characters by the their last name after only mentioning first names just once— it would’ve been super helpful to include first names again appropriately in subsequent mentions)."
213,1594205140,http://goodreads.com/user/show/100739394-mike-burke,4,Enjoyed the book and the story of Harvey Wiley's life and determination to make food food safe. Interesting that we now have a clean label emphasis today. I haven't read anything else about about the and struggles to enact laws to regulate food and additives. Written with the viewpoint of Wiley struggles.Was disappointed that Deborah Blum decided to show a political bias with her epilogue. Recommend it.
214,1594205140,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7439517-monica,5,"I found this a fascinating book on not just the history of the FDA, but of US history as a whole. I'm not normally a big one for modern history but this was well written and informative. I think it's well worth reading because, as the author points out near the end, the current administration is doing everything it can to undo all the good that was started by Harvey Washington Wiley to protect the citizens of the US from harmful chemicals and additives. "
215,1594205140,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4192465-marilyn,4,"Interesting history of Dr. Wiley, head chemist for the Department of Agriculture and his crusade to get a Pure Food and Drug Act passed in the early 1900's. The legislation was eventually passed in 1906, but because of government interference and backing of corporations, never lived up to Dr. Wiley's ideals. Nonetheless, he was successful in getting formaldehyde out of our food supply. Also interesting that Dr. Wiley fought to get saccharine banned but wasn't successful."
216,1594205140,http://goodreads.com/user/show/75326742-janet-goodwin,5,This was a hard read for me as the political environment was not much different then today. Dr. Wiley was a dedicated Scientist in bringing about food safety in America. My stomach could not take reading this book all the way through with out taking a break occasionally. I finally got through because I want to give it to my oldest grandson for his birthday. It is an important book. I do wonder what Dr. Wiley would think of our diet in America today.
217,1594205140,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3380906-cindy,4,"I'm giving it a 4 because of what I learned from it. But it wasn't an easy read due to the topic matter of how dangerous - even lethal, the food was during the late 1880's and the early 1900's. No ""watch dogs"" - no regulations. This was especially true for the lower economic levels. It covers the whole meat packing scandal written about by Upton Sinclair. This could have benefited from tighter editing."

219,1594205140,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3559859-jeremy-hornik,4,"A well-told story of that unsexy topic, reform, and how hard and persistently Dr. Wiley had to fight for it. Lots of gross stuff to keep me reading through the long bureaucratic infighting.

220,1594205140,http://goodreads.com/user/show/22087121-kristen,3,"I thought I’d read this book non stop and not be able to put it down. It was well researched, well written and interesting but man was it tedious and long. I had weeks where I didn’t pick it up. However, this is an interesting look into our food history and the Wiley’s fight for regulations and protection of all Americans. "
221,1594205140,http://goodreads.com/user/show/17770938-kayla-tornello,4,"This was a fascinating look at how a scientist, Harvey Washington Wiley, fought food manufacturers to insure safe and properly labeled foods. He ran experiments to prove that certain food additives were dangerous. It's hard to believe the disgusting things that were hidden in food. It makes me grateful for food regulations and ingredients listed properly on labels."
222,1594205140,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2799823-sferg,5,A lengthy & involved read but well worth it. I’m constantly being reminded that ignorance is such bliss & this book is no exception.

223,1594205140,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3206798-j-j,4,"Things I didn't know before reading: formaldehyde used to be a preservative for milk, saccharine was Theodore Roosevelt's go to sweetener, and how rotten eggs were often used in baked cakes. I had already read Upton Sinclair's _the Jungle_ and knew the role it played, but this book added a different perspective on food safety and labeling. Interesting read."
224,1594205140,http://goodreads.com/user/show/32599678-anne,3,"Not as gripping a tale as I had hoped but I am still glad I read it. The first chapters about food contamination were pretty disgusting. It’s a wonder anyone survived! There was less about the actual Poison Squad than you would think from the book title, and more about the man who created it (Wiley). I am certainly more thankful now for his work than I had any idea I needed to be. "
225,1594205140,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2655525-laura-guill,4,"Maybe not the best book to read during my lunch hour, but still enlightening. Especially about why alcohol labeling laws differ from other food/drink/drug laws -- spoiler alert, it's just politics. I do wish the book had included a modern analysis of what each preservative actually does to the human body, rather then solely relying on the observations of the Poison Squad."
226,1594205140,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10023481-peter,4,"A solid and informative read. Passing and enforcing laws against the interests of capital has always been an uphill slog in America, as this book so clearly demonstrates, and the only path to success lies in not giving up. It took more than twenty (20!) years to pass legislation requiring U.S. food manufacturers to not put harmful or poisonous substances in food, and a further thirty (30!) years of fighting those same manufacturers about what qualifies as harmful and poisonous. In the meantime, documented hundreds (and surely many more) of American citizens were sickened and killed by various chemicals used by companies to make their food look more cheerful and appear fresher. This is the story of that struggle, using the career of one key chemist as the central story, and featuring many other activists, in careful and entertaining detail. Of course, in making these changes, the U.S. lagged behind Europe. La plus ca change! Or, as they say in the swamplands, MAGA! "
227,1594205140,http://goodreads.com/user/show/53473052-will-bohmann,5,"We take for granted the labels on foods. Just imagine if producers were not required to put labels on food - well that's what is was like in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. If not for a handful of dedicated chemists and the strong will on one in particular, the interest of business certainly would have had an impact on the longevity of our lives."

It's also a very insightful description of the ins, outs, ups and downs of policymaking in the US. Blum is among the very best science writers around. The book is especially timely given the Trump administration's attacks on many consumer protection regulations."

236,1594205140,http://goodreads.com/user/show/107126943-deb-florea,4,An interesting book about how the Food and Drug Administration came to be and the rough road that was traveled. Harvey Wiley was a dedicated warrior in the fight to get Pure Drug and Food regulations through the government. He never faltered in his fight no matter how tough the opposition was. He championed the cause to anyone that would listen and hopefully gain support to aid his cause. 
237,1594205140,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1896425-claire,4,An interesting look into the horrifying history of food contamination in the US and how one heroic man strove to rid the food system of it.

This certainly reversed my overly romantic ideas about just how 'pure' food might have been in 'the old days'.
