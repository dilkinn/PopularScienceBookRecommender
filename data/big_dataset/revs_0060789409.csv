Of fundamental significance to the way we interpret the world, this unique, pervasive phenomenon indicates a dynamic relationship between objects. In chemistry and physics, the concept of symmetry explains the structure of crystals or the theory of fundamental particles; in evolutionary biology, the natural world exploits symmetry in the fight for survival; and symmetry—and the breaking of it—is central to ideas in art, architecture, and music.Combining a rich historical narrative with his own personal journey as a mathematician, Marcus du Sautoy takes a unique look into the mathematical mind as he explores deep conjectures about symmetry and brings us face-to-face with the oddball mathematicians, both past and present, who have battled to understand symmetry's elusive qualities. He explores what is perhaps the most exciting discovery to date—the summit of mathematicians' mastery in the field—the Monster, a huge snowflake that exists in 196,883-dimensional space with more symmetries than there are atoms in the sun.What is it like to solve an ancient mathematical problem in a flash of inspiration? What is it like to be shown, ten minutes later, that you've made a mistake? What is it like to see the world in mathematical terms, and what can that tell us about life itself? In Symmetry, Marcus du Sautoy investigates these questions and shows mathematical novices what it feels like to grapple with some of the most complex ideas the human mind can comprehend. "
1,0060789409,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1411444-ed-erwin,4,"This is not just a book about the mathematical theory of symmetry (a.k.a. Group Theory), but also stories about the author's own life, and the history of people and ideas during the development of the theory. Normally I prefer my math/science books to be only about the math or science and get annoyed when they talk about the lives of the people who discovered the ideas. But in this case it works for me. In part because the mathematicians involved had such interesting, and often tragic, stories.I studied basic Group Theory in graduate school and found it fascinating. A book like this makes me want to learn more. But an hour or two spent on Wikipedia convinces me that I really don't want to go there. My mind would explode. You need the kind of brain that can effortlessly memorize 1000 digits of pi, or the bus schedule for every bus in England, things which du Sautoy's colleagues have done. Nope. I'll stop here!"
2,0060789409,http://goodreads.com/user/show/20035919-mark,4,"First off - be patient with me, still getting the hang of reviews on Goodreads...I finished this book a while ago and mulled it for awhile, and just read through some of the other reviews and comments, which confirmed some of my delights and my frustrations.Marcus du Sautoy is very good at explaining the historical and biographical background of the mathematical field. For about the first half of this book, he managed to do this in a really compelling way by showing the gradual development of the concept of symmetry. Perhaps my favorite spot was when he talked about the 17 distinct types of tiling symmetry and went hunting for them with his son at the Alhambra. As the timeline moved into more recent abstract approaches, the material obviously became less directly accessible to non-mathematical audiences (I am at best a punter in that realm). You can't really fault the author for that, or for starting to include less direct math once we are talking about constructions like the Monster.I'm afraid the real irritation for me was the lackadaisical way that the author's personal story was woven into the book. It purports to be, not just his own autobiographical thread (which would be an interesting read as a memoir), but also a more focused ""year in the life of"" where we see him tackling a very abstruse contemporary problem in symmetry.Presumably the structure might have been something like this: a historical view of the thread of symmetry through the larger field of mathematics, gradually converging with the story of his own research. By the end of the book, we would have been given the historical background to understand, at least in layman's terms, the nature of the problem he is working on; his own personal arc, so we see what it means to him to work on it - and there would be some sort of narrative integration of these threads at the end. But the author clearly ran out of steam, or hit a deadline, or seemingly just didn't know how to finish it. At the end I felt like I'd read a historical mystery with no denouement, where you say: ""Well, at least I learned something about 18th century table manners...""Maybe that's a bit harsh, because what I learned along the way here was really intriguing in parts. I picked the book up because I wanted a deeper look at symmetry - in my case to see ways to apply it in other fields, like music. So I did appreciate the detail. I just wish it had been tied together more effectively as an actual work of literature - which non-fiction books still must be, in my opinion."

4,0060789409,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3198449-tracey,1,"Symmmetry: A Journey Into the Patterns of Nature shows a lot of potential. There simply aren't many books targeted to a lay audience exploring the complex concept of symmetry. But does Sautoy deliver a successful and accessible tome outlining symmetry and the nature of mathematical patterns? Pros: Well designed cover; Interesting topic; Fusion of math & memoir Cons: Condescending tone; Frequent redundancies; Lack of preface Like most recent science and math books, Symmetry is divided into chapters with accurate and descriptive subheadings within each chapter. There are twelve chapters in all, each titled with a different month, representing the author's personal journey to turning 40 and beyond. While this is a somewhat novel arrangement for a math book, what Symmetry lacks is a preface. A preface is much appreciated at the outset of a work of non-fiction. The preface typically serves to introduce the topic at hand, as well as to provide a helpful lesson to the reader regarding any technical terms and jargon necessary to the understand the remainder of the book. Despite the lack of a preface, Sautoy does briefly define, or provide an illustration for, each of the higher level mathematical terms as they are discussed. However, even with this assistance from the author some concepts are just too advanced for a general popular readership. One such concept is the idea of greater than three-dimensional objects and space. While this concept may indeed be too difficult for all of Symmetry's readers to grasp, Sautoy's condescending tone when discussing multi-dimensional objects is wholly unnecessary and made me want to put the book down and not pick it up again. Another flaw impairing the overall readability is the repetitiveness of certain observations from Sautoy's mentors. While these observations are undoubtably important to Sautoy and to the concept at hand, Symmetry's audience should be given some credit. It is a rare reader that forgets what occured in Chapter 1 before completing Chapter 2, and likewise for Chapters 2 and 3. Symmetry is also nearly entirely lacking in footnotes but it does have an endnotes and a futher reading section at its conclusion which could be helpful for higher-level math students doing research projects. This book is only recommended for those with an advanced understanding of higher level mathematics and readers with a high degree of patience who can overlook a condescending tone and dull repetition."

6,0060789409,http://goodreads.com/user/show/89099-ben,3,"In my ongoing exploration of math history for the sake of my practice as a math teacher, I bought this book because it seemed to have a lot of information on the history of group theory which is one of my favorite topics. Basically, the book is a sort of theme-and-variations on the topic of symmetry, which is one way to look at what group theory is all about. (You could also say that group theory is one way to look at what symmetry is all about.) The chapters weave together three things: the history of the field, riffs on its connection to other areas of human endeavor (music, cryptography, biology...), and first-person narratives about the author's own experience as a mathematician/person who likes to talk about math.Basically, I enjoyed reading the book, and it is a handy reference for me in terms of the broad outlines of the history of group theory. As somebody thinking about delving more deeply into the world of academic mathematics, it was also sort of edifying for me to read the author's discussions of his own experience in that world.Du Sautoy is a working mathematician, so another reason I was initially attracted to the book was that I was curious to see how somebody who is deep in all the technical details of his subject but committed to rendering it for a popular audience would go about explaining things. The book is a very curious mix of fairly detailed conceptual discussion (considering its intended audience) and a fairly stringent refusal to use technical language. I am all for this in principal but it led to a certain awkwardness in the expository style. Du Sautoy must have repeated the phrase ""groups of symmetries build from the rotations of prime-sided shapes"" at least 4 or 5 times. As a reader with a background in group theory, the first time he said it (and there was a fairly cool explanation of what he was talking about) I thought to myself, ""he means p-groups!"" and then every subsequent use just rung out awkwardly from the page. This was the most extreme example, but actually a good deal of the math discussions had this quality for me: the stuff he actually took the trouble to explain was often a recognizeable fundamental concept in group theory, but he steadfastly refused to use its name. In fact, he (virtually?) never said ""group"" without also saying ""of symmetries."" Maybe this would not have struck a reader who didn't already have a relationship to group theory.Retrospectively, the book wasn't quite what I was looking for in it. I don't have a summary judgement on it - it might be just the thing for the right reader. But I wasn't that interested in the riffs on related topics - I sort of felt I (as a member of the popular audience) was being pandered to by Du Sautoy's publisher: ""Come on, you have to show them how it relates to real life!"" - and while some of the personal stuff was very compelling for me, some of it felt sort of random. And as regards the history, my primary motivation for reading, I really should have got myself a book with more technical detail. I am waiting for a group theory equivalent to William Dunham's wonderful _The Calculus Gallery_: a book that's equally concerned with telling me about the meat of a mathematical result and the mathematical and human story of its birth."
7,0060789409,http://goodreads.com/user/show/548376-andrea,3,I liked this book but it was a little hard to get into. The story about MC Escher's childhood was fascinating. I looked up more information on the 17 wallpaper groups after reading about the Alhambra. I watched a movie where du Sautoy talked about symmetry which is obviously one of his favorite subjects. I would recommend this book to someone who has an interest in the subject but not to someone looking for a easy read.

10,0060789409,http://goodreads.com/user/show/15785230-paulo-glez-ogando,4,"A historical tour through the concept of symmetry. Du Sautoy relates to mathematics the 'moonshine' because the moon doesn't shine itself, but can be seen because it reflects the light of the sun. And so there are a lot of mathematical objects in groups theory that we can't see in reality because they are defined in a nth dimensional space... with n a very big number, in some cases. Huge. Enormous, as the Monster, which is a group that exists in a 196883-dimensional space.I loved how du Sautoy combines his personal work and life with that of the protagonists who studied symmetry throughout the centuries. The evolution of a bunch of mathematical concepts, while he looks into the mathematical mind, conjectures, theorems, beauty... He tries to show us the job of a professional mathematician, his breakthroughs, his fights against the unknown.I keep thinking that Marcus de Sautoy is one of the best writers in popular science, at least in maths. He explains very clearly difficult concepts, he gets everything to make sense and fit using almost no equations. Here he tells the biographical background of the mathematical field almost as much as mathematics itself; he pay close attention to the people behind the theorems and what they do, what they feel. He achieves it because of his personal relationship with part of the mathematicians involve in the pursuit of symmetry in the twentieth century."

So if I get stoned on a beach in the Sinai, well, whatever, write that down too.OK, that is a little unfair. I quite enjoyed the book, but it did rather lack focus. Besides the author’s personal adventures, we get the life history of the mathematicians who developed the mathematics of symmetry (they had hard and often short lives), and an up-close look at the modern mathematicians working on it. I guess you need to be a whack job to do the job well, like the guy who never changes his clothes and carries around a plastic bag full of railway timetables.I was hoping to learn more about how group theory helps us understand symmetry, but instead of learning to play the game I got to be a spectator watching the pros do their stuff. And it is a bit out of my league. The star of the show is the “Monster”, a group that exists in a 196,883 dimensional space. I am still struggling with four dimensional space-time. This group has, oh the number is wider than the page, symmetries. What is the point? Well, for us grubby materialists, it turns out there is a connection to string theory. This does not help my impression that string theory is out of this world.It was a fun ride, and a surprisingly easy read, in a very esoteric space. Enjoy it on the beach."
12,0060789409,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2151607-audrey,4,"8/10The first half of this book was amazing. He did such a good job of giving us the history of mathematics and explaining abstract concepts in fun, easy to understand ways. And he did a great job interweaving his personal story in to this. Unfortunately, he went off the rails a little bit in the second half. There was a lot of name mentioning and a lot less history and explanation. In the first half he defined the word prime. In the second half, if I hadn’t studied group theory, if I hadn’t already known about zeta functions, I would have been totally lost. Interesting for a mathematician, but maybe not for anyone else. And at the end of each chapter, it was like he remembered that he was supposed to also talk about himself, which made for a few sentences that really seemed to come out of nowhere. Still, I loved it!! And I find myself feeling passionate about symmetry all over again, reminded of my undergraduate days. "
13,0060789409,http://goodreads.com/user/show/62188192-nadiya,5,"I first gave this book a 4-star rating. But as I've been lingering about the ideas from this book over the week, I realized that it's not a fair rating. It is really worth 5 stars. I initially discounted one star for the fact that the author was sometimes lingering too much around his own research and work routine, which was distracting me from other more interesting topics of symmetry that he describes in the book. But probably it was just the minimum that the author could include to keep the book coherent and somehow connected. And even these small ""distractions"" are rather minor inconveniences compared to all the wealth and depth of knowledge about symmetry in nature and development of mathematical knowledge and symmetry over 2000 years that I could get from this book. What's very valuable is that this material is written in a simple easily comprehensible language for a lay audience (which is in itself quite an achievement taking into account how complex that information actually is!). Great work, dear Marcus du Sautoy! I already feel I will want to re-read this book once again."

It was strikingly sad, however, to learn how severely did poverty and hardships influence lives of young math geniuses, like Abel. I would say it is a book that requires you to have on hands some time for reading and a calm setting in order to appreciate the text.

21,0060789409,http://goodreads.com/user/show/79260100-hweatherfield,3,"Fascinating! The heavy math-speak might not be up many people's alleys (I'm someone who struggled with math in school), but this book really engaged the visual learner in me and was a very satisfying read. I loved the diagrams and images the author incorporated into his descriptions of specific formulas and symmetries. From the very beginning of this book, my initial understanding of symmetry quickly transformed into a metaphysical search for this underlying factor that stretches over almost every part of our existence and beyond. The anecdotes Marcus du Sautoy uses to explain this search are entertaining and were probably the most enjoyable and exciting parts of the book. It was inspiring reading about ancient and classic mathematicians and their fight for the pursuit of knowledge, even if it meant sacrificing their lives. As someone who is also interested in other applied math, I enjoyed reading du Sautoy's connection of symmetry with our biological and psychological systems (again, showing us the bigger picture), ""The ability of these mirror neurons to help us get inside other people's heads is regarded as the key to binding humans together in groups with clear cultural identities. Humans have been referred to as 'the Machiavellian primate' because of this ability we have to comprehend the actions of others. Indeed, mirror neurons might hold the key to understanding autism. A failure to empathize might be due to the failure of these mirror neurons to fire when someone is observing other people. Empathizing requires this virtual reality machine inside our heads to simulate what it feels like to be doing what we see others doing"".Perhaps I only gave this book three stars because despite its content, I felt at times that the author's voice was too sententious in a way that made me want to skip over some parts. It was a somewhat difficult read. It distanced me as the reader, and was described as if only the author and a handful of scholars he works with that still care about these ideas (which he actually discusses towards the end of the book, noticing the decline of his field of study). I could understand why this would turn people off to this book. Sometimes the diction he uses seems to be aimed at someone who is familiar with his concepts, even though I believe the message this book has should be a bit more accessible to those who pick it up out of curiosity.Overall though, I would give it a try! This book reminds me of one of my favorites, and I will probably go re-read Struck by Genius: How a Brain Injury Made Me a Mathematical Marvel (which I highly recommend). Personally, I may go back and read Symmetry again to fully understand some of the math (which may be the purpose of the book to begin with), but in the end this is what I got out of it: There are many aspects to symmetry in math and in life, and that once-simple idea we take for granted, actually uncovers a bigger world than the reality we live in. And the way that government and society has treated ""symmetry"" throughout history, paints it as an important underlying tool we all have the power of harnessing once understood. The possibility that all finite systems can become infinite over time, the flashlight uncovering the bigger picture, is enough to inspire even non-mathematicians to observe and appreciate the many different symmetries that exist in their own world."
22,0060789409,http://goodreads.com/user/show/445677-scott,4,"One of the paradoxes of popular accounts of mathematics is that they tend to have little mathematics in them. Instead, authors tend to focus on the eccentricities of those who do mathematics. In this book, Marcus du Sautoy does present quite a lot of conceptual material on group theory and its importance in the mathematical expression of symmetry, in addition to the nearly-obligatory accounts of the strange lives of Evariste Galois and Sophus Lie. What also makes this book different than many other books on mathematics for general audiences is du Sautoy's personal narrative. The chapter structure moves through a year of his life, as he researches, collaborates, and presents material on the ""Monster,"" a 196,883-dimension group object with a mind-boggling number of different symmetries (808,017,424,794,512,875,886,459,904,961,710,757,005,754,368,000,000,000 symmetries, to be exact). For those of us who have trouble visualizing all of the geometrical symmetries in three dimensional space, this is obviously daunting. Du Sautoy shows how to make the leap from geometric visualization in three dimensions to group theory visualization of higher-dimensional objects (although not with mathematical rigor or the detail required for individual study).Along the way, we meet many of the characters of modern group theory, including John Conway, Simon Norton, and other authors of the comprehensive ""Atlas of Finite Groups"" that maps out all the possible symmetric groups. Du Sautoy takes us from a beach in the Sinai, to the symmetric majesties of the Alhambra Castle, to conferences in Japan - while personally showing us his relationship with his son from an earlier marriage, his wife and their efforts to adopt children, and the challenges he finds in relating to other mathematicians.This book is a very worthwhile read, and the effort to understand the mathematics conceptually is rewarded in developing a deeper appreciation for the beauty of mathematics and the human pursuit of symmetries."

Finding Moonshine is ultimately about the search by mathematicians to prove the existence of a geometric shape known as the Monster. This shape only exists in 196,883-dimensional space, a concept way beyond the usual three we exist in, but we are not thrown in at the deep end. du Sautoy ushers us towards an understanding of this beast by a series of steps that reassured me and made me able to follow him, even if there was some rereading and consultation with my more mathematically minded husband. We begin chronologically and geometrically with the basics, back to the ancient Greeks and the platonic solids. These are the five 3d shapes where each face is the same regular polygon and the same number of polygons meet at each corner / vertex: the tetrahedron (triangle based pyramid), cube, octahedron, dodecahedron and icosahedron). I remember these fondly from primary school. With skill du Sautoy weaves together the history of mathematicians and theories with increasingly complex theories about the concept of symmetry. Finding Moonshine is packed full of practical applications of symmetry, these give the brain a break from theory and enlightened me that symmetry is not just cerebral gymnastics. In fact it can be seen as an expression of the laws that underpin our universe and are so pleasing to the human sensibility. du Sautoy covers myriad applications including symmetry in bell ringing, nature, human psychology, music, navigation, sexual attraction, chemistry, virology, cyphers, codes, space communication and architecture, from the tiles on the walls of the Alhambra to the pyramid at the Louvre.Unusually for me this is a book I want and intend to reread over and over, I learned so much especially about the beauty of mathematics that is the substructure of our world."
24,0060789409,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2348551-ed-smiley,4,"This book is really awesome and goes into a mathemetician's private obsession and delight in symmetry and the drama of the pursuit of a complete catalog of all symmetry types. The Moorish tiles in the Alhambra, the packing of spheres in the 24th dimension, error detection and correction codes, all are connected.This has about the best explanation for the math loving quasi-layman of the Monster symmetry which emerges from the depths of the 196833rd dimension.An object with rotations for this symmetry group needs 196833 dimensions to construct....Yes, 196,833.... (The sphere packing solution, the so called Leech lattice, and the EDECs are all there for the taking in the 24th dimension, just to give you a sense of proportion.)Um oddly if you add one to the dimensionality IT JUST SO HAPPENS to appear as a coefficient associated with the modular function, and the NEXT ONE is can be formed with this and other dimensionalities in which it occurs by a trivial bit of arithmetic and so on. Now this function connects to Wiles proof of Fermat's last theorem, and this symmetry is starting to show up in string theory--and essentially IT IS IN THE MIDDLE OF EVERYTHING.(The monster group is the highest order sporadic group . It has group order, well, too long to type out.) Well, this book was so fascinating I couldn't put it down (and I am rereading parts of it.) Of course your mileage my differ, but I enjoyed it a lot."
25,0060789409,http://goodreads.com/user/show/20998-christopher-monsour,3,"A scattered but decently written tour of group theory, the branch of mathematics that studies symmetry & patterns within symmetrical systems. du Sautoy starts from this example: what sequences of mattress flips [on a mattress whose bottom & top face are identical:] will return the mattress to its original position? Sounds boring enough—and unless you're already a bit mathematically minded, it probably is. But there's a *lot* of structure & interest in the answers, which took mathematicians hundreds of years to work out in detail. This is partly that story, but interwoven with du Sautoy's own anecdotes about the world of mathematics and his own insights into the presence of symmetry and structure in the world.Unfortunately it was too long & scattered to hold my interest for its full length, and at times it was annoying that du Sautoy didn't explain *more* of the actual mathematics, even if in simplified terms. Still, a good introduction to a topic that will probably be interesting to many of the kind of people who like to read books about math."

Since I am not a mathematician I can't say for sure. But Sautoy did convey the obsessiveness that I think you have to have to be a mathematician, as well as the hard work; and the two really go hand-in-hand. Unless you're someone like Gauss or Euler, you've got to really struggle to understand many mathematical concepts, which means you've got to wrestle incessantly with them. And most people simply give up because they're not willing to put in the effort required without any real, practical payoff. As far as the actual mathematics, I enjoyed the recap of the development of group theory, or abstract algebra. He also displayed an awareness of the difference between geometrical figures and the mathematical language used to describe them, an important distinction."

When reading this sort of dense, academic book I usually know a lot of the stuff is going to go over my head but I try and read it anyways because well, why not? But I felt less confused then I expected to be when reading this and from what I read of it I found it extremely interesting. The author goes back and fourth describing how he got into mathematics and actually how mathematics and symmetries work. Both of which I thought didn't fall at all near the dull end. Instead the different aspects of his life and his work about mathematics play off each other and connect at different points, and it made me think and realize how much what you do shapes where you go and your own story. I hope to continue reading it as well as eventually finish it!"

However, Du Sautoy often tries to take a different approach and talk more in depth about his own research or the great breakthroughs in the field of group theory and symmetry. Unfortunately, he does this by avoiding any mathematical notations as much as possible, and he never goes into detail on the finer points of the theory, while still trying to explain everything. As a result, large part of the text become completely impossible to understand, even for people with a scientific background (chapter 8 is the worst example). A brave but unsuccessful try to stand out against the other popular books on mathematics. Now it's just... regular."
29,0060789409,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1205451-ed,4,"This was a very interesting and very challenging read. A mathematician writes about math and symmetry - the history of math, the histories of various mathematicians who have made contributions and discoveries throughout the years and how math and symmetry relates to art, music, history, politics and science. It was fascinating even if a portion of it was completely over my head.I really liked the concept of moonshine as it relates to math - the moon doesn't shine itself, but can be seen because it reflects the light of the sun. His work is looking for symmetries in theoretical higher-level mathematical objects (objects in 4th dimensional space, 8th dimensional space, 196,883rd dimensional space) and since they cannot be seen in reality, their properties are discovered through the math."
30,0060789409,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5147987-sawsan,4,"Fantastic! from the first pages, the author sails into a new perspective of mathematics :) I liked the idea of organizing the book into months through which the author describes his journey in search of symmetry. It was a good insight into researchers and scientists life, supervisors and students relationship as well as showing the importance of trust and collaboration among colleagues as a simple discussion might spark great ideas in the others head. He also mentioned some issues which handicap the research such as hiding the knowledge and not making it public as people want to discover it first and get their names on a special theorem! My favorite chapter was Alhambra the palace of symmetry and I think it worths reading again. I enjoyed reading the book indeed!"
31,0060789409,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1222424-jean-claude,5,"This was a fun book. Part autobiography of a mathematician hitting 40, part history lesson of mathematicians with a focus on those who worked in the field of group theory - and part museum tour of cool mathematical objects. Examples include the Monster - an object that exists in 196883 dimensional space and of great importance to group theory - and the proof that hexagonal close packing is not the tightest way to fit 24-dimensional spheres, which amazingly has implications for the transmission of information. The book doesn't have a lot of mathematical detail but that does not detract from it being very engaging. "
32,0060789409,http://goodreads.com/user/show/387710-dani,5,"This book gave me a really long, tingly braingasm.I mean, a braingasm that lasted the several weeks that it took me to read the book.As I read, it kept being like, ""Ok, so that last thing was awesome, BUT WAIT, THERE'S MORE!!"" With each new thing building on the previous awesome thing.I'm a math and science fangirl, and I love to learn about mathematical objects. This book gave me lots and lots of new ones for my collection.It was a huge source of joy.I returned the library's copy and bought multiple copies and started distributing them to any friends who expressed interest/willingness. :)"
33,0060789409,http://goodreads.com/user/show/174676-nancy,4,"Math is not a skill or field of knowledge that I ever developed, and parts of this book went way over my head. But overall the author did a good job of making the subject of symmetry and the mathematical language that describes it accessible to the non-mathematician. He told lots of stories from the history of math, and devoted chapters to symmetry in nature, in music, in the human body, and of course, in art. I bought the book for the pictures of the walls of the Alhambra in Spain. I've been reading it for over a month, just a little bit at a time, and it's been surprisingly fun. "
34,0060789409,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4679095-mark-wilson,4,"Very enjoyable, as always du Sautoy is able to whet the appetite and spark enthusiasm for the mathematics without leaving the layperson behind, an impressive feat considering the complexity of the subjects he writes about. Some will find this too anecdotal and skimming the surface, but for those there are other books to read, this is enough to start wading in the shallows and to see some of the development in understanding symmetry, and is enough to change most peoples' view of the mathematics they learnt at high school."
35,0060789409,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2794644-nathan-glenn,4,"This book was neat, getting across what it's like to be a modern-day mathematician, and communicating the way mathematicians work with ideas, not numbers. It's partly autobiographical and partly historical, describing the development of group theory. The descriptions of group theory made the field sound fascinating and far-reaching; it studies symmetry, and the same symmetries are found in art, music, geometry, codes, and everywhere else. I found the technical explanations, however, lacking and I couldn't understand much group theory by the end of the book."
36,0060789409,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5808327-jasmine,2,"So I picked up this book thinking it was interesting and would further my knowledge.Right on the first count. Somewhat right on the second.A lot of things remained unexplained, with a ""this works because there is this fun kind of math behind it and here are a few properties of that kind of math"" type explanation for a lot of the concepts/ideas/statements. I kinda wanted a little more of that math.So then again, this book made me go look things up. Which was pretty awesome."
37,0060789409,http://goodreads.com/user/show/247371-rod,2,"Symmetry is a big deal in science. I was hoping that this popular-audience book would provide some insights into uses of symmetry in modern physics (i.e., string theory). Unfortunately, this book was more an account of the author's intellectual journey than an overview of the current thinking. "
38,0060789409,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2131213-stephen,4,"Sautoy attempts the impossible: bring mathematics to the public. In Symmetry, Sautoy uses examples from his experiences to showcase how mathematics, especially that of group theory, is an integral part of the human experience. Unfortunately, with language of mathematics is necessary for comprehension of any survey literature on the subject. "
39,0060789409,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5995046-simon-hampton,0,"This is a truly lovely book, combining a history of the mathematical pursuit of the theory of symmetry with stunningly eloquent insights about the motivations of mathematicians. It's over 20 years ago that I recognised the need to move on from maths, but this was a moving reminder of the wonderful hours and days (and baths) spent getting my head around a problem."
40,0060789409,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7258306-trever,5,"A rather wonderful story through symmetry, the history of mathematics, and the enjoyment of watching children partake in math.In my mathematics career some of my professors said that this can be related to symmetry like in my number theory class, but this book broke it down very well. Entertaining and worth the price for any math student or teacher."
41,0060789409,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8782986-ian,3,"made me think a lot about symmetry and its abstraction. Appreciate du Sautoy's work in making it readable even to non math experts like myself. Nice that it did include math along with stories explaining. Since I did not finish, I'm still reading it. I like the stories of mathematicians and how they discovered things, such as Galois. "

43,0060789409,http://goodreads.com/user/show/418557-tara,3,"For a much more mathematical person than myself. The ""simple"" equations and graphs made my eyes cross! It was fascinating though (the parts I understood) and each mathematical discovery was described in an engaging story-like fashion. "
44,0060789409,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2899477-bryan-higgs,4,"I had already read Marcus du Sautoy's ""The Music of the Primes"", and liked it a lot. So, I had high expectations of his ""Symmetry"". I was not disappointed, although he has a very personalized approach to the topic.I thoroughly enjoyed this book.Highly recommended!"
45,0060789409,http://goodreads.com/user/show/17768704-kevin-michael-dela-paz,5,This didn't seem like a boring book. I think even those who are not particularly interested in mathematics will find this entertaining. Bits of history here and there make it a good read. I personally liked the part where some mathematicians are racing to solve the cubic equation.
46,0060789409,http://goodreads.com/user/show/233959-lapinova,5,I really loved reading this book. If you like amazing stories and complex maths--you should read this book!

50,0060789409,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5534532-christine,4,Interesting....for a math major!
51,0060789409,http://goodreads.com/user/show/81189-ian,3,I enjoyed this in the main. I have enjoyed Du Sautoy's TV programmes about maths and love his enthusiasm for his subject. I found this entertaining if a little challenging at times.
52,0060789409,http://goodreads.com/user/show/16051962-p-marcelo-metzelar,5,"Actually, quite fascinating. I particularly liked the parts referring to the Atlas of Symmetry and the historical stories of mathematicians. A great reference book!"
53,0060789409,http://goodreads.com/user/show/16014835-alwin-tong,3,"Great storyteller. I dont think it was nearly as strong a book as Music of the Primes, but he covers great material - the overview or group theory and biographies of those who created it."
54,0060789409,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5668541-jack-oughton,4,This guy has made group theory sound user friendly and accessible. I take my hat off to the man.
