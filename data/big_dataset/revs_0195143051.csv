I come back to it every few years because more than the story of how we discovered atoms, it's the story of humanity's intellectual journey into the light. Full of anecdotes; it is just a startling homage to the human mind at its best."
4,0195143051,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3335973-joseph-harriott,5,"well, you need a science education to begin to read this, but then it's fantastic! The best science book I've read. Felt like I was reading a racy detective thriller, and yes I do still remember much of what he said, so thank you Marcus."
5,0195143051,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2436371-dennis-littrell,5,"Captivating, informative, demanding, but highly readableThe title is an allusion to the dream of the alchemists of old who sought a magic kiln in which to transform base metals into gold. That dream remained intact until the discovery in the twentieth century of how the elements are actually built up from hydrogen and exactly what kind of ""magic furnace"" would be required to turn base metals into gold. In a most engaging narrative, science writer Marcus Chown tells that fascinating story through the lives and ideas of the scientists who made the discoveries. Chown begins, as one must, with the Greeks and Democritus who opined, ""...in reality there are only atoms and the void."" Chown shows how it was impossible for the Greeks without the scientific method to go any further than Democritus's intuition. But Chown does not dwell on the alchemy but ratchets us directly to modern science and the growing realization that ""Atoms Are Not the Smallest Things"" (Chapter Two), and that therefore ""it must be possible to transform an atom of one element into an atom of another."" (p. 21)And with that, the race was on to account for how hydrogen became helium which became, through crucibles unimaginable to man, carbon, iron and eventually the heaviest elements. The story culminates in the work of Fred Hoyle, Margaret and Geoffrey Burbidge, and Willy Fowler who explained the nuclear processes operating inside stars and supernovae. Chown finishes with a chapter on the discovery of the cosmic background radiation, the ""afterglow of creation"" which confirmed how helium was manufactured in the Big Bang, and a chapter on how the elements are strewn into space and end up in Population I stars and eventually in our bodies. There is a Glossary and a Selected Bibliography.The value of this book lies not only in the fascinating story told but in the magical way that Chown is able to painlessly teach us a little chemistry and physics along the way. I learned more about the nature of atoms and the various forces in nature in these pages, almost incidentally, than I have in any other single book. So intrigued was I in learning more that I turned to the Periodic Table of the Elements as I read the text.But Chown's style is not didactic. Instead he illuminates the personalities and the flow of ideas. We see Marie Currie with her radiation swollen fingers and Fred Hoyle truant at the back of the local cinema teaching himself to read. We see how the vision of meteorites falling into the sun became the vision of the sun falling in upon itself, shrinking and, as the elements got closer and closer together, heating up, and how that idea coursed after some meandering into the discovery of atomic energy. But perhaps the most beautiful ""turn"" (as in a poetic change of perception, as in a sonnet) in the book is on page 107 where Chown's writes about the sameness of all the atoms of an element, and then suddenly asks, thinking about the mysterious behavior evidenced by the phenomenon of the half-life: ""How could radium atoms all be the same yet behave differently?"" This question leads directly to the uncertainty principle and quantum mechanics.There is an implicit sense of warning in the book about the limitations of humans doing science. Thus the American geologist Thomas Chamberlain is quoted on page 54 as saying, ""There is perhaps no beguilement more insidious and dangerous than an elaborate and elegant mathematical process built upon unfortified premises."" He was critiquing Lord Kelvin, but might his words not apply to more recent theories, such as that of one-dimensional strings? And on page 65 it is recounted that Auguste Comte ""deemed it self-evident that we would never be able to study"" the chemical composition of the stars. Two years after his death in 1857 thanks to the unlikely technique of spectroscopy we were doing just that. Indeed, as Chown reports on page 67, helium was discovered, through a reading of its spectrum, on the sun before it was discovered on the earth! By the way, Chown's material on spectroscopy is fascinating and helped me to a better understanding of how the process works and how the black lines in spectrums of light reveal the composition of the stars.Chown has the ability to engage the reader in scientific ideas, perhaps in part because of the unique way he sometimes puts things. For example on page 79 he writes about the resistance encountered by an object as it approached the speed of light. He states, ""The only conceivable source of such resistance was a body's mass."" However, what I thought was, mass cannot find resistance by itself. There must be something in the very fabric of spacetime that is providing the resistance. It is not enough to posit ""inertia"" since that really explains nothing. I believe there is still something fundamental that we do not understand about the relationship between the speed of light and the nature of matter and energy.Chown sometimes uses the language and assumptions of the times he is writing about. For example on page 96 he speaks of ""the electrons which flitted about an atomic nucleus like planets round the sun,"" an analogy now considered somewhat misleading (a ""cloud"" is preferred, I believe), but in recalling it, we are again forced to imagine what an atom might look like if we could somehow ""see"" it.Most amusing story: Austrian physicist Fritz Houtermans making up dreams to tell Sigmund Freud! (p. 110)Best steam of consciousness leading to insight: Fred Hoyle musing on the atomic bomb project about which he had only second-hand and circumstantial evidence. (pp. 159-160)Best speculation: In answer to ""Where are they?"", Fermi's famous question about extra-terrestrials, Chown proposes that they came and went long before the sun even shone. (p. 215) --Dennis Littrell, author of “The World Is Not as We Think It Is”"
6,0195143051,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5935582-dan-cohen,4,"Excellent book giving the history of our understanding of atoms and how they are synthesised, and hence our understanding of stars. I've been interested in this subject for a number of years and have not previously found a book that gives the right level of detail, but here it is. It also explained something I'd never understood about spectral lines and I particularly enjoyed the section dominated by the account of Hoyle's work, as he is almost invariably remembered just for resisting the concept of the Big Bang rather than for his great discoveries."
7,0195143051,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3540997-derek-woodgate,5,"Excellent book. Truly inspirational. Made me feel rather insignificant. Subject matter that I had not reflected on recently. Obviously was taught most of it at some point, but an amazing refresher. Rutherford blows my mind yet again. Marcus Chown did a great job in weaving it all together like a ""novel""."
8,0195143051,http://goodreads.com/user/show/26169997-mikeh5972,5,This was a very readable book. Marcus Chown presented a complex story of the formation of the atoms of different elements in the universe in a very clear and understandable narrative. Highly recommended.
9,0195143051,http://goodreads.com/user/show/55205911-prahlad,5,"What a brilliant book this is ! This should be included in the school curriculum. For the students interested in Physics (particularly Astronomy), this book gives a good overview of what they are heading into."

13,0195143051,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1779598-pete-dapixie,4,"The Magic Furnace is a magic book. The story of physics, astrophysics and astronomy is a tale that Chown begins back in ancient Greece and is the search for the origin of atoms. The two thousand year investigative odyssey of what everything is made of and where atoms came from and how they were made, from the Universe rich hydrogen and helium, the light elements, all the way to the heavy atoms is a mind blower. I enjoyed the authors previous work 'The Afterglow of Creation', and I think Magic Furnace is even better. From the Greek philosopher Democritus, back when Alexander the Great was on his rampage, all the way to the L.H.C. with who discovered what and how is set out and explained in such an easy to understand way, Marcus Chown removes the mystery and has to be congratulated.As we look out into the universe and identify the many accidents of physics and astronomy that have worked together to our benefit, it almost seems as if the universe must have known that we were coming.Or we have on our hands a multiverse, where we inhabit the fortunate carbon rich 'one-off'. "
14,0195143051,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4331887-steve,5,"An exhilarating account of the discoveries that led to our understanding of the nature of matter and how it is made - the origin of atoms and stars. All the key players are here: Eddington, Hoyle, Gamow, Baade, Rutherford, and others. As with Simon Singh's more recent Big Bang (which I enjoyed slightly more, but this is still worthy of 5 stars), the author draws us into the story of discovery alongside the technical detail - he takes what might otherwise have been quite a dry subject matter (""helium-4 fuses with carbon-13 to make oxygen-16 and a leftover neutron"") and somehow really brings it to life. This is well-written and progresses smoothly from one chapter to the next. My favourite of Chown's books."
15,0195143051,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9491043-tim,5,"If you're one of those people who wants to know all about atoms, their origins and learn on the way about relativity, quantum theory and other cool stuff you can't talk about at parties unless you're really drunk, and if you once tried to pick it all up from Stephen Hawking but found he assumed too much prior knowledge, and if you want to learn it all from someone who won't patronise you and will tell you which facts are whose discoveries and when they made them, then read this. Its gravitational attraction was such that it formed new structures in my mind. "
16,0195143051,http://goodreads.com/user/show/48918397-rene-v-li,5,"One of the best books on physics that Ive ever read! And it is not only a book on physics, its an written as a thrilling detective story. It covers so many topics from nuclear physics to astrophysics and links them chronologically in a natural way. I feel like I learned more about physics and its recent history from this book than 5 years of studying physics in university."
17,0195143051,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4218347-petr,5,"Awesome peek into history of great discoveries around atom, its nuclear structure and the source of Sun's energy. Easily readable and actually really exciting. "
