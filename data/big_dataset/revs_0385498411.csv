I learned a lot about ovulation, for example, and menopause, and breasts, and enjoyed the learning immensely.But the prose. I suspect lines like, ""by Hecate!"" and, ""the Grand Canyon, the world's grandest vagina,"" are meant to be a little tongue-in-cheek, but I just found them off-putting. Some of this is I think par for the course with feminists of a certain age (the book is PACKED with mom-jokes, the kind of thing my mom puts in her Facebook status and makes me facepalm--'she yam what she yam' and so forth).But I think underlying problem was that the prose assumes a certain conception of ""woman"" that I find restrictive. Even when talking about the wide variation in female bodies and minds, it makes broad, sweeping statements about the desires and personalities of both women and men. It assumes that women are straight and cisgendered, for example, when in fact many women are neither. Mind you, the CONTENT of the book is generally inclusive and demonstrates variety, but the prose, the little throw-away lines and jokes, really don't.That concept of ""woman"" is also philosophical, and leads to incredibly tedious pages and pages about, for example, which sex came first, which one is our 'default' setting? (Who cares! Does biology care?) So much talk about mothers and daughters and grandmothers, like being female-bodied makes you part of this grand sisterhood.I'm a woman and a feminist, and I'm proud of both. I just wish that I'd been able to access the information in this book without having to wade through such a wall of over-lofty ideas and prose."

You can't scrutinize and analyze and critique the geography of the vagina (chapter 4) without providing visual aids to those of us who don't possess one or haven't sighted one in... well... a long time. You might as well be talking about the album cover of Sgt. Pepper - yes I vaguely remember the layout, no I don't recall exactly where Ringo was standing.That said, Angier doesn't just explain female physiology, she celebrates it. Loudly. Intelligently. Frankly. This is no college textbook, but maybe it should be. Women 101, freshman syllabus, M-W-F, 9am - noon.And it's not just physiology, it's also biology, psychology, anthropology, sociology, chemistry, and primatology. (I laughed rather loudly at the labeling of the rhesus monkey's capacity for social compromise as ""rhesus peaces""). Science geek nirvana. Speaking as a man, I was humbled and sometimes horrified. For all the splendor and beauty of the female body, there is a lot there that can go wrong. Even when it goes right it's still messy and complicated. A nice place to visit, but I would not want to live there."
2,0385498411,http://goodreads.com/user/show/967506-ann,2,"I wanted to like this book. Oh, how I wanted to. And I will say, it was packed with interesting information. I did learn a few things. I shared any anecdote or theory my husband would listen to. But, I finally got fed up with her writing style. This writer cannot pass up any chance for wordplay, puns, double entendre, thesaurus-izing, or clever euphemism. Since I'm such a word-lover, you might think this was a good thing, but I couldn't get past it. I found it annoying, stupid, distracting, flippant, and not funny--sometimes all at the same time. She takes several major female body parts a chapter at a time. So, in the chapter on say, the uterus, you would think that she would use the word uterus a zillion times. No. She appears to be frightened to do so. Instead, she uses every alternate word, every slang term, known to man (or woman). It got old. It was confusing at times since I was sometimes not familiar with the slang terms (not ashamed to admit that). And it contributed to the overall tone of the book that was a little baffling. Here she is having spent untold hours researching and writing a book on a topic she obviously thinks is fascinatingly important, yet at times she talked about it like she was a 14-year-old boy in the locker room. It's also interesting to me the kinds of questions she asked in order to write the book. Her ""why did evolution do it this way?"" approach wasn't my favorite, but I am certain I would have been able to hang with her on that if it hadn't been for her usage, as I discussed above. I read about half of the book."
3,0385498411,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1886171-chris,0,"Fascinating topic but I hate Natalie Angier’s writing style: the forced metaphors, the whimsical nouns, the strained adverbs. I wish she’d put down the thesaurus and just tell us what she’s learned from her reporting."
4,0385498411,http://goodreads.com/user/show/32138-tracy-rhodes,5,"This book taught me so much about what it means to be a woman from a physiological perspective. Angier writes in a witty, conversational style - not condescendingly, but in a way that keeps the reader willing to stick with her through some pretty hard-core biological science stuff. Just as importantly, she talks about the psychology of women and how we relate to our bodies and their sometimes mysterious ways. Every woman should read this book (and men who want to know more about what makes women tick under their skins should, too)."
5,0385498411,http://goodreads.com/user/show/278544-kara,5,"When I first read this, I was enamored with it - so much so that I was about ready to drop my business major and start majoring in Women's Studies! Luckily my dad stepped in on that one. ;) This book is great and is written with a witty tone to it that only a fellow woman could have. It's frustrating to go through life being told how your body *should* act, by panels of men, no less. I felt like I could related to this book because it was written by someone who not only cared enough to research its contents, but by someone who had a vested interest the topic."
6,0385498411,http://goodreads.com/user/show/92303634-shreya-vikram,4,"This book is strange. This book is beautiful. This book is important. But above everything else, this book is fun. Woman is that narrative I've needed all my life but didn't think was possible. It's educating without being condescending. It's complex and dynamic without overwhelming. It weighs laughter and natural selection with the same nuance. It's movement, strength, aggression, and fury. Angier's writing is eccentric, and in love with itself. Deal with it. At first, the sheer bluntness of offbeat, playful writing style can be strange and exasperating, but it was something I learnt- and learnt fast- to love. Because there is something so intimate, so tender, so tremendous, and so, so loveable about this book. My heart is at forty beats a minute.Blog | Letterboxd- Movie Reviews | Newsletter "
7,0385498411,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1960933-sidewalk-sotol,2,"I could see giving this book 3 stars. It really depends on what you're looking for. I tried to use this book as a supplement to my anatomy & physiology textbook. Not a good idea. I did not get to finish it, but since the organization of the book depends only a bit on linear reading, there is not too much lost by not getting to the conclusive chapter. What Natalie Angier does well is pull together a lot of different perspectives of feminist or feminist sympathetic researchers into one volume that asks a lot of good questions about the androcentrism of most Western scientific writing about women and female bodies. Thus, if you are a layperson with an abiding curiosity in Western biology and contemporary cultural meanings of female bodies and read it primarily for this reason, it provides a lot to consider. However, Angier also interjects word play and innuendo very frequently, making it a difficult book to use for consultative purposes without lots of underlining. Unfortunately, her interruptions and very-clever references rarely provide greater depth to her material, which is based upon scientific research with some anthropological and personal speculation here and there. Also, while Angier provides a good deal of her own speculation, she never gets around to questioning the heteronormativity and cisgender assumptions of scientific research. This is particularly noticeable when she starts talking about individuals with intersex conditions and references such queer scientists as Anne-Fausto Sterling. Angier cherry picks the individuals who most support her specific arguments about how people with intersex conditions prove her points against clitoridectomy, are just like straight women except for anatomy, etc. "
8,0385498411,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5871312-michelle,4,"If you're looking for a comprehensive atlas of the embodied female, then you cannot do much better than Woman: An Intimate Geography. Even 18 years after its original publication, Natalie Angier's book remains relevant, provocative, and thoroughly educational. Women's bodies remain mysteries only to the extent our societal ignorance compels us, and that certain doctors and scientists continue to neglect it in favor of the supposed simplicity of the male form. Angier trods well-worn territory for know-thyself works such as periods and the female orgasm, but where her research truly excels is in debunking hormonal myths and the tired tropes of ""evolutionary psychology"" in explaining women's behavior. And if you aren't yet aware of X-inactivation and mosaicism, prepare to have your mind blown.While Woman is an explicitly feminist work, it's hardly dogmatic; she's fair and thorough with the science. One memorable example is her treatment of competing theories to explain the robustness of human menstruation, which ends without a clear conclusion (but isn't the intellectual exploration so interesting?). An overarching theme of the book is the welcome story that women and men aren't so different after all, and that these pat stories we've been told about our hormones and genes sharply differentiating us are a vast oversimplification. Some may find Angier's eccentric narrative and enthusiasm a bit much, but I mostly enjoyed it. If I had one criticism of this enduring work, I'd say it would be that queer and trans women are largely unacknowledged - but much has changed in recent years, and some inclusive updates would strengthen the book. "
9,0385498411,http://goodreads.com/user/show/948535-hallie,5,"Best book I read in 2011, by a long shot. Continues to resonate. My dad gave this to me as a present in 2000 or 2001 and naturally I refused to read it. An argument with a friend prompted me to look for an answer in one of its chapters, and I was riveted, started from the beginning and worked my way to the end, intrigued by subjects that had never held any interest at all for me, like menopause, and hormones, and ones I have never seen discussed with half the wit or dynamism, such as female aggression and monogamy. I am not of a remotely scientific bent, but Angier is such an elegant prose stylist, and an imaginative and spunky thinker that I swear I fell in love with her over a discussion of mosquito sperm or some such. The last two chapters, in which she stands evolutionary psychology on its head, pointing out its anti-feminist tendencies to boot, wooed me all over again, and I think I would go to great lengths for this woman if I got the chance. It is so refreshing also to read someone who takes her feminism for granted - that is, of course she is a feminist, how could she not be? I am so disgusted by the reluctance of many women I know to self-identify this way, but this rant I will leave for another space, as I want only to heap praise and gratitude on Ms. Angier. I don't have the book with me right now, but I might try to do it more justice in this forum when next I lay my hands on it."
10,0385498411,http://goodreads.com/user/show/764079-stormkpr,4,"An informative investigation into female physiology. I know I sound like a dunce when I say this, but I’ve never been into science. Didn’t do well in it at school and never found it particularly interesting. This book has been on my “to read” list for a while -- I even bought a copy for a friend as a gift, at her request, years ago. I finally got around to reading it. It was a tough read for me in a couple of ways. I had to overcome my distaste for science, I am opposed to testing on animals and I don’t like reading about the results of those tests even if some were enlightening (this may be partly why science turns me off), and then there’s Angier’s prose to deal with. Sometimes it’s poetic and fascinating but more often than not, her writing style is just way over-the-top and even a bit silly. Then again, maybe that’s unfair; she does do a good job making science accessible to non-scientists. When I could get passed the book’s roadblocks, the work was really fascinating. I learned a lot about women’s biology from hormones to the uterus to breasts to the almighty clitoris to the sum of these parts. I also love when she directly states her opinions. Instead of hemming and hawing on the subject of female genital mutilation (twice in my lifetime I’ve heard people actually defend the practice), she condemns it. Definitely a good read. "
11,0385498411,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7980-genya,4,"This is such a great book. I just reread it. It is all about the biology of the female body, but it is funny, brilliant, totally accessible, and a little subversive. Her first paragraph reads, ""This book is a celebration of the female body - its anatomy, its chemistry, its evolution, and its laughter. It is a personal book, my attempt to find a way to think about the biology of being female without falling into the sludge of biological determinism. It is a book about things that we traditionally associate with the image of woman - the womb, the egg, the breast the blood, the almighty clitoris - and things that we don't movement, strength, aggression, and fury."""
12,0385498411,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5437125-nancy-schober,5,"Favorite quotes:""Women need muscle, as much as they can muster. They need muscle to shield their light bones, and they need muscle to weather illness& And being strong in a blunt way, a muscle headed way, is easier than being skilled at a sport. It is a democratic option, open to the klutzes and the latecomers, and women should seize the chance to become cheaply, frowzily strong, because the chance exists, and let us be honest, we don't have many. Being strong won t make you happy or fulfilled, but it is better to be sullen and strong than sullen and weak.""Women never bought Freud's idea of penis envy: who would want a shotgun when you can have a semiautomatic?..it is natural for girls to fatten up when they mature, but what natural means is subject to cultural definition, and our culture still hasn't figured out how to handle fat. & we are intolerant of fatness, we are repulsed by it, and we see it as a sign of weak character and sloth.Girls, poor girls, are in the thick of our intolerance and vacillation. And then they are subject to the creed of total control, the idea that we can subdue and discipline out bodies if we work out very hard at it. Any sane and observant girl is bound to conclude that her looks matter and that she can control her face as she controls her body, through makeup and the proper skin care regimen and parsing her facial features and staying on guard and paying attention and thinking about it, really thinking about it& .If she is smart she knows that it is foolish to obsess over her appearance. But if she is smart, she has observed the ubiquitous Face and knows of its staggering powers. By all indications, a controlled body and a beautiful face practically guarantee a powerful womanhood.Life is lived by the day, and most days aren't Christmas.Thereis a principle in evolutionary thinking called the naturalistic fallacymaking the mistake of assuming that what is, is for the best.You don't want to look muscular? You want to look toned? But your not a Gregorian chant: you're a century-in-waiting. Pray to Artemis, goddess of the hunt, for her huntswoman's quadriceps and her archer's orbed arms. You'll be happy to have them when gravity, ruthless gravity, starts fingering your merchandise and toying with your heart.What is wrong with looking muscular? Muscles are beautiful. Strength is beautiful. Muscle tissue is beautiful. It is metabolically, medically, and philosophically beautiful. Muscles retreat when they're not used, but they will always come back if you give them good reason. No matter how old you get, your muscles never lose hope. Few cells of the body are as capable as muscle cells are of change and reformation, of achievement and transcendence. Your muscle can be sanctimonious, it is true, adhering to a materialist, puritanical, goal-oriented mentality, but at least they are reliable. You can spend every day on a therapist's couch and still wake up to your old frail spirit, but if you work out every day your muscles will grow strong.I've noticed in nearly every gym where I've worked out that women on the weight-training equipment use far too low a setting for their strength, particularly when they are exercising their upper body, where they are convinced they are weak. They'll stick with twenty or thirty pounds that they could handle twice what they're pressing, but they're not doing it, and nobody's telling them to do it, and I want to go over and beg them to use a higher weight and tell them, Look, you're blowing it, here's your chance, your cheap and easy chance, to own a piece of your life and strut and be a comic-strip heroine, so please, stack it up, heave-ho, do it for yourself, your daughter, your mother, the International Maidenhood of Iron.In the real world of the two-career family, most women will breastfeed for the first few weeks or months of their baby's life, and then they will supplement or replace breast milk with formula. Like women throughout history, they will do the best they can under the constraints of work, duty, and desire. They will be generous and selfish, mammals and magicians, and they will flow and stop flowing. Whatever they do, they will feel guilty for not doing enough."
13,0385498411,http://goodreads.com/user/show/32982360-nicole,5,"This whole book got me saying, ""Preach, sister, preach"", every few minutes. What a journey it was and what a beautiful book about femaleness in all its myriad complexity and unfathomable-ness. Angier's ""Woman"" is a must-read for every woman. Much more than just a simple exploration of women and their bodies, ""Woman"" dives deep into the cultural biases that have affected evolutionary research and perpetuated an incorrect view of women as the inferior sex. Calling her book a ""fantasia"" for womanhood, Angier manages not only to convey her intimate and encyclopedic knowledge of a woman's body, but to do so in a way that isn't boring or stuffy or chock-full of complicated scientific terminology that only leads to confusion instead of enlightenment. Biology was my most dreaded subject in school, but Angier manages to infuse it with zest and an uncanny, wry sense of humor and a voice of genuine love and awe for the female body in all its complexity. Language isn't sacrificed for science; they're intertwined and Angier's book is a testament of that.Trust me when I say that if you read this book, you will walk away knowing so much more than just facts about the biology of women. The book does contain a lot of that, touching on everything from the properties of breast milk and the importance of the clitoris, to menstruation and the work that our ovaries do for us. I learned many things that I had had no clue about prior to reading ""Woman."" But Angier, through ""Woman"", ultimately makes the case for all of us women to pay ""Dionysian respect"" to our bodies, to love every inch of ourselves just as we are, free of judgment and fear, and marvel at just what our unique feminine body can do for us. ""Liberation biology"" is what she calls it and ""Woman"" is the Bible for this new branch of biology: calling all women to love ourselves, love what we have been given, know what we have been given, and use that knowledge to educate others about what it actually means to be a woman."
14,0385498411,http://goodreads.com/user/show/632247-chrissie,3,"Angier makes the ""scince of women"" very accessible, although her writing is chock full of scientific and biological terms. She explains complicated things in a very simple manner, perhaps because she really does know what she is talking about. She is a very knowledgeable and witty teacher. She questions everything and usually finds scientific studies to illustrate her views. She keeps your attention. It is just that so much is turned topsy turvey that I began questioning her statements too. I began seeing divergent ways of looking on issues. Sometimes I became less sure of what I thought, at the end of a discussion than at the beginning. But is that bad? Isn't it good to understand how little we really understand?"
15,0385498411,http://goodreads.com/user/show/825356-okyrhoe,4,"I expected less from this book. Or rather, I didn't expect that Angier would provide so much irrelevant material. This is an important book, certainly, but she could have said it in half the space/time it takes here. Yet I still recommend it. Science still has a long way to go to understand women's bodies and psyches; many questions raised here are not discussed in other books concerning the female gender, body, & sexuality."
16,0385498411,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4143685-daniel-gallagher,4,"This is an awesome book, loved learning all sorts of secrets about women (ha ha). Actually, this should be required reading for men and women. There is a lot of good information presented in a fun and engaging way. My only gripe was that the author heaps a ton of praise on old women, and basically dumps on old men as being useless. I think older men and women have a lot to offer younger generations. "

18,0385498411,http://goodreads.com/user/show/117697-shaenon-garrity,4,"Angier is sometimes a little too in love with her own playful, punning prose style, but this is an eye-opening book with a wealth of information and ideas on human biology.

19,0385498411,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8609433-ellen,5,"Seminal (or should I say ovular?) read in my personal formation as a feminist. Like the female body, Angier's prose is both tender and strong, and it's absolutely bursting with insight and information. Quite funny, too!"
20,0385498411,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1545857-jessica,4,"I loved this book but found it challenging and eventually had to assign myself 5-10 pages a day. Every paragraph of Angier's study of women's physiology is packed with enough scientific concepts and ideas to fuel a half-day discussion, and she is one of those writers who makes you use your dictionary, who makes you think, and who also makes you think ""I could never write that."" She starts with a study of the human egg cell and takes you into the operating room where a woman is donating her eggs. From there, Angier explores the uterus, menopause, breasts and breast milk, female hormones and the menstrual cycle. Throughout the book, she considers why nature made women the way they are, how much is evolution and how much is influenced by culture. She dips into chemistry, anthropology, literature and psychology in an attempt to explain biology.You could pick up some of the science in this book in any number of places, and she quotes myriad studies and interviews scientists and researchers and ordinary women. But only here can you find Angier's stylized and stylish prose. ""We are all yeses. We are worthy enough, we passed inspection, we survived the great fetal oocyte extinctions. In that sense, at least— call it a mechanospiritual sense— we are meant to be. We are good eggs, every one of us."""
21,0385498411,http://goodreads.com/user/show/40355968-katie,4,"I loved this book. Contrary to what others are saying, I loved the poetic way the book was written. If you're a real science buff, and just want the cold-hard-facts, this book is not for you. I, however, have always loathed reading about science but am fascinated by the actual wonder of what it creates-- which is why I like this book so much. This piece is crammed full with interesting information which helped me relate to my body and had me popping up with weird new facts to tell my friends: ""Did you know your vagina is the cleanest part of your body?!"" I really enjoyed this piece. It is important to note that although called ""Woman"", it is not particularly intersectional to the trans* community. I feel a book about trans women's reproductive bodies would need a volume of its own, and therefore could not be encompassed on this text. There are moments when the author does make an effort to mention the community, and their inclusion or exclusion on the cause, but this book is by no means tailored to that demographic. Provided, I don't think it necessarily should be. "

Direct quote from one of the women: ""I didn't even know books like this existed!"" I was reminded just how powerful information, particularly timely information, really is. Here is a book that looks in depth at the biology of the women's body and questions traditional assumptions about females as the ""default"" sex and more. Angier is a woman passionate about science and about women and the combination is inspiring, refreshing, and empowering. While the chapter on the clitoris seems to garner the most attention, I prefer the chapter entitled, ""Cheap Meat,"" which is about muscle. Angier describes women's muscle as resilient and powerful -- muscle is our right. Just love it -- it's a chapter I read (and re-read) at the top of my lungs! This is a book I recommend highly to all women -- and girls."

I learned a lot about the landscape of my own existence, and appreciated a voice that dissected a lot of problematic gender assumptions.As much as I loved it, there were a few glaring gaps, including:— no recognition that the baseline cultural assumptions of the author/readership are white people living in the U.S.,— no discussion of racial identities and its effect on the experience of women,— pretty much exclusive bucketing of people into men/women hetero/gay and no space for gender non-conforming people or non-binary sexual identities."

32,0385498411,http://goodreads.com/user/show/38396339-bastard-travel,3,"Feminist evolutionary biology! Almost an oxymoron. The closest I’d seen to evo-psych that didn’t strongly favor the established construct of “men philander, women are chaste because DARWIN” was Sex at Dawn, and this has a notably more grrl-power bent than that, but without being cloying, intimidating, or overly exclusionary. I like how Ms. Angier writes. She sent me scurrying to the dictionary more than a handful of times, too.The first third of the book reads like an anatomy textbook with a handful of jokes thrown in. The second third is more of a personal dialogue, mostly about going to the gym, with an exponential increase in jokes and the jarring use of the word “bitch”. The final third is part literature review, part reasonable conjecture, and 100% dedicated to taking stabs at established evolutionary psych norms. Which, hey, be my guest, shake up those nerds, they’re balancing on a house of cards anyway.Following are some excerpts that I found especially interesting.“At twenty weeks’ gestation, the peak of a female’s oogonial load, the fetus holds 6 to 7 million eggs.”This was weird to consider. Men produce sperm pretty much always, by accident, and faster when they look at boobs, which is always. Women are born with a precise motherlode (teehee) of eggs which they chamber, fire – often blank – then discard. If it seems wasteful, it’s only because of the stockpile.“Take your Premarin, darling – if we’re clever by nature, it’s the natural thing to do.”No fun facts in this one, I just thought it was clever.“A female slave was a sexual being; she had no choice, and very often she was dressed for the part. To distinguish herself from the race of slaves, a woman could do no better than to cherish her chastity and to flaunt it in flagrant modesty.”And here, the potential origin of the cultural contagion of pure and modest womanhood. The spawn point of “I hate her, she’s such a slut”! The possible progenition of the Romantic ideal that even the Romantics didn’t really care for, since Guinevere banged Lancelot anyway. Distancing oneself from sex slavery as a means of increasing demonstrable value, pushing any desire one might have to occasional objectification well into the realm of the repressed and driving up the rates of BDSM experimentation. Oh, humana.“Female strength is, even yet, seditious. It can make men squirm. They can get angry at a woman who is too strong, who may be stronger than they are. Part of me understands that reaction. I feel irritated and jealous when I see a woman who can lift more weight than I can. How dare she! I look for flaws, for evidence that her form is poor, that she is cheating. But once the initial irritation fades and I can see that she is good at what she is doing, I feel grateful to her, and heartened by her power.”Pfft, nice squat, girl-bro. Form sucks, though. Do you even lift? (I’m glad girls get this too. This is a definite milestone on the march toward full equality.)“I’m talking about strong and earthy, a moosey strength, the strength that shrugs its shoulders and takes no bull. I’ve noticed in nearly every gym where I’ve worked out that women on the weight training equipment use far too low a setting for their strength, particularly when they are exercising their upper body, where they are convinced they are weak. They’ll stick to twenty or thirty pounds’ worth of plates and then do many repetitions easily, and I can see that they could handle twice what they’re pressing, but they’re not doing it, and nobody’s telling them to do it, and I want to go over and beg them to use a higher weight and tell them, Look, you’re blowing it, here’s your chance, your cheap and easy chance, to own a piece of your life and strut and be a comic-strip heroine, so please, stack it up, heave-ho, do it for yourself, your daughter, your mother, the International Maidenhood of Iron. I don’t say anything. It’s not my business.”This, too, hit me right in the deep-set Bro Feels. In days of yore, friends used to have me teach them how to lift. Whatever they hoped to accomplish, be it weight loss, muscle gain, or the construction of an ass from near nonexistence, I got them there by way of lifting heavy weights, eating a ton of meat, and doing occasional, begrudging cardio. Most of these friends were women. I was known in some circles as “Matt Holmes: Ladytrainer”. Few circles. Let’s not reflect. Point is, I am way into her message, give or take the hokey Iron Maiden reference. There’s no such thing as toning, ladies, and a square inch of ladymuscle is, pound for pound, as strong as an inch of dudemuscle. Besides, deliberately limiting yourself to avoid getting “too bulky” is ludicrous. You think Arnold Schwarzenegger just accidentally overdid it one day and woke up Mr. Olympia? You gotta work your ass off, even as a dude pumped full of catalyzing testosterone and ornithine, to strap on that sweet sweet FlexSteak. You’re not gonna get too bulky. Odds are you’re not even gonna get bulky, just strong and hot. You see all these dudes going off about Ronda Rousey? You think that’s coincidence?Which brings us to the detractors, the pitiful hicks who deride SSJ Ronda and any other strong women. It is fear, plain and simple. They are weak creatures, they are afraid of losing what low rung of pack hierarchy they have managed to get their tenuous little fingers around. They should be afraid. You should make them afraid.All right, let’s wind that back down a bit…“If women could be persuaded that men didn’t mind their being high achievers, were in fact pleased and proud to be affiliated with them, we might predict that the women would stop caring about the particulars of their mates’ income.”There are a panoply of psychological factors at work in this little torrent, but I agree that most of it amounts of the male’s perceived social stigma. Gotta win that bread, or I fail as a man! If I win slightly less bread, I still fail as a man! Quit being so sensitive, dweeb. Your ceramic ego is your masculine failing. Let her bring home some bacon. Bring home some of your own. Double up on bacon. Who is hurt by double the bacon?“It seems premature to attribute the relative lack of female interest in sexual variety to women’s biological nature alone in the face of overwhelming evidence that women are consistently beaten for promiscuity and adultery,” Barbara Smuts has written. “If female sexuality is muted compared to that of men, then, why must men the world over go to extreme lengths to control and contain it?”BOOM, BABY. Because it’s not. Alluding once again to Sex at Dawn, there are schools of thought that indicate human women are evolutionarily programmed to be damn near sexually insatiable. You remember that whole thing with each orgasm coming (teehee) more readily than the previous? Get a good one started, and you got yourself a chain reaction? Where does that fit into your conception of monogamous prudery, while Kinsey studies put the average vaginal sexual encounter at a tragic seven minutes from penetration to cigarettes and resentment.The take home is most of these silly social problems are born of insecurity and fear, often on the parts of the men. The beautiful irony is, it could all be avoided, if only they woulda-drumroll pleaseMan Up."

There is quite a lot here: genetics, anthropology, history, biology, endocrinology, psychology, sociology. Probably should have read it at some earlier time (written in the late 90s) and though I can't say I really understand 'women' a whole lot better, I have a lot better idea of where she and 'they' might be coming from. They are all individuals (first?) which is something Natalie tends to gloss over, necessarily perhaps. And she is ruthlessly secular, barely giving a nod to female or even human spirituality. Still a splendid effort and well worth reading."
34,0385498411,http://goodreads.com/user/show/127289-emily,4,"Some people were put off by Angier's style, but I loved it. I loved her dance between philosophical and scientific. I love her brain and her wit. This was the book for me. I've read it once, and it took me two years to do it. I know I've already forgotten important bits. This is one of those books that should sit on one's shelf, proud and showy, and that one pulls out every once in a while, opens at random and breathes in."
35,0385498411,http://goodreads.com/user/show/43331685-kristina-backstrom,4,"This book was another in a series I’m exploring on female anatomy, its medical treatment, and gender roles, as well as how social influence impacts what we too quickly conclude to be scientific fact, how those “facts” are used to defend poor social policy, or back weak scientific theories. Many have noted that Angier’s tone is at times over the top, and while I found myself wincing a couple times (e.g. she makes a remark that is downright offensive towards the anorgasmic), overall I found it refreshing and even politically subversive to read her positive wonder in describing women’s bodies—which are too often shamed and relegated as the “second sex.”One of my favorite quotes inverts this old adage of the “second sex” and women being the exception to the rule, noting humanity begins as female in gestation, and from an evolutionary sense likely began the same way:""What the notion of female as ancestral sex means, when stretched to its most interesting dimensions, is that males are more like females than females are like males. Males, after all, are derived from females; they have no choice but to hold in common those features that were modified in the making of them. But females have no such reliance on the male prototype to invent a sense of self. Self was there to begin with; we defined self. We don't need Adam's rib, we didn't use Adam's rib; our bones calcified and our pelvises hardened entirely without male assistance."" (p.44)Readers that praise this book’s scientific passages while dismissing the philosophy are only taking away half the message: It is vital for there to be real dialogue between the biological and social sciences—beyond the basics of how a healthy vagina smells (hint: not douche spray; though this knowledge is revolutionary in its relationship to shame and the commodification of women’s bodies), but broader health concepts such as whether or not the high numbers of hysterectomies and post-menopausal women on Hormone Replacement Therapy so common in the United States is appropriate and in the best interests of those women.Regarding gender roles, Angier touches on the heart of it, which, as all the trendy evolutionary psychologists will tell you, is procreation. Angier discusses what so many women know but are discouraged from discussing—that our relationship with birth and child-rearing is a beautifully complicated burden, one that is physically uniquely female at least through pregnancy, and too often allocated as such after birth. It is so important to dismantle the clichéd Madonna image and encourage men to understand as Adrienne Rich puts it, ""We learn through painful self-discipline and self-cauterization, those qualities which are supposed to be ‘innate’ in us: patience, self-sacrifice, the willingness to repeat endlessly the small, routine chores of socializing a human being."" (p.407)Women deserve support and choice in their family dynamics. Too often in today’s economy, child-rearing and homemaking has become a second or third shift for women. This occurs as society and even some scientists continue to assume these caretaking skills are somehow physiologically incompatible with the Y chromosome; or worse, as men taste the discomfort that is a constant reality for many women, they placate themselves with the assurance that surely she does not feel the same frustrations. I wish every couple, every family, could have more realistic and frank discussions of the dangers and difficulties of childbirth and childrearing, as well as the shared joy and awe of familial bonding, the (literal) labor of love, which is by no means exclusive to motherhood!Finally, as a scientifically-minded modern person, it is inappropriate to entirely throw out the theory of evolution in relation to psychology, but once again it is worth questioning how this “new scientific” trend has been used to support old—what some might even call outdated—social models and mores with a lot of assumptions and not much hard evidence. When Darwin is invoked to prove women as inherently less-creative, docile work-horses, my inner-cynic springs forth to ask who and what is the benefit of these “studies”? Angier finds a happy medium in her discussion with David Sloan Wilson by focusing on the evolutionary pull of self-determination—the very human drive at the very heart of feminism. As Sloan Wilson describes,""The evolutionary psychology view assumes that all resources for women flow through men, leaving only the ‘strategies’ of ‘find the best husband’ or ‘maximize your returns from sexual favors.’ The option that is not listed is ‘self-determination,’ or calling one’s own shots. With this simple addition, feminism finds an evolutionary voice capable of silencing the evolutionary psychology voice on its own turf."" (p.419)More than a man, more than any partner, women want the ability to live well on their own terms. Evo psych’s modern discussion of coyness and brain imaging hides “new” (old) rationalizations for people to continue to deny women that human right. For this reason, the study of female anatomy and recognition of women as full human beings remains shockingly radical."

Natalie Angier makes the scientific side of the subject of the working of a woman’s body very accessible with great writing and a sense of humor. The reader is awarded by follow-up comments which weave together the chapters. The chemistry of the body, serotonin, testosterone and estrogen sections did go on and on, chapter after chapter (after chapter!), a bit much for me. All in all a worthwhile, informative read.Quotable:We may love men and we may live with men, but some of them have said stupendously inaccurate things about us, our bodies, and our psyches.During courtship, a male pig will spit on his sow heart’s face and in doing so expose her to a pungent steroid compound that causes her to freeze with rear legs conveniently parted. All of which might help explain the now quaint term male chauvinist pig – yessir, a bit of spit and the little woman is yours!We mistakenly equate emotionality with the primitive and rationality with the advanced, but in fact the more intelligent the animal, the deeper its passions. The greater the intelligence, the greater the demand on the emotions, the portmanteaus of information, to expand their capacity and multiply their zippers and compartments.A girl who is angry ofter responds by stalking off, turning away, snubbing the offender, pertending she doesn’t exist. She withdraws, visible so, aggressively so. You can almost hear the thwapping of her sulk. Among eleven-year-olds, girls are three times more likely than boys to express their anger in the form of a flamboyant snub. In addition, girls at thisage, more than boys, engage in a style of aggression called indirect aggression. Only among humans have males succeeded in stepping between a woman and a meal, in wresting control of the resources that she needs to feed herself and her children. Only among humans is the idea ever floated that a male should support a female, and that the female is in fact incapable of supporting herself and her offspring, and that it is a perfectly reasonable act of quid pro quo to expect a man to feed his family and a woman to be unerringly faithful, to give a man paternity assurance and to make his investment worthwhile.A number of historians have argued and the evidence strongly suggests, the first human slaves were women, and the impetus behind slavery was the possession of nubile wombs.We are all women with many pasts. We are old primates and neo-hominids. We feel drawn toward other women, we feel a need to explain ourselves to them and to impress them, and we run away from women, we disavow them, or we keep them around only until the real thing comes along. We can do each other mischief, even violence, nut we can do each other good as well. Both options are open to us, in the plastic opportunistic flow chart of our strategies and choices… What we women can’t do is to ignore each other. It is a man’s world, but our aggressions are women-centered, harsh and intimate.“If female sexuality is muted compared to that of men, then why must men the world over go to extreme lengths to control and contain it?” Barbara Smuts"
37,0385498411,http://goodreads.com/user/show/797975-kristen,4,"Wow. This book was pretty incredible. It was my first Natalie Angier book, but not my last! This book was much closer to what I was looking for when I read Barbara Ehrenreich's ""For Her Own Good."" Angier delves into what makes us women -- from the inside out and then back again -- with an empowering, no-nonsense, evidence-based approach. Where there is no evidence to cite, she does a great job of critiquing the mainstream theories that are based more on assumptions and stereotypes than on research. She manages to discuss a wide variety of topics in great depth and yet keeps the book moving forward as a cohesive tale as she ranges from ovaries, the clitoris, and hormones to breasts, aggression, and love.My favorite chapter was the one on strength (Cheap Meat: Learning to Make a Muscle), in which she talked about muscles and how they never go away. No matter how long we neglect them, it takes very little time to get muscle tone back and help support our frames. This was refreshing to hear after having read about all of the other things that decline in our bodies. But I think it stood out to me because she started it by saying: ""In all the years that I have been working out in gyms and lifting weights and preaching to other gals, with admitted obnoxiousness, about the glories of strength training, the commonest and most irritating response I have heard goes something like this: 'I wouldn't want to bulk up or look too muscular. I just want to get toned.'"" This passage resonated with me because this sentiment has irritated me for as long as I can remember. Back in high school, when, as a cheerleader, I could do more full-body-weight dips than any member of the football team, I would hear comments like this all the time. ""Be careful, you don't want to start looking like a boy."" ""Aren't you afraid that your arms are going to get too big?"" I have never been able to understand why strength is a liability and why visible muscles are anything other than beautiful and sexy. I was strong and I was damn proud of it. Now that I have lost a lot of that strength (I doubt I could do 2 consecutive dips or chin-ups these days), this chapter reminded me that it doesn't take long to get it back, and the benefits of working toward that goal are numerous. And women are strong. Our muscles might be hiding or might be underused, but we're strong and that's a good thing.My one big criticism of this book is that it's extremely heterocentric. As I read, I kept thinking of my lesbian sisters out there who would feel excluded from a book that is purportedly about all of us. And I think that's a shame. Angier was able to look critically at so many elements of the feminine experience that I know she could have grappled with the idea of women who have all the same parts but don't plan to share them with a male partner. There are some portions of the book that gloss over the idea of women (gay and straight) who don't choose to reproduce. But unfortunately the lesbian experience is largely absent and that's why I can only give this book 4 stars instead of 5."
38,0385498411,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1938363-kristi,4," 1 of 3 people found the following review helpful:  From fascinating facts to blatant speculation..., August 3, 2002  I was intensely interested in reading this book when it first came out, and finally got around to it. From the beginning, Ms. Angier makes it clear that yes, there is much scientific fact in the book, but much of it is also her wild speculations as to why certain things happen (in regards to women and the female body, of course). She herself refers to this book as a 'scientific fantasia of womanhood', and notes that she is 'scientifically and medically accurate where I can be, opinionated wher there is room for argument'. From that introduction, she goes on to cover the basics of a woman, in cells and ovaries and uterii and all our womanly parts...to our basic chemistry - genes and hormones and our similarities and differences to men (and non-human primates, for that matter). Then she moves on to emotions, love, attachments, and evolutionary biology. The writing style is at times funny, at other times ascerbic. At no time does the author talk down to you, yet the book is very easy to read and comprehend while still imparting valuable information and viewpoints.The book covers a wide range of subjects, but each chapter is well laid out and the book's progression feels very natural. Many of the facts about a woman's body were astounding, and I learned a great deal about how and why my body does certain things. When it came to the author's speculation and to breaking down old ways of thinking, at times I was cheering right along with the author's ideas - and other times I found myself shaking my head and thinking 'I don't agree with her opinion there'. Even in my disagreement though, I can usually see how she arrived at her conclusion.At times, I will admit that some of her opinions and speculations seemed a bit wild or out of touch, and just didn't set right with me. However, for the most part I found this book extremely informative and entertaining, and I believe that women and men alike would benefit from reading it. Unless biology is your profession, you'll definitely learn something new, and it will certainly challenge the old mental paradigms in relation to the sexes. Ms. Angier is not a ball-busting feminist by any means, but she certainly does stand up proud and strong in her beliefs, and I applaud her for it.  "
39,0385498411,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5528935-jason-palmer,3,"The first half of this book is extremely interesting and insightful. The next half is a rant about hormones and evolution that just does not fit at all with the title of the book. The second half should be another book titled: Female Primates and other Creatures such as Prairie Voles: An Uncomfortably Intimate Speculation. I’ve been thinking about probability a lot lately, and the first chapter was thinking right along with me on that front. When I stop and think, it seems that life is so unlikely it is amazing that anybody is ever born. So many things could go wrong. But the natural selection that happens just in the one generation that produces you is actually a huge process of winnowing down to only the fittest potential eggs. The female fetus starts out with 9 million eggs and the weakest of these are killed off until the toddler only has 400,000 left. Of these only 40 or so will actually be available for marriage with the sperm cell that was able to out swim the others. The probability of a healthy person being born is actually very high, because millions of potentially unhealthy people are killed off long before they ever have the chance of being born. It makes me feel special. I also liked the bit in one of the next few chapters that talked about how, if a woman loses one of her fallopian tubes for some weird reason, the other tube can actually reach across and grab the eggs from the opposite ovary. Alas, this is not a book for men who want to find out the Cosmopolitan magazine type secrets about women. In fact, I think this book is purposely man-proof, which is why I found most of it quite unpalatable. Even the grittiest scientific bits are written in such flowery, poetic, Ann of Green Gables, erudite slush that any real Nascar baseball cap wearing man would vomit after the first sentence he understood, if he were able to understand any (which is unlikely)."
40,0385498411,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1663818-rachel,4,"Although this text was published ten years ago, I found it to be very informative--although I don't regularly read in the field of biology, and I suspect there would be a lot to update in terms of what we understand about women's bodies. (This book was published before the human genome project was completed, after all.) Angier's rah-rah oversharing got uncomfortable at times (I really didn't need to hear about when she experiences her peak orgasms, for example.), but overall she presented the information in an engaging and intelligent way. The chapters on estrogen, menopause, and evolutionary psychology (and accompanying gender stereotypes) were the most interesting to me. Her discussion of all of the functions of estrogen served to debunk a lot of the myths I had held about the role of that hormone, not to mention testosterone. The chapter on menopause showed how much older women contribute to the well-being of the community's children (at least in a hunter-gatherer community), and her discussion of the problematic underlying assumptions around evolutionary psychology allowed me to revisit conversations I'd had in college with men and women who spouted those theories as gospel. I wish I had had the tools then to more effectively debunk their arguments. Better late than never, I suppose.Certainly Angier has inspired me to keep up with discoveries in women's health and to use that information to better understand how the human race functions and why it functions that way. "
41,0385498411,http://goodreads.com/user/show/71391-kelsey,4,"awesome book. a very unique, fun, informative read. she throws an incredible diversity of topics into 367 pages. within each chapter she presents a variety of theories explaining or discrediting something or another (female aggression, evolution of the clitoris, evolutionary psychology) leaving the reader (me!) sometimes confused and saying, but wait! where is my definitive answer?? but that is the great thing, she gives you so many things to consider and think about without claiming any one answer. that's not to say she doesn't pipe in with her own witty opinion quite often. ""The Icelandic singer Bjork recently complained about feminists. They really bugged her, she said. They whine about things not being equal and then men get all the breaks. She could understand that feeling for people of her mother's generation, or her grandmother's, but not now. Today the prison door is open, she insisted. All you have to do is walk out.Part of me was happy to hear her say that, to know that she sees the door as open and herself as a free and fiery primate. More of me thinks, Get thee to an optometrist, Lady Magoo, for thy pale eyes are boiled blind. Sure, the door may be open--for now--but it's kept open by the strength of a lot of blistered female fingers and female feet and the wedging in of a rounded female haunch or two..."""
42,0385498411,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9435018-heidi,3,"This book is an interesting read. Very informative. Not entirely my cup of tea (hence the 3 stars), but it's not a bad book.Would definitely recommend to friends. I skimmed through a couple of chapters because they bored me (a chapter about how hormones work and the final chapter). This book is really informative about how your body works when pregnant/breastfeeding, the different releases of hormones through your body that make you bond with the new baby instead of wanting to get rid of it (I must be lacking in that hormone because I do not want any babies. I like cats better), it's informative about why certain areas of women's bodies are more likely to get cancer (the uterus/breasts), and how we tend to stroke each other/pets at the same rate (40 strokes per minute). The parts I was interested in were well-written and easy to read. The parts I didn't much care about were kind of a bore. To be honest, though, this book was more entertaining than my 8th grade science education about the human body and more informative (although, you should take into account that in 8th grade, I was an ignoramous who didn't believe knowing how my menstrual cycle worked would have any bearing on my life)."
43,0385498411,http://goodreads.com/user/show/301455-peggy,5,"I've always enjoyed Angier's journalism and had bought a copy of this book maybe a couple years ago (?) and had it on my informal ""to-read"" list (which is comprised of the stack of books purchased but not yet opened). I saw my neighborhood coffee shop book club was reading it and pulled it out.I loved it.I learned more about how my body works (always new science out there, kids, so even if you think you know everything about ovaries, don't count on it), more about genetics and human development, more about the LACK of knowledge that underlies so much of medical treatment for women, that my head was swimming after finishing each chapter.Angier warns right up front that she will be inserting herself in an unjournalistic way into many of the subjects she is writing about, and she does, complete with bad puns and comments that sometimes slide across the line to total tweedom. But that's okay by me, I laughed quite a bit when reading this. She is, in some ways, an unreconstructed second-wave feminist (I have no idea of her age other than she has a young daughter)but never doctrinaire or didactic.Girls and women: read this book.

But owning books is the most efficient way for me to not read them, so I was excited to be isolated from my library books in China and give this one a try.There is a lot of interesting info in the book. Angier has a disclaimer in the beginning that she just kind of throws out theories, take them or leave them, and that is true - some seem more reasonable than others. The book says it is supposed to be shelved under feminism, not science, but the part I appreciated most was the strong evolutionary bio aspect - Why do human females, unlike other primates, have monthly periods, noticiable breasts, menopause, etc.? The more you try to answer these questions (and back it up with data) the more complicated it gets. I could have done without the Girl Power! feel that a lot of the book had. But on the other hand, I thought that this would make a great read for a teenage girl who needs a bit of that...one who is mature enough to be reading about the evolution of orgasms, I suppose. "

Yet I don't think I really like it all that much because the author is a evolutionary biologist and tries to explain everything by showing how women's bodies are a lot like female monkey's or have evolved from other type of animals. I just don't quite by into that. For me women's bodies were divinely designed by a wise and loving God, and the reason that they are as amazing and incredible as they are is because God made woman his crowing creation. Also, I'm not a fan of her writing style, very fully of awkward and long metaphors that end up sounding kind of ridiculous. Also, in a big long book about women's bodies she spends about 2 pages on pregnancy and women's ability to create human life and about 5 chapters of female sexuality. Obviously she feels that is the most important function of a woman's body and gives little attention to the most miraculous part of a woman's capabilities. I guess we are just different types of feminists. Still, I'm glad I read it and would recommend it to anyone who is interested in women's issues and women's health. "
47,0385498411,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2710511-amanda,4,"This book took me some time to sink into. Angier's writing style is chock full of five dollar words and references to literature, pop culture, and history. It is also breathtakingly lyrical. For the first few chapters, her exhortions seemed over the top, but either she settled down or I embraced it because I found myself really enjoying her enthusiasm as I progressed.Angier has a wry humor and often writes sarcastically, relying on the reader to pick up on the sly tone.The book focuses on female biology--organs, hormones, and ""evolutionary psychology"" all take starring roles. I learned lots of new information and even more probably went in one eye and out the other. Refreshing takes on the whole ""men are providers, women are faithful"" stereotype and biological fundamentals I'd never picked up anywhere else.

The back of my copy classifies it as ""Women's Studies/Health,"" which is accurate but doesn't quite cover everything this book has to offer. I would have added in something about the wealth of well-researched scientific knowledge it contains. In the prologue, Angier herself calls it a ""scientific fantasia of womanhood."" Although it's hard to describe exactly what that is, the thing that really separates this book from others, and what I think won it the Pulitzer, is that it provides knowledge while also capturing the wonder that I feel when learning about science. Maybe I should just stick to the effect that it has had on me. Quite simply, this book has changed my life. It's made me proud to be a woman, and that's not really something I would have said previously. I return to it again and again when I need refreshment or encouragement, or when I just want to feel more comfortable in my own skin. Thank you, Natalie. Happy International Women's Day."
49,0385498411,http://goodreads.com/user/show/19474932-ingeborg,2,"There is something disturbingly antifeminist about this book. There is also something in the tone of Angier’s writing that essentializes women deeply. She has a way of stereotypically approaching stereotypes that she wishes to dismantle! It smells of ideology – women’s power is in their bodies. Ok. And? How can we use it? Although some of the facts about women’s biology in this book are very interesting, I can see no point in the pure cataloguing of women’s biological advantages. Some interesting facts make it a 2 star book, otherwise it is laim read that made me angry at places, and the tone of her writing is really irritating. She wants to be funny, at places where jokes are completely unnecessary, and she keeps writing “us women” and addressing her readers as “sisters” which is something I cannot relate to. It was as if she was trying to somehow artificially connect to her readers. Definitely not my kind of feminism, but can it be called feminism at all? I think not. Can it be useful to women? I think not - but there are many different women out there ... "
50,0385498411,http://goodreads.com/user/show/852845-flan,4,"Written by a woman about women without referencing men for the most part. She is a witty writer that considers the physiology of women and how it has affected them in history up to the present. I can understand other women who reviewed who had a hard time with her dumb jokes. I took it as an attempt to keep the material approachable because there is physiology, anatomy, physiology which is not normal material in most people's nonfiction reading. To judge it without considering its place in history is a mistake. I do not see the value in pointing out her inability to see into the future and speak of women as if she were born after 2000. This is a continuing flaw of modern feminists. Instead of seeing every step women have taken as an important and necessary step, they fault those who came before for not being as brilliant as they are now. It is hard to see how we will form a continuum of females who stand up for all women no matter the era they are born in, how they self-define or what is their future potential. We can learn and advance together, despite bad jokes."

We wax toward ovulation, we wane with blood. The moon pulls us, it tugs at our wombs, even gives us our menstrual cramps. My dearest damas, do you ever feel like creeping out at night to howl at the full moon? Maybe so; the full moon is so beautiful, after all, partcularly when it's near the horizon and smeared slightly into buttery breastiness."""

In a world where pornography is increasingly monopolizing the imagery of the female body, the book is an eye-opening break from conventional discourse. It sheds light on the intelligence, beauty and powerfulness of the female body. The author tends to be too cheesy at times, however. Her attempt to place the woman's body in a positive light sometimes tends to be too desperate. In one chapter for example, she speaks of how the menestrual cycle activates women's sensory organs, turning them into Einsteins and Shakespeares every month (or something along these lines). I personally found this difficult to believe. Nonetheless, I recommend this book to every woman with no background on female biology. The book blends simple story-telling, with some intensely complicated science-a good read."
53,0385498411,http://goodreads.com/user/show/82490-stacy,3,"The writing is florid, sometimes overdone. But the facts are often fascinating. Did you know that an egg follicle can be up to an inch across before ovulation? That seems huge! Did you know that your ovaries are covered with scars from the egg released each month? Did you know that breast milk is actually modified sweat? And there are some animals who have no nipples - who nurse by licking the milk that rises to the mother's skin. Did you know that the female hyena gives birth through her clitoris? Wow. This is only a sample of what I've learned so far. The chapters on biology (our female organs) are more interesting for me than the chapters on chemistry (our female hormones). And I'm skimming the feminist hyperbole that pads in particular the chapters on aggression and love. Still, a worthwhile read."

The interesting information in the first half won it the extra star.Although I never liked her writing style, the information presented in the first half was well worth working through it. Within her disjointed text (which never found a way to accessibly present facts in a conversational tone) were pearls of knowledge about the body. Then, the second half got a little too preachy... and very illogical preachy at a lot of points. In frustration, while reading, I literally yelled at the book many obvious counterpoints and refutations to her ideas and comments. She had an preconceived point to make and did all she could to make her personal beliefs scientific fact and/or the logical choice.It's a shame. I was really excited about the book."

As I expected, reading books written by journalists is kind of tedious - a lot of extra, flowery writing. But Angier definitely knows what she's talking about from a science perspective.I was kind of surprised that the book spent so much time on the social implications of a woman's biology. That's definitely something that's probably gained from the journalist perspective over a strict biologist perspective. The social implications were definitely really interesting, but sometimes leaned towards being slightly preachy. And there was just one too many side rants about how menopausal women shouldn't be on hormone replacement therapy. Sorry, I just don't care as much as a perimenopausal woman about that subject..."

While I disagree with the author's take on evolution, I am glad that she celebrates what it means to be a woman. The book focuses more on broad strokes, which I generally appreciated, although it is worth noting that she occasionally fails to catch the nuance of certain topics. This is understandable, though, and it is nice to read an author who celebrates rather than denigrates and goes being mere clinical explanations. I found it helpful, although I found the first half more helpful than the second. The first focuses on the physical aspects of being a woman, and the second begins to explore more of the social aspects.That said, I appreciated that the author does not try to make sweeping statements about all women when it comes to behavior, but merely brings up questions and notes interesting points. I'm glad I read the book."

I guess the book seemed like it was trying way too hard to refute Paglia's opening chapter in 'Sexual Personae' (a piece of writing some part of me loves in theory, another part of me finding it rather dubious in practice). I admittedly didn't finish the book, and am writing this review several months after having attempted to do so, but the author's form of feminist critique seemed to follow the 'can too! why? because I said so! girl power!' school of thinking more than really trying to parse out and deal with gender realities. If I'm way off base, either disregard or, better than that, enlighten me. "

It's much more ""chatty"" than a textbook, and it is obviously geared more towards starting a conversation rather than educating you. In fact, you need to take this book with a grain of salt because the author mixes equal parts of her own opinions and theories with actual scientific research, and it's not always completely clear where one ends and the other begins. Nevertheless, it was still thought provoking and I learned at least a couple of things that I had never heard before. I also can't wait for my wife to read it so that I can ask her opinion about some of Angier's more, um, provocative theories."

However, I love this book, and keep coming back to it again and again for my personal biology questions. Natalie Angier, a science writer for the New York Times, discusses the biological and anthropomorphical origins of women's bodies, from our double-x chromosomes to our raging hormones. But this is not a science lesson. Rather than bog the reader down in charts and graphs, Angier leads you though a lot of studies and theories using her sharp wit and feminist tongue. I bought this book when it came out over eight years ago, and still pick it up from time to time. As women are such interesting creatures, ""Woman"" makes for a fascinating read."
61,0385498411,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7766143-rachel,5,"An intriguing examination of female biology: what we know, what we thought we knew, and what we still have no idea about.Almost every chapter led me to rave about a fascinating new idea. (Did you know that your cervix pulsates during orgasm, drawing semen inside? How pro-choice of your uterus! Or that theories on the evolution of the clitoris are based on a female being highly promiscuous to conceal the paternity of her children, therefore discouraging infanticide. Or that mammary glands are simply modified sweat glands and human children could survive on chimpanzee milk...)Occasionally, the author used overly flowery prose that I found distracting, but otherwise I HIGHLY recommend this book!"
62,0385498411,http://goodreads.com/user/show/29091931-sam,3,"Science that is driven by politics does not really deserve the name in my opinion. I found this book to be interesting and thought-provoking, but Angier's obvious willingness to allow her feminist views to inform her writing caused me to doubt the accuracy of every detail. ""A Study"" does not mean anything in the scientific world, but often, as here, forms the basis for any number of professions of faith. I would much prefer that she spend the first, say, three quarters of the book giving us thoroughly accepted current scientific thinking, and follow it with a few chapters on her interpretations and opinions. By mixing them together she left me bereft of what is, after all, the point of science: reliability."
63,0385498411,http://goodreads.com/user/show/36351218-nef-apps,5,"I personally really enjoyed the author's writing style and frankly enjoyed her good nature jabs at men, their testosterone rich adolescent behaviors and neanderthal thought processes. I learned a great deal about the biology, physiology and psychology of my life long pastime - women!On a very serious note, I would recommend this book be required reading for all high school students and teachers. It may well reduce teenage pregnancies and rapes, after all understanding and knowledge is the only way we'll ever learn to control our animal instincts or at least take on the animal behavior with full knowledge of what's driving it.NefP.S. in the ""too much information"" category - my partners are enjoying better sex as a result of my new found knowledge."

Angier is pro-woman and her biased opinion is not judgmental, but sympathetic. There is so much we don't learn about the female anatomy in school and Angier tries to fill in the spaces where science class left off. I say ""tries"" because we still live in a partriarchy and Angier admits that because no dieseases are correlated to certain parts of the female reproductive system, most scientists have neglected to study them beyond surface assesments. I recommend this book for men and women. It is a wonderful read and highly education for both sexes."

Lots of new and different thoughts about the current trend in evolutionary biology (books like ""The Moral Animal,"" etc.). A feminist take on the basic theory that women are attracted to power, men to youth. She points out some holes in the argument and makes the case that people are not just their biology. I will probably buy myself a copy of this book to keep on my shelf...Only reason I only gave it four stars is because I was occasionally irritated by her writing tone - but I can be picky that way."

I really enjoy reading Natalie Angier. She's smart, and her prose is smart and somewhat demanding without being intimidating. She doesn't dumb it down, but it's immensely readable at the same time. She's a bit snarky at times too, and she doesn't act like anyone, even herself, has all the answers. And did you know your organs produce chemicals similar to opiates and marijuana? I had no idea, and apparently the uterus produces about 10 times the amount of any other organ. Hmmmm...interesting. Great book."
67,0385498411,http://goodreads.com/user/show/697412-jessica,5,"Glorious. Nobody has a command of language like Natalie Angier. She’s like a master chef who peppers her prep with knife tricks and tosses, not because they’re necessary, but because they are so easy and fun for her. It seems like every paragraph has a linguistic gem, and that’s just frosting on the already amazing content. This book is thorough, fascinating, and an absolute joy to read. (Previous review: I'm halfway through and have been reading it for a year. I don't know what's taking so long because it is glorious. I think it should be required reading in Health classes in high school. =))"

This gets 5 stars for fascinating content-- I learned so many things about my own body that I never thought possible. Angier is opinionated and forthcoming about the fact that her book is biased toward a feminist viewpoint, and that many theories she throws out there may be questionable. I appreciated her honesty and enjoyed her willingness to conjecture just to put different points of view out there on the fuzzier edges of science where there are still a lot of unanswered- and unasked- questions. I would recommend this to any woman- especially if you are contemplating having children."
69,0385498411,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2429240-lauren,4,"This book is a must-read for every woman, and I think especially every young woman. Angier does an incredible job of painting what can at times seem more like a liability than an asset as something to be treasured and celebrated by every person born a woman. The factual information is good and her connections with history and mythology prove enriching and useful to the book. Angier takes what we have learned in health class and not only expands upon it, but makes us feel special for having it. I agree with the review on the back cover that ""everyone living in or near a female body should read this book."""

Perhaps even for an interesting and scholarly work on how and why women's bodies behave. Alas, she had to burst my bubble. I know we're awesome, I don't need to hear how the world couldn't exist without us or any of the other obvious ideas. Also, it is inconceivable to procreate without men. But, the information contained in the midst of the blabber is so very very interesting, and I do believe there is no other book that has compiled this kind of information. So I will continue to read it, shaking my head."

It started out really lovely and interesting, but after a while I got tired of the author going on and on and on about some body part or something. The poetic language makes it interesting and often more digestible, but sometimes it's just too much. Not everything is fantastic and inspiring and deep.I did learn quite a bit from the book, however. There's a lot of interesting science, though it's mixed in with loads and loads of opinion. Some chapters were more interesting than others. Ultimately, I don't think women know much about themselves, and this book can certainly counteract that."

She does so in a way that is situated in contemporary culture while remaining fantastically sensual and intense page to page. I particularly enjoy the way she explores her own personal relationships with her anatomy, to share stories about the interconnectedness of body and mind and this relationship as it is affected by (and engaged with) society as a whole. I highly recommend this book to anyone seeking to drink deeply from a well of knowledge about the female body through every stage of a woman's life."
73,0385498411,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3274122-nicholas-martinez,5,"Natalie presents a scientific and charismatic story of the female with care to celebrate physiology, femininity, and uncertainty. Bra-burners beware, but she is not at all apologetic with her demand for academic and societal recognition of the female as human, before wife or mother or daughter or virgin. Natalie retains her scientific and professional integrity while baring the baselessness of foundational institutions in our social consciousness--a rare talent in these politically charged times. This is a much needed addition to the literature as we examine cultural traditions and beliefs to shed the fiction from fact."

Her book is chock full of amazing anecdotes about super sexual apes, aggressive little girls, and weight-lifting 70-year-old ladies.Some surprising facts from her book:(1) Women in hunter-gather societies contributed more calories to family meals than men.(2) Both male chimps and female chimps have multiple partners. (3) The clitoris has twice as many nerve endings as the penis. This book is exuberant, wise, and incredibly funny. I'm sure I'll return to this book at different points in my life. "

She is clearly passionate about her subject matter, and injects a lot of personality into this comprehensive overview of female biology. She explores the how and why of eggs, breasts, hormones, sexuality, lifespan and more from biological, evolutionary, and social angles.

After some initial hesitation and complaints everyone gave very positive reviews.Now, this book is not an easy read. The author is often pedantic and annoyingly self indulgent, but her writing is accessible and she does make some great points. i would suggest reading this book on a chapter-a-night schedule to allow for the inevitable rumination as well as mitigation of ire."

There are parts that are a bit difficult to get through for someone without a great science background, but the knowledge you gain is SO worth the work. Angier really celebrates being a woman and is a fabulous writer. Reading this book is like having a professor who is really excited about what they're teaching and you can't help but buy in to their enthusiasm for the subject and want to learn more. "
78,0385498411,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1324168-michelle,4,"I liked this book and I think I learned a lot. For me, the shortcomings are that the metaphors are often way over the top and there are lots ranty bits that are more about the authors personal opinions than about anything scientific or objective. It deals with a huge variety of topics, from oddly varied perspectives: biological, sociological, evolutionary, anecdotal. A lot of it is about women's reproductive health, seen from the perspective of a middle aged woman. So nothing about birth control and lots about estrogen replacement treatments. "
79,0385498411,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2088050-michelle,3,"I really, really liked this book for the first four chapters; after that, I think it was just too much. The author is hilarious, which is a real plus when you're discussing the particulars of female anatomy and physiology and its socio-political implications. The book brings up many interesting, debateable topics (with a decidedly humanist-feminist tone); perhaps it was because so many of these issues were left open-ended that I found the book, in the end, not completely satisfying. But worth reading, nonetheless, particularly for women or people who are frequently around women... "
80,0385498411,http://goodreads.com/user/show/878571-susan,5,"This was a really fascinating read. Angier is fierce, funny, and erudite. She writes playful, engaging prose and explains scientific concepts, all without any visible effort. (I started reading this and Catherynne Valente's book at the same time, which is probably why Valente's work struck me as being so strained, while Angier in comparison made it look easy.)I would love to see an updated version of this, but most of the information is still relevant. Sadly, there have been few changes in the overall attitude of the health care system towards women and women's needs."

She takes her reader on a spirited and humorous journey of discovery. "
82,0385498411,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8742-alisa,5,"Whenever I told anyone the title of the book, they were confused on its content. It's a book about female biology--and not staid biological determinism. I just finished it and I want to immediately start it again. She challenges so many male/female stereotypes, and does it so poetically. If the phrase ""scientific fantasia of womanhood"" piques your interest, you must go out and read it. She has amassed an amazing amount of studies on the supposed gender wars. My only complaint is that she doesn't have as much to say about queer women, but the book can only be so long."

My main issue was a misunderstanding of what Ms Angier hoped to accomplish in her volume. When I began reading, I thought I was picking up a pop science book about the majesty of woman’s body, scientifically examined. That is not what this is. After a hundred pages, I realized that this is a personal view of women as written by a journalist with a background in science. Too political, too opinionated. I just didn't like the author's voice in this at all."

""Woman"" is also a great book. I learned a ton of new information, plus came to understand better things I thought I already knew. Some of the stats/science in this book is a bit dated, so keep that in mind as you're reading certain sections (e.g., hormones) and fact-check anything you have a question about. But don't let the publication date stop you from reading this book! There is plenty in here that's still good and current science. I wish Angier would write a follow-up."

An exploration of what it means to be a woman from a physiological perspective. Angier writes in a witty, conversational style - not condescendingly, but in a way that keeps the reader willing to stick with her through some pretty hard-core biological stuff. Just as importantly, she talks about the psychology of women and how we relate to our bodies and their sometimes mysterious ways. I'm looking forward to sharing thoughts with Ann, Teresa and Sari and will continue reading. "
86,0385498411,http://goodreads.com/user/show/12369745-david,5,"An excellent book. This book is not written by a professional researcher, and she admits early on that new data from the big HRT study changes some of what she presented. I really enjoyed all I learned, and I was left with as many questions about what it means to be a woman, or a man for that matter, than when I started, but that's the fun part. I found the author did an excellent job discussing neurology, hormones, physiology, psychology all quite well, and very clearly.

The chapters on the endocrine system and pregnancy are especially informative. The second half of the book is an extensive rant about feminism and — Ms Angier's bête noir — evolutionary psychology.

This was such an excellent read, and I have been recommending it left and right. It's essentially a book about female anatomy, but it is not an anatomy book; it does not read like a textbook, in a clinical way. Angier is funny and opinionated, and included a serious appeal for feminism toward the end, that I really appreciated. I learned a lot, and highlighted a lot.

92,0385498411,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1008761-ashley,4,"Finally re-read and finished this book. A fascinating and very readable book on women's bodies. I especially l liked the revelation that stroking a persons skin at a rate of 40 beats per minute releases oxytocin- this is also the rate at which the average baby suckles, which also releases oxytocin, and is also the rate at which the uterus spasms during orgasm. Forty beats per minute, the rhythm of love. "
93,0385498411,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2332220-gabrielle,4,"This is a surprising ""science"" book (it is full of scientific fact but it probably wouldn't get shelved there.) It's informative but written in a poetic style that is not at all dry or boring. I learned new things about my body by reading it. This is the kind of book you can go back to and read in sections now and then. I reread the chapter on building strength whenever I need to get motivated to work out or start a new exercise regime."
94,0385498411,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4432205-brady-dale,5,"I read this book once, I don't know how many years ago, and I still find myself remembering bits from it. Her writing is almost too exquisite, but she has a right. She's very good. I think this book is amazing. I think her objection to suitcases with rollers is a bit silly, but it gives the book character.I'm new Male-Feminist-Super-Lefty, but I freaking loved this book and thought it a high work of high art. "
95,0385498411,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3903502-clare,4,"In Woman, Natalie Angier presents dozens of gem-like ideas about the female body to counter the evolutionary biology she’s so sick of and help women to understand and celebrate their bodies. It can get a bit dry when it deals with hormones and it does lack an chapter on transwomen, but it’s a book that I think definitely benefits cisgendered women, helping us redefine our bodies away from a male perspective."
96,0385498411,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3143351-libby,4,"fascinating. offers up contrasting theories for why humans menstruate, when in human history the patriarchy got underway (complements Jared Diamond nicely), what estrogen can be responsible for, female aggression, and good discussions on breast-feeding, hormone replacement therapy in menopause, and the evolution of the clitoris. Her style isn't my favorite - very descriptive, at times ornate, reminds me of Diane Ackerman, or maybe Rachel Carson. But it's better than being too dry. "
97,0385498411,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1952609-bea,5,"I don't know why, but I thought I would not like this book. Well, I was wrong. I really enjoyed it - lots of interesting information written in an easy to read style. I learned stuff about my body. I also learned more about how to think about the crappy articles that clog up the popular press about the differences between men and women. I know a lot of that stuff is crap, but reading this book will help me articulate it better! "
98,0385498411,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7484829-teresa-cairns,0,"I found this book in a little shop in Greenwood. I love Angier's writing style - warm and humorous, suffuse with the wisdom of a Jewish grandmother, who happened to study psychology and anatomy. I wish the prof of my Psychobiology of Women class had recommended this as part of the course readings. It's the book for those of us who read Our Bodies, Ourselves as we waited in the county free clinic for our checkup and birth control pills. "
99,0385498411,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10287523-kate,5,"I really enjoyed this book, and wish I'd read it earlier. Even though I'm a science geek, I learned a lot of science form this book...particularly in the areas of genetics and embryology. However, don't think this is only a science book! Natalie Angier is a Pulitzer Prize winner, and it shows. As the back cover states, Angier ""offers optimistic alternatives and transcends feminist polemics with an enlightened subversiveness that makes for a joyful, fresh vision of womanhood."""
100,0385498411,http://goodreads.com/user/show/30467686-sirr-tahirah,1,"HATE IT! She is an awful writer, way too opinionated and judgemental. I dislike her intensely and hope to never be forced to read her work again. I felt I was mulling through judgemental, sarcastic, and bad attitude female author. I stopped reading it at some point, and despite that earned a good grade in the class. I found little science in her book, and way too much opinion than I was comfortable with."
101,0385498411,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1268527-jerianna,4,"I didn't like this one as much as I enjoyed The Canon (which I bought) but it was really interesting, and there were a lot of good things in it. She is pretty ""In your face"" about things that she believes, and quite feminist, but worth reading. I just had to filter a little baloney.I think I'll blog later about this author and some others like her. She's an amazing author, funny and informative."
102,0385498411,http://goodreads.com/user/show/176889-jess,4,"This book is so wonderful for anyone that has a vagina... or anyone who loves vaginas. It goes through various parts of the womans body and inner workings (eggs, breasts, orgasms, vulvas, and much much more) and breaks things down so that every woman can know exactly what it going on in our own bodies. Angier is one sassy broad. "
103,0385498411,http://goodreads.com/user/show/90755-julie-bell,4,"This is a fascinating book. It is a good blend of technical details and personal experience from differing perspectives. The craftsmanship of our bodies is awe inspiring. My favorite quote is 'We're a good egg, each and every one of us'; this is after a long discourse on the likelihood off any one egg being eligible for fertilization."
104,0385498411,http://goodreads.com/user/show/350125-anita,4,So far I love it! Angier takes the woman's body and breaks it down to the chromosome. She explains the functionality of the body in the most poetic terms and defines how cultural bias has influenced the research and ultimately placed stereotypes on our gender. Very interesting and more entertaining than taking a semester of Biology. 
105,0385498411,http://goodreads.com/user/show/126950-robynne,5,"Angiers dives into the wondrous mysteries of the female body, from a scientific perspective that is heavily opinionated. Ladies, get ready to be amazed at the incredible inner workings of your beautiful bodies! Gentleman, prepare to be jealous that you're just not as cool as we are from the X-chromosome on up."
106,0385498411,http://goodreads.com/user/show/540436-rebekah,5,"I read this book first in college, then reread it recently. It has different meanings at different stages in my life. I think all women should read it at least once. It's really fascinating. I enjoyed the first half that dealt with biology more than the second half, which seemed to be more of a polemic. But it is all still worth reading."
107,0385498411,http://goodreads.com/user/show/299018-camille,3,"I would like to correct Paul, I had already read this book before we met, then reread it at his suggestion. It is interesting, but slightly OTT on some topics for my taste. I can still honestly say that I enjoyed it both times I read it and may have to pull it off the shelf for another perusal - it's been about 3 years since I last picked it up. "
108,0385498411,http://goodreads.com/user/show/614201-laura,5,"An excellent read. It is very entertaining to read from cover to cover, but just in the few months since I finished it, I've referred to it a number of times. So it's also turning out to be quite a good reference book. I have a new appreciation for my body since reading Ms. Angier's fascinating and funny and enlightening exposition of the female anatomy."
109,0385498411,http://goodreads.com/user/show/840719-joanna,4,"I'm currently reading this book as an adjunct to my Biology of Women class. It's heavy on the science, but an enjoyable read. Angier definitely writes in favor of women, not as an ""afterthought"" of man. It helps to be familiar with the ""science of women"" to get through some of the heavier science-parts, but being a National Book Award winner, I'm sure she touches a lot of people. "
110,0385498411,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1195000-vivalachlo15,5,"Fucking amazing. amazing amazing AMAZING! a book about everything you could ever want to know about a woman's body--very scientific but written to entertain, amaze, and enchant :) natalie angier is the BEST science writer out there-her way of writing about science and the world is extremely poetic :)"
111,0385498411,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1200578-emily,4,"Extremely interesting & I love the way Natalie Angier writes science, but unfortunately a few of the things that made me go, ""wow! really?!"" I later found out are probably not true... But read it!! It's at least a starting point that might make you really think about why things are the way they are. Just do a little homework when you're done."
112,0385498411,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1313669-claudia,5,"A wonderful reference book for women, that should be on every woman's shelf. I enjoyed learning about the female body and why certain anatomy is where it is, and the theories behind the role of the grandmother. I find science fascinating, but only when it's explained in a way that I can visualize in order to understand."
113,0385498411,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1590441-stacy,4,"A completely readable tour of the female anatomy & physiology. There were moments of hippie-ish, earth mother worship that I couldn't get fully on board with. However, if I had a dozen of those eye-rolling moments, I had a dozen more where I cheered and felt deep kinship with the author in a shared sentiment about some aspect of womanhood."
114,0385498411,http://goodreads.com/user/show/32243-mim,4,"This book was very interesting. So many facts! Some of the things the author notes in the book have changed since it was written, which was kind of interseting, also. There were some parts that were dense with information and slow reading. However, very worth the time. There was so much that I didn't know about myself!"
115,0385498411,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1184842-adrienne,3,"What a unique writing style. She blends fact with metaphor and back again. If only textbooks were written like this...Nearly gets four stars but suffers from length, dull sections, wandering prose, and lack of structure. Still she will have you rethink most things about womanhood and I am all in favour of navel gazing in solidarity."
116,0385498411,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2617486-barrett,4,"I'm really enjoying this book - so beautifully written and so singularly and wonderfully focused on women. It's not without its own grand leaps of deduction, but very enjoyable. However, as I navigate my own chemistry and biology, I find myself not able to focus on it objectively. I will come back to it! "
117,0385498411,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4833878-gail,3,"So far I am enjoying the scientific information provided and the bios about women involved in each chapter. However, I don't like the author's rambling writing style and the volume of personal opinion and speculation tossed into each chapter. She could really have condensed the information to make a much more powerful book, in my opinion. "
118,0385498411,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1530494-aja,2,"I really liked this book to begin with but had a hard time continuing on with it. The writing style got a little hard to follow and seemed to become more and more written for a scientific audience, which was maybe the intent all along. A lot of good information, that should maybe be presented just a little differently to attract a wider audience."
119,0385498411,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1122979-beryl,3,"This is a book that I should have read 30 some years ago. Reading it now, I felt that she belabored women's sexuality to the point of boredom. Angier is witty, and extremely knowledgeable, yet those gifts failed to keep me engrossed. I found that I had to leap around, take different sections at different times, hoping she'd deal with more than our wombs and ovaries."
