Many scientists look up to the author of this book like Oliver Sacks. You just say “Luria” and their faces will be lit up. The book is a case study of, a story of somebody referred to as “s” who could remember everything he’s told without effort or straining. Interestingly, words can have smells, tastes, etc. each word had the effect of summoning up in his mind a graphic image, and those images of words were incomparably more vivid and stable than those in other people’s minds. The images in the mind of Mr “s” were invariably linked with synthetic components (sensations of colored “splotches”, “splashes”, and “lines”) which reflected the sound structure of a word and the voice of the speaker (P.30). The visual quality of his recall was fundamental to his capacity for remembering words. When he heard or read a word it was converted right away into a visual image that corresponded with the object the word signified for him. Once he formed an image, which was always of a particularly vivid nature, it stabilized itself in his memory.I believe that there is a lot we can learn from that as we work on our ability to recall stuff we’re learning or trying to remember in general."

It's interesting that Luria focused on S's vast memory and made S""s synesthesia almost an afterthought.  The book is good reading whether one is interested in memory per se or not. It gives the flavor of early neuroscience by one of its pioneers."

Hence it would be impossible to comprehend the subjectivity of the protagonist(Writer made great efforts to make him as lively as possible). But this book can push you to expand your horizon to problem-solving. It will push you to see problems in a very different light. How you can practice visual memory to see the world differently. To synthesis synesthesia in you. more importantly, the great product that you are accidentally created by existence."
4,0674576225,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1687185-mari,5,"I loved this book. Quite a fast read. It not only discusses S.'s memory capabilities, but the synesthesia that plays such a big part in how S. remembers. Luria also discusses, with great sensitivity, the effect such a gifted memory has on S.'s personality, and explores the limitations that S. experiences as a result of the way his mind works. A fantastic read for those interested in memory, as well as in synesthesia."
5,0674576225,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8482935-cm,2,"This short book is Soviet psychologist A.R. Luria's case study of Mr S whose memory is so vast that he can perfectly recall long lists of items YEARS after he first remembered them. His secret is synaesthesia:To this day, I can't escape from seeing colors when I hear sounds. What first strikes me is the color of someone's voice. Then it fades off...for it does interfere. If , say, a person says something, I see the word; but should another person's voice break in, blurs appear. These creep into the syllables of the words and I can't make out what of being said.  I would say about 80% of this book is filled with these reflections of Mr S telling us how he remembers and the way his thought process differs from ours, with Luria's commentary setting his account into chapters and sections. While it's a readable case study about an one-of-a-kind memory (plus all the credit for founding a new genre for humanistic clinical history!), Professor Luria's writing and his approach, to a reader of our time, may seem plain and ordinary."
6,0674576225,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8776142-tim,4,"Starting in the 1920's Luria began to study ""S."" a subject who had a seemingly limitless capacity to memorize numbers, words, nonsense sounds, etc. Once memorized, S can recall a list after years. Luria worked with S through the 20's and 30's to unlock the secrets of his remarkable ability, and also to understand the impact this talent had on his perception and understanding of the world and his personality and self-control. S has the rare condition of synesthesia by which experience is encoded in multiple sensory pathways. For him, sounds have distinct colors and visual imagery and the wrong music can clash with the taste of a meal. The visual images he forms are extremely vivid and particular and he memorizes lists by encoding each item into images which he stores on the fly. However, this faculty has its downside. S finds metaphor and abstract concepts extremely challenging. Poetry is almost inaccessible to him. He is confused by the clash and confusion vivid, unrelated images that arise when words are used with double meaning. His powerful visual imagination allowed him extraordinary control over autonomic responses such as body temperature, pulse and the like. But the boundary between the visual imagery of his imagination and reality was often be nebulous and he was prone to distraction that could border on split personality.The Mind of a Mnemonist anticipates the later work of Oliver Sacks and is a short, rewarding book."

Between Hebrew, Yiddish, and Russian, the translation and footnotes were very well done. This book has been on my to-read list since 2008 and I've FINALLY managed to find a copy earlier this year (seriously, uoft robarts didnt have it, i checked). A lot of the information was redundant since I've read a lot about synesthetic savants over the years, but it's always good to trace it back to the source. A great extra read if you liked The Man Who Tasted Shapes or The Man Who Mistook His Wife For a Hat. It's a short and smooth read, and I'm very grateful for Luria to take a gamble back in the day and publish this ""little book""."

It delves into painstaking granular detail of one individual case study.

11,0674576225,http://goodreads.com/user/show/12204861-kjpout,4,"What a fascinating read! The over 90-year old story of the mnemonist Solomon Shereshevsky is both gripping and sad. A man that on the other hand can at any time go back to his childhood and remember his mother as he saw her as a baby (""good"" and ""safe""), but on the other hand cannot read or listen to anything without being assaulted by a tide of images due to his synesthesia. Ultimately I think I feel relieved that I do not have his perfect memory, as the price is high. The book is structured more like a summary presentation of the results of the 30-year study of Luria than an actual book. What really emerges from the text is the very humane and personal relationship Luria had with his object of study, Shereshevsky. Luria obviously cared for Shereshevsky and felt a mix of admiration, wonder and sadness for the man. I can understand and feel the same. To paraphrase Luria (of Shereshevsky): ""He had a family - a lovely wife and a successful son... but it was difficult to see which one for him was more real: the imaginary world he lived in, or the real world where he was but a temporary guest.""What an extraordinary individual. What I cannot help but wonder having finished the book is whether Solomon Shereshevsky himself felt blessed or cursed as he was. Perhaps the question never occurred to him."
12,0674576225,http://goodreads.com/user/show/23860903-tariq-mir,3,"This little book is an unusual resource in that it documents a prodigious mnemonist from the early 20th Century throughout his life. While it is not a comprehensive book on the how, it is nonetheless a deals with the day to day details of having such an ability.It is a fair thing to say that most people would like to have better memories, but S. (a mnemonic for the actual person!) felt like it was more of a curse than a blessing. He found it impossible to ""turn it off"" and therefore was cast under its spell like opening a Pandora's Box that couldn't be closed. He became an observer of the process more than a participant.There are several things to learn from this. One must be careful of what one decides to create using one's imagination as the world could become so altogether all embracing that as an observer its easy to lose oneself in its dream. In real life something similar happens in the sense that we create realities all the time in our minds - so complex and elaborate, in fact, that we are unable to escape from them. In this attempt at escaping reality (whatever that is!) we often become prisoners of it. There seems to be no way out - or is there? Many individuals when they get to a point in their lives experience a form of anamnesis, a loss of forgetfulness when everything makes sense at a deeper soul level. this is unfinished and a draft atm."
13,0674576225,http://goodreads.com/user/show/17254970-brandon-barton,5,"I'm glad I finally got around to reading this pioneering classic of neuropsychology, which dovetailed nicely after reading ""Born on a Blue Day."" While these two books are very similar patient cases, this book is written in more objective manner, while ""Blue"" is written by the subject himself. I can see how Dr. Sacks got his inspiration from this type of approach, combining descriptions of not only the quality of the mind but also the personality, behavior, and inner world of the patient (deduced more logically from the patient's own statements). There is some repetition of ideas but this is helpful to reinforce Dr. Luria's conclusions, he leads you along his path of speculation and you feel like you are making sound conclusions while standing at his side. "
14,0674576225,http://goodreads.com/user/show/77280413-dillon,5,"Regardless of the slight awkwardness that can come with translation from Russian to English, I found that this book read well and accessibly. That of course means accessible to myself, a High Schooler with limited knowledge of the subject matter. This book didn't lose me as a reader by using the Academic English Vernacular. Rather, it presents images that are relatively complex in terms which allow someone of my relatively low standing to understand the message. Not only did the author present concepts in a way that was easily graspable, he did so while acknowledging the limitations of his studies and his field. By dropping that possible pretense found elsewhere in academic writing, particularly scientific writing of one's own work, he was able to write an enduring book."
15,0674576225,http://goodreads.com/user/show/36404945-chaitalee-ghosalkar,4,"The phenomena presented through this book itself fetches it a four star rating. We have all heard about mnemonics, perhaps even made use of it during school/college days to remember difficult content. But to read about the life of a person whose whole life comprises of it is fascinating. The author tries to explain how things are perceived by the subject S, how he sees words/numbers and everything else through pictures, and while things are explained lucidly, it is incomprehensible to understand the entire lifespan of a person to be spent in this manner."

The upside of this gift seems great until you realize it's actually a liability. Because he couldn't forget all the tiny details, his mind was drowning in things that didn't matter. So he could repeat back every word in a novel but the meaning of it would be lost on him. Which meant he couldn't really appreciate the arts, literature, etc. "

Now I can ruin dinner by reciting trivia from two neurologists; enjoy!Anyway: I’ve got an average memory, minimal synthesia (limited, I swear, to “hearing” GIFs), and a substandard ability to think in images and not words—so much of the mind of the mnemonist of course seemed foreign. But I was surprised at how much else in Luria’s account of his subject’s life was recognizable as merely exceptionally intense instances of universal dilemmas: for example, the impossibility of deliberate forgetting and the fraught relationship between imagination and inaction. And I certainly relate to this:

Details which other people would overlook, or which would remain on the periphery of awareness, took on an independent value in his mind, giving rise to images that tended to scatter meaning.

At least now when I get stuck on a word in a manual I can be grateful I’m only contending with its definition and not also its shape and color and taste and sound. It could be worse! It could always be worse!"
25,0674576225,http://goodreads.com/user/show/964148-gloria,3,"A nerdy read and read for a nerdy reason.Was a follow-up to the Oliver Sacks memoir; he wrote of Luria frequently, and I thought I should read one of Luria's cases.... a short famous one....."
26,0674576225,http://goodreads.com/user/show/82829-abeer-hoque,4,"In this book, Dr. A. R. Luria writes about S, a man with a limitless memory, or at least one that couldn't be measured. S used a system of visual and geographic iconics to remember everything he came across. Everything. Synesthesia only deepened this ability of his, adding taste, smell, touch, and sound to his astoundingly detailed visual memories. ""Presented with a tone pitched at 30 cycles per second and having an amplitude of 100 decibels, S stated that at first he saw a strip 12-15cm in width the colour of old, tarnished silver. Gradually this strip narrowed and seemed to recede; then it was converted into an object that glistened like steel. Then the tone gradually took on a colour one associates with twilight, the sound continuing to dazzle because of the silvery gleam it shed.""Interestingly, S had a poor memory for faces and voices. People tend to single out certain features to identify others, but since S found it nigh impossible to generalise, everything - emotions, context, expressions - fluctuated from encounter to encounter and he found it hard to pin down a person. “There are people whose voices change constantly... twenty to thirty times in the course of a day. Other people don’t notice this, but I do.”His imagination and powers of visualisation were in many ways a super power. In addition to his feats of memory, S could control his heart beat, body temperature, even his feelings of pain and discomfort. In some cases, he proved capable of seeing better in the dark. But they also interfered with his perception of reality as he often couldn't distinguish between the two, his inner life as vivid and perhaps more real than the real. As with Dr. Luria's ""opposite"" book ""The Man with the Shattered World"" I wished there was more science, more psychology, more analysis, more brain talk interspersed with the case study reports. And the last chapter - about how sensory and psychological excesses (or deficiencies) affect personality development and interaction - is the most interesting, and unfortunately, the shortest:""Psychology has yet to become a science that is capable of dealing with the really vital aspects of human personality. It has yet to learn to depict the nature of personality in such a way that the function of each individual trait could be seen in its relation to the total personality structure.""I'm not sure whether we'll ever get there, but I'll keep reading, Dr. Luria."
27,0674576225,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1950709-derek-davis,4,"A heartfelt study of an amazing man who could recall virtually anything he had experienced—without fading over time. ""S.,"" the unnamed subject of psychologist Luria's multi-decade study, was a synesthete (a person who combines/confuses senses, as in tasting a sound) who could recall any sequence of numbers or sounds (words or nonsense syllables) and accurately recall them years later.Luria was especially interested in how S. saw and interacted with the world—how his strange condition augmented and interfered with his perception and handling of reality. S.'s experiencing of everything he read, heard or otherwise took in depended on his involuntary creation of imagery, mostly visual but also tactile and auditory, that he would recall as a ""journey"" through a remembered landscape. This approach both enabled him to rapidly solve problems that might stump a verbally-dependent mind, but also interfered with his comprehension of abstract ideas and poetry. The book includes numerous quotes from S. describing his approach to memory and reality.The book has several problem areas, especially for a non-Russian reader:1) Many of S.'s examples of his recall mechanism depend on the specific sounds and meanings of Russian words, and the translation is clunky at best, with little creative flexibility.2) S.'s attempts to explain what he's ""seeing"" in his head are often unclear and confusing.3) Luria, though concerned and compassionate, is limited by both his own rationalist mind and the narrow scope of psychology of the time (1930s-60s). He sees S.'s personal approach to the world as more extreme in some areas than it will appear to many readers, especially S.'s use of imagery.A fascinating read."
28,0674576225,http://goodreads.com/user/show/86362-amar-pai,5,"M, the patient described in this book, has unbelievable memory. He experiences synesthesia, seeing 5 as ""red"" and smelling/tasting/feeling 5 in every sensory way.People tested M by giving him some random sequence of numbersthat they'd then put away. 5 or 10 years later, if asked hecould still recall the exact sequence of numbers!It might seem like heaven to have a ""photographic memory,"" more recently known as ""eidetic memory."" Think of how great it would be if you didn't forget stuff! In fact, it turned out that M. was basically incapable of functioning like a normal human being. He couldn't complete the simplest tasks and for all intents and purposes was retarded. It seems that forgetting is a crucial part of memory. We have to have some way to let go of unneeded information or else our minds would drown in a profusion of distracting details. In order to efficiently process your environment, you have to be able to drop all the irrelevant stuff and focus clearly. This is all just coming from a hazy recollection of reading this book in my cogsci Memory class back in the day. The class was pretty frustrating because it became apparent that cog scientists don't know very much about memory. There are some basic things like 7+-2, cocktail party phenomenon, etc. But they're basically postulating a bunch of structures at the cognitive level that may or may not exist, and couldn't be directly tested anyway.From the neuro end things look more promising.TODO: read In The Palaces of Memory, supposed to be great pop sci book that covers the work of neuroscientists seeking to uncover memory's biological substrates & mechanisms"

In particular, it discusses his unique mental processes, how they help him remember things, and how they hindered other aspects of his life.Warning: ""spoilers"" below this point.The book begins with a description of his amazing memory, which seems to have been completely limitless. He could remember random strings of numbers, characters, syllables, etc., just by looking at them for a while and committing them to memory. Once he had done that, he had near-perfect recall of the entire sequence for the rest of his life. His memory was based on his strong synesthesia [1], which allowed him to remember random numbers, syllables, or words as images in his mind. He constructed elaborate, complex scenarios in his mind corresponding to the sequences, and by replaying the scenario in his head later, he would be able to recall the sequence.The synesthesia and amazing recall came at a price: he had an extremely hard time mentally representing abstract concepts like ""nothing"", or understand idioms like ""to weigh one's words"", since he had such strong mental images associated with the words and their literal meanings that he had to work hard to force himself to accept the figurative or abstract meaning. The book also discusses his personality and problem-solving abilities at length.It's a fairly short read, and an interesting account of extreme variability in a mind: I'd recommend reading this book if you're interested."

Of course, S. has problems that bother him only, namely forgetting, but he does pretty well for all that.Luria is introduced to S. in the 1920s and follows him for around 17 years or so. There seemed to be no limitations to his memory capacity, so Luria became bored with that sort of thing, and began asking how he did these things, and what his methods were.S., whose name is never disclosed, was a synesthete. He had a marvelous visual memory and saw everything in images. Though this may be seen as a good thing in some cases, S. did not have a filter to determine what was important and relevant. He remembered everything that he was told. S. also did not have any way to visualize vague things like ideas and concepts. Words suggested images and these got him lost in such things as poetry. So initially he would take walks and use the memory palace method in his mind. Once he became a mnemonist, he needed a better way to recall things, so he started to make a visual shorthand.In any case, this book was a quick read and quite enjoyable."

He could memorize long strings of words or numbers in a few moments time and recall them perfectly not just minutes later but even YEARS later.His mind created VIVID images associated with every word he heard or read, but he also experienced them with other senses. His synesthesia meant that when he heard a word he also ""saw"" its shape and texture in patterns of lines, splashes, or fogginess, and he ""tasted"" the sound of each word, too. He was unable to grasp the concepts of synonymns, because (to him) it was ludicrous to suggest that two words with completely different ""colors,"" ""tastes,"" or ""textures"" could possibly represent similar (much less the same) meanings. Homonyms also confused him, because to assign two or more absolutely unrelated meanings to ONE ""color/taste/sound/shape made absolutely no sense to him!This book will definitely give you a better appreciataion for your own memory--or lack thereof!"
32,0674576225,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1609334-mary,3,"This book didn't really grab me. It's a short read, and fairly easy going. It's the true account of a Russian man that the author (a scientist) studied starting in the 1930s. He has a synesthetic memory, meaning words and numbers evoke images, sounds, tastes, and sensations. Though they offer no explanation for these abilities, the sensory experiences seem to make things indelible for him and he can remember and regurgitate enormously long lists and passages, even years after he's absorbed them. Unfortunately, the account of him is dry and sort of redundant. There's a short chapter at the end about how this ability affects his personality and ability to function which I think would have been more interesting to dwell on. Instead, we get example after example of what he has memorized and how he ""sees"" and ""feels"" it. Meanwhile, his imagination was so developed that, as a kid, he could lay in bed in the morning, imagine himself getting up and getting ready for school, and believe absolutely that he'd done so until someone came to rouse him. But that we don't get until 10 pages from the end. Oliver Sacks could have done justice to this subject. "

The mnemonist in question could memorize tables of figures, phrases (in any language or even gibberish) and then recall it perfectly 15 or more years later! Every incident was an image seared into his memory.However, rather than given an account of his amazing memory, the book spends its time describing how his mind worked, and how it differed from we people with more forgetful minds. In essence, the man had synesthesia, and this mixing of sensations created a web of memories for each incident of his life. He could taste words as well as see them as they were spoken. Strangely, he had many difficulties when words such as ""pig"" did not ""appear"" as the animal which it is meant to describe. In all, it sounds like the mnemonist had more problems than the advanced memory was worth, struggling to relate with normal people or keep an interest in what he was doing. Overall I thought the book was less interesting as an account of a mnemonist than it was a meditation on the way any mind works."
34,0674576225,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6195707-julian,4,"A delightful and fascinating book written by one of the intellectual giants of cognitive psychology.As many reviewers have already mentioned, while Sherashevsky's ('S') limitless ability to recall facts, based on synaesthesia and an unparalled capacity for visual imagery is captivating in itself, what is even more fascinating (and refreshing) is Luria's interest in the PERSONHOOD of the 'case' he is studying. It is perhaps somewhat symptomatic of our society's insistence and reliance on the objective and measurable as reified indicators of mental and physical health, that this work (and his other case study, 'The man with a shattered world')are rarely referred to in scientific discussions and papers relating to Luria.I also found Luria's reference to S's innate and integrated mind-body connection, and hints at synchronicity through S's 'magical thinking' absolutely fascinating. Also, given the much need integrative approach in 'new' fields of study such as interpersonal neurobiology, this is indicative of how Luria thought outside the restrictions and boxes of his time."

Stories of people who can remember so much are fascinating. This little book is a winner, well written and engaging. Other popular books, like Space walking with Einstein, can tell you that getting a prize winning memory up to speed is work and losing memories is easy. I became especially interested in memorization and neuroscience while teaching a course in Memory and Learning while a graduate student back in the 70's. I had a star basketball player who was trying to pass my course. His coach came to beg me to pass him although his grade was failing. So I tried to put what I knew about memory to use. I coached the fellow along an imaginary court, throwing balls (facts, ideas, contextual stuff) thru hoops, making him dribble facts back and forth. He caught on to these visual placements and, yes, he passed."
36,0674576225,http://goodreads.com/user/show/889877-dominick,4,"This fascinating account struck me in a number of ways—a ravel of empathy, sympathy, and curiosity alike—but perhaps what so well framed my reading of this book was a bit from Bruner's foreword to the 1987 edition:...Luria's humane yet naked account—he liked to call this genre ""romantic science""—is in the spirit of a Kafka or a Beckett writing of characters who are symbolically dispossessed of the power to find meaning in the world. In his way, S., Luria's patient in this book, takes his place beside Joseph K. in The Trial, or in the gallery of lost souls that Beckett has brought to life in his stories and plays.I was a bit distraught at the lack of mention of the Method of loci by the author, as S.'s account of his geo-spatial method for both encoding and recall seems dead-on the same as the ancient technique that so imbues folks with the ability to win memory competitions, without the gift of natural genius."
37,0674576225,http://goodreads.com/user/show/930401-maya-lang,3,"A very cool case study by the old Russian scientist Luria (inventor of Luria broth, used in Petri dishes--ah, random trivia from the 9th grade) about a man with a seemingly boundless memory whose gift poses psychological and personal problems to him. The patient is sort of the opposite of the guy from _Memento_ (whose memory was zapped), and fascinating I think for similar reasons. It's also interesting to see a scientist cross the boundaries of his field and write a non-clinical piece that amounts to a biography of sorts. He was obviously affected by his patient and felt a great deal of compassion for him. The memory stuff is pretty friggin' cool too."
38,0674576225,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1292871-todd,4,"Synesthesia's a cool writing technique, simple to execute and pretty impossible to do consistently well (I have my own samples to show you if you're curious and masochistic). ""tMoaM"" follows a case study of a Russian (that should date it for you) with a, more or less, perfect memory. It's interesting, and worth reading, but I could probably do without all the dry explications of the case study and the several introductions. Were the book reduced to the patient's journal entries, however, I'd make the claim that this would be a moderately successful book of very creative poems.Check it out if you're in a writing slump."
39,0674576225,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11373009,5,"It's a highly readable book whose story stays with you for a long time. This translation from Russian into amateur English gave us the mirror of what the author have intended: Alexander Luria paints a fascinating portrait of a man with an amazing memory and the effects and aftermath it had on his personality and life. All of the sudden, most of us would probably consider such a perfect memory as a blessing. I find it fascinating that such a memory actually turned out to pose severe problems. Thus, The Mind of a Mnemonist is a phenomenal and influential book that has earned its well-deserved status as a classic. "
40,0674576225,http://goodreads.com/user/show/681912-emily,3,"Interesting account of a mnemonist (guy with a seemingly unlimited memory). Turns out he has synesthia, meaning his senses are all interconnected. When he hears something, he has an automatic detailed image associated with it. Along with taste, smell, touch, etc. So his amazing memory feats were linked to this--give him a long list of items to remember & his brain creates a unique sensory experience that he can later revisit.... Turns out this came with some challenges too (e.g., he couldn't forget/discard things). Got a little dry, but generally pretty intriguing."
41,0674576225,http://goodreads.com/user/show/19251343-joseph-santiago,5,This book was great! Reading what this man deals with on a daily basis is what most science fiction writers hope to attain. Though in most science fiction the person that can remember everything usually doesn't land in an asylum. Reading this book connected some of the gaps with Bandler and Grinder's work on submodalities. Imagine waking up each day having to remember to forget every interaction with another person because it would interfere with communicating with them in the present moment. This was an great read!Mr Joe
42,0674576225,http://goodreads.com/user/show/93990-ashley,2,"It's always embarrassing when I'm the one who ""doesn't get it."" I admire and actually cherish Luria's considerable contributions to the field of psychology, but as a read, I just couldn't get into this. Of course, I finished it, but aside from moments of interest when Luria described the way a mind saturated with synesthesia works, I found it rather dull. A case study that lacked the interest of, say, and Oliver Sacks case study. And of course Sacks stands on Luria's shoulders; yet I simply couldn't get engaged in the book, despite my admiration for the author and his contributions. "
43,0674576225,http://goodreads.com/user/show/381346-tarfia,5,"This is a brilliant case study done by Russian psychologist Aleksandr Luria of a man (""S."") whose memory capacity is seemingly endless. Luria takes a typical case study several steps further by examining S.'s personality characteristics as well as exploring how someone like S. might function in everyday society. This book is a quick, beautifully written read, but is devastating in its conclusion that the gift of endless memory can be both rich and relentless. "
44,0674576225,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1301881-riana-elizabeth,4,"Interesting case study of a man, originally thought ""slow"" because parents and teachers didn't understand the vast amount of information he was cataloging, who had to train himself how to forget.From ""His Control of Behavior"":""The boy's vivid imagination broke down the boundary between the real and the imaginary; and this lack of distinction between the two producedquite unusual behavior on his part."""

46,0674576225,http://goodreads.com/user/show/42661748-dale-minner,5,"This is a delightful read and difficult to put down. As others have said ""his writing just sparkles."" Dr. Sacks explores in detail some of the workings of the human brain. The detail raises serious questions about the ancient pagan Greek ideas of a duality of soul and body. If such explicit neurological conditions arise from specific anatomic brain defects, and if there is no consciousness in deep anesthesia the idea of a separate immortal soul seems to have no evidentiary basis in fact.

Luria's case study of a man with a vast and detailed but indiscriminant memory was the inspiration for Oliver Sach's popular book about aphasias and other neurological disorders, The Man Who Mistook His Wife for a Hat. I always wondered if the extraordinary mnemonist of Luria's study was the inspiration for Borges's Fumes the Memorius. "

Critics of the book may relegate it as a qualitative account but there is much more here; the subject's condition is viewed from the POV gift AND affliction, and the author makes takes this opportunity to probe his personality."
50,0674576225,http://goodreads.com/user/show/40101884-shariq,3,"deeply unsatisfying. the book's focused on the subtleties of S.'s memory, as revealed through page after page after page of documented experiments. wish the last section, the only section dealing with S.'s personality and daily life, were much expanded. but luria's a neuropsychologist, so idk why expected anything else. i think oliver sacks spoiled me."

52,0674576225,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2149919-bobby,5,"A small gem of a book that holds up remarkably well and offers many insights into the nature of memory. In my opinion, superior to Oliver Sack's early books, many of which take a similar approach to a similar subject. "
53,0674576225,http://goodreads.com/user/show/16257737-dan-smith,4,I came to this from Oliver Sacks and it led me to the Borges story Funes The Memorious and the rather wonderful Blueglass by Chris Wilson.
