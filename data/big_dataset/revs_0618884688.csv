0,0618884688,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6100646-brian-clegg,5,"Visit bookshop When I first came across this book, I groaned a little. Yet another 'story of the mysteries of cosmology' title. Was there anything left to say? I'm pleased to say that my groan was unnecessary - this is one of the most enjoyable popular science books I've read all year. Although there's nothing new in the science itself, the main thread of Anil Ananthaswamy's book is a tour of the remarkable places where the expanding universe, dark matter, dark energy, the Higgs boson and more are being pursued. At each location we get some excellent historical context - I loved, for example, how he puts across the feel of the early days at the Mount Wilson observatory.What makes this so enjoyable are the extremes of the locations where this leading edge physics takes place. One moment we are perched on a snow-covered mountain in California, the next we are in a deep mine. As we reach CERN we are plunged into a vast underground empire that any Bond villain would be proud of... only to contrast this with an experiment using a vast block of Antarctic ice as a neutrino detector. I'm a big fan of Bill Bryson's travel books, and while Ananthaswamy doesn't have Bryson's humour and homeliness, he does succeed in painting an excellent word picture of these locations, the people he meets and the far-reaching work that is being carried on there.My only reservation with the book is that the science is mostly presented as if it is 100 percent fact, rather than our current best guess - something that, let's face it, is all it can be with cosmology (as in 'There's speculation, then there's more speculation, then there's cosmology'). For example dark matter is presented as if it were as certain as normal matter. In fact what we know is that the gravitational force calculation comes up with the wrong value at the level of galaxies. This could mean that the mass is wrong (hence dark matter), that the distances are wrong, or that Newton/Einstein are wrong on the scale of galaxies. Dark matter is the best supported possibility - but it remains just this. I think not to make this clear does cosmology no favours.I accept, though, that it is particularly easy to fall into fallacious fact-speak when the detail of the science is not the main thrust of the book. You want to get the science out of the way in an easy, approachable fashion so you can concentrate on the travel book/history of science aspects. And bearing that in mind, I can easily overlook that reservation, because this is such a good, well-written book. If you want to get a feel for where the mysteries of the universe are wrestled with, I can't think of a better book to pick up. You'll be swept away by Ananthaswamy's expert storytelling.Review first appeared on www.popularscience.co.uk - reproduced with permission."

Such an environment helps us gather images of galaxies billions of light-years away that would answer many fundamental questions of astronomy and physics. Hence large telescopes are built at places like Atacama Desert in Chile at Paranal Observatory. The author provides his personal experiences of visiting these places and reporting the experiments conducted there. Other places of interests include an abandoned iron mine in Minnesota, where experiments are conducted to study dark matter particles. In Antarctica, 1.5 miles into the icy ground, efforts are underway for the detection fundamentals particles like neutrino. Lake Baikal in Siberia, the world’s oldest and deepest lake is also a hotspot for detecting neutrinos, and the Indian Astronomical Observatory in the Himalayas to study galaxies with optical, infrared, and gamma-ray telescopes. This book is not so much about the experiments or astronomy research, but it is about the experience of visiting these places. "
2,0618884688,http://goodreads.com/user/show/40480855-viswajith-venugopal,4,"Simultaneously a science and travel book, Anil Ananthaswamy's The Edge of Physics is a very well-conceived book -- go to the edge of our planet to find out the extent of how much we know about the Universe. The book describes some fantastic scenes from extreme locations around the Earth, while telling us just what science does and doesn't know about the deep questions -- what is the Universe? How did it form, where is it going, why are all these particles and energies there, and why do fundamental physical constants have the values they have?The book explains, in a manner that a lay reader can follow (albeit with some difficulty -- more on this later), all the physics that can answer these questions, and how scientists are trying to dig up more experimental evidence to help them answer more questions. It becomes clear that physics is in some sort of crisis at the moment -- all the easy experiments have been done, and there are all sorts of theories, but the experiments and measurements needed to take things further are very difficult. And there's a whole lot of things yet to be explained.The experiments that are being done to rectify this are mind-boggling -- from Russian scientists trying to find neutrinos going through the massive frozen Lake Baikal in Siberia, to a huge array of radio telescopes in South Africa, to floating balloons over the Antarctic. The experiments devised, the locations chosen, and the sheer intricacy and innovation required to technically execute them is really mind-blowing, and definitely worth reading about. The places described are all extreme (saying he's gone to the edge of the Earth is no exaggeration) -- the South Pole, a deep mine in the United States, Ladakh, Hawaii, Siberia -- which makes the travel part of the book fascinating reading. The depictions of the scientists themselves are also interesting, telling you everything from what drives them to how they spend their leisure time. (Spoiler alert: Russian scientists consider no hour too early and no surface ice too thin when it comes to consuming vodka.)Like I said, the book also updates you on where exactly the frontiers of cosmology currently lie. Unfortunately, though, physics is probably too complicated to describe to a lay reader, and I felt like that was the one thing this book suffered from -- the physics was very complicated, and it was hard to understand the details. This was made even more frustrating by the fact that even this involved description is giving you only a fraction of the details, so that you don't truly understand things. I don't blame the author though -- it simply isn't possible to explain all of cosmology in such a small place, and if he'd tried, the book would have been unreadable.Nevertheless, this is a book definitely worth reading, at least for the travel parts and the description of the experiments. It also gets philosophical in parts, and through everything described, one definitely does appreciate humanity's struggle its place in the Universe and all its infinite mysteries."
3,0618884688,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1925269-paul-weimer,3,"The Edge of Physics: A Journey to Earth's Extremes to Unlock the Secrets of the Universe by Anil Ananthaswamy is not quite what it seems.While the title promises a look at the bleeding edge of physics and cosmology, this book in actuality has a broader canvas. Anathaswamy, a journalist at the New Scientist, focuses on the places he goes and the people he meets on his journey to understand the experiments, equipment and the people associated with them. High energy physics requires special conditions to have their detectors work. If you want to detect WIMPs, look for primordial antimatter, and try and find Higgs Bosons, you need special equipment, which just can't be built anywhere. In this book, Ananthaswamy chronicles his journeys to these often remote locations and talks with the people there. In the midst of this, the book is filled out (some might say padded) with a large number of digressions. In detailing his trip to Antarctica, for example, Ananthaswamy feels compelled to discuss the race to reach the South Pole first by Shackleton and Scott. It really has little to do with the physics experiments going on at Antarctica, and while its a fascinating bit of history, it is out of place as far as the title of the book is concerned.This portion, and almost all of the other portions of the book read like travelogue, as Ananthaswamy details the effort he has to take in order to get to some of the more remote locations where the physics experiments are taking place, such as Lake Baikal, the Chilean Desert, South Africa, and the Soudan Underground Mine in Minnesota. Those far more interested in the physics are going to be annoyed by these portions of the book. For myself, I liked these digressions, and accepted them as part of the matrix of the book. I was fascinated by, for example, his journey to Lake Baikal. I didn't know much about the lake, and in reading this book I learned as much, if not more about the lake than about the neutrino detector submerged there.It's a relatively conversational tone of a book, with no equations and not a lot of hard science. It's well edited and a very easy read. I think that the target audience for this book are those who have taken physics in high school, maybe some general science in College, but do not generally have a strong science background. My mother is has no special science background. and no post-secondary education I think she would be able to understand and enjoy this book. Conversely, those who have physics degrees, and have a stake in the ""cage match"" that is going on between String Theory and Loop Quantum Gravity should stay far away from this book.Ananthaswamy does not ""discuss the controversy"", to coin a phrase. While the information on the experiments might be interesting to physics experts, the non physics portions of the book will probably not be to their taste. If you are looking for a book on the level of Lee Smolin or Brian Greene, no matter which camp you support, then this book is definitely not your cup of tea and you probably will be frankly bored by large portions of this slim volume. If your interest is more broad, and your commitment to controversies in the field are not intense, then this relatively painless look at the field, and more especially, the people and places associated with high energy physics is entertaining and informative, even if (and for me especially because) it does contain a wide ranging view of the people and the places the physics takes place."

5,0618884688,http://goodreads.com/user/show/76014-raghu,3,"The title of the book gives an impression of this book as one that deals primarily with the ideas like dark matter, dark energy, strings, supersymmetry and so on in a popular scientific way. However, it is more a travelogue of the far reaches of the Earth where experiments are undertaken in unravelling the secrets of Nature and the author's journey to these places to find out what is being done in all these places. There is an amount of personal-interest stories and popular history that he writes about in each of these places. The author seems to realize that at times the 'science' takes a backseat to these stories and so compensates for it by giving the background to many of the fundamental theories relating to strings, dark energy and the search for neutrinos and Higgs bosons. But somehow, it feels disjointed with the rest of the narrative.I felt that it would have been better to start the book with a few chapters that summarize the history and science of how we got where we are today in theoretical physics and how experimental physics had evolved alongside, thereby setting the stage for his investigations into each of the ten sites he visits to delve deeper into the experiments. The travel stories about each of the site in itself is interesting but, in general, they take the focus away from 'science' for a reader like me, who is interested in popular science but not a qualified scientist in the field. I wish he had discussed in more detail the counter-points to some of these theories in the scientific community, thereby giving a more complete picture. For example, he writes about the conclusions of the string theory that says that there are 10^500 universes which are possible and that we may be living in just one of them. It sounds lame even to a layman like me that we need to postulate 10^500 Universes in order to explain the one we happen to inhabit. This is akin to many bizarre religious views of the origin of the 'world'. There are many contrary views of eminent scientists against such theories but the book gives the impression as though the scientific community has by and large resigned itself to the string view of the Universe. The book is worth reading for the knowledge it disseminates about the frontier areas of experimental work in particle physics. I would recommend it as a good read."
6,0618884688,http://goodreads.com/user/show/18648265-glenn,5,This book is a beautifully written travelogue that includes physics lessons for the lay reader and anecdotal histories. I enjoyed every minute of it.
7,0618884688,http://goodreads.com/user/show/15651131-last-ranger,5,"Shiva’s Dance: What a fantastic book! Join Anil Ananthaswamy on his pilgrimage around the world to visit as many of the most famous, and unusual, Observatories that he can get to. In his 2010 book “The Edge of Physics” Ananthaswamy shares his experiences on this global journey. Along the way he interviewed some of the top minds in astronomy and theoretical physics, seeking answers to many of the most pressing questions in modern science: Is Supersymmetry a valid theory? Is there actually a Higgs Boson?* And the hunt for Cosmological Neutrinos and the Neutralinos. As a layman-reader I really enjoyed this book although there were portions of the text that left me feeling somewhat overwhelmed by the complex theories of particle physics and the mysteries of cosmological history. But Ananthaswamy is very good at explaining these difficult concepts, his writing is layman friendly and very readable. Part travel log, part history and cutting edge science, this entertaining book left me hungry for more of the same. Starting out in California, USA, the author visits the Mt. Wilson Observatory and takes a side trip to visit a Camaldolese Monastery in the Santa Lucia Mountains to spend some time with one of the resident Monks and experience some really dark skies. From there he continued on to more exotic locations; the VLT at Cerro Paranal Observatory in Chile’s Atacama Desert; the Karoo region of So. Africa, possibly the future home of the SKA (Square Kilometer Array)— the other contender is in Australia; the controversial observatories atop Mauna Kea, Hawaii and with IceCube in Antarctica drilling for the Square Kilometer Neutrino Detector. The list goes on but, for me, the high point was his visit to CERN in Geneva, Switzerland to see ATLAS: the huge particle detector for the Large Hadron Collider (LHC). While touring each facility the author discussed the ultimate goals of the scientists and engineers work and live there. And what are those goals? High on everybody’s list was a theory that combines General Relativity and Quantum Mechanics but they would also like to confirm Supersymmetry, look for validation to String Theory and the Multiverse. Ananthaswamy’s description of CERN and ATLAS is breathtaking. Working and doing research at CERN is definitely not for the faint of heart. With the dawning of the Space Age it wasn’t long before new observatories were being sent to “The Final Frontier” in the form of satellites like Hubble and Planck that can “park” at one of the Lagrangian Points to make their observations. And so the book closes with a look to the future when a new generation of scientists, and their tools, will be rewriting the composition and history of our universe. I thoroughly enjoyed this challenging book and I highly recommend it to anyone interested reading about space, time and the universe. I had no technical or downloading problems with this Kindle edition.(* Higgs Boson was Discovered at CERN in 2012)Last Ranger"

(This sentence is a microcosm of the style of the book)I reveled in some amazingly poetic prose as he described the locations that housed or supported an amazing array of telescopes located in places few care to venture. Fortunately for us, he went to those often hostile places and spent as much time writing on the geographies mentioned above, as the hard-core science that motivated their existence.It’s a complex story. It includes acronyms and names enough to dissuade a reader from continuing, but then he slips in something fascinating about places or an Ideas, both here on earth and into the multiverse.He is careful to include a multitude of scientists and support personnel, past and present, who labor in difficult places without much recognition or human comfort. It’s a Who’s Who of science, and very few receive awards or devices, theories or systems named for them, all do their part to bring knowledge to we who glibly receive it from our easy chairs.If nothing else resonates with the reader, the glossaries and indices at the end of the book can be used for further study and clarification.Four stars only reflect my inability to understand large sections of the scientific prose, not the author’s vast knowledge or broad-based education, which is quite stunning. I found that having Google Earth and Wikipedia close by enabled me to stop and see many of the places and images contained in his writing. Pictures in the text or at the end of the book would have made this far more enjoyable. If one reads only what they can easily understand, this will be well worth their investment in time. As my father used to say “Eat the meat and spit out the bones”. "
9,0618884688,http://goodreads.com/user/show/67483040-patrick-teti,5,"I found this to be an excellent consolidation of where things are with ""big physics"" and cosmology. The writing was clear, entertaining and well-edited. Ananthaswamy did a great job of linking historical discoveries such as the magnitude of galactic distances with the more recent surprises and mysteries such as accelerating expansion and dark energy. The descriptions of the logistics of humans working in extreme research sites such as abandoned mines, high elevation mountain tops, Lake Baikal in winter, and the South Pole Station provided welcome relief to what could have been tedious descriptions of the extreme physics experiments going on at those locations.

In the video, the narrator, Toby Hendy, a mathematics and physics graduate, is present with a guest, David Gozzard, who also has a background in physics. Toby states that, along with Marcus Chown, one of her favourite pop-science writers was this book, written by Anil Ananthaswamy.Toby claims that the book introduces you to things like big neutrino telescopes, which they have in Antarctica as well as in old abandoned gold mines, just science experiments on the edge of science that you might not have known existed."
11,0618884688,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5344627-sarah,3,A travel book around places where cosmology is done with some well explained cosmology to round it off. Hasn't dated badly. I enjoyed it a lot and it would have got a full four stars if the section on the Large Hadron Colider has been less long.

12,0618884688,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10682608-adrian,3,"This interesting volume provides a well-written geographical romp through many of the remote astronomical observatories dotted from Hawaii to Antarctica, and along the way gives a pretty good account of the physics involved in the questions and quests facing modern cosmologists and astronomers. While I did not understand the physics side of the story, I thoroughly enjoyed Anil's descriptions of the places he visited, and his anecdotes about the many explorers and scientists he met along the way. My only criticism is that I was mystified by how he could cover the physics involved without mentioning Stephen Hawking. He does list 'A Brief History of Time' in his bibliography, but to the best of my memory, we hear nothing from Hawking in the body of the work. I have now started reading Hawking's book, and reckon Anil owes a big debt to him!"

Nice combination of science, geography, history and future vision. "
14,0618884688,http://goodreads.com/user/show/71230800-dan-carpenter,3,A bit outdated at this point. The author mentions that the Higgs Boson and gravitational waves have not been found yet but both have been found since the publishing of this book. Certain parts were very interesting but others were slow enough that I had to skim to make it through. At times this book is geared more towards those that have no background in the subject and at other times it seems to be more detailed that a beginner would be able to comprehend. I would not read this book again.
15,0618884688,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6182695-james-morrison,2,I picked this book up at a local used book sale. Wonderful writing and lots of well explained phenomenal information.

Having said that I personally believe that buying this book and actually ending up reading it and finishing it in one go (ie, without putting down the book to pick up another book to read) has benefited me in multiple ways.(1) This book has rekindled the interest in reading books by the dozen yet again and I have started making a list of the next 5-6 books that I want to read(2) This book has rekindled the spark of curiosity in me which I believe had died down over the course of the last few years(3) This book not only makes me want to read more, but also write more which I am hoping will end up in generating more blog posts such as this one and make me more of a regular writer / blogger.To get to the book itself, it deals with Cosmology which Wikipedia defines as the academic discipline that seeks to understand the origin, evolution, structure, and ultimate fate of the Universe at large, as well as the natural laws that keep it in order. Wow, while I know that is a heavy definition with big words, big concepts, suffice to say that most of my understanding of the origin of our Universe began and ended with The Big Bang Theory (not the TV series, but the actual cosmological concept). And guess what it turns out that most modern cosmology is indeed dominated by The Big Bang Theory.This book, The Edge of Reason (called “The Edge of Physics: A Journey to Earth’s Extremes to Unlock the Secrets of the Universe” outside of India) is part travelogue, part documentary-style writing which takes the author Anil Ananthaswamy from the tip of Mount Mauna Kea, a dormant volcano in Hawaii to deep mines in Minnesota, from Lake Baikal in Siberia to McMurdo Station in Antarctica, from the underground Large Hadron Collider in Switzerland to Mount Saraswathi in Ladakh. The author goes to these places to talk to the scientists, physicists, cosmologists and astronomers regarding to get more details regarding some of the experiments that they are conducting to answer questions regarding the origins of the universe.While documenting his travels, the author describes in great detail the locations of these experiments, the rationale behind the choice of these varied locations, basic tenets of the experiments being conducted, descriptions of the questions that these experiments are trying to answer, as well as the history behind some of these questions themselves. This book manages to give us an insight into the brilliant minds of the physicists and cosmologists who asked these questions in the first place. In many ways, this book is a tribute to all those pioneer cosmologists who dared to ask the questions which nobody else asked, who dared to question the status-quo of existing theories regarding the origins of the universe, and some of the answers to the questions asked have the potential to radically change our existing knowledge regarding the cosmos itself.It has to be agreed that this book requires a certain degree of knowledge of and interest in basic physics to be read. Also, the reader has to have the patience of actually slowing down, re-reading paragraphs and pages to put together complicated theories and concepts of cosmology. That being said, Anil Ananthaswamy manages to take the reader on a wonderful joyride around the world and also manages to paint quite a vivid picture of modern day cosmology. In fact, I would bet that more interest would be generated in this field if schools and colleges around the world made this book a part of their libraries and if possible, a part of their list of suggested readings in Physics.A wonderful book which is a travelogue, cosmology reference guide (at a very basic level), introductory guide to some of the most profound ideas of cosmology and its propounders. A really good read."
28,0618884688,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1142366-hans,3,"I probably understood somewhere around 30% of the actual science of this book, which just happened to be enough to get the basic gist of what is going on today in physics. Of course most of the book 80% was a travelogue and history of each of the different sites where scientists are conducting experiments to uncover the problems plaguing physics today.I am sure that magazines or even the internet would or could be a better source for more up-to-date information regarding where physics actually is today. Though this book was published in January of 2011, most of the content of this book came from 2009 thus making the material already dated. In fact this book was barely anymore insightful than Stephen Hawking's book ""The History of the Universe"" or ""The Universe in a nutshell"". In fact I can basically sum up most of the book if a few sentencesThe physical Universe (or matter that we can interact with), makes up about 10% of the Universe, Dark Matter is believed to make up the next 20%, and finally the most mysterious of all Dark Energy seems to make up the final 70% of the Universe. That means that as of yet, 90% of the Universe is actual unknown to us. I of course find this the most striking aspect of the book. That despite all of the progress made by mankind that the majority of existence is still unknown. It is both humbling and awe inspiring. It is also interesting to note how physics is coming around to ideas once thought fantastical or only in the realm of science fiction. The Multiple-Universe theory is gaining more and more credibility as it helps make the different laws of physics, including string theory work. "
29,0618884688,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2352376-venkates-swaminathan,5,"Meant for the lay reader who has an interest in science, this well-written book is a cross between a travelogue and an explanation. The author traveled to the places where cosmologists (scientists who study the distant universe, and the theories of the universe's creation and evolution) conduct experiments. Since these experiments can only be conducted in places where the earth and its inhabitants don't create interference through light, dust, etc., most of these places are in remote and desolate places (Siberia, Antarctica, the Andes mountains in Chile, remote regions of South Africa). His descriptions of the places and the scientists are wonderful in themselves, since you get a great sense of the spirit of discovery and exploration that motivates them. The history sections, which describe how science has reached its current state, are also fascinating. But most interesting is the explanation of the science itself. The general theory of relativity, string theory, the big bang, and other obscure topics are all explained in a way that's readable without being oversimplified. I really enjoyed reading it!"

Dark matter, dark energy, quantum gravity: these are the topics that keep physicists awake at night, requiring bigger, more massive, more extreme experiments to test theories and uncover clues. The author takes readers behind the scenes of these experiments in some of the most inhospitable places in the world, leading the tour with wit and an eye for compelling detail. First is a pilgrimage to Mount Wilson Observatory, where astronomers first measured the expansion of the universe. Next we go 2,341 feet underground in a defunct Minnesota iron mine to search for particles that could reveal dark matter. Sensitive telescopes embedded in the thick ice of Siberia's Lake Baikal and Antarctica search for neutrinos. These experiments and others are heroic in every sense, and Ananthaswamy captures their excitement—and the personalities of the scientists behind them—with enthusiasm and insight."

Dark matter, dark energy, quantum gravity: these are the topics that keep physicists awake at night, requiring bigger, more massive, more extreme experiments to test theories and uncover clues. The author takes readers behind the scenes of these experiments in some of the most inhospitable places in the world, leading the tour with wit and an eye for compelling detail.

Next we go 2,341 feet underground in a defunct Minnesota iron mine to search for particles that could reveal dark matter.

Dark matter, dark energy, quantum gravity: these are the topics that keep physicists awake at night, requiring bigger, more massive, more extreme experiments to test theories and uncover clues. The author takes readers behind the scenes of these experiments in some of the most inhospitable places in the world, leading the tour with wit and an eye for compelling detail. First is a pilgrimage to Mount Wilson Observatory, where astronomers first measured the expansion of the universe. Next we go 2,341 feet underground in a defunct Minnesota iron mine to search for particles that could reveal dark matter. Sensitive telescopes embedded in the thick ice of Siberia's Lake Baikal and Antarctica search for neutrinos.

Dark matter, dark energy, quantum gravity: these are the topics that keep physicists awake at night, requiring bigger, more massive, more extreme experiments to test theories and uncover clues. The author takes readers behind the scenes of these experiments in some of the most inhospitable places in the world, leading the tour with wit and an eye for compelling detail. First is a pilgrimage to Mount Wilson Observatory, where astronomers first measured the expansion of the universe. Next we go 2,341 feet underground in a defunct Minnesota iron mine to search for particles that could reveal dark matter. Sensitive telescopes embedded in the thick ice of Siberia's Lake Baikal and Antarctica search for neutrinos. These experiments and others are heroic in every sense, and Ananthaswamy captures their excitement—and the personalities of the scientists behind them—with enthusiasm and insight."

"
286,0618884688,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2827908-john-e,4,"This was a fun book. Following the latest (as of publication date) experiments in physics and astronomy, the author takes us on a wild ride to the far reaches of the earth where scientists seek isolation from civilization's pollution to perform unbelievable work. I just wish I had been with him; it sounded like a lot of fun to travel and learn the latest science."
287,0618884688,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1685814-louise-chambers,5,Very well written. A fascinating look at all the science projects worldwide. Most of the language is fairly easy to understand; I only got truly bogged down on the last chapter. I highly recommend this to everyone.
288,0618884688,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1339246-gendou,4,"Occasionally dry and boring, but very well-written.The book is about science experiments on a large scale.Much of the book is historical and biographical.However, the author isn't afraid to get right into the science being tested."
289,0618884688,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1134744-allison,4,"I learned a lot from this book. Im not sure how much I retained from the actual breakdown of quantum mechanics and such, but it was more interesting just to experience the places and the sights of these groundbreaking experiments and the people who are behind them. Excellent read. "
290,0618884688,http://goodreads.com/user/show/738899-erin,3,"This is a fascinating book on where physics currently is and where the theories are going. However, since science is not normally something I read a lot about this book was really dense. I also had a bit of a time keeping track of all the abbreviations. Still an interesting read."
291,0618884688,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2614673-michael,3,Good book for anyone interested in cosmology. Do expect to learn much about physics but it is a good starting point and you will learn about what the bigs experiments that are under way in physics are.
292,0618884688,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5452330-deeann,3,"It was really interesting, but hard to understand alot of the time. And I'm not a scientist, but most of the words were all really big science words that I couldn't really understand even after I looked them up."
293,0618884688,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3352854-david-skip-everling,3,Primarily concerned with experimental astronomy and cosmology (with just enough theoretical physics to explain why the experiments are being done). An emphasis on the engineering challenges of building these large scale experiments in highly remote or hazardous locales.
294,0618884688,http://goodreads.com/user/show/12806275-kim-bastian,5,A great book no matter if you are new or experienced to physics.It takes you around the globe with the author to experience the frontiers of physics experiments. Each place has its own chapter starting out with a detailed description of why the experiment is performed.
295,0618884688,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1073647-robyn-blaber,4,"This was a very good book, but I read it a little late: Pre-Higgs-boson. Well, now I know everything about physics that I should have known 5 years ago. Time to catch on where all of these interesting studies have taken us (if I don't already know). Googling... googling."
296,0618884688,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10716719-william,3,"Wasn't sure but it ended up being very good coverage of all of current ""Big Science"" in all of the corners of the world with great explanations of ""Dark Matter"", ""Dark Energy"", ""String Theory"", ""Quantum Mechanics"", and the engineering of our new optical and radio telescopes."
297,0618884688,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1477073-jeff,4,Best popular physics book I've read since Elegant Universe. 
298,0618884688,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3171124-chris,3,Borrowed from JoelZ. A fun tour of faraway places in the world where science is made.
299,0618884688,http://goodreads.com/user/show/15408-chris-march,4,"Travel with the author to see exotic places, meet charming people, and find out what's new in physics. Skim or skip the first chapter to get to the good stuff."
