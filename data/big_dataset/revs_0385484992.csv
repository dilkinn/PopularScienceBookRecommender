Kaku once said that H.G. Wells was ""one century ahead""..., of his time.

""When Isaac Newton walked along the beach, picking up seashells,he did not realize that the vast ocean of undiscovered truth that lay before him would contain such scientific wonders.He probably could not foresee the day when science would unravel the secret of life,the atom and the mind. Today, that ocean has yielded many of its secrets"".A very, very interesting book, both for scientists and laypeople. Published in 1997, it's a look into the future. Three main revolutions expected to unfold: Computer's, a Bio molecular one and a Quantum revolution.

""One of the most original and unexpected discoveries in recent years is the DNA computer,which may eventually outperform silicon computers on difficult mathematical problems""...Leonard Adelmen of the University of Southern California has showed that even a tiny test tube of DNA might be able to crack problems that would choke a supercomputer"".There are predictions reaching year 2100, antimatter engines...along with Nanotechnology advances (can you imagine supercomputers the size of atoms?), and eternal life seriously considered.Very futuristic: the idea of DNA computers...capable of solving problems faster than standard serial computers.  

It's all in the book."
1,0385484992,http://goodreads.com/user/show/590822-heather,4,"Richard Dawkins defines ""poetic magic"" as something deeply moving, something exhilarating, something that gives you goose bumps in the night... in short, makes you feel good to be alive. Reading a book by Michio Kaku is poetic magic. Approachable, entertaining science writing, about reaching toward mastery of matter, life, and intelligence to reshape ourselves and the universe around us.This was written about 15 years ago, so as a futurism book it's dated in places, but since we're only 12 years into the 21st century, and Kaku speculates readily up to 2100, I think it's still a valid book for future contemplation. Kaku covers 3 scientific revolutions that will shape the 21st century: the Computer Revolution, the Biomolecular Revolution, and the Quantum Revolution. He envisions the world as these revolutions unfold and discusses relevant issues on their impact. If there is a futuristic science concept you are interested in .. antimatter engines, privacy and genetics, anti-aging, robot consciousness, etc. .. it's touched on somewhere in here. Again, a warning that some bits are dated, but it's still worth a read for Chapter 15 alone, ""Toward a Planetary Civilization"" where Kaku explores Nikolai Kardashev's classification system for extraterrestrial civilizations. To give you a sense of scale, the United Federation of Planets in Star Trek would only qualify as an emerging Type II civilization. Fun stuff, and Kaku has written several more books since this one if you like his writing."
2,0385484992,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3599694-priya,4,"The book was written in 1997, so it was interesting to see how Kaku's short term projections came out. It is split into the quantum revolution, computer revolution, and molecular revolution, with the broad theme that soon we will become masters instead of observers of the universe. By soon, I mean at least 100-10,000 years, depending on your definition of master. Anyway, it was a fun read. I will probably check out his most recent book, Physics of the Future."
3,0385484992,http://goodreads.com/user/show/669579-craig,1,"Kaku just sees to repeat a few sound bites over and over. He makes the common pop science mistake of truncating his explanations as they get technical, rather than explaining them in layman's terms. The result is like climbing into fog - the science becomes disembodied and disconnected."
4,0385484992,http://goodreads.com/user/show/36223164-anna-b,5,"This book was published in 1997 and reading it now gives an uncanny deja vu - Michio Kaku accurately predicted how technology will change the world by 2020. This is also because at that time, he had access to many researches, seen proofs of concepts, etc. If I ever read this book in the lates 90s or early millennium, I would have chosen to study computer science (I mean, I'm not a science person so, yea.) He tried to simplify quantum physics but I still can't quantum physics. He has a very good simplified explanation of how one can fall through a black hole into a parallel universe, like a rabbit hole. Type I, II, III civilisations (we are still at zero and Star Trek seems real), time travelling, paradoxes. Very good read."
5,0385484992,http://goodreads.com/user/show/130454-donna,4,"I inadvertently made this book even more intellectually intriguing than it would have been otherwise by waiting ten years to read it. Published in 1997, Visions is a futuristic look at what’s likely to happen in the decades to come in three areas of science that are rapidly converging: computer science, biotechnology, and quantum physics. As nearly as I can tell as a layperson, Kaku has been dead-on for the first decade since the book’s publication. Consequently, even his most off-the-wall predictions have more credibility with me than they would have had if I’d read the book right off the press.Some of these mind-stopping predictions include DNA tests that can provide detailed physical descriptions of crime suspects, self-replicating machines the size of molecules, and computers that possess both self-awareness and common sense. (Kaku did not predict when the majority of human beings might be expected to achieve common sense!)It’s amusing to read a book published so recently that “predicts” things we already take for granted: online travel companies and book stores, widely accessible cable and satellite communications, LCD screens replacing CRT monitors. Sequencing of the human genome was completed two years before scientists predicted it would be. Much of the “future” predicted by Kaku has already arrived, and it’s clear that the pace of change is accelerating faster than even the experts could have imagined a short time ago."
6,0385484992,http://goodreads.com/user/show/63821926-logan-scoles,3,"I wanted to give this 4 stars but it was missing a few things. First, it was very informative and included much of what I hoped for when I picked up the book. However, Dr. Kaku condenses too much information in his pages and jumps from topic to topic. It's easy to lose interest at times. Not quite like Sagan who gradually brings you into a topic and discusses it long enough for you to feel informed and understand what the hell he is talking about.This was my second book I have read by Dr. Kaku and I will likely read another. Kaku's passion for science and introduction to scientific topics makes me want to continue reading his works. His writing style just seems to lack in a few key areas."
7,0385484992,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1188865-alberto,5,"This is about technological developments for the next 100 years and beyond. A great investigation by a great scientist.Written about 10 years ago, so its getting outdated but a lot of the predictions are happening. Good for anybody in the technology field or interested in tech foresight."
8,0385484992,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1205745-chris-meger,4,"If you have any intention of keeping up with the 21st century, your best bet is to get out ahead of it. Read and learn. "
9,0385484992,http://goodreads.com/user/show/20926327-lora-shouse,4,"Back in the late 1990’s Michio Kaku was writing about then-current scientific advances and how they might change life in the future. He focused on three areas: the computer revolution, the biomolecular revolution, and the quantum revolution. And he aimed his projections at three periods: up to about 2020, from 2020 to 2050, and after 2050. He got much of his information from talking to other scientists in many fields. He thought that many of the predictions for up to 2020 would be pretty accurate, as they focused on areas of research that were already taking place and making progress. Of course, the predictions further into the future were naturally more speculative.As far as I can tell, some, but not all, of the predictions for what was supposed to be happening by 2020 have come to pass. I suspect that there are many areas where progress has been made, but either the practical applications have not been worked out, or the technology is still too expensive or too complicated to be widely available yet. In particular, many of the things that were predicted to be dirt cheap by now just haven’t happened.Despite this, Michio Kaku has explained a lot of things in an easy-to-understand manner that I might never have understood otherwise, particularly in the realm of quantum mechanics.This was a library book."
10,0385484992,http://goodreads.com/user/show/55651694-mars-smith,4,"Summary: The author, Michio Kaku, discusses how the quantum revolution inspired two other revolutions; the computer and biomolecular revolution. (This is shown in the diagram in chapter 1.)Pro: The author's knowledge about biology, technology, and physics is combined to make optimistic predictions about the future that may lead our society to a type I civilization. My favorite part in this book is how all three topics were tied together to inspire readers to look towards the future in STEM. I also loved reading about antimatter and the different genes for the human body.Con: It's very hard to criticize or rate a book that makes predictions that have yet to happen. This book was copyrighted in 1997, and I read this in 2019. So, when I read this it did seem outdated in that some projections had already come true. The only other negative is that some readers may think the author is too optimistic about the future.Who should read this? People interested in reading briefly about machines, computational biology, and the possible future of humanity."
11,0385484992,http://goodreads.com/user/show/58468649-leonardo-figueir,4,"Dense and heavy reading. Sometimes had to stop reading since I was questioning everything from how we are formed, what will be the future of our world, what our life is worth, why we are here and how my kids will work and live in the next decades.If you are like me, and starts to question everything, I suggest to leave the book aside for a while and grab a fast track Sci-fi, or a thriller. As I did.Is my third reading of Michio Kaku and he never fails to impress me or to get me to think and wonder all that he writes.If you like that, I strongly suggest to read this and his newest book. If not... I can only be sorry for you."
12,0385484992,http://goodreads.com/user/show/102484307-muhammad-abdullah,5,"This is really a great book. The efforts in writing such a great science book by Dr. Michio Kaku is salute able. But their is some critics in a few text especially in Bimolecular revolution section. There is some sort of misunderstanding regarding to some specific religious aspects which are explained in an abstract way, totally opposite to the reality. By the way, this book is a source of knowing much more in a very short period about various fields of science in a single copy. The computer and quantum revolution sections are full of mind-boggling informations about the future. The biomolecular sector is also a great deal of knowledge, particular to biological related people."
13,0385484992,http://goodreads.com/user/show/66395940-kristen-belles-bookshelves,3,"""Perhaps there is a lesson here is that science and technology advance and thrive in an open atmosphere, when scientists and engineers can freely interact with each other.""Divided into quantum, computer, and molecular revolutions, this book imagines where these sciences will take us in the future. since this book is 20 years old now, it's interesting to see how many of Kaku's theories are accurate (or projected to become accurate). I think this would be great to read in conjunction with Physics of the Future, another Kaku book delving into theories of the future."
14,0385484992,http://goodreads.com/user/show/73478784-johan-syahriz,2,"This book was written in 1997. It was impressive to realise most of the predicted technologies or events actually happened and some of them are actually under Work In Progress. However, the way he wrote this book was to give an idea how different fields are connected hence making the content in the book repetitive."
15,0385484992,http://goodreads.com/user/show/104421697-mesker,3,"To read with extra care. All social and environmental outcomes and impacts are obliterated. Although the author makes an attempt to discuss them briefly in a dedicated paragraph, the global feeling is ""Science is good, all hail Science"".However, simplification of complex technical topics is done in a very appreciated way and the whole book is easy to grasp."
16,0385484992,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8366477-sachin-prabhu,4,I found the title interesting so i just picked the book and it didn't disappointment me. I was teleported to different world of michio kaku. The book being written in 1997 intrigued me. Its perfect blend of philosophy and science
17,0385484992,http://goodreads.com/user/show/54769865-yazaid-ahmed,5,Imagination at its bestImagination leading to bizarre inventions and even more imagination. Get this book to see how far the imagination of scientists reached and what possible inventions lie ahead of us.
18,0385484992,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6064704-ana-lu-sa,4,"Very interesting book :) It was very eye opening and I felt repeatedly a sense of deja-vu when reading, since it was written in 1977. Kaku covers a wide range of topics, from Type 3 civilizations (which I personally found very interesting) to immortality!"
19,0385484992,http://goodreads.com/user/show/102608571-dlong1969,4,"Interesting perspective... this was written in the late 1990's and Professor Kaku makes some predictions for ""20 years out"" based on what was then current physics... very cool to see where he was right and where he missed the mark."

22,0385484992,http://goodreads.com/user/show/117921467-sasha,5,Read it as a child first and then as a teenager. Now as an adult it’s an absolutely necessary read. One of my all-time favorites. 
23,0385484992,http://goodreads.com/user/show/60827499-atomicdyson,5,"Got me interested in physics, abandoned philosophy."
24,0385484992,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2233083-jason-mcclenney,4,"I learned all about the future in this book. There are three main areas talked about in the book. These are: the computer revolution, the biotechnology revolution, and the quantum revolution.I am most interested in the computer revolution. Computers are always getting smaller, faster, and able to store more. They will become increasingly ubiquitous in our lives. My favorite subject was artificial intelligence. I am fascinated by the brain, so I loved when the author expounded on how the brain works. Scientists working in the AI field try to increase the functions of AI by trying to implement some of the same methods used by our brains. Advances in AI have been slow, but I've no doubt that artificial intelligence will eventually be indistinguishable from regular human intelligence. There are of course many ethical questions raised by the idea of human-like AI. What defines consciousness? There is no clear answer to that question, but the discussions are very interesting.The part on the biotechnological revolution was my least favorite. Medical care is getting better all the time. The mapping of the human genome will increase our ability to detect and treat diseases. The ethics of genetic engineering is also discussed. All of this is well and good, but it didn't get my imagination going like the previous section. I just hope I can afford the amazing medical care that will be available in the future. I sure as hell can't afford it now.Many of the topics spoken about for the quantum revolution seem to be very far away in the future. Cold fusion and interstellar travel are amazing, but still just a dream. The conceptual ideas put forth were interesting and thought provoking, but most will not be realized in my lifetime. Therefore, this part was bittersweet to me.I enjoyed the book overall. Dry at times, but I'm glad I read it through. I will definitely look for more reading material about artificial intelligence."
25,0385484992,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3186291-leon-m,4,"Split into three parts each giving an overview of one major revolution science is going through this very moment, Kaku's ""Visions"" explores the numerous miracles that the technologies of the future have to offer.In the first section, the reader is introduced to the ever-changing world of computation. Kaku deals with the possible successors of silicon-chip computing as well as with the abundance of information that will mark the internet in the future. He talks about the question of artifical intelligence and gives examples of the present state of the art wherever possible. Arguably the most interesting part can be found at the end of the passage, when Kaku goes on to talk about the social and ethical implications of advanced technology.And these implications are even more interesting and relevant for the discussion of the second major revolution in science: The Biomolecular Revolution. Kaku discusses the possibilities of curing cancer, designing children and ultimately living forever, giving detail on the current progress of science and reasons for his often optimistic extrapolation thereof.The book finishes with a depiction of the revolution that - in the eyes of the auhtor - will have the most profound implications for human society: The quantumn revolution. But while it is interesting to read about the journey to the starts and blazingly fast star ships, this part still seems to consist of vague predictions rather than solid facts.To put it in a nutshell, it can be said that this is one of the best books you will find on the future, written from the perspective of an experiened scientist."
26,0385484992,http://goodreads.com/user/show/24168531-lucas-ventura,4,"It's far out to read a book that was written before the turn of the century, which predicts technological advances that are indeed unfolding today. Yet it still provides an insightful and intriguing look into the future possibilities and directions of technology.In some ways, the predictions are spot on or even a bit conservative, yet in others technology has yet to truly arrive at the threshold. It makes me wonder at times if it is overzealous prediction, or that science is being stymied by cultural/societal factors. It makes me more concerned that we promote an active and engaged scientific culture in our country, and encourage the same in less developed nations.The end of the book lays a wonderful and inspiring notion of civilization, not divided by nations' borders or cultural boundaries, but rather a human civilization united in progress and vision. Perhaps idealistic in the current world cultural climate, it pleads this as a necessity for human survival. Indeed, perhaps the most important and meaningful vision into the future, and one which Kaku can't predict."
27,0385484992,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6584617-david,4,"I read this somewhat dated book just because I want to read all of Michio Kaku's books. Anyway, it was a fun and interesting read, which gave me the chance to compare some of the predictions and outlooks from almost 20 years ago (this was published in 1997).And indeed, it's interesting to see how some projects have fallen out of favor, while some other topics and discoveries have been made that the book didn't foresee.The scope of the areas of knowledge and research in the book is amazing, although always revolving around three major revolutions: the computer, molecular and quantum ones. I particularly enjoyed the chapter about civilization types, a recurring topic in Kaku's books.Nice read!"
28,0385484992,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8386525-briankiwi,3,"If I had looked more closely before grabbing this book on Kindle from my library, I probably wouldn't have read a futuristic book written way back in 1998--but after diving into it, the book warrants reading even today. Helped me make sense of many changes in technology that have been happening outside my sphere of immediate awareness, provided a physicist's perspective on the revolution in genetics, and gave me yet another glimpse into the mysterious world of quantum mechanics. If I have a problem with the analysis, it is that the challenges presented by climate change are not given adequate treatment--but perhaps that reflects a global consciousness that has changed quite radically since 1998--and that's a good thing. "
29,0385484992,http://goodreads.com/user/show/19223903-jos,4,"Still a very good read.Reread this book (1'st read was in 1999/2000) after having finished ""Physics of the Future"" also by Michio Kaku. Parts of this book were used verbatim in the later one, this is no wonder as we have a long way to go until some of these 'events' come to pass.In hindsight it seems to me that computer science is the only science that keeps up with the predictions. It's true that major steps have been taken in other sciences but nothing that compares to... Moore's law.Genetics is making good progress but there are some pretty tough questions/decisions lying in waiting. Questions that on the service seem so easy but turn very nasty as the euphoria wares off and reality kicks in. Decisions which may already have been taken for us."
30,0385484992,http://goodreads.com/user/show/17224480-vincent-saputra,4,"This book is not a science fiction but rather a quite logical prediction on how the science will evolve. Michio Kaku interviewed hundreds of scientists nad presented their views in this book. He argued that the 21st century science achievement will be driven by computer revolution, biomedical, and quantum physics. The three achievements will merge into one big theory of everything. What i like about this book is that it presents the science in an easy to read book for non-scientists like me. I find many ideas that can be implemented or in the trend of being commercialized.I also find his ideas consistent with what the Bible said about the future of our universe, the structure of our body genes, and the electromagnetic forces that helps connects the information wave."
31,0385484992,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3533612-troy-crayson,4,"Great book. Being 10 years old, its amazing how many of the things he predicts are already commonplace, while others are still far off on the horizon. Most, if not all seem INEVITABLE , not ""what if"" type stuff. Some of it might not happen for 150+ years, some, will happen within 5. Fascinating. Kaku is (and is widely considered) one of the best writers (and public figures) talking and writing about reality / science. Unfortunately we are too busy wondering about what a wizard is doing playing with his staff or when Justin Beiber will be shunned off the planet for sucking down far, far too much of the worlds resource on mediocrity and pointlessness. "
32,0385484992,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5256904-nicol,4,"My husband and I have been listening to Michio Kaku since the 1990a. So, even though this title is over ten years old, it's still relevant in its predictions based on current technology and mapping our leaps into advanced science with each passing year. It's about what is possible in the future of science and technology from medical break-throughs to I AM ROBOT androids to space travel. For instance, Kaku told us ten years ago that flat screen televisions mounted on walls were a possibility in our ""future."" This technology having come into being makes reading the other possibilities all the more intriguing. "
33,0385484992,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2916724-taro,5,"I thought that this book is very interesting and would recommend it to anyone who is interested in hearing theories rather than just facts. In this book, famous physicist Michio Kaku talks about how science as of now has been the stepping stone of life. During the next several years he explains how we would soon be able to take what we have learned about life such as laws of natures or DNA structures and apply it to our everyday need. Michio Kaku's prediction was that we will soon change from ""Passive observers to active choreographers of nature"" and begin to use and manipulate the forces of nature to our needs."
34,0385484992,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2309246-cassandra-kay-silva,4,"I liked that Kaku spent a good deal of time on DNA and genetic advancements. I find this to be one of my favorite fields of interest, it must be included in visions of the future. Advancement in medicine will completely change our ideas about being human, as innovated research is used to outfit more than just the wold around us. I think he covered a vast amount of topics in a very small number of words which was well met. A fairly broad overview of some of the advancements that we can expect from science and medicine in the not too distant (and distant) future. "
35,0385484992,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3202570-rishard,3,"I decided to give this book a shot just because I like Michio Kaku. Its an older book of his, but I thought it wouldn't make a difference. I was wrong. The problem I had with this book is that a lot of what he predicted already came true by now (which proves that this guy is awesome). So all in all a lot of it was kind of boring and uninteresting. I did learn quite a few other things though that I hadn't previously so it wasn't a complete waste. All in all I'd say you can skip this book if you haven't already read it. "
36,0385484992,http://goodreads.com/user/show/18203243-stuart,4,"A fascinating read for the non-scientist (i.e. Me). Does a great job of explaining the link between quantum theory, computer development and biotechnology. He then projects those theories into the future. Written in 1997 I believe, it is interesting to see that many of the projections he has written of thru 2020 have in fact come true. It gave me a good grounding that will help me better understand these topics when they come up in news or science journals. His style is easy to read and peppered with enough ordinary references to make his points clear and concise. "

He is a brilliant man, and although the future is hard to predict with a high degree of accuracy, especially if we try to predict further and further, he does a good job of doing it interviewing and articulating thoughts of the people who make the future happen. The future is spectacular. I cannot wait =)."

From the first 4 pages I knew that buying this book was worth it.Even though it was published in 1997, and hence it is a bit outdated, that doesn't spoil the book much. I'd say it is quite amusing because of it, since we can see how well his predictions were made.The language is perfect for people who aren't as deep into science, and it's very comprehensible.I gained So much knowledge from this one book!"

I got around this by reading a bit at a time, as it is conveniently separated into sub-sections of a common theme. Some of the predictions Michio Kaku made (published in 1998) have already come true, and others seem just as likely. I'd recommend it."

48,0385484992,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3398610-wendi,4,I admire Michio Kaku. His ability to explain scientific concepts in such a way that anyone can understand is truly a gift. His work is certainly worth reading. I find this book to be both enlightening and scary. Where will the future lead us?

53,0385484992,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2235467-john-meigs,5,I was the only one from F'99 to read this. I remember this book keeping me safe in a tent in Colorado while a bear was rummaging through our camp.
