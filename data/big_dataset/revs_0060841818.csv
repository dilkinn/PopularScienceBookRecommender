Particularly those by Scott Altran, Sam Harris, Seth Lloyd, Alison Gopnik, Esther Dyson, Jean Paul Schmetz, Nasim Nicholas Taleb, Carlo Rovelli, Kai Krause, and Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi."
1,0060841818,http://goodreads.com/user/show/175635-trevor,2,"This is what I would call a toilet book – the kind of reading matter that one keeps beside the toilet to be read in snatches. Most the articles go for three pages at the longest. What is particularly surprising is that the least interesting responses to the question of what you believe were from the most famous people. Dawkins, Davies, McEwan and even Diamond presented dull as dishwater articles – in fact, you could nearly guess exactly what each of them would say before reading their articles. The worst articles were the ones that said effectively, “I believe there is no God, but I can’t prove it” – oh, enough already. As an atheist I have the right to say that there are very few things as boring as atheism. After you’ve said, ‘there is no god’, there’s not a whole lot of interest left in the conversation. Take Richard Dawkins saying ‘I believe design comes late in the universe’. That is much less interesting than if he had found something to say more directly related to his real speciality of biology – something like, “I believe the mongo-pongo ant will one day be shown to have a additional penis in what has always been taken to be its earlobe. Other specialist friends of mine have laughed at me at dinner parties when I’ve suggested this, but by God, if it’s not a penis it damn well looks like one!” (is it just me that finds the idea of Dawkins at a dinner party deeply troubling?)That belief would have been interesting, but effectively saying ‘there is no god’ once again just isn’t. You see, the point of this book was for clever people to come up with stuff they believe to be true even though they don’t have any proof for it. But too many – particularly at the start (and so I was nearly going to stop a few times) said things like Michael Shermer, “Science as a method, and naturalism as a philosophy, together form the best tool we have for understanding reality.” And that’s what you believe, but can’t prove? Yes, indeed, I know, but boring. Other people I’d never heard of before said much more interesting things. Jean Paul Schmetz for example says, “I believe that most ideas taught in Economics 101 will be proved false one day” – now, there is an interesting thing to say. There is something you can chat about over a beer down the pub! Isn’t that more interesting than McEwan’s ‘No part of my consciousness will survive my death’ or the seemingly endless string of people who said ‘we are not alone in the universe’ – yes, yes, yes… But virtually everyone likely to be reading this book is also very likely to have just that same belief. If you were going to do a ‘life in space’ belief I would have much preferred if someone had said something like, “I believe there will never be a silicon based life-form found in the universe.” There, balls have been put on the line. But to say that some form of life will be found somewhere in a near infinite universe – that brings ho into far too close contact with hum.I have to admit that I did like some of the people who confirmed some of my pet prejudices – you know, that there will be no multiverse or that string theory will be proven to be silly – but I much preferred the ones that said things like, “I don’t believe in time” or “why not assume that consciousness does not play a significant role in human behaviour?” – now those are interesting beliefs to have.So, what do I believe, but cannot prove? I'm going to put myself out there and say that Shakespeare wrote the works of Shakespeare. I know, it sounds impossible, but I’m a crazy kind of guy. "
2,0060841818,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4771466-john-martindale,3,"I've read some atheist who ludicrously claim they hold no beliefs, they go about mocking faith and gloat about how they only have knowledge based on reason and science, he he... Considering these happily deluded pseudo-skeptics and ""free-thinkers"", I appreciated these quotes from this book:""I’ve always found belief a bit difficult; most of what I believe to be true lies far beyond my ability to prove it. As far as knowledge goes, I’m a consumer and sometimes a distributor, not a producer. My beliefs are based on faith in other people and in processes and institutions. The same is true for most of us. Those who can prove their beliefs in their own field of expertise still rely on faith in others when it comes to other fields. To continually acknowledge this would make every utterance tentative, encrust every concept with ceteris paribus clauses. But when faced with a question about our beliefs, the role of faith in people and social institutions has to be credited.""""I can prove almost nothing I believe in. I believe the earth is round but I cannot prove it, nor can I prove that the earth revolves around the sun or that the naked fig tree in the garden will have leaves in a few months. I can’t prove that quarks exist or that there was a Big Bang—all of these and millions of other beliefs are based on faith in a community of knowledge whose proofs I am willing to accept, hoping they will accept on faith the few measly claims to proof I might advance.""""When considering the Edge Question, one has to remember the basis of the scientific method: formulating hypotheses that can be disproved. Those hypotheses that are not disproved can be believed to be true until disproved. Since it is more glamorous for a scientist to formulate hypotheses than it is to spend years disproving existing ones proposed by other scientists, and unlikely that someone will spend time and energy trying to disprove his or her own statements, our body of scientific knowledge is surely full of hypotheses that we believe to be true but will eventually be proved false.""""First, and most simply: Everything. In a strict Popperian reading, all the things I “know” are only propositions I have not yet falsified. They are best estimates—hypotheses that so far make sense of all the data I possess. I cannot prove that my parents were married on a certain day in a certain year, but I claim to “know” that date quite confidently. Sure, there are documents, but in fact in their case there are different documents, presenting two different dates. I recall the story my mother told to explain that, and I believe it, but I cannot prove I am right. I know Newton’s laws—and, indeed, believe them—but I also now know their limitations and imprecisions and suspect that more surprises lurk in the future."""
3,0060841818,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2436371-dennis-littrell,5,"Brilliant idea leading to a most fascinating and enlightening readThis seemingly modest little book with a cartoon like cover is in my (in this case clearly) humble opinion one of the best books of 2006. John Brockman, who is a man with a gift for editing the scientific mind and for getting the most from people who are not necessarily at their best when writing for a general readership, is the force behind the idea for this book. The idea is something close to a stroke of genius: get an all-star line up of today's leading scientists and cultural mavens to go on record about what they believe but cannot prove. Simple idea. Profound consequences.Normally if you ask scientists to describe the future or what they think is really happening at the edge of their discipline, or what they think is going on scientifically in fields outside their area of expertise, you are liable to get some carefully worded, very guarded opinions. But free the scientists from the responsibility of scientific rigor for the moment and just let them tell us what they think based on their unique knowledge and long experience, and guess what? You are liable to get the kind of candor that otherwise would not be forthcoming. And what is more, you are going to get, as it happens, some very significant predictions about the future. That is what happened here.Some highlights:Anthropologist Scott Atran writes, ""There is no God that has existence apart from people's thoughts of God. There is certainly no Being that can simply suspend the (nomological) laws of the universe in order to satisfy our personal or collective yearnings and whims--like a stage director called on to improve a play."" But, he adds, we can suspend belief in what we ""see and take for obvious fact."" He calls this the quest for ""nonapparent truth."" (p. 47) Independent scholar Judith Rich Harris adds to natural selection and sexual selection the intriguing possibility of ""parental selection"" in which in tough times parents select which infants to keep. Stir this factor into the mix and evolutionary changes can take place very quickly. She cites skin color and hairiness as examples of the kind of superficial changes that we would notice. (p. 66)Psychologist Nicholas Humphrey writes, ""I believe that human consciousness is conjuring trick, designed to fool us into thinking we are in the presence of an inexplicable mystery. Who is the conjuror, and what can be the point of such deception? The conjuror is the human mind itself, evolved by natural selection, and the point has been to bolster human self-confidence and self-importance--so as to increase the value we each place on our own and others' lives."" (p. 111)Cognitive scientist Alison Gopnik believes that ""the problem of capital-C Consciousness will disappear in psychology just as the problem of life disappeared in biology...The vividness and intensity of our attentive awareness...may be completely divorced from our experience of a constant first-person I."" (p. 139)This reflects my belief that the so-called problem of consciousness is a problem of a confused conjoining of two or three aspects of awareness. Here Gopnik points to pure awareness AND self-identify, which are really separate phenomenon often thrown indiscriminately together as ""consciousness.""Neurobiologist William H. Calvin in his essay beginning on page 142 makes a distinction between ""our kind of consciousness"" which depends heavily upon language, and other possible consciousnesses.Psychology professor Robert R. Provine turns the consciousness question on its head with this: ""Instead of wondering whether other animals are conscious, or have a different, or lesser, consciousness than ours, should we be wondering whether our behavior is under no more conscious control than theirs?"" (p. 147)Some of the essays by physicists are concerned with whether there are many universes instead of just one, or even if there are an infinite number of universes. Some of the other pieces by physicists concern the nature of time, string theory and quantum mechanics. Physicist Carolo Rovelli writes, ""I am convinced, but cannot prove, that time does not exist..."" (p. 229) This is consistent with an idea I got from one of my students some years ago: Time is a mathematical point.I found some of the speculations not so agreeable. Philosopher Daniel Dennett's belief that ""acquiring a human language...is a necessary precondition for consciousness..."" seems almost silly, even in consideration of the qualifications that follow. (See page 124.)I found philosophy professor Rebecca Goldstein's essay (pp. 84-85) on scientific theories mostly impenetrable, and I could not disagree more with neurobiologist Leo M. Chalupa's statement that ""...we will eventually succeed in discovering all there is to discover about the physical world..."" (p. 174) Science writer Margaret Wertheim shares what is clearly the majority opinion, writing, ""...there will always be things we do not know--large things, small things, interesting things, and important things."" (p. 176)The essays are all short, the longest perhaps a thousand words, the shortest a sentence or two. They are arranged roughly by discipline or area of interest (the ones on consciousness, for example, are all more or less together, one after the other). It is evident that the contributors, before finalizing their essays, were able to read the other essays in the book because in some cases one writer would refer to something another wrote.This is the kind of book that needs to be returned to after some serious thought and after further reading. Even though the essays are short they require deep reflection. Some of the essays are brilliant and reflective of some of best scientific and cultural thinking going on today.--Dennis Littrell, author of “The World Is Not as We Think It Is”"
4,0060841818,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1096492-kevan,3,"This book includes tiny essays (no more than four pages each, sometimes as short as a paragraph) by the world's smartest people about their hunches, estimates, guesses about a broad range of topics. It's a pretty thoughtful survey that results in a lot of interesting ideas. Some of the more interesting concepts and quotes:""I believe that the human race will never decide that an advanced computer possesses consciousness.""""We will find ways to circumvent the speed of light as a limit on the communication of information""""We will find another Earthlike planet within a decade.""""I believe nothing to be true if it cannot be proved.""""No part of my consciousness will survive my death.""""People gain a selective advantage by believing in things they cannot prove."" ""There is no God that has existence apart from people's thoughts of God.""""There is a God, it's not me (and it's also not you).""""I believe that there is an external reality, and that you are not all figments of my imagination""""I believe in true love.""""I believe that neuroscientists will never have enough understanding of the neural code, the secret language of the brain, to read people's thoughts without their consent.""Then, outside of the actual arguments and suggestions were some well-worded statements about life and beliefe in general:""Beliefs that one cannot prove are often wrong (as demonstrated by the contradictory beliefs in these pages). But they are also often healthy, and they are essential in science."" (Carlo Rovelli) Also from Rovelli: ""I also believe but cannot prove that we humans have the collaborative instinct. This instinct will eventually prevail over the shortsighted, egoistic, and aggressive instinct that produces exploitation and war.""""How do we remember the past? I have been puzzled by my ability to remember my childhood even though most of the molecules in my body today are not the same ones I had as a child."" (Terrence Sejonowski)""Zen is wrong..."" -- or, being a happy human is not about savouring the moment. ""Spend your life in the eternal bliss of always having something to hope for, something to wait for, plans not realized, dreams not yet come true. Make sure you have new points on the horizon, that you deliberately create. And at the same time relive your memories, uphold and cherish them, keep them alive and share them, talk about them. Make plans and take pictures."" (Kai Krause)All in all, by its very nature, this book was a thought-provoking read. I gave it three stars because a lot of it sailed clear right over my head: mathematicians and physicists and neuroscientists making no attempt to make their fields accessible to laypeople. I mean, you can't fault them: you're asking them to talk about things they can't prove, when ""proving things"" is the one thing they are very, very good at. They HAVE to include minutiae and industry-specific terminology to even talk about the topic. As a result, I had no idea what 1/4 of the book was talking about."
5,0060841818,http://goodreads.com/user/show/772165-parksy,4,"Very interesting read. Check out Edge.org... it's all there, plus more. Very thought provoking.From Publishers WeeklyThe title's question was posed on Edge.org (an online intellectual clearing house), challenging more than 100 intellectuals of every stripe—from Richard Dawkins to Ian McEwan—to confess the personal theories they cannot demonstrate with certainty. The results, gathered by literary agent and editor Brockman, is a stimulating collection of micro-essays (mainly by scientists) divulging many of today's big unanswered questions reaching across the plane of human existence. Susan Blackmore, a lecturer on evolutionary theory, believes ""it is possible to live happily and morally without believing in free will,"" and Daniel Goleman believes children today are ""unintended victims of economic and technological progress."" Other beliefs are more mundane and one is highly mathematically specific. Many contributors open with their discomfort at being asked to discuss unproven beliefs, which itself is an interesting reflection of the state of science. The similarity in form and tone of the responses makes this collection most enjoyable in small doses, which allow the answers to spark new questions and ideas in the reader's mind. It's unfortunate that the tone of most contributions isn't livelier and that there aren't explanations of some of the more esoteric concepts discussed; those limitations will keep these adroit musings from finding a wider audience. (Mar.)Copyright © Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.From BooklistIn this informative and often surprising book, more than 100 notable scientists and scholars answer the question, ""What do you believe even though you cannot prove it?"" The responses range from the thought-provoking to seemingly trivial (or just plain silly). Professor of cosmology and astrophysics Martin Rees, for example, admits that he believes intelligent life is unique to our world (in sharp contrast to many of his fellow contributors). Alun Anderson, senior consultant to New Scientist magazine, believes cockroaches are conscious. Mathematician and science-fiction novelist Rudy Rucker believes in a multiplicity of universes. Susan Blackmore, who has written widely on the subject of consciousness, appears to believe that she doesn't exist. The contributors touch on a broad spectrum of subjects, from religion to science and many points in between. Although some of the responses are arrogant or nitpicky, the majority are thoughtful, honest, and revelatory of the contributors' own intellectual and philosophical biases. And the book certainly gets us thinking about our own deeply held, if entirely unprovable, beliefs."
6,0060841818,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2144363-alexia,4,"It’s taken a couple attempts to finish this book, but I’m glad I did. I was lost for some of the astrophysics entries; there seemed to be too many complex terms and obscure theories that overwhelmed my science knowledge. But, thankfully, that didn’t happen very often. Most of the entries provided new points of view for phenomenon I was familiar with (or able to easily research and understand). I’m somewhat familiar with evolution, but hadn’t thought about evolution in relation to beliefs. One essayist stressed the importance of cultural evolution in belief; that ancient beliefs about the sacred and profane have been “selected over time and in different situations and therefore might be worthy of belief”. Hearing the beliefs of scientists is more interesting to me than hearing something more concrete like their research, because it reminds me of the humanity behind science. The scientific method accrues evidence rather than finds truth (one scientist insisted that he believes cell phones are harmless, but can’t prove so—which must be very frustrating). This being so, scientists must be constantly skeptical and their skepticism always provides new research opportunities. But there is always a choice in what to research and that choice is impacted by belief. If you believe cell phones are harmless, as many do, you won’t pursue that as a research topic. You will pursue something you believe needs to be investigated. Belief plays a part in science and it’s refreshing to read a book that at least partly acknowledges that.This book is also a nice reminder that the scientific community isn’t united. For every essay favoring something like free will, there is one against it. But all essays don’t stand in opposition to one another; many just demonstrate that there is so much that we don’t know. Autism, consciousness, dreams, language acquisition and most function of the brain are still a mystery. I look forward to seeing how in 10 years my beliefs change as a result of emerging knowledge."
7,0060841818,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7976644-david-miller,3,"I'm not convinced that this was a great idea for a book. It reads like an internet forum (which is more or less what it actually started as), where some people write at length and others can barely be bothered to go beyond a few sentences. For instance, they put Richard Dawkins' name on the back cover, presumably to attract sales, but his contribution amounts to a single paragraph. It contains an interesting idea, but it's over and then we're on to someone else's two cents. That's not very satisfying over the long term, so it's a good thing that reading it isn't a long-term proposition.Some of it is really interesting and thought-provoking stuff. Many of the answers contradict one another and indicate exciting and different ideas about life and the universe. Some ideas are not conventional or apparently far-reaching, but remain interesting. Do the ravens of Alaska and British Columbia ""speak"" in different dialects? I don't know, but George Dyson seems to think they might, and quirky little ideas like that are a nice distraction from wondering whether or not the universe is infinite.Incidentally, out of 109 contributors to this book, 15 are women (I arrived at these numbers by counting them, so I might be slightly off). As for what *I* believe but cannot prove, I believe it would have been possible to assemble a comparable body of ""today's leading thinkers"" with a more equal gender ratio."
8,0060841818,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4574713-zenyatta,4,"http://www.edge.org/annual-questionsThe reader is not expected to agree with everything written in this book, which would probably defeat the point of its premise - but it allows the reader to examine a wide range of interesting theories and personal beliefs set in the anthology - the clarity and conciseness with which many of these have been espoused making it a digestible perusal even for average readers like myself.Highly recommendable."
9,0060841818,http://goodreads.com/user/show/62655754-churchill-osimbo,3,"A completely humbling experience. Reading this book feels like those existential conversations you have with your sister on a Sunday morning, it's exciting.

11,0060841818,http://goodreads.com/user/show/52557863-grrlscientist,3,"The Seed Media Offices recently sent a book to me to review. This book, 
What We Believe But Cannot Prove: Today's Leading Thinkers on Science in the Age of Certainty
 (2006, Harper Perennial) is edited by John Brockman, publisher of Edge. The book is a collection of essays written by more than 100 scientists and other leading scholars in response to the question, ""What do you believe even though you cannot prove it?"" Each essay is blog-length, ranging between five words and approximately 800–1000 words, so it makes for interesting thought experiments that you can easily read and contemplate while waiting for the bus, for example.I enjoyed this pleasant little book and its bite-sized essay format. Even though the writing can be rather dry in places, and it is sometimes repetitive, the topics discussed are very interesting. The contributors discuss everything from mathematics, computer software and the Big Bang to evolution, consciousness and whether there is a God.I was particularly intrigued by linguist John McWhorter's essay. He says that human languages evolve towards complexity rather than simplicity, unless they are a blend of two or more languages. He also observes that subjugated peoples tend to modify the dominant people's language, creating a sort of ""pidgin"" form that is a simplified form of the dominant language combined with strong influences from the subordinant language(s). One example is the Afrikaans language, which is Dutch modified by several local African languages spoken by the Khoikhoi, Xhosa and later, by the Zulu peoples.So, based on these data, McWhorter believes that three strangely streamlined languages spoken on the Indonesian island of Flores resulted from blending the language(s) spoken by humans with the language(s) spoken by the so-called ""hobbits"", an extinct species of Homo that were recently described. He writes;So isn't it interesting that the island those [unusual] languages are spoken on is none other than Flores, which had its fifteen minutes of fame last year as the site where skeletons of ""little people"" were found. Anthropologists have hypothesized that this was a different species of Homo. While the skeletons date back 18,000 years ago or more, local legend recalls ""little people"" living alongside modern humans - little people who had some kind of language of their own and could ""repeat back"" in the modern humans' language.But wait, there's more. If interspecies communication doesn't interest you, there is a smorgasbord of topics to read about. For example, Professor of Cognitive Science, Alison Gopnik, believes that babies and young children are actually more conscious than adults. George Dyson, an Historian of Technology, believes that bird dialects correspond to indigenous human language groups. Philosophy Professor Daniel Dennett believes that acquiring a human language is a necessary precondition for consciousness. Terrence Sejnowski, a Computational Neuroscientist, believes that memories are stored in the connective tissue located in the extracellular space within the brain. Independent Scholar and Theoretician, Judith Rich Harris, believes there are three processes (not two) involved in human evolution; natural selection, sexual selection and parental selection. Robert Sapolsky, a Neuroscientist at Stanford University, believes that there is no god(s) nor such a thing as a soul (whatever the religiously inclined of the right persuasion mean by that word). Psychologist David Buss believes that true love exists.Each belief is well-argued using both existing data and as well as speculation, or ""flights of fancy"", if you will. One thing that I wish could have been part of this book was a discussion between contributors who wrote about the same topics, particularly when their beliefs conflicted. But maybe that's something best left to blogs instead.NOTE: Originally published at ScienceBlogs on 20 March 2006."
12,0060841818,http://goodreads.com/user/show/782114-nathan-albright,1,"Quite bluntly, this book is a load of rubbish.  There is a sense of irony that few of the supposedly ""great thinkers"" of this book seem to get, and that is that a lot less is certain that the writers included here tend to think.  Most of the writers (although mercifully not all) are atheists of a particularly unfortuante kind, the kind that are unaware of their own dependence on assumptions and presumptions about that which is true.  A great many of the authors, even worse, have a degree of contempt for biblical morality and the God of heaven and earth that is unacceptable and certainly unbecoming of anyone who wishes to be viewed as a great thinker.  Invocations to supposed sky gods and nasty comments about religion being the source of evil and other falsity fills this book.  The certainty that many of these readers seem to possess is the certainty of people who are blindly sailing towards icebergs in the North Atlantic or poking at sleeping bears or partying on a meteor that is headed into a planet, blithely unaware of their folly and doom.That is not to say that there is nothing in this book worth reading.  If you want to read a lot of snarky and condescending comments from idiots who consider themselves to be brights, and who look down on those of decent behavior and godly lives, this book is for you, and may warm your own dark and prejudiced heart.  When the authors move beyond their mistaken presuppositions about that which has been proven and move into the realm of that which they consider unproven, there is more to appreciate, at least a little, even if the authors show themselves most interested in a very small set of problems.  While one or two may ponder about the afterlife and desire their own forms of immortality despite the absence of belief in a future judgment and in eternal life in some form or fashion, most of the people here spend their time writing about problems of consciousness or quantum mechanics or the mind-body-brain problems.  The best of the lot ponder the lack of interest that psychology has in questions of faith and religion, pointing out that what billions of people on earth consider important is worth researching on those grounds alone, while most of the rest seem to lack curiosity in anything outside of their own minds, in which they have a great degree of confidence in.The editors and publishers of this book should be ashamed of themselves.  This book purports to be the sort of book that is inspired by the post-cocktail wonderings of a group of naval gazing pseudointellectuals who view their own intellects positively and seem to think that they are writing mainly for other people like themselves and not those who do not believe in the same things.  This is clearly written for an in-group audience of people who fancy themselves to be leading lights engaged in normal research that will solve what are viewed to be important problems that would make the universe entirely mechanistic or deterministic and deal with the last few doubts in their own capacity to understand the universe and to control it and harness it for their own benefit.  Yet the authors make all kinds of assumptions about that which is supposedly already proven and have all the certainty of scientists in the age when Newtonian mechanics was viewed to be triumphant with nothing left but a few problems to uncover and some greater understanding of various issues in string theory or quantum mechanics and human consciousness before we take our place as one of a numerous of sentient species in the galaxy seeking an age of peace and harmony under the rule of enlightened philosopher kings."
13,0060841818,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3668071-lisa-kucharski,4,"Probably would give this more a 3.5 star rating. Things I liked about the book was that it really was a smattering of shared ideas about what people think will be proved true. Like there is life out there somewhere in the universe. (not a surprising thought but one that popped up a lot.) There was other common un-provable ideas. One thing that popped up that I found (unsurprising) a bit of a ""come on people"" was the semantic responses of what can be proved, and what makes something provable etc... It's a little akin to taking the situation a bit too serious or coming off a little stuffy. There weren't any real off-beat thoughts about things, but I found a lot of more interesting items came from people in the social sciences actually and one person in the realm of physics actually had a similar take on quantum mechanics as I did. The system to explain it now is too quirky and at some point an simpler explanation will be found at some point where it can be understood if not explained more thoroughly! And, another person said that one has a hard time accomplishing things if you don't believe in something just the simple having faith (taking a leap of faith) on your own ideas and worth- makes things happen.The downside was that there are a bunch of chapters that just didn't grab me or said something similar to another chapter but not as well. Was it worth getting the book, yes- if only to get me familiar with the website www.edge.org and to get a feel of what people are thinking in the sciences. Basically these un-provable ideas, are what these guys are looking at proving. A good way to know if you'll like the book is to check out the website."
14,0060841818,http://goodreads.com/user/show/15948490-cath-ennis,3,"Nice little collection, although there was a little too much repetition of some of the main themes (especially physics, neuroscience, and evolution). I was drawn to the evolution category in particular, where there were some real gems such as Judith Rich Harris' speculations about a potential role in evolution for parental selection (i.e. which offspring to keep and which to abandon when resources are limiting - potentially contributing to the evolution of traits deemed preferable by parents); John H. McWhorter's piece about some unexpectedly simple Indonesian languages that might point towards communication between modern humans and Homo floresiensis; and George Dyson's musings on geographical correspondence between human languages and raven dialects. I also enjoyed David Gelertner's article on the role of emotions in thought and memory.It was a bit jarring to see Jeffrey Epstein's name in there, but hey, the book's from 2006! "

""Leading"" in a predefined, narrow, way. Some good insights. Some ho hum. The (carrefully selected) scientists are the least convincing in their uncerytainty. Very few are in fact sufficiently self-reflective to convince me that they know whereof they speak. Ian McEwan is the best.

This book is a collection of those essays. This book belonged to my dad, who was an intellectual. I, like him, believe in science. However, this book was beyond my scope of knowledge, intelligence, and many times, interest. Topics range from string theory, neuroscience, evolution, to much more. I skimmed the essays on computer science, but found many of the essays in God, consciousness, and natural selection interesting. Almost all of the topics are thought provoking, but I think the book would work better for me if there was more humor laced within the pages. Some of the writing, though ALL phenomenally intellectual, was stiff and lecture-like. The wittier and less-""snobbier"" essays were more enjoyable to read...and whether I'm reading a mystery, romance, or collection of essays from scientists and renowned deep thinkers, I want to enjoy the experience. Admittedly, I may not be smart enough to enjoy a book like this...but I could see why my dad, an intellectual snob, as I liked to call him, would. "
26,0060841818,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5953092-darla,4,"Wow. Put 100 of the world's most brilliant minds in a room and get them to ask each other the questions they ask themselves, and that's the premise of Edge.org, which published this book. The question Edge.org asked these 100 people in 2005 was, what do you believe but cannot prove? This book is the collection of short essays in response to that question. Topics covered quite a range of things, but boil down basically to questions of the physical, metaphysical, and spiritual realms. Some of these topics include: Existence (or not) of intelligent life beyond Earth; our ability to eventually surpass the speed of light; whether evolution is universal and whether it has intelligent design behind it; whether or not an afterlife exists; what is a soul; what is the nature of science; the existence of cannibalism/slavery/racism as natural parts of humanity; what is free will and do we have it; is global warming real; what are memories and where are they stored; what is consciousness and is there a collective human consciousness; the existence of multiverses (in many forms); what is human nature. An idea that particularly spoke to me is that the ""Then"" philosophy of life is more correct, or at least more fulfilling, than the ""Zen"" outlook on life; that is, that anticipations and memories are more pleasurable than simply living in the moment. A few essays were dry and difficult to get through even the page or two devoted to them (read: the few essays written by pure mathematicians, who attempted to introduce math proofs into their answers)--But on the whole, this was a very interesting, engaging, stimulating, quick read. It is definitely a book I will keep in mind for using excerpts in future college science classes that I teach."

And, I concede, that in several entries, I was inspired and challenged by the original theories posed about everything from the origin of the universe to whether or not animals have feelings to Armageddon and the existence of God. However, a good many of the entries (though the foreword cajoles you into believing otherwise) are filled with jargon and esoteric name droppings, making the reading not only confusing and elitist, but also as a direct result, dull. And I couldn't decide if ordering the responses by subject was helpful or boring. I mean, it helps to understand a writer's reference to another writer if you've just finished reading the referenced writer, but, adversely, how many subtly different takes on string theory can you read before you a) start to hate that you really don't understand it, or b) just don't care anymore. I admit that many times I fought the urge to skip ahead to the next response subject. Though the ending is somewhat redeeming, composed of fresh responses and forward thinkers, over all, the book is a collection of supereducated pseudophilosophers gorging on their own academic egos and trying to outdo the guy before him. I was expecting so much more. (And where the hell is Hawking in all of this? Since when is he not considered a brilliant scientific mind?)"

It's pure brilliance and provocation wisely mingled with sound reasoning and questionable feelings. An very much needed and recommended conjuration of deep ideas and far-seeing perspectives which, while possibly wrong in the long term, presently duly pursue the intended job. Which is to stir the reader's imagination and dust of many preconceptions (though by means of some other ones, possibly) so to prepare the ground to what is possibly next. Hunches and feelings are, though many voices to the contrary, an inevitable part of the activity which founds science and in general every creative cumulative process. Belief in the positive sense, which is to be found ultimately in most of our even most trivial activities and whose exclusive affiliation to the irrational superstitious (religious) thought should be ultimately cleared out in order to express its motivating and dynamic power to the full.Many areas are touched hereby, from reflections on the concept of belief itself to quantum physics to limits of science to communication tools to social complexity and so on. Evoking criticism and enthusiasm at the same time is the least of the benefits to be expected from this little jewel of a cheap book."

He claims this can't be proved because he has called Pia several hundred times asking for confirmation, but, strangely, she refuses to discuss it.The belief, of several important figures in my life, that I should be spending my time doing something more worthwhile than reading books like this is, sadly, provable and can be substantiated by multiple witnesses.Only one of the preceding paragraphs contains even a grain of truth - have a guess which one.Yes - you're right. :)"

We’re living in a draft version of the universe, and there is no final version. The revisions never stop. / From time to time, it is possible to be aware of this. In particular, when you relax and stop naming things and forming opinions, your consciousness spreads out across several drafts of the universe. Things don’t need to be particularly one way or the other until you pin them down. … The start of a novel matches its ending; the past matches the future. Changing one thing changes everything. If we know everything about the Now moment, we know the entire past and future.” — Rudy Rucker“We have been told by wise men, lamas, and maharishis that it is supposedly all about moments — to cherish the moment and never mind the continuance of time. But ever since childhood I have realized somehow that the beauty lies in the time before, the hope for, the waiting for, the imaginary picture painted in perfection of that instant in time.

Some topics were given as little as two or three paragraphs, barely enough to say what the topic was.The second major problem I had was that some of these topics were addressed by ""thinkers"" that were not qualified to speak on them in any obvious way. For instance, is a financial analyst qualified to speak on science? Possibly, but not based on the information presented in this book.In the end, I found this book unreadable. There are some interesting short discussions that it would be nice to follow up on, but the book doesn't provide anything. The topics that are interesting end much too soon (before any in-depth content), and the rest aren't worth reading. I find it most like a collection of short blog posts that are meant to raise the knowledge of the existence of an idea, to be followed up on later through a different venue."

I'm not sure why the BBC called it the 'crack cocaine of the thinking world.' It's a rather lumbering presentation to be compared to a stimulant. In any event, I realize that it might have been difficult to edit or omit any of these great scientists' and thinkers' ideas, but the editor disappoints. Some of the presentations should have been omitted (do we really need to know the beliefs of so many cognitive researchers?). In addition, I realize that the majority of scientists are atheists or agnostics, but a good number are not. Yet, we get a very one-sided view from this presentation. I'm certainly not asking for equal time for the intelligent design folks (heaven forbid!), but there are reasonable scientists who have thought about theological issues and present them in an interesting way (e.g., Polkinghorne, Barbour).

The premise is that great minds often can intuit the truth before they have evidence to support it.This book addresses many deep subjects, including life after death, the existence of extraterrestrial life, the nature of consciousness, and the question of free will. Yet it's always easy to read, avoiding technical jargon and rarely venturing into mazes of logic that a layman would find hard to understand. This is the kind of book you can read a few spare minutes at a time without missing anything.Inherent in the premise of this book is the idea that these essays might give insight into future discoveries. I'm skeptical that anything in this book will prove particularly prophetic, but it's still engaging and tremendously thought provoking."
34,0060841818,http://goodreads.com/user/show/120859-amber,4,"When scientists are asked to describe a belief they hold, but cannot prove, the answers are sometimes cooly predictable (unproven scientific theories about human development, extraterrestrial life, or the multiplicity of the universe). Other times, however, their beliefs are unexpected (belief in true love, moral progress, the excitement of anticipation). While I find the first category of essays to sound a bit rehearsed and written in the presence of academic ghosts, I nonetheless appreciate the deep exploratory thought that pushes those beliefs through generations of thinkers. But it is the second genre of answers--those beliefs about humanity and life and love and all the wondrous mystery that makes us dream and grieve and give--to be endlessly more fascinating. These are the ineffable passions that often can only be expressed through the arts, and tend to overwhelm some artists in the process. I am excited to see them awake and alive within the minds of scientists as well. "

A lot of study. I found myself struggling with every other line, searching for context and finding nothing I could latch on to. There are brilliant minds at work within these pages - interesting thoughts, ideas, and theories I would have been curious to learn more about. The unknown and unexplainable fascinates me. I would never profess being a Thinker, but faith in the unseen is worthy above all, even if scientific minds are seeking to disprove the very essence of an intimately involved Creator. I would have liked to ""understand"" what these Thinkers were saying so passionately, but they communicated with me as though I shared with them advanced degrees and field study. Simply put, I needed to be toddler-walked through this, and because I wasn't, the majority of this book flew right over my pigtails. "
36,0060841818,http://goodreads.com/user/show/28825839-stephie-williams,4,"Another book edited by John Brockman from Edge.com. This one focused on what various scientists, technologists, entrepreneurs, science writers, and other authors believe, but have no scientific proof for; although, there is evidence that make these beliefs plausible. Of course, some are more believable than others. Also, as in most anthologies by different writers, some are more interesting than others.I found that I was familiar with about three quarters of the topics and about half of the writers. Among these writers were some of my favorites like Daniel Dennett, Richard Dawkins, Michael Shermer, Steven Pinker, and John D. Barrow. While I might not agree with them one-hundred percent, Dawkins and Barrows are amongst the very best writers I know of. If you have not read any of these type of books by Brockman, this would be a good book to start with. If you are familiar with his books, than you should enjoy this also."
37,0060841818,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1470047-david,4,"Surprisingly thought provoking, it features short, accessible (for the most part) essays from famous scientists from across disciplines (including social science) speaking of their hopes and beliefs, at times wrestling with some of the very basic questions of scientific thought itself. I haven't learned so much from a single book in ages. The diversity of voices and perspectives is staggering, with many surprises: a social scientist who studies the worst in humanity, for example, wrote one of the most positive and upbeat pieces, while a technology tycoon wrote a doomsaying piece about the dangers of our hi-tech world. The most chilling and frightening essays came (big shock) from the environmentalists, and the most difficult to comprehend came from the cognitive scientists. It's rare that a book actually strikes me as a ""mind-blower"", but this was one."

Quick to read and inspired a lot of interesting thoughts inside myself.The writers of this book are some of the most creative and intelligent people on the planet, and hearing their speculative ideas was inspiring and insightful both into understanding how the world works and how people think.Most of the ideas were things familiar, yet with reasoning very unique and fascinating. Plus the handful of unprovable beliefs that were entirely new to me. Things I had never thought of or heard mentioned before were thrilling to read. It is rare to come across ideas one hasn't heard before, yet this book was full of them. Most of them will likely be false, but even those open up new ways of thinking that will lead to other unique and true ideas."

Reading this anthology was akin to practicing scientific nihilism on concepts about teeming universes, varying levels of consciousness, infinitely reducible subatomic particles, and much more. I don't believe I've ever felt as dizzy examining, re-examining, dissolving, and then re-producing concepts of our physical, technological, and cognitive worlds. Thus, I recommend this book to the intellectually limber, or those looking to prove or augment their mental agility. Overall, another great anthology by John Brockman and many of my favorite contemporary intellectuals. "

Luckily, even the boring or repetitive ones weren't longer than four pages.The most interesting belief presented was that humans are not conscious - that is, we don't actually make decisions. We act by instinct, in the same complex ways that ants and bees do, but we also happen to be able to think about the way we're acting, and have convinced ourselves that we're actually in control of it all."

Oddly, it's the hardest to find. This one was an ILL. Everything was mind-expanding, except for some that were a bit lazy and dialed-in, and I had a minor-to-middling quibble with anyone who said anything along the lines of, ""We cannot prove anything, can we?

There was a bit of an emphasis on the questions of ""are we alone in the universe,"" ""is AI possible,"" and ""what is consciousness"" but each thinker had a different perspective.

At first I thought this would be a book by and for the anti-religious scientific contingency; there is plenty of that, but also plenty of not-that. If nothing else, this book contributed to my sense of wonder about the universe and the human experience. "
62,0060841818,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1578829-christi,5,"Each little ""belief"" is about a page long so they are quick and to the point which is great if you're not that interested in the topic and leaves you wanting more if you do like the topic. I wrote down the names of some of the people so I can follow up on people and topics. It gave me a lot to think about."
63,0060841818,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3352854-david-skip-everling,4,"Great nightstand book for the occasional dreamy pondering of lofty ideas. A new thought-provoking short essay every page or two, from a long list of very smart people (including some of my favorite authors, Steven Pinker, Daniel Dennett, etc.). In doses of a few essays at a time provides instant cure for boredom."
64,0060841818,http://goodreads.com/user/show/742737-darla,4,"What a fantastic idea -- to ask leading scientists a thought-provoking question and harvest the results into a book. Just enough of the essays were above my head (neutrinos, huh) to make the book feel weighted and worthwhile. The unanticipated bonus is that the author blurbs at the beginning of each essay have provided me with a fantastic list of books to read. "
65,0060841818,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3250423-mark-schnitzius,2,"What do you get when you ask some of our best minds a deep, probing question? Something surprisingly lightweight and vapid, it turns out. I suspect many of these great thinkers are really second rate, judging by their answers. But there are a few I suppose that redeem it. I would recommend only as a bathroom reader."
66,0060841818,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5571024-jacob-t,2,"This book has an interesting concept and great contributors. However, it is put together by the fields of writers... making the essays seem dull. It also has the effect of highlighting the truly out there theories. One author believed that evolution has a final picture in mind, and because every other author said the contrary, his lone essay stands out. Is this a good thing? In my opinion, no. "
67,0060841818,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5745063-kevin-johnson,1,Pedantic nonsense. Reviews say it is written for non-scientists to understand but most of the essays were highly technical in nature and require a significant understanding of physics and mathematics to decipher. I read through the entire collection for the few gems of intellect but for the most part it was a waste of time.
68,0060841818,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6974552-kent,3,"There were some good entries in this book by some really interesting people. I find it funny, though, that the ones who were highlighted often had some of the shortest or uninteresting entries. The best ones come from those I didn't know before. But I would be interested to know, since this was from 2006, if any of their predictions have become more plausible or falsified. "
69,0060841818,http://goodreads.com/user/show/176181-shelley,4,"The publisher of edge .org asked some of the keenest, and mostly scientific minds in the world the question: What do you beleive to be true even though you cannot prove it? Four stars just for the concept!"
70,0060841818,http://goodreads.com/user/show/212485-brigette,5,"Okay, it's true. A few of the scientists who offer up ""something they believe but cannot prove"" come off as pompous asses. But overall, this is a really fun, thought-provoking book. It is the most optimistic thing I've read in a long time."
71,0060841818,http://goodreads.com/user/show/220939-allison,3,"I found the most interesting responses came from linguists and anthropologists, while the bevy of nerdy astrophysicists speculating on wormholes and the speed of light was kind of boring.But that was probably just me. And it was still a fun read!"
72,0060841818,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1272349-neven,2,I find the Edge Question to be a very odd format - it doesn't lead to particularly revealing writing. Most pieces here seem to be either obvious or controversial but unable to defend themselves due to space restrictions.
73,0060841818,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1541796-eric,5,"This is a perfect book to read in small chunks. In essays ranging from a quarter-page to five pages in length, some really smart people say, unsurprisingly, some really smart stuff. If this book doesn't get you thinking, you're not paying attention."
74,0060841818,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3443565-wendy-palmer,3,"I have to admit to getting a little bored when reading this in big chunks but read a few at a time, and especially in areas which held special interest for me and where the essayists disagreed, at times radically, it was a much more compelling read."
75,0060841818,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1098341-jamie,2,"I didn't really enjoy this one. Too much space devoted to subjects I'm not interested in or have no understanding of, such as string theory physics. The title says it all; when one cannot prove something it remains pure speculation, regardless of who's writing it. "
76,0060841818,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5900232-heather-browning,4,A really interesting collection of short essays from some leading thinkers in their fields. In large part they cover what they believe to be the future directions in research. Made me think about some of my own (currently) unproved beliefs.
77,0060841818,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1769655-mike,3,"Perhaps the ugliest cover of any book I own. Hideous. The book itself was pretty good, actually. (I write as though I'm surprised by this fact, somehow....) This book taught me (yet again) that I don't really know anything. I'm getting used to this feeling. It's okay...."
78,0060841818,http://goodreads.com/user/show/44436428-rj-zimmerman,4,"Thought provoking, and fun to experience some new and not so new thought in the making. Prominent thinkers clearly don't always agree, but those things that aren't so objectively observable, empirical; well, that's clearly where the fun is for the folks who aren't doing the real work."

80,0060841818,http://goodreads.com/user/show/18842-chad,4,"Great book about what intelectuals in varying fields believe but cannot prove. Hard to agree with all of it, but its still interesting."

88,0060841818,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1706264-barry-j,4,"A great book full of essays about exactly what the title says. Some of the essays are funny, others very smart, some make you wonder just how wise is the writer."
