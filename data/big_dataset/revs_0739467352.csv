0,0739467352,http://goodreads.com/user/show/769943-molly,1,"This is what happens when you take an intelligent person, and casually make a few mentions of a field of study they have no knowledge of.Mr. Diamond, NOT an anthropologist, takes Marvin Harris' theory of cultural materialism and uses it to explain everything in life, history, and the current state of the world.Materialism is a way of looking at human culture which, for lack of a better way to explain it easily here, says that people's material needs and goods determine behavior and culture. For instance Jews stopped eating pigs because it became so costly to feed pigs they themselves were starving.On the surface, materialism seems very logical. Like any theory it has to be at least somewhat probable sounding, and since people are used to thinking of life, these days, in terms of materialistic values already, Harris' theory sounds logical and likely very often.But like every other time you attempt to explain everything that ever happened in the history of man with one theory, this falls desperately short of reality. Materialism is likely ONLY when coupled, sensibly, with other theories and, need I say it, actual PROOF, of which Diamond has little.As an exercise in materialist theory this book is magnificent. I would recommend this book ONLY to people in Anthropology with a great understanding of theory, less educated or unwarned people might think this book is fact rather than an exercise in speculation. As an explanation of why the world is the way it is, it is an utter and complete failure."
1,0739467352,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1713956-manny,5,"[Original review, Dec 10 2008]I liked this book, and it taught me a bunch of things I hadn't known before I read it. Jared Diamond has clearly had a more interesting life than most of us, and spent significant amounts of time in a wide variety of different kinds of society, all over the world. He says he got the basic idea from a conversation he had back in the 70s with a friend in New Guinea. His friend, who later became a leader in the independence movement, wanted to talk about ""cargo"" (manufactured goods, technology). ""Why is it,"" he asked, ""that you Europeans have so much more cargo than we do?"" Diamond thought he had come up with a good question, and wrote the book in an attempt to answer it.The core of Diamond's explanation is that Europeans were essentially lucky in two respects. First, we have unusually many easily domesticable plant and animal species. Second, since Europe is oriented East-West rather than North-South, a species which is domesticated in one part of Europe has a good chance of thriving in another, so there are many opportunities to swap farming technology between different areas. It helps that there is an easily navigable river system, and also that there are no impassible deserts or mountain ranges. These conditions are not reproduced in most other parts of the world; Diamond has a range of interesting tables, showing how few useful domesticable species there are elsewhere. Because we got efficient farming earlier than most other people, we also got cities and advanced technology earlier, and everything else followed from that initial lead we established.One objection you could make is that it wasn't luck, but rather that Europeans were more enterprising than people in other areas about finding good species to domesticate. Diamond's answer to this is fairly convincing. Having lived extensively with pre-industrial people, he says that we city-dwellers just don't understand how well they know their flora and fauna, and how active their interest in them is. I guess a New Guinea tribesman would, conversely, be surprised at how quickly word gets around on the Internet when a cool new website appears. Basically, what he's saying is that pre-industrial people tried everything that could be tried, and when they didn't find anything good, it's because it wasn't there. Systematic studies by modern scientists do seem to support this conclusion.Another criticism some readers have leveled at Diamond is that he makes history completely deterministic - once the geography was fixed, everything that happened after that was inevitable. I don't actually think that's fair. Diamond is open about the fact that his theories make one embarrassingly incorrect prediction: if it was all about being first to domesticate plant and animal species and set up efficient farming, then China should be the world's preeminent civilization. Even though he makes some attempt to explain why this isn't so, there does right now seem to be a fair case for saying that it's not only geography.Luckily, George W. Bush has been working hard to try and smooth things out. If the Western world can just arrange two or three more leaders like him, all of Diamond's data will hopefully come out the way it's supposed to, and the last few hundred years of Western history can be written off as a statistical blip. Way to go, Dubya! _________________________________[Update, Oct 1 2012]I was surprised this morning to discover that Darwin, in On the Origin of Species, expressed an opinion diametrically opposite to the one Diamond argues for:If it has taken centuries or thousands of years to improve or modify most of our plants up to their present standard of usefulness to man, we can understand how it is that neither Australia, the Cape of Good Hope, nor any other region inhabited by quite uncivilised man, has afforded us a single plant worth culture. It is not that these countries, so rich in species, do not by a strange chance possess the aboriginal stocks of any useful plants, but that the native plants have not been improved by continued selection up to a standard of perfection comparable with that given to the plants in countries anciently civilised.Does Diamond mention this? Unfortunately, I don't have a copy to hand._________________________________[Update, Mar 20 2020]We seem to be well on track. Deadly virus comes out of China, Western leaders react with a mixture of denial and incompetence as infection rates soar and their economies crumble. Diamond's analysis was so accurate that he couldn't believe his own conclusions."

“Why you white men have so much cargo [i.e., steel tools and other products of civilization] and we New Guineans have so little?”
Jared Diamond is a biologist, who had a passion for studying birds, particularly the birds of New Guinea. But as he came to know and appreciate the many native people he met in his work, the question asked by a New Guinean named Yani remained with him. Why was it that westerners had so much relative to New Guinean natives, who had been living on that land for forty thousand years. Many found an explanation in racial exceptionalism. Diamond decided to find out. Was one group of people smarter than another? Why was there such dimorphism in the amount of cargo produced and toted by different groups?The arguments he seeks to counter are those stating that since ""civilization"" came to full flower in the Eurasian countries and not in places where other races dominated, that this success indicated innate superiority. He offers a stunning analysis of why civilization emerged in the places in which it did. Jared Diamond – image from The GuardianGuns figure large in why some societies were able dominate others, but the development of guns was not a universal. The materials necessary are not equally distributed over the planet, and there are technological prerequisites. It turns out that not every locale is ideal for the emergence of farming. He offers some detail on why farming flourished in some areas more than in others. The importance of domesticated animals is considered. Diamond shows how it was possible for them to have been domesticated in some, but not all of the theoretically possible locations. He discusses the impact of germs, the immunity defense developed by more urban dwellers, and the harm those germs can cause when those urban dwellers come into contact with peoples who lack such immunities. Although ""Steel"" figures prominently in the title, and is significant in its use in weaponry, this aspect is given the lightest treatment in the book. Diamond closes with a plea for history to be redefined as History Science, claiming that, as with many other ""historical"" sciences, it holds the elements necessary to merit the ""science"" designation.While I might have been happier if the title had been Guns, Germs, and Seeds, it remains a seminal look at the whys and wherefores of how some societies came to flourish, often at the expense of others. It has nothing to do with genes. Guns, Germs and Steel was awarded the Pulitzer Prize. =============================EXTRA STUFFLinks to the author’s personal, Twitter and FB pagesAn  excellent National Geogrtaphic documentary  was made of this book.

3,0739467352,http://goodreads.com/user/show/77981-mike-shapiro,4,"Author Jared Diamond's two-part thesis is: 1) the most important theme in human history is that of civilizations beating the crap out of each other, 2) the reason the beat-ors were Europeans and the beat-ees the Aboriginees, Mayans, et. al. is because of the geographical features of where each civilization happened to develop. Whether societies developed gunpowder, written language, and other technological niceties, argues Diamond, is completely a function of whether they emerged amidst travel-and-trade condusive geography and easily-domesticable plants and animals.I'm not sure I agree that why the Spanish obliterated the Mayans instead of visa versa is the most interesting question of human history. (How about the evolution of ideas, or the impact of great leaders and inventors?) But it is an interesting question, and worth exploring. Diamond is a philosophical monist, neatly ascribing just about every juncture in human history to a single cause or related group of causes. Given his extensive background in botany and geology, it makes sense that he would look for the impact of those factors in the human story. Unfortunately, those factors are all he regards as important; he relegates to insignificance the contribution of ideas, innovations, and the decision-making of individuals or cultures. His view is fatalistic, seemingly motivated by a P.C.-era desire to pronounce all cultures equal, and their fates the product of random circumstance.A contradiction here is that fatalistic viewpoints are incompatible with moral pronouncements. (If nobody can control their actions, who's to blame for anything?) Diamond is condemnatory of the Spanish incursion into Mayan lands, but the logical consequence of his theory is that the Mayans would have done the same to the Spanish if they had been first to develop the musket and frigate. Taking Diamond's theory seriously means we'd have to view imperialism as natural and unavoidable, like the predation of animals, and be unable to criticize any culture's actions whatever.All that said... this is a fascinating and worthwhile read.There's no doubt that the factors Diamond identified had some role in human progress, however, and if you can put aside the author's predisposition towards his own field and somewhat sketchy philosophical foundation, the book is a compelling and vivid account of what life was like for the earliest civilizations. Diamond describes the evolution of agriculture, written language, and other indispensable facets of human history, giving us a crash tour through the earliest days of human history. The specialized expertise that ultimately derails Diamond's overview at the same time offers a compelling and detailed view of the rise of mankind. "
4,0739467352,http://goodreads.com/user/show/48483884-michael-finocchiaro,4,"It took me a while to complete Diamond's book (and admittedly I also distracted myself with a few Roth novels in the meantime) because of the density of the text and the variety of ideas presented. The central thesis that it is not racial biology that determines the victors in history but rather a complex combination of agriculture, geography, population density, and continental orientation is a fascinating and compelling one. The style is not academic (and did admittedly put me off by using sentences with ""!"" in them), and yet does come across as the fruit of years (or decades) of research in an astounding number of fields simultaneously: biology, agriculture, history, climatology, sociology, etc. I can understand why Mr. Diamond received accolades and a Pulitzer for this complex work written at the level that the layman, non-scientist can still grasp. The funniest story that struck me was the QWERTY keyboard one which apparently is the least ergonomic design but due to its rapid adoption by typists due to capitalist competition and afterwards its ubiquity once computers became important, it is impossible to dislodge. (I still find it easier to use than the AZERTY one here in France LOL). The one thing that struck me - and here I warn readers that I climb on my soapbox near the Marble Arch for a moment - is the abundance of corroborating evidence for human evolution and development that has solid artefacts and proof going back 40000 years and more by the most precise dating methods available by today's scientists. For anyone with a shred of intelligence to try and say the world is only 6000 years old and created in-state as it were is pure insanity and blindness. And yet, we now have high-placed individuals in the US holding these beliefs and poised to poison American youth with medieval and ignorant ideas such as young-earth creationism. If one is to take reality at face value rather than with massive filters eliminating reason and coherence from it, then one cannot possibly justify believing that all humans came from Adam and Eve and that they were white as snow and racially superior to their offspring. This book proves beyond a shadow of a doubt that just because one has white skin, that this is not a determinant in the development of the individual and his/her peers as human beings. It is critical that works like this get wide diffusion in order to debunk racial superiority theories that gave rise to the horrors on Hitler and continue to inform white supremacists and Islamic radicals and all other religious or racial bigots because their underlying fundamentals are based on patently false principles. OK, down from soapbox now. The book was well-written (if a bit repetitive at times) and presents eye-opening and inventive analysis that will help me see the world I live in differently. Highly recommended. Especially in view of the rise of revisionist, white supremacist bullshit."
5,0739467352,http://goodreads.com/user/show/115473-siria,1,"Terrible. This is one of those books which seems at face value as if it has an interesting and persuasive thesis, and indeed there are a couple of reasonable points in here, but by and large Guns, Germs, and Steel is a poorly written book, shoddily argued and riddled with factual errors. Jared Diamond's thesis is that the differences which one can observe in technological and economic development around the world do not result from racial differences but rather from geographical ones: the variety and nutritional value of available crops, the number of animals which could be domesticated, the geographical axes of the various continents. Diamond claims that this is an anti-racist theory because it points out that white people were just lucky, not inherently more deserving or more talented or more resourceful than people anywhere else in the world. However, Diamond's intention to write an anti-racist book doesn't mean that he succeeded in doing so. There are layers of problematic assumptions and unconscious Eurocentrism underlying his writing, layers which make Guns, Germs, and Steel an uneasy read: you (for the reader whom Diamond seems to hypothesise in the book is a white Westerner--there's no sense that a PoC from, say, Malaysia or Egypt might have picked it up) should not feel a sense of accountability or responsibility or guilt for colonialism or imperialism or the ongoing exploitation of most of the world's population by those living in the developed world. It's no one's fault--it's just geography!When it comes to assessing the reliability of Diamond's arguments, the fact that there are no footnotes and no full bibliography make that a somewhat difficult task--but I know enough about sub-Saharan African history to know that he characterises several key things incorrectly, and just enough about the history of the Americas to be very suspicious about things that Diamond claims. There are numerous minor factual errors, like saying that ""oi"" means ""sheep"" in Irish (p. 343). The Irish word for sheep is ""caora"", and as far as I know, there's no such word as ""oi"" (or even ""oí"") in Irish. This is admittedly minor, but if you indulge in repeated bouts of carelessness like that, you're going to make me suspicious about the factual foundations of the rest of your arguments. And indeed, while I can't assess the validity of some of Diamond's scientific claims--though the continent axis theory falls apart the more you start to think about it, as does his failure to consider the impact of human alteration of the environment--I do know that I'd expect better historical argumentation from an undergraduate history major. For instance, when about to describe the meeting of the conquistador Pizarro with the Incan emperor Atahuallpa, he says:What unfolded that day at Cajamarca is well known, because it was recorded in writing by many of the Spanish participants [...] by six of Pizarro's companions, including his brothers Hernando and Pedro. (pp. 68-69)Which of course is nonsense. What we have is a record of what six individual Spanish men--and no Incans--wanted the Spanish king to think had happened on that day. A moment's thought would tell you that there are multiple problems with using their writings as a straightforward means of assessing anything about Incan culture and society. Rookie errors like that made me roll my eyes extra hard at the epilogue in which Diamond explains to historians what our discipline should look like and how we should think of it. How about no, sir--if you've repeatedly demonstrated a lack of ability to think historically, you don't get to decide what historians should do. It's also worth pointing out that even if one accepts Diamond's thesis as persuasive, it doesn't actually answer the question he sets out to answer: why it is that European/Western societies set out to establish political and cultural hegemony over the rest of the world and were so successful at it. Just because a society is more technologically or economically complex than its neighbour doesn't mean that it automatically sets out to conquer it--that's a question you can't answer with ""geography."" You have to theorise power and social structure, and Diamond can't do that. Avoid."
6,0739467352,http://goodreads.com/user/show/954317-nate,1,"This may be the most over-rated book in the history of book rating. The point he is making is that we in Western Civilazation haven't built skyscrapers, made moon landings, mass produced automobiles, eradicated polio (or for that matter lived indoors with running water) while aborigines in certain remote outposts still hunt and gather in isolated tribes because we are inherently any smarter or more industrious than those individuals. Of course he is mostly right, but why in the 21st century is this considered such a novel idea, and why does he have to be so BORING about it? Don't believe the hype."

حلقه ی بازخورد مثبت آن‌ها را، تقویت می‌کند (به این معنا که برتری محیطی، باعث پیشرفت تکنولوژی می‌شود، و برتری تکنولوژی، باعث پیشرفت‌های بیشتری می‌شوند، که در جای خود پیشرفت بیشتری نیز به دنبال می‌آورد)؛ در مواردی که تفاوت‌های فرهنگی، یا ژنتیکی، به نفع اورآسیایی‌ها عمل کرده‌ است (به عنوان مثال دولت متمرکز در چین، یا مقاومت ژنتیکی در برابر بسیاری بیماری‌ها در میان اورآسیای‌ها)، این مزیت‌ها تنها به دلیل تأثیرات جغرافیایی به وجود آمده‌ اند، و در ژن اروپایی و آسیایی ریشه ندارنددایموند اشاره می‌کند که تقریباً تمام دستاوردهای بشری (علمی، هنری، معماری، سیاسی، و غیره) در قاره اورآسیا رخ داده‌

فوق‌العاده (اشاره به بومیان آمریکا، بومیان استرالیا و بومیان خوآسان جنوب آفریقا) عمدتاً از بین رفته‌ اندبرهان نخست این سلطه ی اوراسیائی‌ها، برتری‌های نظامی و سیاسی آن‌ها بوده، که خود ناشی از پیدایش زود هنگام کشاورزی، در میان این اقوام، پس از آخرین عصر یخ بوده‌ است؛ دایموند در این کتاب برهانهایی برای بازگویی چنین توزیع نامتناسبی از قدرت و دست‌آوردها پیشنهاد می‌کندعنوان کتاب نیز اشاره‌ ای است، به راههایی که به وسیله آن‌ها، اروپایی‌ها علی‌رغم تعداد نفرات کمتر، ملتهای دیگر را مغلوب کرده) و سلطهٔ خود را حفظ کرده‌ اند، سلاح‌های برتر مستقیماً منجر به برتری نظامی می‌شوند (اسلحه)؛ بیماری‌های اروپایی

مصونیت برخوردار بودند، جمعیت‌های بومی آمریکا را ویران کردند؛ اوراسیا پس از آخرین عصر یخ شانس برخورداری از ویژگی‌های مطلوب جغرافیایی، اقلیمی و زیست‌ محیطی را دارا بوده‌ استدایموند دو مزیت زیست‌ محیطی اوراسیا را دلایل اصلی توسعه زودهنگام کشاورزی در این منطقه در قیاس با سایر مناطق می‌داند؛ پس از آخرین عصر یخ، با اختلاف زیادی، بهترین بذرهای وحشی و حیوانات رام شدنی تقریباً بزرگ (مانند بز، سگ یا بزرگتر) در طبیعت اوراسیا یافت می‌شد؛ این امر مناسبترین مواد اولیه را اختیار مبتکران اروپایی و آسیایی کشاورزی و به خصوص اهالی «آسیای جنوب غربی» (تقریباً بین‌النهرین و ترکیه) گذاشته بودبرتری در حیوانات رام‌ شدنی عامل پر اهمیتتربود، زیرا که مناطق دیگر، حداکثر دو و اغلب هیچ حیوان دیگری، در اختیار ساکنان خود نمی‌گذاشتند؛ مزیت دیگر اوراسیا در این بوده است، که محور شرقی-غربی آن یک منطقه بسیار وسیع، با عرض جغرافیایی مشابه، و در نتیجه آب و هوای متشابه تشکیل می‌دهد؛ در نتیجه، برای مردم اورآسیا به مراتب ساده‌ تر بود که شروع به استفاده از گیاهان و حیواناتی کنند، که از پیش در سایر نقاط اوراسیا اهلی شده بودنددر مقابل، محور شمالی-جنوبی آمریکا، و تا حدی آفریقا، به دلیل تنوع گسترده در آب و هوا، مانع از گسترش اهلی کردن گیاهان، و حیوانات در سراسر این قاره شد؛ حیواناتی و غلاتی که در مرکز آفریقا، یا آمریکا قابل پرورش هستند، با جنوب این قاره‌ها بسیار متفاوت است؛ از بذرهای وحشی قابل کشت، سرخپوستان ذرت را داشتند، اما این غله بر خلاف غلات اوراسیا، مواد مغذی اندکی فراهم می‌کند، و از آن مهمتر، می‌بایست یکی یکی کاشته شوند، مه کاری بسیار خسته‌ کننده است؛لازم است ذکر شود که پس از آنکه به عنوان مثال در تمدن می.سی.سی.پی در حدود سال یکهزار میلادی، میزان کشاورزی به حدی رسید، که محصول مازاد تولید شد، آن‌ها زیستگاه‌های متراکم ،و تخصصی‌تری ساختند؛ اورآسیایی‌ها، گندم و جو در اختیار داشتند، که سرشار از فیبر، و مواد مغذی است، و می‌تواند به راحتی با دست، و به مقدار فراوان بذر افشانی شود؛ اورآسیایی‌ها، از زمان‌های بسیار پیشتر، مازاد عظیمی از مواد غذایی تولید می‌کردند، که این امکان رشد جمعیت نمایی را، به آن تمدن‌ها می‌داد. چنین رشدی، منجر به تشکیل نیروی کاری بزرگتر، و مخترعان، صنعتگران، و امثالهم شد؛ به علاوه غلات (که در اورآسیا یافت می‌شده‌ است) می‌توانست بر عکس محصولات گرمسیری همچون موز، برای طولانی مدت ذخیره شود؛ در حالیکه سرزمین‌های جنوب صحرای آفریقا عمدتاً از پستانداران وحشی، برخوردار بوده‌ اند، اورآسیا بر حسب شانس، بیشترین حیوانات بزرگ سربزیر (رام شدنی) را، در سرتاسر جهان در اختیار دارد: اسب و شتر که می‌توانند، به راحتی برای حمل و نقل بشر مهار می‌شوند، بز و گوسفند برای پوست، پوشاک، و پنیر؛ گاو برای شیر و ورزا برای خیش زدن زمین، و حمل و نقل، و حیوانات خوش‌خیم همانند خوک‌ها، و مرغ برای خوردن. آفریقایی‌ها، بر حسب تصادف جغرافیایی، با شیر، پلنگ و امثالهم طرف بوده‌ انددایموند اشاره می‌کند که تنها جانورانی مفید برای استفاده بشر در «گینه نو» در واقع از شرق آسیا آمده‌ اند؛ اینها حدود چهارهزار تا پنجهزار سال پیش، و هنگام گسترش استرانیزی به گینه نو وارد شده‌ اند؛ در انتهای کتاب دایموند اجمالاً به بررسی این نکته می‌پردازد، که چرا قدرتهای مسلط در پانصد سال گذشته، ساکنین غرب اروپا، و نه آسیا (به ویژه شرق آسیا و چین) بوده‌ اند؛ در مورد جنوب غرب آسیا، دایموند پاسخ پریسش را واضح می‌داند: استفاده طولانی مدت و گاه بیش از اندازه، اغلب مناطق جنوب غرب آسیا را بسیار خشک و غیرقابل کشت کرده بود و جنگل زدایی و دیگر فاجعه‌ های زیست‌ محیطی، از این مراکز اولیه تمدن، صحراهای کم‌آب و علفی ساخته بود، که نمی‌توانستند به راحتی با سرزمین‌های حاصل‌خیز اروپا، رقابت کننددر مورد مناطق شرق آسیا، دایموند حدس می‌زند، که ویژگی‌های جغرافیایی این سرزمین‌ها، باعث تشکیل امپراتوری بزرگ، با ثبات و جدا افتاده‌ ای شد، که هیچ فشار خارجی قابل توجهی، آن را تهدید نمی‌کرده‌ است؛ این امر باعث تمرکز بیش از حد تصمیم‌گیری شده، و نوعی خودکامگی بی‌رقابت را، ایجاد کرده‌ است، که خود پس از مدتی، منجر به ایستایی جامعه، و در مواردی (مانند اختراع اسلحه و کشتی‌های اقیانوس پیما) سرکوب تکنولوژی از سوی حاکمان شده‌ است؛ در اروپا وجود موانع طبیعی بسیار (مانند کوه‌های عظیم و خلیجها) منجر به ایجاد دول ملی محلی رقیب شد؛ این رقابت

10,0739467352,http://goodreads.com/user/show/852363-joshua-parkinson,4,"In 1532, Francisco Pizarro and a band of 168 Spaniards punctured the heart of the Inca Empire and proceeded to capture its emperor, decimate its citizens, and plunder its gold. Why didn’t it happen the other way around? Why didn't the Incas sail to Europe, capture Charles V, kill his subjects, and loot his castles and cathedrals? Jared Diamond attempts to answer this question in Guns, Germs & Steel. Why have Europeans tended to dominate other peoples on other continents? Does it have something to do with race? Were Europeans cleverer than other races? Diamond says no. It wasn't racial characteristics that tipped the scales of fortune for the Europeans; it was their geography. Their geography gave them access to the best domestic grains and animals, which led to specialization and advanced technologies like steel and guns. Their domestic animals also helped them develop potent germs, and the antibodies for those germs.The importance Diamond lays at the hoofs and paws of domesticated animals is, in fact, one of the fascinating themes of the book. According to Diamond, our animals have played an uncanny role in our cultural and economic development, both in a negative sense (human contact with farm animals facilitated the germ-exchange that produced man’s deadliest diseases) and in a positive sense (men from the Russian steppes, riding their newly domesticated horses, spread the Indo-European language both westward into Europe and southeastward into Persia and India). Diamond's point is that people living in areas with more domesticable animals (sheep, cattle, pigs, horses, etc.) gained an important advantage over people without them.For example, Native Americans had only three domesticated animals before 1492: llamas, turkeys, and dogs. Why only three? Weren’t there wild horses and cattle in America too? Actually, fossil records show huge populations of horses, oxen, and millions of other large mammals in the Americas until about 11,000 BC. What happened around 11,000 BC? You guessed it: man showed up via the Bering Strait. The American horses, oxen and other large mammals, having never experienced a human predator, approached the new arrivals like slobbering puppy dogs, and were consequently turned into steaks. In fact, it was steaks every night for a couple thousand years for the new immigrants, until most of the continents’ large mammals— and all but one suitable candidate for domestication— were wiped out.Now this is fascinating enough, but then consider that because the Native Americans didn't have any horses, oxen, pigs, etc. left to exploit as beasts of burden and domesticated food sources, they also lost the civilizational benefits those animals would have brought (and did bring to Eurasians), not the least of which is germs. Yes, germs. Because the Native Americans didn't live in close proximity to a plethora of ""farm animals"" like their counterparts in Eurasia, they lacked the ""petri dish"" wherein deadly germs could grow and proliferate. They thus failed to develop the infectious diseases and (more importantly) the antibodies to those diseases that might have protected them from the germs of invading Europeans when Señor Columbus and his crew showed up.It was for this reason that when the Conquistadores did finally show up, they were able to wipe out 80% of the indigenous population before ever unsheathing their swords— with germs— with small pox and influenza, both diseases generated by the passing back and forth of germs between domesticated animals and their human caretakers (small pox between cattle and humans, and influenza between pigs and ducks and humans). If that doesn't blow your mind, your mind is blowproof.Then again, you may well ask: “What about moose and bison? Why didn’t Cortés and his boys float up to the Mexican shoreline and find a bloodthirsty cavalry of Aztecs on mooseback, energized by the milk and meat of their plentiful herds of bison?” Diamond surmises that by the time most the large mammals in America had been digested into extinction by their hungry human friends, there was only one suitable candidate left for domestication: the llama/alpaca. Every other large mammal that remained (including moose and bison) lacked the qualities that allow for domestication.In all of human history only 14 large mammals have ever been domesticated: sheep, goat, cattle, pigs, horses, camels (Arabian and Bactrian), llamas, donkeys, reindeer, water buffalo, yaks, and two minor relatives of cattle in southeast Asia called Bali cattle and mithrans. Outside of these, no other large mammals have been transformed from wild animals into something useful to humans. Why? Why were Eurasia's horses domesticated and not Africa's zebras? Why were Eurasia's wild boar domesticated and not America's peccaries or Africa's wild pigs? Why were Eurasia's five species of wild cattle (aurochs, water buffalo, yaks, bantengs, and gaurs) domesticated and not Africa's water buffalo or America's bison? Why the Asian mouflon sheep (the ancestor of our sheep) and not the American bighorn sheep?The answer is simple: we tried and it didn't work. Since 2500 BC not one new large mammal (out of the 148 worldwide candidates) has been domesticated, and not for lack of trying. In fact, in the last 200 years, at least six large mammals have been subject to well-organized domestication projects: the eland, elk, moose, musk ox, zebra, and American bison. All six failed. Why? Because of one or more of the following problems: diet, slow growth rate, nasty disposition, tendency to panic, captive breeding problems, and/or social structure.Diet: Why don't we eat lion burgers? Because raising lions, or any other carnivore, is uneconomical. You need 10,000 lbs of feed to grow a 1,000 lb cow. You would likewise need 10,000 lbs of cow to grow 1,000 pounds of lion. That means you’d need 100,000 lbs of feed to produce 1,000 pounds of lion. Hence the lack of lion burgers on the Wendy’s drive-thru menu.Growth rate: Why don't we eat rhino burgers? Simple, it takes 15-20 years for a rhino to reach adult size while it only takes cows a couple.Nasty disposition: Here's where we eliminate zebra burgers, hippo burgers, grizzly burgers and bison burgers. These animals retain their nasty and dangerous tempers even after several generations of captive breeding. Did you know zebras injure more zookeepers per year than do lions and tigers?Tendency to panic: No deer or gazelle burgers either. Why? Because they take flight at the first sign of danger and will literally kill themselves running into a fence over and over to escape the threat.Captive breeding problems: Many animals have elaborate breeding rituals that can't happen in captivity.Social structure: This may be the most important requirement for domesticates. The best candidates for domestication live in herds, maintain a clear herd hierarchy, and overlap ranges with other herds rather than having exclusive ranges. Here humans just take over the top of the hierarchy. They literally become the herd leader (think “Dog Whisperer”).So the reason European explorers didn't find Native American ranchers with herds of bison and bighorn sheep is because these animals can’t be domesticated. Diamond contends that if there had been any horses left in the Americas, or any of the other 13 candidates for domestication, the Native Americans surely would have domesticated them, and reaped all the attendant benefits. But alas, their great-great-grandpas had already killed, grilled and digested them all.Diamond's book is a great read. If you're a student of history, it’s a must read. The way I see it, the story of man (and the story of all things, for that matter) is the story of varied states of disequilibrium moving violently and inexorably toward equilibrium. What was Pizarro's vanquishing of Atahualpa's empire if not an example of such violent re-balancing? The beauty of Diamond's book is that it seems to pinpoint, with surprising simplicity, the original source of disequilibrium among men: geography. Roughly put, some got born in the right place and some didn’t. Skin color had nothing to do with it. Race has always been nothing more than an arbitrary mark to show the geographical birthplace of one's ancestors'.By the way, if you do read this book, take note of the way we humans first discovered agriculture. According to Diamond, it happened at the latrine. We'd go out gathering seeds, eating some along the way, and then come back to camp and defecate, all in the same spot. Guess what started growing in that spot? Yes, my friends, as crude as it may sound, we humans shat are way to civilization. Thank your ass when you get a chance."
11,0739467352,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1651956-riku-sayuj,5,"Jared sticks to the basic premise and plugs every hole in his argument so well to construct a magnificent explanation of the evolution of societies. What makes the book particularly good is the intimate hands-on experience that Jared has on the wide variety of fields required to attempt a book like this. The last four or five chapters start to get very repetitive, but except for that Diamond has taken a stunningly large scale view of history that keeps you enthralled throughout the 13,000 years we cover in this book. "
12,0739467352,http://goodreads.com/user/show/198340-jim,5,"The PuristI give you now Professor Twist,A conscientious scientist,Trustees exclaimed, ""He never bungles!""And sent him off to distant jungles.Camped on a tropic riverside,One day he missed his loving bride.She had, the guide informed him later,Been eaten by an alligator.Professor Twist could not but smile.""You mean,"" he said, ""a crocodile.""That bit of Ogden Nash whimsy came into my head as I thought about Jared Diamond's Guns, Germs, and Steel, a reflection on human history through the lens of evolutionary biology. Diamond, unlike Professor Twist, is seeking answers to real world problems. In this case, he seeks to understand the plight of indigenous peoples and their subordination to European and Asian cultures in light of evolutionary pressures. Even so, Diamond seems awkward in his attempts to justify the ways of the Blind Watchmaker to men as so. One false note comes early in the book, when he departs from his evenhandedness to assure us that not only should we not hold New Guineans to be less intellectually endowed than Europeans (a reasonable enough assumption), but that they are probably intellectually superior. He admits that he can't demonstrate that superiority empirically, so that assertion strikes the reader as an attempt to curry favor by a politically correct reverse bias.On the other hand, there's a lot of really stimulating and interesting stuff in this book. Diamond talks about: what kinds of foodstuffs are necessary to support civilization; why disease almost always flowed from native Europeans to native Americans (and not vice-versa), whereas Europeans encounter many new diseases when they attempted to enter Africa; why those previous two topics are related; how innovation happens; etc. It seems like there's an interesting fact or point of view whenever you turn the page.The book seeks a complete explanation for the course of human history. It has that sort of broad, sweeping intellectual appeal that a hefty work of philosophy or science has. For example, after someone learns Newtonian mechanics, he tends to see the entire universe as the interplay between physical forces that are expressed in terms of differential equations. A similar dynamic happens here, where the reader suddenly sees commonplaces in a new light.As with most grand theories, it's important to see that there are some important limits to the analysis. While we can see why, in broad strokes, European and Asian peoples might have overwhelming advantages in human history in purely biological and geographical terms, Diamond's analysis is of no help in answering historical questions that still might strike us as large, but come within the realm of European or Asian culture, instead of at the border with other peoples. For example, it's hard to see how his analysis adds anything to our understand of conflicts such as the Greco-Persian wars, the rise and decline of Rome, the Napoleonic Wars, or the American Civil War. Certainly these questions are important, and we rightly inquire into agricultural, military, political, and culture causes for these events. In these cases Diamond's analysis is largely impossible, since we are dealing with peoples that share genetics, foodstuffs, climates, terrains, etc.Perhaps I'm nit-picking. It's an excellent, thought-provoking book. I'd just like to temper the inevitable temptation to view all history through this lens."
13,0739467352,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5293536-melki,4,"Diamond attempts to ""provide a short history of everybody for the last 13,000 years,"" AND answer the question of why some cultures thrive while others perish or are conquered by others. There is a mind-boggling amount of information presented: some of it is fascinating, some of it seems repetitive, and overly long. When my husband, who is a big fan of ""farming books,"" thinks that there was WAY TOO MUCH about agriculture. . . well, that kind of tells you something. I listened to this on audio, (all thirteen discs!), and one line really caught my, um, ear: 
Some societies seem hopelessly conservative, inward looking, and hostile to change.
 Wow! Hmm . . . right now I can think of a country that is fast adopting isolationist policies, a country that is constantly looking to the past as ""the ideal time,"" and whose politicians are doing all they can to turn back the clock, denying climate change, shunning education as ""elitist,"" and deleting scientific data from public websites, all in an attempt to stick to the ""old ways"" that have been so profitable for so few.  Did Jared Diamond, writing in the late 1990's, just describe the United States today? And will we become like one of the more primitive societies, sitting and watching while the rest of the world makes strides in science, technology, and the development of clean energy sources? Yes, our agriculture is mighty nice, and, yes, we have plenty of steel and tons of guns, but with our scientific community both muzzled, and strapped for cash, will we be able to fight off new diseases, epidemics, or attacks by biological weapons? Will we become one of those once great cultures Diamond discusses that once flew high, then crashed and burned? The choice is up to us, and I'm not feeling too optimistic."

15,0739467352,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2294090-darwin8u,4,"“In short, Europe’s colonization of Africa had nothing to do with differences between European and African peoples themselves, as white racists assume. Rather, it was due to accidents of geography and biogeography—in particular, to the continents’ different areas, axes, and suites of wild plant and animal species. That is, the different historical trajectories of Africa and Europe stem ultimately from differences in real estate.” - Jared Diamond, Guns, Germs, and SteelThis is one of those books that once you finish, you sit back and say ""yeah, um, duh"". Since I'm reading this about 18 years after it was first published and probably 14 years since I bought and first perused it, it never seemed very shocking to me. Look, certain civilizations came to dominate based on a couple random, accidental, and nonracially-based situations that combined to give the Eurasian people a slight advantage once these civilizations came into contact with each other. First, the domesticated food and animals of Eurasiaa contained more protein and more varieties of domesticated animals (pigs, cows, goats, etc) that allowed the people on the Eurasian continent to achieve a certain population density that allowed them to move from band > tribe > chiefdom > state > empire first. This density also allowed for more technological advances, more exposure and protection against herd diseases, so that when cultures collided, the more advanced societies were able to dominate. End of book. Q.E.D.Is it still worth reading? Certainly. Just because you get the basic premise of Natural Selection does not mean you shouldn't read Darwin's classics. I'm not comparing Jared Diamond to Charles Darwin. This book isn't that good, but the apparent simplicity of the book's premise only appears simple. The argument that Diamond delivers is tight and simple but hides a lot of work."
16,0739467352,http://goodreads.com/user/show/16160897-warpdrive,3,"This is a thought-provoking, deeply interesting, controversial book investigating the reasons behind the bafflingly different rate of development of human societies in different parts of the world. The main thesis of the author is that geographic aspects represent the overwhelming ultimate set of causal factors, and they played out mostly at the very beginning of societal development, mainly in prehistoric times. The author uses very broad brush strokes to develop his main themes, both in geographical terms (he treats the whole of Eurasia plus North Africa as one single entity, which he then subsequently compares with the whole of the Americas, the rest of Africa and Australasia), as well as in temporal terms (the last two thousand years of human history are virtually ignored), and even in political terms (all societies more complex than an egalitarian tribe are defined “kleptocracies” managed by self-serving elites that extract tribute). This very broad approach is compounded by his methodological tendency to artificially identify and distinguish between ‘ultimate’ explanations and mere ‘proximate’ ones; an approach which brings him to minimize aspects of cultural idiosyncrasies, randomness, and all local cultural factors unrelated to the environment; approach which pushes him to assert that the most critical influences on modern history had already occurred mostly in prehistoric times, and definitely before the birth of Christ, virtually discounting the last two thousand years of history as a foregone conclusion determined by prior developments. I have the feeling that his view is ultimately based on a Marxist-like type of historical perspective, whereby specific historical events are merely accidents, there is little or no role for chance, randomness and individual action, and where complex feedback loops, culture and ideology, religion, war outcomes and politics are just super-structural elements derived from more fundamental materialistic aspects. This view is now considered obsolete by many mainstream historians (or at least incomplete). The author also seems to have a pretty “linear” vision of history, whereby the same collection of factors invariably determine the same outcome – my personal feeling is that many historians would disagree with this perspective and state, on the contrary, that one of the complexities of the study of history is that history is not physics, as the interaction “laws” and the independent variables themselves might vary depending on the period and particular sets of circumstances: for example, the weight of geographical factors in more technologically advanced periods as opposed to prehistorical or less advanced eras. And we should always bear in mind that phenomena such as chaotic behaviour lurk even in seemingly simple physical systems, so a deterministic approach to the study of history presents many potential dangers. Even more quantitative and more limited in scope disciplines pertaining to human behaviour (such as economics) have repeatedly proven how identification of context-independent causal chains and prediction of future behaviour can be extremely problematic to achieve. Yes, it is true that the author pays lips service (in the epilogue, which is the best balanced part of the book) to the irreducible complexity and to peculiar nature of any science based on the study of human behaviour, but this attempt to dilute and balance his geographical determinism is too little too late, IMO (and the author does not fail to re-iterate, even in this section, his faith in a ultimately fully deterministic long chain of causation that can fully explain all main trends of historical development). There are also some wide generalizations in the book that are questionable at the very least: for example he uses the Spanish American conquests as a model for all European colonial expansion, and he also comes up with claims that are wrong or should be, at least, heavily qualified (such as the horse being the most decisive factor in warfare since it was domesticated 6000 years ago, until WWI – has the author ever heard of Agincourt and Crecy ? And Republican and Early Imperial Rome did not rise to military supremacy due to a superior use of cavalry). There is also, at the beginning of the book, a really bizarre and totally unsubstantiated claim by the author that “in mental ability New Guineans are genetically superior to Westerners, and they are superior in escaping the devastating developmental disadvantages under which most children in industrialized societies now grow up”. Such a statement is scientifically very dubious (like any similar statements trying promote a naive (if not racist-driven) view to connect genetics with race and intelligence - and what is ""intelligence"" anyway ?); moreover it appears almost self-contradictory in this book, as the author himself, in the rest of the book, very successfully dismantles any racist claim that the difference rate of development between societies is caused by genetic differences between the races. Coming back to the main themes of the book: the broad patterns of history, according to the author, are all ultimately caused by essentially “geographical” factors: the availability of a variety of easily domesticable crops facilitating an early adoption of agriculture, of big domesticable animals, and the longitudinal gradient (the Eurasian east-west axis being favourable compared to the North-South axis of the Americas) facilitating or impeding diffusion of agriculture, trade and technology. It must be said that the author main thesis is argued and documented very convincingly (however I must say that I can't assess the validity of some of the author's scientific claims in fields such as genetics, anthropology, botany, linguistics and evolutionary biology – and the referencing material is strangely lacking, which is slightly suspicious), and the book is brilliantly written, very readable, full with fascinating insights and rich with extremely interesting information in many different fields. It has been a reading pleasure and I learned quite a bit from it. The author's main theory of the critical importance of geography is well supported by several examples (even though it must be said that the author appears somewhat selective in his analysis, conveniently alternatively over- or under-emphasizing the importance of geographical barriers in the diffusion of agriculture, trade and technology - he also under-emphasizes the important role played by internal wars, competition and migration in the development of Europe and the Middle East in historical times) and the book contains many ideas that are, in my opinion, very important (even if not complete nor conclusive) in the debate over the reasons why some historical patterns diverged so significantly among the different parts of the globe. It is a pity that the author leaves out so many important factors, and so many questions very partially answered (such as why did Europe gain supremacy as opposed to China, considering that China, soon before the start of the big European expansion, was as advanced – probably more advanced than – its European counterparts ? ).But make no mistake – with all its problems, it is a nevertheless a good, highly readable, informative, fascinating book, recommended to all lovers of history who want to gain original insights and perspectives into the broad patterns of historical development. I definitely learned many interesting things and gained a better appreciation of geographical factors as significant determinants in the development of human societies. "

18,0739467352,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6743601-jim-fonseca,4,"Did you ever wonder if there is a certain inevitability in the way world history has evolved? Jared Diamond argues, in effect, that the giant Eurasian continent (Europe and Asia combined) was predestined to take over the world. Everything conspired in its favor: climate, vegetation, population distribution, mineral resources and even bacteria. Compare Eurasia and Australia, for example, and you find that when humans evolved to the point of beginning agriculture, Eurasia had dozens of varieties of natural grains that could feed humans and a dozen potential draft and food animals. Australia had only two puny proto-grains and no potential draft animals. No contest. Eurasia developed settled agriculture, food surpluses, dense populations, cities and complex social organizations. Due to climate and landform zones, Eurasian civilizations were then able to share inventions and culture with each other by trade or conquest, whereas complex civilizations that developed elsewhere, such as those of the Aztecs and Incas, remained relatively isolated. Even the types of germs conspired to ""favor"" European and Asian expansion. The virulent types of bacteria that developed among dense human populations in interaction with animal populations wiped out low-density indigenous societies on other continents when Europeans explored and settled new lands. On the other hand, non-Eurasian germs brought back from Africa and the New World had little impact in Eurasia. Even if you don't agree with the hypothesis, Diamond has given us a fact-crammed, yet very readable book that won a Pulitzer Prize. "
19,0739467352,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5253785-lyn,4,"Jared Diamond asks the question: why did technology develop along different lines and at different times throughout the world and then goes on to study the reasons why.Using economic, sociological, anthropological, biological and botanical evidence to examine and analyze his hypotheticals, Diamond goes on to map out the world not just in geography but in time, providing a unique human history going back tens of thousands of years and culminating with how we’ve ended up – with some people typing out book reviews on a laptop and drinking Sumatran coffee, wearing clothes from Southeast Asia and Central America, driving a car from Japan and specializing in labor – and other people carrying out hunter-gatherer activities similar to people millennia ago.Most compelling was Diamond’s rejection, and erudite refutation of many racist and jingoistic theories about why Eurasian cultures have come to dominate global socio-economics. Diamond has spent a good portion of his life living and working in New Guinea carrying out his scientific studies. He noted earlier on that his was not a qualitative analysis, he was not trying to prove which society was better than others or which cultures produced the happier peoples. Diamond opined, in fact, that he felt that the New Guinea folks were on average more intelligent, more intellectually curious, than their Western neighbors. Diamond’s goal as merely to track and examine the spread of technology, how and why it took up root in some societies over others.I loved his 2004 book Collapse: How Societies Choose to Fail or Succeed, mainly because it told a story about the lost cultures examined. We learned about the lost colonies of the Greenland Norse and of islands settled by Polynesian peoples long ago who left only fragmentary clues as to what happened. This is the more scholarly text, but Diamond still narrates with wit, personality, and even some subtle humor.Recommended."
20,0739467352,http://goodreads.com/user/show/113897-rhiannon,2,"I have this awesome picture in my head in which Jared Diamond did not write this book. He instead wrote a detailed, engaging account of the history of plant and animal domestication.""But Rhiannon,"" you might say, ""doesn't that remove his entire thesis, that geography determined just about everything about the course of human civilization?""And, I would respond yes, it does.""And, isn't that kind of removing the whole book?""No, I counter. It just removes the douche-y social Darwinist parts. Plus, if he weren't trying to prove an overarching point about the entirety of human history, readers wouldn't be subjected to his style of argument, which largely consists of applying only certain parts of his thesis at certain points (see his arguments regarding the lengths of human habitation of North American versus how those same arguments are applied regarding Africa), waving away pieces of evidence that would call his thesis into question, and neglecting to include any citations, instead relying on a ""Further Reading"" section. Removing all of this would leave the only parts really worth reading: the stuff about plant and animal domestication. Which was awesome."
21,0739467352,http://goodreads.com/user/show/79757330-philip-allan,4,"This is an ambitious book. It seeks to provide a simple rationale to explain why inequalities exist between the peoples of the world. What makes its approach fresh is that the analysis is from someone who is neither an economist nor a historian. Broadly speaking, Diamond pulls this off. His style is readable and his arguments well laid out. His conclusions about the importance in early human history of having the right plants and animals to promote the vital first step for a civilisation – that of developing farming, is compelling. I was also particularly impressed by his view that the orientation of a continent can foster or hinder the spread of farming, a point I had never considered. The book’s strength is also it weakness. Jared Diamond is very good on his own ground, and so long as his narrative is based on his knowledge of anthropology, biology and geography, all is well. Once the book approaches our own times, however, his arguments become stretched. When more complicated historical, social and economic factors need explanation, his narrative becomes less convincing. That said, this is still an excellent, thought-provoking read. "
22,0739467352,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4721762-cody-vc,1,"I will say this: he makes some interesting points about geographical and geological determinism and the potential validity thereof. Everything else, however, is basically shit. The Pulitzer this book got must have been the world's biggest and most expensive A for effort.Diamond writes in his introduction that a multi-discipline effort ""would be doomed from the outset, because the essence of the problem is to develop a unified synthesis. That consideration dictates single authorship, despite all the difficulties it poses."" He does go on to mention ""guidance from many colleagues,"" but even so this makes no goddamn sense (p. 26). It is actually possible to find people across disciplines who agree on a single theory - like, say, gravity. I'm using theory in the scientific sense here, where the fact of gravity's existence is obvious but there needs to be a framework of mechanical explanation - and this framework has the potential to be proven wrong. That doesn't change the fact of gravity's existence, it just means that one person's (or several people's) proposed explanation of its mechanics was misconceived. You can see similar approaches in the field of history. What this boils down to is, Diamond is saying right in the bloody introduction to the whole book that he was the only one who could do this glorious project and he didn't want to bring other people in because they might not agree with every single thing he's saying. GOD FORBID.This book would have benefited from multiple authorship, particularly a partnership with someone who had some actual experience with historical research and thinking, because the incessant lazy errors are impressively offensive - Diamond keeps predicating his argument on such and such historical facts, but the facts he's using are flawed and wrong. Take his chapter on the Spanish invasion of the Americas. First off, he calls the indigenous naive like the extinct megafauna of the previous chapter - I'm not kidding, he uses that exact word and that exact comparison to animals; for somebody who's so avowedly anti-racist that's a fucking awful rhetorical tactic - but the academic offense is that his primary sources for the capture of Inca leader Atahuallapa are, as far as I can tell, Spanish letters to the king and Spanish personal journals. That's it. (Nothing is properly cited in this book, which is another cringe point.) Even a high school student could tell you that you should use and cite primary sources from multiple sides of an event, cite your secondary sources, and use some goddamn critical thinking. If you look at the Inca sources, sure there's some conflicting accounts - same goes for the Spanish - but what's obvious is that they weren't naive. Diamond asserts that Atahuallpa had bad information and it was an obvious trap supported by the advantages of Spanish literacy, but if you look at all the sources the situation is more that he had the right information but chose to be diplomatic in the Incan tradition. Pizarro was just a dick. (Diamond is right about the significance of germs, but that part's a gimme.)There are a lot of fundamentally flawed arguments like that - e.g. pre-invasion indigenous people on the coast of Australia being described as totally isolated even though the historical record shows them as being brilliant sailors and the numerous islands between Australia and the Asian mainland are reachable by walking in places, or talking about the easy dispersal of animals/crops across a continental ""axis"" of north/south or east/west despite huge mountain ranges and climate differences across the terrain like in Asia - and his broader assertions are also seriously problematic. Like when he's discussing the supposed advantages of the written word (completely dismissive of pictographs and no mention of signed languages, of course) he name-checks Chinese and Japanese but otherwise devotes his syllabic-complexity argument to Roman-alphabet languages. Which, no. Focusing on the languages that are easiest for you to understand is far from persuasive. (To say nothing of the historical errors in that chapter as well.) And then there's smaller things like the series of photographs of people, all not white and mostly wearing indigenous clothing and unsmiling expressions, which is totally unnecessary - if Diamond's ""objection to such racist explanations [of sociocultural differences vis-a-vis a western capitalist definition of success] are is not just that they are loathsome, but also that they are wrong,"" then what the fuck are these pictures doing in here (p. 19)? Why does it matter what these oh so poor, less successful people look like? Jesus christ.I could go on and discuss the further problem of his trying to fit history into a science framework, when the two have different approaches for a reason - which is, of course, not to say that the philosophies and conclusions of one can't support the other - but I think the point of Diamond's colossal hubris and scholarly failure has been sufficiently made for this review. (There are critical essays by people more professionally accomplished and generally articulate than myself out there.)Is this the worst book ever? No. But it's still a fucking waste of space."

But this book gave me so much more than that, it gave me answers or some revelations about some of my personal thinking all these years.I cannot comment much about the contents, there are a lot of reviews that describe the contents well.Some interesting points on this book for me:1. In my opinion, this book has pristine description the 1966 revolution in Indonesia.2. This book has interesting theory of the losing of China vs. European since 15th century.3. I found the epilogue is reminding me some with Asimov’s psychohistory, with chapter title: “THE FUTURE OF HUMAN HISTORY AS A SCIENCE”. For people who had read Foundation, please try the epilogue of this book.There is at least one hint about a leading civilization destroying its own environment… but it is another story. Mr. Diamond described this idea on his next book, Collapse."
24,0739467352,http://goodreads.com/user/show/595788-alex-telander,5,"GUNS, GERMS, AND STEEL: THE FATES OF HUMAN SOCIETIES BY JARED DIAMOND: This is one of those books that takes you a while to read -- it's pretty heavy non-fiction -- and yet at the end of it, you feel like Hippocrates, a Muslim scientist, or Leonardo Da Vinci must have felt at the realization of a great discovery. The Eureka! moment. This book is kind of like the movie Hotel Rwanda: the movie was life-altering for me, and just made every other movie that came out that year seem tawdry and unimportant; it was one of those movies that everyone should see (especially Americans and Western Europeans) just to understand the world and its history better. Guns, Germs, and Steel is one of those books that everyone should read to better comprehend their existence at this specific moment in time.The premise of the book is revealed in the prologue in a conversation between the author and a New Guinea native who lives his very simple life in Stone Age conditions. The thesis that arises in their conversation is what specific events led to the fact that Europeans were the ones to reach New Guinea and interact with its people, and why it wasn't the New Guinea people to develop the technology and abilities to travel the world and make first contact with the Europeans.With the concept in place, Diamond sets about doing this in his conversational and, quite frankly, mind-blowing and ingenious way. As a professor, with studies in anthropology and biology, he has an astounding way of seeing things and being able to explain ideas in a simple manner that make so much sense and you're left saying to yourself: ""Oh, that's how that happened,"" or ""that's why it's like that."" At times he can bog you down with details, mainly because he explains them on minutest and seemingly most insignificant level (such as different seeds around the world). And yet you are left with that adage of chaos theory: everything on this planet happens for a reason and has a knock-on effect.Some of Diamond's ideas that I found and still find most astonishing include:The reason the continent of Eurasia was able to develop to a much more advanced level than the rest of the world, with its complex empires, cradles of civilizations, and large amount of farming and domesticated species was due to its latitude on a specific east-west axis. The other continents -- North and South America, Africa, Australasia -- are all on a north-south axis. What does this difference mean? For one, climate is greatly changed the further north or south ones goes, which has an effect on the migration of people, animals, and plants, as well as the spread of information, technology and culture. Because of this, Eurasia was able to develop more crops and have them spread around the continent through trade, as well as the spread of domesticated animals, culture and more importantly, technology. The other continents did not have this ease, which Diamond explains in clear detail with facts and dates.Of course, I am vastly over-simplifying the book and it's really necessary for one to peruse its pages to get the full understanding.

It is interesting in that it has gone into areas that I have never really considered. Would I have given thought that the ability to domesticate plants and animals was a consideration when thinking of the continental differences between the east west axis of Eurasia compared to the north south divide in both the Americas and Africa? Probably not. I suppose in the end this is a book that is more based on the environment of peoples over the last 13,000 years and with that their opportunities to use that environment that they just happened to be born into. Interestingly the book gives little consideration to capitalism as a factor in some parts of human kinds march to modern prosperity. I suppose that each individual can make of that what they will in terms of how they view their history. In the end a touch long but a minor quibble. I will read more by the author eventually."

Apart from their status as European countrymen, it was the fortuitous confluence of guns, microbes and steel technology which all but ensured their success at colonizing regions occupied by peoples who lacked such historical fulcrums. It should be unsurprising, given this lethal mixture of offense, why invading states comprised of so few have been able to conquer, kill or otherwise displace indigenous societies comprised of so many. These asymmetrical collisions suffuse human history, and it’s no secret that its retelling lends specific favor to Eurasian societies rather than those of other landmasses.In Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies, Jared Diamond, famed anthropologist and author of The Third Chimpanzee, seeks to answer why history unfolded so differently among the various continents. Not contented with the proximate explanations above, Diamond forages deeper to uncover the ultimate explanations of why some societies procured that fateful triumvirate and why others did not. Pointedly then, why does history record Francisco Pizarro and his confederates storming the Inca Empire and capturing Emperor Atahuallpa in that momentous 1532 collision at Cajamarca instead of Atahuallpa and his band of warriors sailing east, assaulting the Spanish Empire and seizing King Charles I? Were there initial conditions which facilitated the depopulation of so much of the New World by so few of the Old?Traditional solutions to these questions have revolved around genetic differences or innate disparities in race and intelligence, and it is these traditional explanations which Diamond hopes to sweep away. With a starting point at the tail end of the last ice age circa 13,000 years ago, Diamond takes a holistic approach to deconstructing the broad patterns of history. This is no picnic of a task. As Diamond himself points out, compressing 13,000 years of tightly coiled history into roughly 400 pages works out to “an average of about one page per continent per 150 years, making brevity and simplification inevitable.” (p. 408).To Diamond’s great credit, Guns, Germs, and Steel represents the metamorphosis of a topic of impenetrable scope into a cohesive, persuasive and not overly prolix piece of historical literature. He begins by surveying the natural differences among the continents, noting the variations in ecological and biological diversity as well as the orientations of the main axes of the continents, all of which had deep import for the evolution of complex human societies, namely the divergence of larger food-producing cultures from smaller bands of hunter-gatherers.As it turns out, the last ice age played a significant role in the course of our story. Compared with all other natural disasters, ice ages tend to have the most severe and lasting effects on the planet, dramatically disrupting not only climate but the chain of animal and plant life struggling to adapt to the changing circumstances. The Pleistocene drove countless of the planet's large mammals to extinction, especially those indigenous to North America and Australia. Europe and Asia, on the other hand, suffered fewer local extinction events of their large animal species. Following the upheavals of the Pleistocene, a full thirteen of the major fourteen domestic mammals were confined to Eurasia. This propitious outcome presented more options for animal domestication (defined as the regulation of an animal's breeding and food supply).“Thus, part of the explanation for Eurasia’s having been the main site of big mammal domestication is that it was the continent with the most candidate species of wild mammals to start with, and lost the fewest candidates to extinction in the last 40,000 years.” (p. 163).Of equal importance is the inequality of wild plant species distributed across the global landscape. Here again, one contender is lopsidedly advantaged in terms of ecological and topographical diversity. Home to the highest seasonal variation as well as the largest zones of temperate Mediterranean climate, Eurasia is saturated with the most diverse plant life.“The Fertile Crescent and other parts of western Eurasia’s Mediterranean zone offered a huge selection to incipient farmers: 32 of the world’s 56 prize wild grasses. That fact alone goes a long way toward explaining the course of human history.” (p. 139).Diamond discusses in detail the cultural shift from hunting and gathering to food-producing, emphasizing throughout that it was a gradual process. For those regions amenable to a new and more structured way of life, crop farming and pastoralism offered several benefits over the legacy lifestyle in terms of time, effort and payout. This precipitated an incremental transition from complete dependence on wild foods to a diet mainly supported by agriculture. Peoples inhabiting less fortunate regions of the globe either carried on as nomadic hunter-gatherers or were displaced by invading farmers. Australia is perhaps the best example: as the most infertile and biologically most impoverished of the continents, it has contained the largest population of hunter-gatherers into the modern era.To illustrate the attendant, socially formative benefits of food production, Diamond enlists the reader on a voyage of deductive reasoning to link the various feedback loops at play. In low-res, highly paraphrased form, it can be sketched as follows: Whereas the hunter-gatherer existence was nomadic, food production gave rise to more sedentary societies. Farming also created food surpluses, which provided for denser human populations. With increases in human densities came a greater variety of roles to be filled within the community, facilitating the appearance of social hierarchy and political structure. At the same time, denser settlements meant more potential for crafting metal tools, inventing writing systems, and pioneering other technological leaps, while sedentism allowed for more time devoted to innovation and skill specialization.In this way, food production served as a springboard for human innovation, which then radiated to surrounding populations. As the landmass with the most navigable terrain, Eurasia benefited its inhabitants by helping ease the spread of agricultural and other developments. When neighboring cultures convened to trade their goods and wares, technology and ideas were also exchanged, fostering competitive one-upsmanship and ratchet-scale modernization that would eventually sweep the region. Even more critical, when famine and other climate-triggered anomalies struck, Eurasia’s potential for east-west migration ensured that previous developments were maintained and that generational improvements in technology and social complexity kept marching onward.The Invisible AllyFor all of its benefactions, the advent of agriculture around 8500 BCE sponsored a most pestilential side effect: increased human exposure to deadly microbes living inside domesticated animals and plants. Food-producing societies evolved resistances to these pathogens over time, or they were wiped out. First contact with foreign germs can upset the balance of a society more than any other contributing factor, and this is exactly what happened when colonizing agricultural societies encountered natives who did not share their immunities. This was, in fact, the most important factor for each of the major collisions throughout history, including the fall of the millions-strong Aztec Empire by Cortes and his mere 600 men, as well as the largest population shift in all of human history: the initial 20 million North American indigenes being reduced by 95% in a matter of a century as a result of European conquest. In terms of their contribution to human depopulation, germs should clearly precede both guns and steel in the book's title.In sharp contrast with the heavily race-dependent, empirically vacuous speculations still in circulation, Diamond's core idea is that geographic advantage proved the decisive factor in shaping the major outlines of history. Diamond links dominant cultures to the largest native palettes of domesticable biota and to the regions most congenial to technological diffusion. Thus while literacy, political organization, firearms, advanced ship technology and infectious disease represent the proximate causes of Pizarro's overthrow of the Inca Empire, Vasco da Gama's success in East Africa, and countless other population shifts throughout history, Diamond insists it was their ancestors' home turf and enduring success in cultivating the local flora and fauna which sit at the bedrock of history's narrative.As is the case with any work of this breadth, any implied monolithic pattern is fraught with qualification. Diamond is careful to mention caveats throughout, such as some of the difficulties involved with homogenizing Eurasia into a unified landmass. He notes that food production should not be synonymous with monotonic progress in any one category, referencing the Japanese injunction against firearms and China's decommission of its maritime fleet in past centuries. The many nuances introduced throughout are a testament to Diamond's attention to detail and responsible scholarship.Closing ThoughtsOne of the most fascinating gifts of history lies in the interactions among past peoples and their ripple effects down through the ages. Guns, Germs, and Steel sits above the vault of human history, providing first-stage explanations to account for its winners and losers. To a great extent, it furnishes a new hermeneutical lens by which to view history, or at the very least a soak test for assessing historical anecdotes. While Diamond was not the first to connect environmental factors to ruling states, GGS is one of the greatest syntheses of the encompassing subject matter released to date. He debunks with crack empiricism the alternative, largely racist hypotheses for history's manifest imbalance of power, leaving a soundly reasoned case in their stead.I can only add to the avalanche of praise that has been directed toward this book. Guns, Germs, and Steel has forever changed the way I view history and make sense of modern society. It is an academic read, to be sure, but I found it optimally dense so as not to turn away readers less interested in every detail. Some have dispraised Diamond's repetition of common themes, but I personally found this helpful as it allowed the material to ossify more easily in my mind. The book also serves as a model of scientific rigor, with each chapter fastidiously referenced in the ending bibliography.If I had my say, this would be standard high school reading across the country. GGS makes the short list of books which demand to be read at least once. Polymathic in scope, unwavering in its cogency, Diamond has penned a major contribution to our historical understanding which has stood the test of time. I only wished I had read it sooner.Note: This review is republished from my official website. Click through for additional footnotes and imagery."
28,0739467352,http://goodreads.com/user/show/695116-jim,4,"THIS BOOK ATTEMPTS TO PROVIDE A SHORT HISTORY OF EVERYbody for the last 13,000 years. The question motivating the book is: Why did history unfold differently on different continents?...Diamond immediately takes great pains to shoot down any ideas of one race being more intelligent than another. Yes, some thought so, but they've been refuted for long enough that I thought he belabored the point. This section does introduce us to his method of argument which is to set up straw men & knock them down. I don't care for it much since the questions aren't always honest or complete.Eurasia is an iffy area for Diamond's purposes. It often includes northern Africa, but generally not eastern Asia or northern Europe. This makes sense in the context of the plant & animal species available to the humans of the time. Eurasia had the most species of both that could readily be domesticated. Of all the plants, only a few were readily domesticated. In Eurasia, the number made for a critical mass which led to earlier civilization. Giving up hunter-gatherer often isn't an advantage to individuals, but is to the tribes/clans as a whole. More food reserves, more specialization (leaders, soldiers, farmers), better able & pressure to compete & share discoveries.It's amazing how few plants & animals can be domesticated - only 14 large animals by his count. There isn't that much megafauna (animals generally averaging over 100 lbs) that early man didn't wipe out & most of those evolved with man. They survived because they learned early & well to fear & avoid or live with us. In almost every case where they didn't, such as in Australia & the Americas, they went extinct shortly after we showed up. Successful domestication is based on the Anna Karenina Syndrome, a name given due to the first line of the novel.Happy families are all alike; every unhappy family is unhappy in its own way.IOW, a happy family has many things right while it only takes one of any number of things to make an unhappy one. Plants & animals must have everything right to become domesticated, especially early on. Wheat needed very little modification & we domesticated it (or vice versa) very early while we still don't domesticate oaks because they take so long to mature, breeding characteristics*, & it's so hard to economically pick their acorns due to their size & competition with other animals.(* A complex of genes controls tannin production, so it's very difficult to breed a non-bitter acorn. If only 1 gene were in control, we might have domesticated them (pecans) even if it were a recessive one. Oaks just had too many things wrong.)The proximity to animals & each other also led to more disease. The originating groups of humans survived with immunity, but when they met another group without similar immunity, the new group was often wiped out. Obvious examples are the natives of the Americas & the spread by Europeans of small pox & other diseases.Eurasia also had the most contiguous land along generally the same latitude. This helped spread domesticated plants, animals, diseases, & ideas. North to south, like sub-Saharan Africa or Mexico to South America, is a problem since temperature, hours of daylight, & general climate varies too greatly for many plants & animals to survive a slow expansion across them. While humans could adapt to environments from desert to jungle, their plants, animals, inventions, & diseases often couldn't/didn't.Different environments also slowed humans so not only weren't inventions spread, but there wasn't the pressure to develop/adopt new methods or die. Sub-Saharan Africa is considered an entirely separate area, almost a continent of its own, from northern Africa in terms of evolution. Australia, New Zealand, & Tasmania were all distinct from the rest of the world & even each other.So, the answer to the central question is civilizations developed differently due to their environments:1) The number & variety of plants & animals that were available to domesticate.2) The ease of diffusion & migration within the continent & 3) between continents.4) Continental population size.He really should add a 5th - plain luck. As he points out, in the early 15th century, China was ready to explore the world, but political infighting in their unified government killed the exploration party almost a century before Columbus set out. While Columbus was originally turned down, he had multiple governments to try, one of which eventually opened the doors to expansion which led to many of them - all European - competing around the globe to grab the prizes.The audio edition of this book is abridged, although I hadn't realized that when I started listening & it sure seemed long enough. It wasn't until I got the ebook to see some of the maps & reread certain sections that I realized how much had been cut out.

His synopsis & maunderings in the beginning are interesting only from a historic point of view, although he seems to pretty much have the basics right, so it doesn't invalidate his later conclusions. It does stretch that section out a lot, though. It's cool to see how well a different science has nailed down so many questions & in such a short time.Overall, very good, but a bit dated & long. Grover Gardner did a great job reading this & I'd suggest the abridged version backed by a book since the maps help & reading more in some areas was good."

Well told tale. Persuasive, goodness knows. Maybe even partially correct, who knows, since we're facing the consequences of climate change on our civilization and they aren't good. They're only going to get worse, too. So who do we look to for models of how to change our food production?Anyway, the 2007 revision isn't different in any significant way to the 1997 version and you'll get a lot out of reading it.

30,0739467352,http://goodreads.com/user/show/807826-deborah,3,"Having read Charles C. Mann's 1491 immediately before Guns, Germs, and Steel, I was all-too aware of the dated nature of many of Diamond's assumptions about the New World. (And therefore I would highly recommend 1491 to anyone interested in learning about the latest and greatest developments in knowledge concerning the early history of the Americas.) This seed of doubt concerning the accuracy of Diamond's assumptions about the Americas prevented me from fully appreciating what he had to say about the histories of the other continents, of which I am even less familiar. True, the theories promoted in Diamond's book are not disrupted by the accuracy of details concerning the peoples and societies under discussion, but this raises another concern for me: the theories are so generalized, they don't suffer for the potential inaccuracy of described events. In other words, instead of starting with objective histories (and or/references to ongoing research into such histories), the book starts with a central premise and cites historical examples to support that theory. The central theory may be summarized as follows:* People with agriculture can produce food surpluses* Food surpluses can support larger populations* People located in geographical areas with animals to domesticate were able to use such animals for labor as well as meat* Large populations with food surpluses can support artisans and bureaucrats * Artisans and bureaucrats lead to more complex social structures and technical innovations (tools, weapons, metallurgy)* Dense populations (especially those with domestic animals) contract and evolve immunities to germs and diseases* Eurasian populations, due to favorable conditions for agriculture and their head-start on many other populations around the globe, acquired the ""guns, germs, and steel"" to conquer populations lacking the equivalent weaponry, diseases, and technology.While the central premise makes general sense, I think it's important to acknowledge that it represents a generality, and thus offers an over-simplified view of human history. Considering the fact that this book leans so heavily on theory, I am surprised that book stores typically shelve it in History and Science sections, rather than Philosophy.After that long disclaimer, I can say that the overall content was interesting. I especially enjoyed the section about the process of domesticating plants and animals. It had never really occurred to me that some plants and animals simply cannot be domesticated, or that the yields of some plants made the domestication of others less desirable or completely unnecessary."
31,0739467352,http://goodreads.com/user/show/182193-radhika,4,"I give this book 4 stars because it has some very interesting ideas that provoke thought and inquiry. It also offers plausible explanations that often ring true. I don't give it 5 stars because it suffers from certain drawbacks.I love his analysis and interpretation of causes that show why civilization arose variously in diverse and distinct locations of the planet. I love how his causes make sense. His rejection of race-based politics is quite clear. I like how his explanations lead us to reexamine patriotism, nationality, group affiliation, judgment of other cultures... There is definitely a lot to learn and what better way to learn than from someone who loves to learn/teach by engaging.Contrary to another reader on goodreads, I couldn't wait to get to the ""around the world"" chapters. That is what the book was building towards in my opinion. Towards explaining why the world today looks like it does. Jared Diamond is not much into referencing materials which is strange given that he is an academic. One could claim that this book is written for a wider audience and is meant to be more approachable and if so, Diamond makes some very bald statements which are very hard to substantiate in the absence of citations. For instance, his claim that the hard sciences look down upon softer sciences like history. I heard similar claims in graduate school. But where is the evidence for such claims and should they be taken seriously if there isn't supporting scientific evidence for it? I don't doubt that such evidence may exist if he makes the statement but I have a hard time as a reader who needs more proof. He makes a similar bald assertion towards the front of the book about the prevalence of race-based explanations for differences in development which again I know exist based on similar conversations but which I would never take seriously anyway, unless someone could show it to me using science.There is a lot of redundancy in the book. The four major causes are drummed, driven and pummeled into one. A different organization of the book could have lead to less redundancy and more salient communication of points. That said, he does still get his points across. Lovely pictures in the book. The maps and tables are a little thin on resources but the author tries to provide a reading list toward the end of the book for each chapter. The PBS show based on his book more pithily stated and demonstrated the unequal distribution of material wealth, health and resources around the globe and made clear who has benefited and at whose expense. It is not very often that any westerner, let alone an academic has so openly shown through their work how viciously parts of the human race have treated certain other parts of it. His book does make me want to go further back and look also at what lead to racial distinctions in the first place.In the new edition of the book, there is an especially interesting chapter on Japan and the Japanese people and language and how they might be Korean in ethnicity. This may not go down well with a Japanese audience with their extreme nationalism and their emphasis on superiority over neighboring cultures. However, it is perfectly plausible and a fascinating read.--www.aprilandradsdiablog.blogspot.com"

Diamond explores the key role that environments and geography play in shaping different cultures, and the ultimate factors that affect cultures most, like: availability of domesticable plants and animals, shift from hunter-gatherers to farmers, ease of population movement due to geography, north-south vs. east-west axes of the continents, exposure to various animal-born diseases and resultant immunity, development of writing and metal-working, etc. His carefully-laid argument builds a compelling case that many societies have benefited greatly from their environment, and that their success is not necessarily due to an innate superiority. The implication too is that cultures that currently dominate the global scene may not always retain that position if they destroy their environments, an idea that is more fully explored in his next book Collapse.I first read this book back in 2013 and it really opened my mind to seeing history and cultures and development through the lens of geographical factors. Needless to say one of the fundamental reasons Jared Diamond wrote it was to dispel the centuries-long belief that much of the dominance of advanced Western societies stems from racial/genetic superiority rather than environmental factors. This time I'm revisiting it via audiobook in 2020 with a lot more books of historical anthropology under my belt, and it remains a real powerhouse book of fresh ideas.That is not to discredit the many discoveries, innovations, and efforts of Western civilization over the millennia, but rather to bring a more balanced view of the world, reminding us of the many early technological innovations that arose in China, the advanced pre-industrial societies of the Americas such as the Aztecs, Incas, and Mayans, the early societies of the Fertile Crescent, and so forth. His arguments are so lucidly developed and well-argued that you might be led to believe that it was only these environmental factors that explain why some cultures thrived and become dominant in the modern world while others did not. This would be inaccurate of course. There are many ""ultimate"" factors that supersede the ""proximate"" factors, such as the focus of industrial Western societies on innovation, technological advancement, rule of law, focus on scientific reasoning over religious dogma, acceptance of cultural and ideological diversity, and the constant drive for growth and expansion spurred by capitalism, whether for good or bad. So there are plenty of nay-sayers that discount much of Diamond's arguments. I think that is missing the point. He is not providing the all-encompassing answers to why some societies thrive while others struggle in the modern world. Rather, he's trying to redress the underlying preconceptions of racial/cultural superiority that have prevailed until now so that we can reassess things from a much balanced perspective. It's the starting point for further analysis of why the world has developed the way it has, and more importantly (as he addresses in more recent books), how we can shape future developments in a more sustainable way given that understanding."

It does deal with a lot of hardcore, sometimes too dry, but mostly interesting, archaeological/anthropological/biological/genetical/historical/cultural/geographical/economical/technological developments, facts and insights through which Diamond propounds his basic argument:  why did human development proceed in such different rates on different continents; why certain societies/countries/regions became disproportionately powerful and innovative (while others lagged behind)Starting with human evolution; geological transformation making inroads with development of civilizations; domestication of plants and animals; food production; reasons for growth in population in some regions while others seeing deaths in large numbers, owning to susceptibility to particular germs; leading to factors behind the victory of particular regions/countries/ (race?) over others, this book indeed is an intensive read in terms of research and information.I need a second or third read to fully comprehend the finer points of Diamond's ""whirlwind tour"" nearly 13,000 years of history of almost everybody, but not anytime soon though..."
38,0739467352,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4042339-andrew,1,"I felt cheated by this book. It started off with such promise and like a fat person with a box of chocolates in front of them, I couldn't wait to get wired in. At one point, I decided that this book was worthy of four stars. By the midway point though I was tired. Tired of the repetition. How many times does Jared Diamond have to refer to the fact that he believes the rise of food production to be the main determinant of success for a society, before he believes the reader might believe him. It just seemed like in this book, it was (at least) one time too many.Diamond attempts to answer an age old question; what determines a society's position in relation to the others on Earth? The problem with the approach he uses is that it is just not robust enough to be worth sharing. My first problem is that just because things are the way they are, it doesn't mean they had to be. Unless otherwise convinced (and I would take some convincing) I just can't lend any weight to the idea that history is anything other than chaotic, influenced by countless factors, many of which we remain unaware. I just could not shirk off the impression that Diamond was coming up with a theory and then shoehorning facts into the theory to lend it credence. One example of this is the idea that societies rate of progress is determined largely by what way round the landmass they inhabit lies. He fails to mention The Alps, The Mediterranean, the Himalayas or the large temperature gradient between parts of Eastern Russia and Western Europe, as potential barriers to the diffusion of ideas between societies in Eurasia, instead choosing to blithely ignore them to fit his chosen hypothesis. To me that's a bit like saying that rather than teeth evolving to fit our diet, they evolved to improve our smile and hence give us more chance of attracting a mate. In other words, making up a theory to fit the facts and using the facts themselves as justification and choosing to ignore existing evidence.To reinforce this impression in my mind, Diamond concludes by trying to justify his flimsy just-so explanations in a very patronising and unconvincing manner, suggesting that the main reason for disagreeing with them lies in a misunderstanding of the historical sciences and it's methods by the majority of people. He even goes as far as including the likes of evolutionary biology and astronomy in with history, suggesting that if we believe in the findings of the former disciplines, we should give more weight to the theories of the historical sciences (history). It is my belief that the findings within both astronomy and evolutionary biology are subjected to rigorous experimental testing, a belief which Diamond clearly does not hold. I could almost feel my faith and trust in Diamond as a scientist die inside me by the time I had turned the final page.The whole thing is pretty flimsy. A few theories, which are either extroardinarily simple (geographical difference makes the difference in societies developments not the people) or flawed and/or lacking evidential support (the axis of the continent which a society inhabits makes a considerable impact upon it's development). Finally the book is by and large, overwhelmingly dull. Diamond repeats himself like a broken record and wading through his prose feels at times like wading through thickened treacle on rubber stilts. If you are looking for definitive answers to the central question of this book, answers that you feel assured are reasonably likely to be robust and accurate, this book does not provide them. It contains nuggets of trivia but that wasn't the reason I picked this off the bookshelf to read it and I think that would apply to most prospective readers."
39,0739467352,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2747498-arun-divakar,5,"The first impression that history gave me was of a never ending series of dates and occurences which needless to say is an extremely boring way to learn. The whole perspective of history changed for me when I began viewing this like I do soil. Multiple layers all held together by a common force, some of them interleaving and some totally independent with each layer telling a story of its own. At one point of time, the layer of top soil thinks of itself as invincible but with changing circumstances it paves way for the next layer. History is similar to this in many ways and such a perspective forms the wireframe for this wonderful book.In roughly 400 pages, Jared Diamond gives a highly compressed version of the world as it is. His is not a dry recounting of occurences and how they shaped world events. Rather he delves deeper into why the world is as it is right now. Why did the Western civilizations get to influence the world more ? Why were the conquerors of lands across the world from the Eurasian landmass ? The answer to all these questions lies in the title of book : Guns, Germs and Steel. At first glance all three of these factors are entirely unrelated but on a deeper look they prove to be the most decisive factors that cut across world history. The conquerors who brought the guns overpowered the masses and they brought along with them the germs of epidemics from across the seas. Those that did not fall by the bullets, fell by the diseases and then it was a relatively easy way (full of corpses !) that the European conquerors could walk across. The author goes into details of the Spanish conquest of the Incas, The extermination of the American Indians and subduing the Aborgines of Australia as examples of these. The power of the weapon and of the germs was not the only factor of power for the Western world. What really set apart Eurasia was its power of food production. This is where the steel part comes in. What fascinated me most were the questions that Jared Diamond poses and answers. For instance : Both agriculture and animal husbandry began in the fertile crescent - which is modern day Iraq and thereabouts but then how did the center of power shift westward ? When China had a headstart from all other parts of the world in everything from agriculture to maritime navigation why did they lag behind others in innovation ? The first human beings began life in Africa so how did the continent go far behind ? All these questions do not have simple straightforward answers but answers that are an amalgamation of economic,social,political and environmental factors. The author explains all these in depth and satisfactory detail.The analysis, interpretations and observations in this book are not things that glance at the skin and fall away but they are facts that go down to the bone marrow of present civilizations. The research that Jared Diamond would have done for this book shows in the pages.Undoubtedly one of the best and most informative books I have read in the last two years. Highly recommended for those who love a strong dose of cultural history, anthropology and a study of civilizations."
40,0739467352,http://goodreads.com/user/show/986712-curtis-abbott,5,"Before buying and reading this book, I read some reviews, and frankly, they didn't inspire me. They talked about it being a history of the world, they talked about its immense, ambitious scope. Such talk causes my crap detectors to tingle. I did finally buy it after reading a laudatory review by someone I respect. And I'm glad I did, because I found it to be absolutely top notch. The phrase ""history of the world"" misguides because the book is entirely about pre-history. The story it tells is historical in nature, but since it is about societies for which we have no written histories, the nature of the evidence is different, and that is one key to its value. The book is a superb assemblage of evidence from different disciplines, mainly genetic analysis, archeology (including non-human fossil evidence), and linguistics, with a smattering of anthropology. This evidence is woven – with original analysis – into a story of early human history.The result is a story that isn't always pretty but that hangs together well and seems better defended – hence more believable – than I would have thought possible. I suppose this is the origin of those ""ambitious scope"" comments in the reviews I distrusted. I could not have imagined before reading this book that so much about human pre-history could be inferred.The writing is strong as well: cogent, well paced, never overbearing. Diamond has a gift not only for writing clearly, but for helping you to understand why you should care. For example, even though his scope includes inference of pre-historical migrations and developments (both cultural and technological) throughout the world, he organizes his presentation in terms of a trenchant theme – why did the European cultures win out over so many others? Why did the Europeans colonize Africa, South America, and so on? Why didn't the Bushmen, or the Australians, or the Incas invade Europe?And this gift extends to well-chosen personal anecdotes from Diamond's rather unusual life. He personalizes the key question (why the Europeans won) by having it come from the mouth of a Papuan politician who buttonholes Diamond on a beach, asking why the Europeans have so much ""cargo"" and the New Guineans so little. He illustrates the challenges of Australia by telling stories of his own adventures there as well as those of some Europeans (who died there) in the 19th Century.By bringing together evidence from a number of disciplines, synthesizing it, and writing about it in an accessible way, Diamond has done something important. It has always been said that the reason to pay attention to history is to learn more about who we are. I believe that this book can be even more powerful in that endeavor because of the vast period (13000 years) and scope (the whole world) it covers, even though the lack of a written record limits the amount of detail. I for one found it stimulating, eye-opening, maybe even life changing."
41,0739467352,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9777942-joe,5,"In the fields of geography and history, there are few more nettlesome turns of phrase than the vaguely Eurocentric 'The Middle East' and the academically petulant 'The Common Era' (or C.E and B.C.E. as a replacement for A.D. and B.C.) Jared Diamond avoids both of these, while introducing the more precise 'Southwest Asia.' This is an early indicator of the exactness and objectivity he shows throughout this epic overview of civilization's building blocks.When reading nonfiction, I am often impressed by a particular author's style, breadth of research or interest in the details of humanity. But before Guns, Germs and Steel, I was never so moved by the analysis of the information presented. Before Guns, Germs and Steel, I never considered a continent's long axis (either north-south or east-west) significant to the development of the people that live there. So when Diamond presented this theory, I was dubious. But after reading his argument with all its copious details and seeing this theory applied to all corners of the Earth, I was convinced. This is a book for anyone who has wondered why Europeans conquered Australia and the Americas so much easier than Sub-Saharan Africa or New Guinea. It's for anyone who has wondered why South Africa looks so much more European than most of the rest of Africa. It's for anyone who has wondered why we don't eat acorns. It's for anyone who wants to see abhorrent theories about 'racial superiority' calmly blasted to smithereens. It's for anyone with the patience to have all their historical assumptions challenged over the course of 500 glorious pages.Edited 3-16-2017"
42,0739467352,http://goodreads.com/user/show/29931726-joel,5,"Let me start off by comparing this book to another hugely popular title: Sapiens: A Brief History of Humankind by Yuval Noah Harari. These two books are often lumped together - they both essentially take a long view of human history - but they are different in so many ways. Starting with the writing style: Harari is engaging and easy to read while Diamond is far drier and often belabouring. However, in substance and thoughtfulness, Diamond's nuance and brilliance are far superior to Harari's smug simplicity. Diamond considers every factor and examines his evidence in detail, while Harari makes sweeping assertions and puts his conclusions before his evidence. Both take essentially a materialist view of the world, Diamond's geographic determinism being just that, but Harari takes his reductionism to a monistic extreme, rejecting anything he can't touch or see, while Diamond is willing to consider alternative causal explanations for historical outcomes, and even concedes that his theory doesn't reduce everything to geography alone, but only that geography is the strongest ultimate cause for human differences.The books starts strong, and the prologue does a good job giving a disclaimer about what what the book is and is not; it is not a justification of colonialism or genocide, only an explanation of why Europeans were the colonizers and Native Americans the colonized. The prologue succeeds in pre-empting many of the challanges that critics bring up. For those of you who have read reviews that are critical of Diamond's alleged ""Euro-centrism"", I would advise you to read just the prologue and see that Diamond himself repudiates any such accusations. He also anticipates the complaint that his theory is reductionist. He stresses that it is not, as I mentioned above.The first three parts of the book builds up the basics of this theory - that the differences between advanced and primitive civilizations ultimately trace back to the superior food production capacity of some regions, among other geographic factors, and the ability for advances such as domesticable crops, livestock, writing, political organization, and technology to be shared across distances (and famously, more easily across East-West axes than across North-South). These are important because they supported large concentrations in population, which in turn led to other advances, in what Diamond calls a self-catalyzing process. The second and third parts of the books go into the finer detail of each of these processes, and while at this point the book starts to sound repetitive, these chapters add enough nuance to make it interesting. By the fourth part of the book, however, in which Diamond applies his theory to each of the continents, it does start to get tiresome.The strongest part of the book, in my opinion, comes at the very end, in the Epilogue and the Afterword (2003 edition). There's a very interesting discussion in the Epilogue that seems to have gotten much attention about why it was Europe rather than China that became the colonial superpower than colonized the Western hemisphere. He talks about how connectedness can be positive or negative. In the case of China, the extreme connectedness was at first a positive because it allowed crops and technology to be shared across the country, but it was also a negative when a single centralized authority had absolute authoritarian power to shut down the Chinese maritime project. Europe, on the other hand, because of its moderate connectedness, enjoyed the benefits of the sharing of ideas, yet its fragmented geography ultimately allowed Columbus to shop around his idea of sailing West to the various fragmented political regimes. This same idea is found in Matt Ridley's book The Rational Optimist: How Prosperity Evolves, and in Joel Mokyr's A Culture of Growth: The Origins of the Modern Economy.The Epilogue also has a short discussion about cultural causes and the great-man theory. The latter he dismisses but the former he entertains. His discussion is well nuanced though, and worth contemplating. Finally, the end of the Epilogue talks about history as a science and is one of the best discussions I've seen on the topic. He explains why the scientific methods familiar to physicists could or could not work for historical sciences as well. Edward O. Wilson in Consilience: The Unity of Knowledge has some good ideas on this topic too which don't make their way into Diamond's treatment, but he comes close. In fact, the author I would characterize as most similar to Diamond would be Edward O. Wilson. His books The Social Conquest of Earth and Consilience complement this book very well. This segment is perhaps one of the most important parts of this book, and I would recommend everyone read it even if they don't read the rest of the book. It's important enough that it deserves its own book or a long essay at the very least.Overall, this book deserves its status as an ultimate classic, and there is enough nuance and detail that a short summary won't do. If you think you already understand the main ideas of this book from a review or YouTube video you watched on it, I would challenge that you don't. The style does get a bit repetitive and dry, but if you pay enough attention to the details, it should keep you enthralled."
43,0739467352,http://goodreads.com/user/show/163451-julianne,3,"My three-star rating has nothing to do with the quality of the ideas in this book; I think they're all top-notch. My lukewarm response has to do instead with their presentation. Jared Diamond's prose is very readable but prolix. How, one might ask, could I find prolix a book which purports to condense the entire history of humankind into 425 pages? (As Diamond himself points out, compressing 13,000 years of history into roughly 400 pages works out to ""an average of about one page per continent per 150 years, making brevity and simplification inevitable"" (408). My answer is simply that Diamond does not actually condense 13,000 years of human history into 425 pages but rather picks and chooses which years with which corresponding phenomena on which continents are most relevant to his thesis. In order to prove that ""history followed different courses for different peoples because of differences among people's environments, not because of biological differences among peoples themselves"" (25), Diamond traces the domestication of plants and animals, the origins of agriculture, the emergence of crowd diseases such as Bubonic Plague and measles, the rise and spread of techological innovations like metallurgy and writing, and the seemingly autocatalytic process that promotes the development of large complex political entities from small, less complex ones. But ""Guns, Germs, and Steel"" is not a comprehensive treatment of the Black Death any more than it is a primer for understanding the development of metallurgy. In other words, he skips a lot, which I agree is inevitable; however, my beef is that in addition to skipping a lot, he repeats himself a lot, in effect writing a book that is not so much too long or too short as it is inefficient--prolix. Diamond states the same ideas over and over again, and he always articulates BOTH the affirmative and the negative formulations, seldom omitting words that really could be ommitted without interfering with itelligibility: ""History followed different courses for different peoples because of differences among people's environments, NOT because of biological differences among peoples themselves"" (25); ""the availability of domestic plants and animals ultimately explains why empires, literacy, and steel weapons developed earliest in Eurasia AND later, or not at all, on other continents"" (92); ""the reason for the failure of Native Americans to domesticate North American apples by the time Europeans arrived lay neither with the people nor with the apples....INSTEAD, the reason Native Americans did not domesticate apples lay with the entire suite of wild plant and animal species available to Native Americans"" (156). While I agree that such a writing style is very clear and understandable (readable), surely after the first articulation of each idea and component, bolstering idea, Diamond could speed things up a bit?But no, in fact, his 18th chapter (the penultimate chapter, not including epilogue, and entitled ""Hemispheres Colliding"") is an entirely redundant reformulation of ideas previously articulated, often referencing the exact same examples already referenced. This is evidenced by Diamond's tendency to include phrases like ""in Chapter 9 we encountered,"" ""as I explained in Chapter 11,"" and ""as we saw in Chapters 5 and 10..."" This, along with his tendency to provide overview (as in the Prologue: ""Part 4...applies the lessons of Parts 2 and 3"") as well as suggestions like ""if we begin by comparing Figure 19.2 with Figure 19.1..."" that contribute to the unfortunate impression on the part of the reader that he/she is reading the incomplete novelization of a textbook--a hitherto unknown literary hybrid.This is not to say that Diamond has not ultimately provided a service to humanity by writing ""Guns, Germs, and Steel"" or that his arguments are unconvincing or that he never provides us with an arresting phrase or that the book is devoid of colorful and illustrative anecdotes. The very basis for the book rests in a personal experience of Diamond's in New Guinea in 1972 (""Yali's Question""); and I especially like the phraseology of the final sentence of Chapter 19, ""...the different historical trajectories of Africa and Europe stem ultimately from differences in real estate."" And one certainly cannot fail to be struck by the originality of some of his ideas, such as the orientation of the continents' major axes (East-West vs. North-South) having played a greater role in the differences between human societies than we have previously recognized. Overall, this book is very accomplished and worth reading.However, Diamond gradually chips away at the various misconceptions, errors, and prejudgments that cloud our understanding of human prehistory and history in the manner of a slow-moving stream or a very patient archaeologist. Maybe he imagines that this gradual approach is necessary for changing slow-moving or simply out-of-touch minds in which repetition might accomplish what erudition might not, though I really can't imagine such individuals, let alone the genuine racists whose views Diamond is avowedly rebutting making it through the book. But really (to borrow a page out of Diamond's intellectual repertoire), I believe this book could be intellectually stronger, aesthetically superior, and ultimately more influential if Diamond repeated himself less while articulating more."
44,0739467352,http://goodreads.com/user/show/78485297-mario-the-lone-bookwolf,5,"A refreshingly different approach to the theses on the evolutionary history of cultures.Please note that I put the original German text at the end of this review. Just if you might be interested.Those are revolutionary theories that open themselves up to the reader, and that wipe the floor with old, racist concepts about the emergence of advanced civilizations and states. Using indisputable geographical and biological facts, the author provides a viewpoint that would have opened up only to the most creative minds without such explanation.Due to the size and the partial length of the work, I would recommend budding non-fiction fetishists to sharpen their view of the partly autobiographical colored inserts and dry statistical or very specialized remarks. In case of lack of time or discomfort, read them over and enjoy the fillets even better. It may, of course, be appreciated the entire menu, only the lengths will give my well-intentioned advice probably one or the other time right. Especially with such excellent literature as the present one, it would be a shame if the reading experience is diminished or in the worst case even prematurely ended.In addition to the actual flora and fauna of the various described regions of the world, the West-East or North-South axis is the decisive factor for the rise and fall of the peoples as a primary geological fate. The luck or bad luck with well-domesticated animals or due to exceptional stubbornness for the livestock utterly unsuitable representatives of the herbivores or productive, resistant or little throwing off, sensitive plants plays another critical role.Looking at the continents, only in Eurasia does the West-East axis lie at about the same latitude and in similar climates, which significantly facilitates the exchange of plants and animals via trade routes, since they find much better survival conditions in similar environments than if they would be transported across a north-south axis from Norway to South Africa or from Chile to Canada. This greatly facilitated the transition to agriculture and livestock farming and the associated opportunity to feed specialists such as artisans, warriors and scientists through surplus food and jump on the train to the big state.In contrast to the natural conditions that exist on Earth, the effects on the environment are not negligible. In Latin America and other countries, these plants are relatively sensitive. Moreover, even if that were not so, an exchange which goes beyond the different climates, may work or not. In Africa are incredibly many areas as well as tropical jungle or dry savanna not so recommended for animal transport. It is similar in Latin America, though not so extreme. This is also a military event, but not as good as it used to be in the past. As the author so genuinely quotes, only a more benevolent nature of bison or rhinos would have been enough to change the course of world history. If Huns and Mongols were able to build world empires on pure horses, compared to the potential and much more robust mounts of the South, the military possibility of up to nearly one ton of massive bison and over three tons of rhinos would have been far more resounding. Imagine these animals in their thousands and the style of a paladin horse armored with a hail of arrows whirling riders.From the meticulous descriptions of various facts, there are still multiple ideas for alternative world history that could not be more beautiful, since they are based on verifiable basics, unlike far-fetched, improbable conjectures and doctrines.The author rightly deserves the reputation of being a top-notch science writer, and not just because of his impressive work so far. However, also and primarily for the series of hammer blows, which he sends down on the incarnate anachronisms long ago to be sent by a paradigm shift in the intellectual nirvana, representative of his guild, which has little to counter to his revolutionary thinking approach. Besides anyone from the university, there are still many guts to hallucinate something of cultural superiority or other racial, verbal diarrhea.Eine erfrischend andere Herangehensweise an die Thesenbildung über die Entwicklungsgeschichte der Kulturen.Revolutionäre Theorien sind es, die sich dem Leser auftun und die mit alten, rassistischen Konzepten über die Entstehung von Hochkulturen und Staaten den Boden aufwischen. Anhand unabstreitbarer geografischer und biologischer Fakten ermöglicht der Autor eine Sichtweise, die sich nur den kreativsten Köpfen ohne derartige Erläuterung eröffnet hätte. Aufgrund des Umfangs und der teilweisen Länge des Werks würde ich angehenden Sachbuchfetischisten empfehlen, den Blick für die teilweise autobiografisch gefärbten Einschübe und trockenen statistischen, beziehungsweise sehr fachbezogenen Ausführungen zu schärfen. Um diese bei Zeitmangel oder Unlust überlesen und die Filetstücke dafür noch umso besser genießen zu können. Es darf selbstverständlich auch das gesamte Menü genossen werden, nur die Längen werden meinem gutgemeinten Rat wohl das eine oder andere Mal Recht geben. Gerade bei so hervorragender Literatur wie der vorliegenden wäre es eine Schande, wenn das Leseerlebnis dadurch geschmälert oder im schlimmsten Fall gar vorzeitig beendet wird.Neben der eigentlichen Flora und Fauna der verschiedenen beschriebenen Weltgegenden bildet als primäre geologische Schicksalsinstanz die West-Ost- beziehungsweise Nord- Südachse den entscheidenden Faktor über Aufstieg und Fall der Völker. Das Glück oder Pech mit gut domestizierbaren Tieren oder aufgrund großer Halsstarrigkeit zur Viehzucht absolut ungeeigneten Vertretern der Herbivoren beziehungsweise ertragreichen, widerstandsfähigen oder wenig abwerfenden, empfindlichen Pflanzen spielt eine weitere wichtige Rolle.Betrachtet man sich die Kontinente, so ergibt sich einzig in Eurasien eine auf etwa den gleichen Breitengraden und ähnlichen Klimazonen gelegene West-Ostachse, die den Austausch von Pflanzen und Tieren über Handelsrouten wesentlich erleichtert, da diese in ähnlichen Umgebungen wesentlich bessere Überlebensbedingungen vorfinden, als wenn man sie über eine Nord- Südachse von Norwegen nach Südafrika oder von Chile nach Kanada transportieren würde. Dadurch wurde der Übergang zu Ackerbau und Viehzucht sowie die damit einhergehende Möglichkeit, durch Überschuss an Nahrung Spezialisten wie Handwerker, Krieger und Wissenschaftler zu ernähren und auf den Zug zum Großstaat aufzuspringen, wesentlich erleichtert. Als wäre das nicht genug der von der Natur vorgegebenen Ungerechtigkeit, befinden sich auch noch die meisten der ertragreichsten Saatpflanzen und Nutztiere im eurasischen Raum, während selbige auf anderen Kontinenten rar gesät sind. In Lateinamerika sowie Afrika sind sowohl gut für den Hausgebrauch geeignete Großsäuger als auch ertragreiche Pflanzensorten relativ selten. Und selbst wenn dem nicht so gewesen wäre, hätte ein Austausch über die verschiedenen Klimazonen hinweg kaum funktionieren können.So sind in Afrika sowohl extrem aride Gebiete als auch tropische Dschungel oder schlichte Savanne für keinen Tiertransport zu empfehlende Routenpunkte und auch den Pflanzen dürfte es übel bekommen. In Lateinamerika verhält es sich ähnlich, wenn auch nicht ganz so extrem. Dass sich das militärisch einst unersetzliche Pferd auch noch just der südlichen Hemisphäre entsagen musste war ein weiterer wesentlicher Nachteil. Wie der Autor so treffend anführt, hätte nur ein gutmütigeres Wesen von Bisons oder Nashörnern vonnöten sein müssen, um den Lauf der gesamten Weltgeschichte zu verändern. Wenn Hunnenheere und Mongolen auf, im Vergleich zu den potentiellen und wesentlich robusteren Reittieren des Südens, schlichten Pferden Weltreiche errichten konnten, wäre das kriegerische Potential von bis zu fast einer Tonne schweren Bisons und bis zu über drei Tonnen schweren Nashörnern noch wesentlich durchschlagender gewesen. Man stelle sich diese Tiere zu Tausenden und im Stil eines Paladinpferds gepanzert mit Pfeilhagel schwirren lassenden Reitern vor.Es erschließen sich anhand der minutiösen Schilderungen verschiedener Sachverhalte noch diverse Ideen für Uchronien, die schöner nicht sein könnten, da sie im Gegensatz zu weit hergeholten, unwahrscheinlichen Vermutungen und Lehrmeinungen auf nachweisbaren Grundlagen beruhen. Dem Autor gebührt, nicht nur aufgrund seines beeindruckenden bisherigen Werks, zu Recht der Ruf eines Wissenschaftsautors der Spitzenklasse. Sondern auch und gerade für die Serie an Hammerschlägen, die er auf die, als fleischgewordene Anachronismen längst durch einen Paradigmenwechsel in das intellektuelle Nirwana zu schickenden, Vertreter seiner Zunft niederprasseln lässt, die seinen Denkansetzen wenig entgegenzusetzen haben. Außer irgendjemand aus dem Universitätsbetrieb entblödet sich wirklich noch, etwas von kultureller Überlegenheit oder anderer rassistischer, verbaler Diarrhöe zu halluzinieren."

The point of no return was once he started in on the history of language and how it spread. The tedium could not be borne.Totally a subjective read, this one. Stylistically, it was a fail.

And of course powerful germs to kill other races.This explains why they ended up colonizing the americas, australia, asia and africa instead of vice versa.What I liked most about this book is the powerful and intriguing questions he asks, he has an open minded attitude to history and don't push too much for a universal theory of everything historical, he just read and interprets general lines of human history and he does it so well."

I generally hold to the idea that people are people and it presented a solution to why Europe got ahead of everyone else of course written in much bloody history. The key according to Diamond is a bunch of lucky breaks in the geography of Eurasia and the plant and animal power that gave Europeans a head start on the road to complex technology, Guns, Germs, and Steel which put them for a while on the top of the pile. We live in the aftermath of this day in the sun for Europeans and are looking to share the goodies of these tools without blowing up the world. Worth the read.Update 8/17/2020 Diamond's book was the first book on differential development explained by geographic factors. It explained quite well the advantages in Eurasia of domesticable plants, and Animals that allowed for sedentary food production that allowed for large complicated sedentary societies in the middle east and spreading east and west from there in Eurasia those concentrated populations exposed to their domestic animals were subject to outbreaks of disease and those that survived tended to have partial to full immunity from those diseases over time. Of course, large concentrations of people allow for innovations by necessity, and a heterogeneous population of inventors. So once the thing got rolling it snowballed and societies with a head start got to dominate. Of course, this is big history in broad strokes. To get more granular like Europe vs. East Asia requires looking at other factors or in Northern Europe vs. Southern Europe more detail and granularity is needed but as a first approximation, Jared Diamond's story rings true and makes sense."
52,0739467352,http://goodreads.com/user/show/73705586-ben,1,"this won the Pulitzer? -_-I couldn't get past the opening chapters.This book reminded me of Sapiens. They both postulate a 'wow' theory meant to be groundbreaking (and bookselling) and then don't back it up with actual science or evidence.In the opening chapters, the author claims that one race is more intelligent than another because of a bunch of anecdotal things he noticed, like that the New Guineans he met seemed really curious and good at making mental maps. He goes on to point to the fact that western children watch a lot of TV and that makes them dumb... but this is entirely a nurture thing that has little to do with inherent intelligence.The author makes several more poor arguments, but then does make an interesting one with perhaps some validity: that New Guineans experienced more natural selection and thus it weeded out the less intelligent for a longer time. But this theory is weak at best. Given how long humans were developing for, 1000 years of slightly easier living for one race is doubtful to cause a statistically significant difference in inherent intelligence. Truly, there's lots of similarly weak arguments you could make for the contrary too.In the end, this whole exercise is silly in itself. There's clear examples of intelligent people and idiots from every race. People are people. No doubt many liked this book because in a racist way it's trying to promote anti-racist sentiments. But even if one race is slightly more intelligent as a whole, there's so much variance among people that it wouldn't amount to anything you could realistically point to anyway - so what's the point?DNF."
53,0739467352,http://goodreads.com/user/show/15715846-rosie-nguy-n,4,"An intriguing book. Regardless of whether its arguments are right or wrong, the book provides profound knowledge of human history and civilizations. A vast amount of information is presented neatly, that helps a layman like me to follow and capture the data better. I, considering myself to have no interest in all kinds of history (consequence of Vietnam's education system, but not only the problem of Vietnam to be precise), astonishingly found the book absorbing and thought - provoking. In addition, the author offers encouragement to the people in their efforts to write a brighter history for their homelands, as he implies that all the people on this planet have equal potency to shape the future of their regions.Nonetheless, the book mostly refers to the mainstream theories in human immigration and neglecting other hypothesis, which may mislead the reader into presuming that what mentioned is the only truth. Besides, it analyses human history based on geographical regions (Europe, Asia and North Africa to be Eurasia), failing to meet the reader's expectation in figuring out what made western countries dominate the world today (he did explain it at the end of the book, but it was not satisfying).Anyway, I like the book and the author's writing style. Reading it when there was tension between China and Vietnam regarding the oil rig gambit. A thought struck me that human came a long way to reach this stage and here we are fighting and killing each other. Stop that nationalism. It's all bullshit."

It’s longer than it needs to be, but largely because it is thorough and takes the time to break down academic subjects to be accessible to intelligent but non-specialist readers. First published in 1997, this book sets out to explain why Europe was able to colonize such a large part of the world in the last few centuries. Europeans’ possession of “guns, germs and steel” was an immediate cause, but why did they have these things when people on many other continents did not? Diamond’s answer comes down to the environment in different parts of the world. In essence, all of these advantages come down to agriculture. In a hunter-gatherer society, population is kept relatively small, people have to focus on acquiring food, and (unless they live in an especially bountiful area), small groups typically need to move from place to place, such that they can’t have too many belongings, especially if they have no domestic animals to carry them. A society built on farming, however, tends to be much more populous, can support a class of people who do something other than farm (an elite class of nobles, but also specialized trades), and can accumulate belongings, which makes developing new technology more worthwhile. So, parts of the world that had a head start on farming also had a head start on developing technology, such as metallurgy.Meanwhile, European germs played probably the most decisive role in their conquest of the Americas, as well as some other parts of the world; given the size of the native population (an early European visitor to the east coast of the modern U.S. wrote that there didn’t really seem to be room for colonies because the area was so heavily populated) and the difficulty of getting even small numbers of people across the ocean on wooden ships, one can imagine that this could have turned out much more like the English conquest of India, or might not have happened at all, if not for the epidemics that killed some 90% of the population. Why were the Europeans the ones with the germs? Well, human epidemics have come from domestic animals (think swine flu and avian flu today), and epidemics need a large population to stay alive; otherwise they will simply kill everyone they can kill and then die out with no new hosts. Therefore, epidemics evolved in places where people lived in close quarters with domestic animals, and stuck around in populations large enough to produce a new crop of children before the epidemic died out (this is why diseases like measles were once considered “childhood diseases” – not because children were more susceptible, but because the diseases were so prevalent that children would almost inevitably catch them before growing up). Both individuals and populations exposed to these germs would eventually develop immunity if they survived.But the opportunity to domesticate animals wasn’t spread evenly around the world. Asia and Europe (referred to throughout the book as “Eurasia” since it’s really one landmass, considered two continents for political rather than geographic reasons) had lots of options, including horses, cows, water buffalo, sheep, pigs, and goats. As far as domesticable large mammals go, the Americas had only the llama (which didn’t spread beyond the Andes), while sub-Saharan Africa had none. It isn’t that people didn’t try – people will keep almost anything as a pet – but numerous factors influence whether a large mammal is a good candidate for domestication. It needs to live in herds, to tolerate its own herd’s territory overlapping with others (or you’d never be able to bring in a new cow that wasn’t related to your current cows), to not be overly or unpredictably aggressive toward humans (this is why the zebra has never worked out), to not panic, bolt and throw itself against the fence until it dies, and more. Eurasia had a couple of major advantages here. Being the largest landmass, it had the most animal diversity. And, as modern humans evolved in Africa and Eurasia, animals evolved alongside them, presumably learning how to deal with human hunters’ increasing skills; on the other hand, most large mammals went extinct in the Americas and Australia shortly after people arrived.With agriculture, too, Eurasia had an advantage, causing it to kick off there early. Again, there was a greater diversity of plants, only some of which make sense to domesticate and begin to grow. The Fertile Crescent (roughly modern-day Iraq and Turkey), perhaps the first site of agriculture in the world, had it particularly easy: wheat already existed in a form quite similar to its modern equivalent, and grew bountifully, so the idea of taking it home and growing it wasn’t much of a leap. On the other hand, with corn – a staple crop of Mexico and eventually the eastern U.S. – there isn’t even agreement on what the wild ancestor was; the plant that might have been the original corn produced husks only about an inch long with tiny kernels and other disadvantages. People had to work on it for a really long time before it became a suitable staple crop for large swathes of the continent.And then too, you wouldn’t switch from hunting and gathering to farming for just one crop. While hunting and gathering seems like a precarious lifestyle to us, it can actually be better than subsistence farming. Farmers worked harder – which makes sense, since they had to nurture their food every step of the way rather than simply finding it and bringing it home – and based on their skeletons, early farmers’ nutrition was worse than that of hunter-gatherers. So it’s the total package that counts; in areas that provided a nutritionally-balanced diet of domesticable plants, plus domesticable animals to supplement that diet and also provide labor and fertilizer, farming made a lot more sense than it did in areas without such a bounty. Essentially, the sort of lifestyle people had depended on the food options available, and some places supported agriculture much more than others. Nobody’s building a densely-populated empire from a desert like the Australian outback.There is a lot more to the book of course, but I think it’s the central thesis that’s the most convincing. Many of Diamond’s other points – ancillary to his main argument – don’t work so well. For instance, he’s very interested in how a Spanish force of about 150 managed to defeat and capture the Inca emperor Atahualpa, who was supported by thousands of troops. Certainly the Spanish weaponry played a decisive role, particularly since it was the first time the Inca had encountered guns or cavalry. But Diamond claims that we know well what happened based on the (likely self-serving) accounts of several Spaniards, without apparently realizing that the Inca would probably have told a different story, and then makes a big deal of the fact the Inca lacked writing, arguing this is why they weren’t aware of prior Spanish conquests in Central America and therefore walked into a trap. But this ignores the fact that people who can’t depend on storing information in written form tend to have far better memorization skills than people who write everything down (Homer was not unusual in being able to recite epic poems from memory), and the fact that “they’re going to try to kill you with terrible weapons” is a simple message that could certainly have been transmitted intact had the Inca had envoys in Central America, all while assuming that Atahualpa didn’t know it was a trap. Without contemporary Inca sources, we have no idea whether perhaps he did know, but being new to the throne of an empire destabilized by epidemics, had to go anyway or risk looking weak to his subjects and promptly being overthrown.There’s some other questionable reasoning here: that it makes sense that the wheel, while invented in Mexico, wasn’t actually used for transportation because there were no animals capable of pulling carts. (So what? People too can transport far more weight on wheels than they can carry.) That New Guineans are probably smarter than Europeans because their society has a higher homicide rate. (A society with lots of murder and warfare would select for strength, skill with weapons, and ability to maintain strong social ties far more than it would select for abstract, creative, or analytical thinking. Plus, an anthropological study of a New Guinea tribe found that those typically targeted for murder were the elderly, who would have already passed on their genes regardless.) And the 2003 epilogue, attempting to apply principles of societal development to how corporations should organize themselves to best promote innovation – apparently inspired by business leaders writing to Diamond about the book – even if true, has nothing to do with the contents of this already-long book.Obviously there’s a lot to chew on here, hence the long review. I do think the book is worth reading, though it’s unfortunate that Diamond doesn’t cite sources for individual facts, and only includes generalized “further reading” lists. The book has some repetition that makes it a little longer than it needs to be, but overall I think it does a sound job of explaining some of the broad strokes of human history."

I'm afraid they're not.Although Diamond's main purpose is to answer the question ""Why did the peoples of some continents conquer and dispossess others?"" in a non-racist fashion (and succeeds convincingly), the book in many ways is a history of the world, and one less Eurocentric and less focused on irrelevant details than many whose point is explicitly trying to do that. This was one of those awesome books that blew my mind in almost every chapter with some fact or analysis that threw something I knew or thought I knew about the world into a totally different light or explained how something got the way it was. (For example, my nerdy self loved the description of how people go about starting to domesticate plants, why we have domesticated almonds but not acorns, stuff like that.)Diamond uses a mixture of ecological history, linguistics, and archeology to make a pretty concise and well-supported argument that a few things—suitable domesticable plants, suitable domesticable animals, east-west vs north-south axis, and size—led to the large differences in development of technology, epidemic diseases, writing, and political organization that allowed, for example, Europe to conquer the Americas. It's a fascinating tale that everyone should know.I especially appreciate the perspective that comes from his choice to focus in detail on what happens when cultures collide in areas outside the Europe-Americas story. The story of the South Chinese expanding into the Indonesian archipelago and Polynesia, for example, allows this American reader to not only become a much better-educated world citizen, but to think about the issues in a less familiar context where I have fewer knee-jerk associations.While Diamond bends over backward, and rightly so, to make clear that there's not only nothing inherent in different people's genes that led them to develop ""civilization"" at different speeds, he also tries to be clear early on that there's nothing inherently wonderful about civilization either. I know from another paper of his that hunter-gatherers actually enjoyed better physical health than settled farmers. (He does slip from this from time to time, though, and starts talking as if it's too bad not to invent any given thing there is to invent.) But still, his account leads right to, yet doesn't address at all, some hard questions: Was/is it inevitable that those who did accidentally acquire food production and its advantages address the population pressures that arise from food production by overrunning and massacring in cold-blood other societies? (It is sobering and instructive to remember how much of that had already happened long before 1492.) Should we care about the extermination of human populations and their languages? (It seems that the early human-caused mass extinctions of large mammals had *huge* effects on continental competitiveness: might loss of human cultural diversity do the same?) Or, perhaps more relevant to today's world: recognizing that the advantages held by the global North were not ""earned"" or ""deserved,"" is there justification for us to continue wielding our economic power to maintain that disparity rather than letting/helping other areas either ""catch up"" or remain at the complexity level appropriate to their environment? Although Diamond's neutral political/moral stance irritated me at times (mostly when it bordered on ""it's inevitable that human societies are self-centered warmongers""), I think it was the right choice for the book--those are important questions, but ones that his analysis should contribute to, not vice versa. He even offers a bit of a look at an answer when he starts, tentatively, to explore why Europe went a conquerin' overseas and China, which alone by his measures could also have done so, didn't (yet)."
57,0739467352,http://goodreads.com/user/show/13472185-andrej-karpathy,3,"In the ~mid 16th century the Spanish conquistador Pizarro captured the Incan Emperor Atahualpa despite being outnumbered a few hundred to few tens of thousands. Why didn’t Atauhalpa’s warriors instead land in Spain and capture King Charles I? More generally, why did Europeans conquer the world? And what factors govern the broad trends of societies in the history of our species? Are they predominantly biological? cultural? geographical? is it all luck and chaos?Guns, Germs, and Steel seeks to answer these questions. The central thesis is that if you carefully trace the major factors they will lead you to geography. Do you play Civilization? Of course you do. The book argues that the winner of the game of Civilization has very little to do with the players and almost everything to do with the distribution of resources near the starting locations of different civs. And if there are any biological factors (e.g. civ-specific bonuses), they are negligible in the scheme of things (as it is in Civ games as well). The Europeans, for example, happened to spawn next to a lot of bonus tiles for a wide variety of nutritious plants giving +10 food, and also bonus tiles for several domesticable animals, giving +5 food and +5 production. Any civ player can tell you that if your population grows faster and the cities become bigger and denser you will get lots of nice bonuses: specialist civilians, social stratification, faster research, more culture, etc. Over several hundred years these bonuses add up and the next thing you know you're showing up with 10 +28 attack Musketeers in a territory full of gold tiles defended by a +8 attack Aztec warrior. Unmodeled by Civilization games, you also enjoy carrying more germs that you’re also resistant to, and it's cheaper to establish trade routes west-east instead of south-north due to climates (convenient for Eurasia, not so much for America).These are very important questions and it’s all great to know and contemplate, but dammit is it painful - the book feels like eating your vegetables. Be prepared to hear (in excruciating detail) about different protein:carb:fat ratios of dozens of plants species you’ve never heard of. Be prepared to learn much more than you ever wanted about all possible candidate animals for domestication. Jared in fact manages to enumerate them all. These sections are definitely interesting and you can’t help but admire the thoroughness and attention to detail here, but it’s exhausting. There are a few more things that can be critiqued:- the hypocrisy in the dubious claim that Papa New Guineans are smarter than whites is jarring, considering that the whole point of the book is to discredit biological determinism. - the book is almost certainly sometimes guilty of post-hoc reasoning, but admittedly Jared is aware of this criticism and tries hard to avoid it.- the pacing is slightly off: there are hundreds of pages devoted to plant seeds, and only dozens of pages devoted to much more interesting patterns of development (especially in the last chapter).I can’t decide if I should recommend this book. I personally liked it (i.e. 3/5 on Goodreads scale). It was a significant undertaking and I feel that I’ve gained quite a bit of insight into the development of societies in the history of our species, but… at what cost? **shudders**."
