0,0974707708,http://goodreads.com/user/show/119364-melee-farr,3,"This was the longest 3-month read of my life. I did finish the bastard, though. If you want to enjoy it, read chapter 1, then skip to 9. The concept is fascinating: where is the seat of consciousness in the brain, and what, exactly, is consciousness - along with a little exploration in what consciousness is for. The execution was beastly. Even with a background in anatomy, I had no idea where the author was going with about half of the book, and was pretty pissed at him when I figured it out ""You made me read 60 pages and study 5 diagrams just to tell me that that little place is NOT the seat of consciousness. Bastard."" Still, the questions he posed held my interest enough to finish the book. Unfortunately, I still don't know the answers to them. Heh. "
1,0974707708,http://goodreads.com/user/show/206483-dj,4,"Until recently, those interested in learning about consciousness have had just three options: (1) introspection (informative but deceiving), (2) books by philosophers (interesting but completely speculative), and (3) books by crazies (the majority of the literature on consciousness). Consciousness has long been a naughty word in science, but ho! No longer! While the ""hard problem"" of exactly why phenomenological states arise from the collective squirts of neurotransmitters washing across your brain at all is still a crapshoot, the relatively ""easy problem"" of correlating certain neural activity with certain phenomenological experiences is well underway.Christof Koch of Caltech is one of the leaders in probing visual consciousness (or ""awareness"" if we are speaking to grant committees - shh!) - a particularly ""easy"" form of consciousness that is amenable to experiment both in humans. Dr. Koch's ""quest"" is to identify the minimal set of neurons whose activation leads to consciousness. The book provides a grand tour of all the interesting quirks and subtleties of visual consciousness discovered in the last few decades, painting a picture that is far more fractured and fragile than our daily experience might suggest. If you still cling to the picture of the homunculus dictator riding a meatbag mech warrior around the world, this book will, at the very least, convince you that biological dictators can't do their jobs without an army of unconscious robot agents. The book also includes some more speculative thoughts on the purposes and general nature of consciousness but, perhaps surprisingly for a book with such a lofty title, consists almost entirely of good old-fashioned science.What Brian Greene's The Fabric of the Cosmos is to modern physics, Quest for Consciousness is to modern neuroscience - the finest popular account available for lawyers, stock brokers, and mailmen with a bad science habit. Koch's book might focus on visual consciousness, but he touches on learning and memory, motor control, and lots more on this quest and does so in his highly readable and concise style. While mucking around in neurobiology can make for dangerous trekking, Koch organized the book very well with small, informatively titled sections, making it easy to remember the salient point of a particular passage if you're a neuro-rookie and easy to skim a particular passage if you're a neuro-master.For a more philosophical approach, I'd also recommend Daniel Dennett's Consciousness Explained.WARNING: The rest of this review is a collection of my reading notes. Readability not guaranteed.

   The evolutionary development of the brain makes it the ultimate kluge. New functions are continuous adaptations of old ones, making for some pretty wonky and unintuitive design principles. Speculative example: humans evolve disgust to avoid bad food. As humans form larger societies and viral epidemics become a problem, it becomes evolutionarily advantageous to avoid certain people. Rather than reinventing an avoidance mechanism, evolution simply co-opts the old disgust system (for dealing with bad food) to deal with potentially infected fellow humans. 
    Is the function of emotions to allow detected correlations without known functional relationships to influence decision making? (In other words, I might not know by what mechanism two things are related but have unconsciously noticed a pattern in their coincidence.) 
    Approach to decoding neural computation: consider that the typical sensory stimuli or brain info that feeds into a circuit will be highly tuned to the absolute scale, relative scales, and symmetries of that which it represents. Considering the nature of the input may constrain neural computation and suggest approaches to understanding it in a particular circuit. 
    Does our consciousness integration window increase in unfamiliar environments and/or decrease in familiar ones? Does it increase or decrease in rapidly changing environments? How does one test the integration window in a dynamic setting? Traditional artificial masking protocols used in highly controlled environments don't seem appropriate. 
    As consciousness seems to change continuously, does this mean that the NCCs (neural correlates of consciousness) must be constrained in their activation patterns? How does the continuity of conscious experience arise from the somewhat digital spiking of neurons? Is there perhaps a continuous ""read-out"" process wedged between NCCs and qualia? Does the distinction between discontinuous and continuous dynamics suggest a useful approach to decoding neural computation? 
    How does the brain optimize the balance between zombie agents and conscious processing? The zombie system offers speed at the cost of flexibility, operating through previously detected correlations and heuristics. Conscious processing offers flexibility at the cost of speed, offering a rich simulation of a series of events in order to consider and weigh consequences. (Simulation is the best word for this - you don't know where your thoughts will end until you ""run the program."") 
    How might one quantify consciousness? Do more explicit representations lead to more meaning and hence more consciousness? Would this justify deeming babies ""less conscious"", since they have not yet developed the repertoire of explicit representations available to an adult?

2,0974707708,http://goodreads.com/user/show/145381-brian,3,"(3.0) Worthy goal, not sure I got much out of the book thoughA noble goal: to find the neural correlate of consciousness (NCC), the network of neurons to point to as where perception 'happens'. To a neuroscientist, this is probably a tremendous amount of review. To a non-neuroscientist, probably way more neurobio than can be absorbed. But he does well to try to rule out places where consciousness cannot be (in vision, retina, V1, for example), and hints at where it might be (in vision, inferotemporal cortex?).One criticism that others may disagree with is that he narrows the definition of consciousness quite a bit so that a layperson may be disappointed. He boils it down to the experience of perceiving (not of thinking, free will, emotion, introspection...but simply of the awareness of 'red' when looking at a red ball, for example). I agree with this decision, but he may want to choose another word besides consciousness?I didn't quite follow (was I too sleepy?) the grand program of research he'd like to see that would uncover the NCC. It felt learned, though I don't think I'm taking a lot with me after having read it. I still think the CNS program (that Koch is heavily involved in) at Caltech is pretty awesome; I came pretty close to enrolling myself back in the day. ;)"

5,0974707708,http://goodreads.com/user/show/16212136-peter-pete-mcloughlin,5," This was published in 2003 but it is an excellent work probably close to the state of the art brain science at the time. It tries to tackle the big question of consciousness by exploring the neural correlates of consciousness in first the visual system from the eyes to the visual cortex in the back of the brain and then the two streams moving forward in the brain the lower stream that identifies objects and the upper stream for manipulation and navigation of the objects and world with area between them dealing with motion. Then it goes through the memory system with short term memory being translated to long term think RAM vs ROM in your computer through the filter of the Hippocampus. Think of Working memory as a buffer in the prefrontal cortex for holding information to solve complex problems on the fly it is what IQ tests are looking for when looking for fluid intelligence holding multiple bits of info for processing at one time. It also talks about the attention system which overlays all these modules direction focus here and there now we are getting close to consciousness and more in the realm of speculation and less detail. We also speculate on why biology would need consciousness and the zombie modules running below this command and control and attention of consciousness. Now I will say something obtuse why does the consciousness system need to have qualia why can't it also be a zombie system merely a more complex one. What it does regardless is maybe an executive summary, helps in learning complex new information and behavior. Still why do we experience it. Why the qualia of the hard problem. Granted trying to leap from a physical system to experience might be a form of stubbornness in my mind but I have a hard time doing it no matter how much neural correlates stuff that I see. This is a really good book I recommend it but it didn't solve my qualia freak problem but I learned a lot of neuroscience. recommended. See my updates for more details."
6,0974707708,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2945104-ramkumar-ramachandra,4,"This is THE book on consciousness if you're looking for a purely neurobiological approach. The picture is still very incomplete: Koch sticks to making claims based on hard scientific evidence, and makes no assumptions. If you don't mind using a bit of analytical philosophy to make the jump and build the entire picture, I'd recommend Metzinger's ""Being No One"".Light entertaining read."
7,0974707708,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1077817-erin,4,"If I could recommend just one book on a neuroscientific approach to consciousness, this would be it. But don't expect any clear answers to be spelled out for you – we’re not there yet. In particular, Koch does not provide the reader with anything approaching a satisfying explanation of how subjectivity can arise from a physical system."
8,0974707708,http://goodreads.com/user/show/16325787-moneim,3,النسخة العربية رغم الترجمة الممتازة والجهد الجبار المبذول فيها الا انها سيئة ! يبدو ان المشكلة في اللغة العربية ذاتها وهيمنة الانجليزية كلسان للعلوم ... ربما المشكلة في طريقة العرض خاصة في ظل وجود تجارب معقدة نسبيا كان من الممكن يتحول الكتاب لفيلم وثائقي شيق .. او يمكن المشكلة في توقعاتي وفي الوعي في حد ذاته :D 
9,0974707708,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8452002-david-olmsted,4,"Because this book brings in real neuroscience data it is the best book on consciousness yet published. Consciousness is a combination of perception and conscious sensations called qualia, two different phenomena. Qualia is why we see the color blue instead of just blindly react to some neural signals as would zombies (we can do this up to a point in a phenomena called blind-sight which involves a primitive non-cortical neural pathway). One can have qualia without perception but not vice-versa as exemplified when some object pattern suddenly jumps out at you from a picture you have been viewing. The foundational Qualia (feelings and primary sensations) are not generated in the brain regions that make us intelligent (although our pre-frontal ""planning"" cortex seems to add a valuation component). Because this book deals with consciousness it mainly deals with the qualia from the primary sensory cortical centers and not the deeper non-cortical feeling centers. ""Split brain"" patients have separated cortices but unified feeling centers. In a rare case in which both left and right cortices can talk the book reports this:""this led to frequent back-and-forth between them, as when Mark (the researcher) echoed one of her statements that she did not have feelings in her left hand. She then insisted that her hand was not numb, followed by a torrent of alternating Yes's and No's, ending with a despairing ""I don't know"". (page 291)So what is the evolutionary purpose of qualia? Does it use energy even though it is not affected directly by any known energy source (the frontiers of physics are at high energies, not the low energies of the brain)? While this book cannot provide definite answers it does make suggestions."

You'll find a lot of experiments with surprising results (at least for me :) ). Human brain know things you consciously don't. And do some things better and faster than you do consciously.

Anatomi ve biyoloji eğitimi almayınca olayın sadece beyinde geçtiğini anlayabildim. Aslında kitapta yeterince şekillere yer verilmiş ama bunları 200 sayfa sonra yeniden hatırlamak zor. Geri dönüp bakmaya da üşendim. Belki ileride, e-book readerlarda en azından, bu tür animasyonlu, resimli hızlıca çağrılabilen fonksiyonlar koyarlar da bu tür kitaplar çok daha rahat okunabilir. Canlılarda bilincin nerede ve nasıl oluştuğunu görme duyusu üzerine anlatmaya çalışan bir kitap bu. Bu alanda bir çok şey çok yeni olduğundan burada da genelde sadece kendi (yazar ve çalışma arkadaşı Francis Crick, evet DNA'nın yapısıyla Nobel ödülü alan biliminsanı) hipotezlerinden bahsediyor. Görme duyusunda ilerledikçe spekülasyonların miktarı da artıyor haliyle. Ben kitabı popüler bilim kitabı beklentisiyle okudum (bence değil) ve bazı şeylerden rahatsız oldum. Mesela bir sürü dipnot ile geçiştirilen açıklamalar. Her bölümün arkasında da bu dipnotların referansları var ama e-book readerda sıçraya sıçraya okumak hoşuma gitmiyor. Ayrıca dipnota gitmek de yetmiyor, çünkü bazen o dipnot sadece yapılan deneyin anlatıldığı bir çalışmaya referans oluyor. Başka bir rahatsızlık veren nokta da hayvanlar üzerinde yapılan deneyler ve uzun bir süre daha bu deneylerin devam edeceği öngörüsü. Kitap belli bir rotayı takip eden bölümlere ayrılmış. Ya ben başta bu rotanın tanıtıldığı yeri kaçırdım ya da yazar bundan hiç bahsetmedi. Rota aslında anlaşılıyor ama neden o şekilde incelendiği anlaşılmıyor bence. En azından yaptığı yolculuğun metodik çerçevesini başlarda verse iyi olurdu. Bu kitap benim için cevapladığı sorulardan çok yeni soruların kaynağı oldu. Daha yeni sayılabilecek bir araştrıma alanı olduğundan bu soruları bilmek bile benim hoşuma gitti. Biraz daha popüler bir dille ve üslupla yazılabilse güzel olurdu ama o zaman da iki kat filan kalınlıkta olurdu heralde. "
12,0974707708,http://goodreads.com/user/show/14291876-samuel-moss,5,"A spectacular book. Koch is an excellent writer and he structures this challenging material in such a way as to make it totally accessible. He takes a stab at a topic that most neuroscientists shy away from. He makes it very clear what is grounded in evidence (most of the book) and what is speculation. Even then, his speculation follows often times directly from the evidence. The sort of book which might inescapably alter the way that you understand your own perception of the world (at least this happened to me, in small ways, when I was reading it).I would recommend this to anyone with an interest in consciousness, anyone with an interest in neuroscience, anyone, really."

17,0974707708,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1571969-billie-pritchett,3,"Christof Koch's Quest for Consciousness is intended for lay audiences, but it is still a highly technical book, about the neurobiological approach to investigating consciousness. The book is at turns highly readable and at other other turns abstruse in its use of neuroanatomical descriptions of brain regions and processes. Nevertheless, it was enjoyable to read. Koch argues that consciousness, or awareness, is an emergent property of the nervous system, important for planning and choosing among different action courses. Its function, he writes, is ""to summarize the current state of the world in a compact representation and make this 'executive summary' accessible to the planning stages of the brain"" (305). Some more counterintuitive suggestions in his work include the claim that a majority of human thought is not consciously accessible and that the feeling human beings have of conscious control is just the frontal lobe sending signals to and from the back of the cerebral cortex. Whatever you think about his conclusions, he makes an interesting case in this book for a more detailed analysis of the neurophysiology of consciousness. I would recommend the book for anyone interested in the mind."
