I've been reading lots of books lately about behavioral psychology and economics: why people make the decisions we do, economically and in other life areas. But Predictably Irrational and Made to Stick both explore these questions in a much more engaging way.""Nudge"" is mostly concerned with how companies and governments can practice what the authors term ""libertarian paternalism""--gently, noncoercively pushing people toward doing something that they really want to do. For example, a company might, by default, enroll new employees in a 401K plan and put a certain salary percentage into that plan. The employees can opt out or change their contribution amount at any time, but by enrolling everyone by default, the company does an end run around its workers' natural procrastination tendencies, without forcing them into anything.Another use of ""nudging,"" this one on the state level, might be to require that everyone signing up for a driver's license check a box saying either ""Yes, I want to be an organ donor"" or ""No, I don't wish to be an organ donor."" Or, a state could change its laws so that people are, by default, assumed to be willing donors unless they say they don't want to. This would greatly increase the number of organs available for emergency transplants.So, interesting stuff--but not enough to fuel an entire book. I wound up skimming quite a bit, and while some of the anecdotes are funny and interesting, many of the writers' proposals are dry unless you happen to be fascinated by the particular social or economic issue they're addressing. It's worth picking ""Nudge"" up to see if it grabs you; just don't be surprised if it lets go about 100 pages in."
1,014311526X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/175635-trevor,4,"This one took me longer to read that is reasonable for a book of its length or the clear style it is written in. I mean, such a simply written text of 250 pages ought to have finished in no time. The problem was that I don’t live in the US and so many of the examples made the book a struggle for me. All the same, there are ideas in this book that are important no matter where you live.Don’t you just love the internet? I wanted to start this paragraph with that quote by Göring, “when I hear the word culture I reach for my luger”, but it turns out it is actually a quote from a play by Hanns Johst which is even better, “Whenever I hear of culture I release the safety on my Browning”. I have much the same reaction when I hear the word choice. There is a false equality set up between freedom and choice. It is as if the two terms are identical. Since I’ve had to read through dozens of American examples in this book of why this identity may not always apply, I would like to give an Australian example to explain some of the key concepts of this book.A couple of decades ago Australian workers went without a national pay increase and rather had this money directed into superannuation. Superannuation is essentially forced saving for retirement. Over the years this required percentage of an employee’s wage dedicated to superannuation has increased so that today it stands at 9%. Everyone knows that if people are to retire on anything like their current salary they need to put aside around 15% of their lifetime earnings. The gap between 9% and 15% is one that will be, for most people, borne by reduced living standards at the end of their lives.The previous Australian Government decided that it would be a good idea to introduce ‘choice’ into the superannuation system. So whereas previously most people were corralled into mostly industry superannuation funds that were ‘not for profit’ (meaning they had low fees and profits went back into the fund), the new system opened up the superannuation business to private operators. People would now be able to ‘choose’ which fund to invest their money in. (Where did I put that Luger?)The industry funds obviously didn’t like this idea. But like choice, competition is always a good thing and can never be criticised, right? Well, it is not quite so easy. The problem is that the industry funds asked the previous government to structure the new system so that all funds would have to disclose all fees and charges associated with their products. This would clearly have favoured the industry funds – that often don’t charge fees at all. The government refused to include this disclosure of information as a proviso in the legislation.Of course, this made ‘freedom of choice’ a bit of a joke. You can’t really have ‘freedom’ if your choice is also based on your being ‘free’ from vital information.What made matters worse was that the ‘financial planning’ industry in Australia isn’t as well regulated as it might be. Financial planners generally receive commissions from the financial institutions whose products they sell (oh, sorry, encourage you to take up). So, rather than providing you with a plan that is unequivocally in your best interests, the financial planner you are seeing may have (actually, will have) a strong motivation to provide you with information that is in their best financial interests, rather than yours.Economists would say that despite all of the obvious problems with this new system of choice it is still better as people ‘always act in their own best interests as rational economic agents’ and more choice (even if some of those choices might be biased against people) is always better.The writers of this book define themselves as Libertarian Paternalists. Essentially, they also believe that choices are good things – however, they acknowledge that choice alone isn’t enough and that people aren’t always economically rational entities.One of the ideas I found most useful in this book is the idea of ‘choice architecture’. They do not believe in taking choices away from people, but they recognise that being presented with a bewildering array of choices is often enough to stop people from making any choice at all. The book opens with a discussion of a school cafeteria and how you can affect the eating habits of kids simply by how you place the food on display. That is, putting healthier food at eye level, rather than fatty, sugary foods, will ‘nudge’ kids towards eating more healthy food. This is not a subtle change; this ‘nudge’ can drastically improve the eating choices made by the kids. The kids still have a choice to eat rubbish, but this simple change nudges them towards eating better. The point is that you simply don’t have the option to display the food in a ‘non-nudge’ way. You have to make some choice about how you are going to display the food – so doesn’t it make sense to set up the display so that people are nudged towards eating well, rather than badly?Choices don’t occur in a vacuum and one of the lessons of this book is that if we are going to provide ‘choices’ we need to think about the consequences of the choice architecture we put in place in which those ‘choices’ are going to be made.Another of those pieces of ‘choice architecture’ is going to depend on what is the default choice. This is because, people being people, many of us are going to get bored early on in the decision making process and just go for the default. Therefore, the default should be the choice that is most likely to meet the needs of those required to make the choice. There is a very disturbing discussion of the ‘Part D’ prescription drug coverage process in the US in which people who do not make what is an incredibly difficult choice are ‘randomly’ assigned to a range of default plans that takes the principle of government non-intervention to absurd extremes.The other idea that is very strongly pushed in this book is that people are very much ‘loss averse’. This is an idea that has been in virtually every book I’ve read lately, but this book does more than most to explain the consequences of this aversion. Going back to our superannuation example, one of the reasons why people don’t increase their superannuation contributions – despite knowing that it would be good for them in the long term – is that it involves them in a perceived loss now. The authors discuss a way of encouraging higher contributions which they call the ‘pay more later’ plan. Essentially people are encouraged to commit to increasing their contributions at the time of their next pay increase. This way the increase in contributions does not feel like a loss and the authors show that this way of increasing contributions leads to higher contributions than virtually any other method.I particularly liked their solution to the ‘gay marriage’ issue that is producing so much heat and so little light in society lately. Their answer is for the government to get out of the marriage business altogether. That the government should enable people to have their relationships recognised on the basis of it being a ‘civil union’ and that this be open to all couples, irrespective of their sex or the sex of their partner. This civil union would be the legal and social recognition of a couple’s partnership. Marriage then would be left up to religious bodies to worry about. If a particular church refuses to marry you because you want to marry someone they don’t think you should – well, find yourself another church – or even better yet, avoid churches altogether.The last part of this book is a defence of the idea of nudges against radical free market types; the sorts of people who, like our previous government, think that choice is always good and ill-informed choice is even better. The idea that people might be nudged towards donating their organs after they’ve finished with them, nudged to eat better food or to get better health care cover or to slow down when approaching a dangerous intersection all just seem obviously good to me, so this part of the book was preaching to the converted.But then, like Hegel, I don’t equate freedom with choice, but with needs and how we understand those needs. I think freedom has less to do with getting to choose and more to do with getting adequate information on the consequences of that choice. This book doesn’t go as far as I might along this path – but at least it recognises that we are human and that we often need help in making decisions that are in our own best interests. …If it was up to me there would not only be no freedom of choice in superannuation, but superannuation would be a tax and would be run by the Australian Tax Office. But don’t get me started…This would be an even more interesting book if you live in America, given the nature of the examples, but either way, this is still worth a look."

3,014311526X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2752994-dem,2,"December bookclub read for my sit in bookclub and when I checked in my book shop for this Book and was directed to the ECONOMICS/BUSINESS section I did quite a bit of eye rolling, I had automatically decided I wasn't going to like this book and as christmas reading goes this was going to be a taxing read. But I was pleasantly surprised at how readable and relatable the book was and how our decision making can be influenced by Nudges of all kinds and how society reacts to Nudges.Only 3 out 10 people in the group finished the book and yet the discussion created was lively and interesting with everyone participating and having an opinion. Not one I would be recommending but certainly a book that has food for thought."
4,014311526X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5860800-malcolm,1,"This comes with a whole bunch of big name endorsements – the physicist Brian Appleyard, Stephen Leavitt (of Freakanomics fame) and we’re told by the end of Introduction that it is making an impact with Obama and Cameron and so having a policy impact in both the UK and USA. What is more, it is now marketed as a ‘new international edition’. As I ploughed my way through this I kept thinking of a comment by the great photographer Eve Arnold to the effect (and with a few more expletives) that she was not the genius many proclaimed, it was just that everyone else was so mediocre: the praise singers do themselves no favour by shouting about the marvel that this book is.It has one central idea, grounded in social psychology, that with careful thought and planning people can be encouraged to ‘freely chose’ things that are good for them, with the corollary that too much choice or unclear choices will lead to many/most people making bad choices. So far, so good – and the first part (about ⅓) of the book does a pretty good job of explaining some interesting (but not that complex) social psychology. Alas, then the ‘new international edition’ goes off track in that, aside from a brief postscript considering some issues about the circumstances of the 2008 financial crisis, the vast majority of the examples under discussion rely on a some pretty detailed explorations of US-based material – which is a perverse understanding of ‘international’ – made all the more frustrating by Thaler & Sunstein’s jokey, blokey little self-referential asides.Leaving aside the difficulties of behavioural economics – the first major problem with the book, though, is what is not in it and as a consequence what it is able to be used for. There is little doubt that ‘nudging’ is a good thing – we know that we are more likely to continue with decisions when we feel like we have chosen freely (the psychologists call this compliance, and it is a big thing in theories of behaviour change). The big issue for me is not how to ‘nudge well’ – but the direction in which we nudge, and so far it looks to me that the policy applications of this idea have in many cases been little more than a cover for increased privatisation, for a removal of services and social support networks and to generally undermine the social world that many of us rely on to survive. There is a further and key deficiency related to this bigger picture of what the ‘nudges’ are used for, and that is its failure to explore the broader socio-political question of who gets to nudge us – or in their jargon, who gets to be a ‘choice architect’. For a book that has as one of its areas of application politics they seem remarkably unaware of or, more likely, are extremely good at obfuscating a key dynamic of politics – power – while at the same time having constructed a text that is all about making sure that those of us who are subject to various forms of political power (be it about health care plans, buying gas, donating organs or managing our pension funds) do what the wielders of power want us to do. Their notion of ‘libertarian paternalism’ (in many ways an oxymoron but I’ll cut them some slack because they are, after all, economists applying psychology to broader social contexts so have to grapple with two discipline areas that claim to be ‘sciences’ in an effort to assert their credibility) seems to be a synonym for ‘soft power’, so beloved of contemporary liberal imperialists. They set up two ideal type figures – Econs and Humans – and then build a text around a series of methods that enhance the likelihood that (irrational) Humans will make better decisions, where better is defined by what the (rational) Econs would do. In short, hidden within all the popularising language, this is text that is designed to promote ways to make us more like the Rational Economic Man so beloved of neo-classical economics. It is not that they want us to become more powerful people or to gain a greater degree of autonomy and control over our own lives, it is that they want to make us more compliant by making the decisions others want us to make.So, my problem is two-fold. First, this is a book that is dangerous because it focuses only on the means and not the ends, in that the ends that seem to be taken-for-granted are those that are defined by a model and theory of economics that lies at the heart of the current crisis. Second, even if I accept that model and its theories (which I don’t) it is not that this book is wrong, just that it is disappointing. Now I admit that this may be a characteristic of these popular ‘academic’ titles and if I read more of them I’d be less disappointed – but as I continued through this I felt more and more like Eve Arnold; wearied by the mediocrity of others. I get enough of that in my own writing. "
5,014311526X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/155663-david,4,"I was pleasantly surprised by this book. It starts out like many other pop psychology books, describing an array of psychology experiments that are so often in the literature. But, at some point in the book, the story takes a turn into a direction that few other books seem to touch. Nudge is really about the small, subtle pushes that our modern-day world makes to sway one's opinion or real-world choices.The book devotes a separate chapter to each of several real-world scenarios. When a company gives employees a choice among investment plans, how should the be described? Should there be a default plan such that, if no explicit choice is made, gets chosen automatically? What about health plans--they are very complex, and is there one that is best for everyone? (Probably not.) Then there are mortgage plans, organ donation, college funds, and on and on.People are often lazy, and they make a choice once and then forget about it. But, should a company or a government give a subtle nudge by intelligently designing a form, an intelligent default, and so on? Or should the choice be left 100% to the customer?The authors of this book argue that libertarian paternalism may be the answer. Give people the full cast of choices, and give people the freedom to make the wrong choices. But, also give people a default choice that may be better than most of the choices.Some choices are fixable. If you take your clothes to a dry cleaning establishment and they do a poor job, then the next time it is easily correctable; in the future just take your clothes somewhere else. But other choices are not correctable. How many chances do you have in choosing a spouse? While in theory it is a correctable choice, it is not one that my people make over and over again. And, by the way, why should the government have any say at all about marriages? If there are any government benefits to marriage, say taxes, laws, etc., why not distribute those benefits to everyone? The authors argue that there is not reason for the government to be in the marriage business at all.This book is a quick and easy read. I recommend it to people who are trying to formulate policies and even to those who are designing forms for public use."
6,014311526X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/88489-viola,3,"As an economist, Nudge was a book that I desperately wanted to like. Unfortunately, I was disappointed. Perhaps my low rating of the book stems from my high expectations of a book co-authored by the well-regarded behavioral economist Richard Thaler. Without such expectations, my rating might have been higher. But at the same time, without such expectations, I might not have bothered to read the book at all.The only interesting part of the book is the first part, which consists of the first five chapters. Here, the authors lay out the main premise of the book. The decisions humans make are affected by ""nudges."" Since nudges are not easy to define, they are best explained through examples. The clearest example of a nudge is a default. When you register online at a site, you are often asked, ""Would you like to receive future emails?"" By default this box could be either checked or not checked. The default matters; that is, different results emerge under different defaults. The main point of the book is that nudges matter and thus should be carefully designed.The rest of the book presents a laundry list of policies to which we should apply this principle. For me, this got boring fast. For some reason, the authors seem to be obsessed with identifying every possible nudge and offering their nudge design suggestions. The end of the paperback version of the book became really ridiculous - a bonus chapter of twenty more nudges. I think that the hardcover version is saved from this madness, because the bonus chapter was added after the publication of the hardcover version.Many may find Nudge overly political. The authors weigh in on what they believe to be good nudges on a large number of hot political issues such as Medicare and same-sex marriage. I personally didn't mind their political stances as much as I minded the lack of economics.The book is also poorly written. I felt that the publishers gave the authors complete free reign since the authors were well-regarded academics, and obviously academics don't need editors. One problem with the writing was the lack of a targeted audience. The book is supposed to be targeted towards a mass audience; or at least, that is the target of the book's marketing efforts. It is not a textbook or standard teaching material targeted towards undergraduate economics majors. It is also not a serious academic discourse targeted towards other economists. And yet, although it's supposed to be targeted towards the layman, the writing is oftentimes confused about its audience. Additionally, I didn't care for the writing style. While I do enjoy a casual and conversational tone, this book suffered from unnecessary tangential remarks that detracted from the main point. All of the writing issues in this book could have been easily rectified with a good editor. I don't fault the authors as much as I do the publishers for that oversight.I weakly recommend Part I of Nudge to the intellectually curious layman. The rest of the book I recommend only to those want to read a laundry list of political suggestions. "
7,014311526X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1910836-lobstergirl,2,"Libertarians are always annoying, and these two are no exception. Their particular brand of libertarianism they call ""libertarian paternalism"" and it involves the idea of ""nudges,"" which are things/designs/incentives that push people toward ""better"" options. ""Better"" options would include: choosing healthfullier food, not smoking, not driving drunk, enrolling in your company 401(k) plan vs. not enrolling, lessening your factory's carbon emissions. An example of libertarian paternalism of which they approve is requiring fast food restaurants to list calorie counts. More information to help you decide what to eat is good, they think, but banning high calorie menu items outright would constrict freedom, thus bad.The way choices are presented to you is called ""choice architecture."" An example of poor choice architecture was George W. Bush's new entitlement for prescription drugs for seniors, Medicare Part D. There was an enormous number of plans, no good way to compare their various elements to see which plan would work best for you, and if you were unable to decide on a plan, one was selected at random for you. Not just seniors, but their doctors, pharmacists, and experts drafted by the authors found the ""choice architecture"" for Medicare Part D incredibly confusing, and picking out a plan took hours even for experts and economists.(Another example of horrible choice architecture, or choice design, would be Palm Beach County, Florida's infamous butterfly ballot in the 2000 presidential election. Many voters couldn't tell which punch hole was designated for which candidate, and as a result voted for a candidate they had not intended to.)The authors discuss nudges and choice architecture in the contexts of investing, health insurance, organ donation, school choice, privatizing marriage, and other areas. The most compelling chapter for me was on Medicare Part D, because I'm kind of a health insurance nerd. Weaker chapters were on school choice (the authors uncritically accept the notion that vouchers are good) and on medical malpractice insurance.On the latter: they argue that the price of health insurance contains the cost of malpractice lawsuits, and therefore if a buyer of health insurance could waive filing such suits, their health insurance premium would be cheaper, and doctors and hospitals would also be able to charge them less. They claim that malpractice lawsuits increase medical costs by 5 to 9 per cent. First, who knows if that hazy range of numbers is accurate. Although tort reform is of course lovingly put forward by Republicans every time the issue of healthcare costs arises, the consensus among non-Republicans is that malpractice litigation costs are a tiny percentage of overall costs and not worth addressing. What bugs me more about this chapter is that the authors never bother to ask, or to address: just because the cost of lawsuits might vanish from their bottom line, why do we automatically believe that doctors and hospitals would charge a patient less, rather than take the savings as increased profit? How would having two types of health insurance policies, one where you could sue your doctor and one where you couldn't, affect the doctors themselves? Would doctors take patients from each category, or would they restrict their practices only to patients who had agreed not to sue them? If the former, would they charge different prices to the patients according to whether or not they might sue? In other words, this is interesting theoretically, but how would it work in practice? The authors don't care, because they are mostly interested in these clever theoretical notions.The chapter on privatizing Social Security was another instance of mental masturbation. It looked at the system in Sweden, where accounts had been privatized, to see how the choice architecture had affected the way beneficiaries designed their investment plans. Yet the authors don't question whether privatizing Social Security is a good idea or a terrible idea (even though the paperback edition of the book went to press after the giant stock market crash of 2008-2009 and the book contains a postscript discussing some aspects of the crash that could have been avoided with proper nudges). They merely advise that although George W. Bush's yearning to privatize never went anywhere, ""some version of this proposal is likely to be considered again before long"". Well, the crash of 2008 killed all thoughts of Social Security privatization, at least until we become idiots again. Obviously, when countries and economies are run by idiots, all bets are off.They wrap up the book with ideas presented to them, via their website, for other ""nudges."" The stupidest of these is trayless cafeterias (when people use trays, they tend to waste more food and napkins), which is a splendid idea for societies where people have four hands."
8,014311526X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/166376-david,5,"This is a terrific book. The authors cover terrain which has been explored recently in a whole slew of books: loosely speaking, why we humans persistently engage in behavior patterns which do not benefit us in the long term. Their own research, at the University of Chicago, builds upon the work of Tversky and Kahneman in behavioral economics (very much in vogue this past few years). In the book, they provide a funny, engaging, remarkably clear exposition of the various factors which lead us to make poor decisions. This alone would make it worth reading. What makes this book stand out though is that they actually suggest *remedies* that might help us save ourselves from our own flawed gut instincts. "
9,014311526X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1275546-chris,4,"I second-guessed my purchase of Richard Thaler and Cass Sunstein's Nudge: Improving Decisions About Health, Wealth, and Happiness, almost the minute I received my Amazon e-mail receipt -- I had already read Malcom Gladwell's Blink, and heard about the literary disaster that is Sway, and yet there I was, reading Nudge's introduction about the arrangement of cafeteria food.I'm glad I did. While Thaler and Sunstein are happy to revel in the small ways that their insights into ""choice architecture"" can lead to better or worse choices, they also lay out their political principles and detail their impact on current policy debates (e.g., Social Security, Medicare Part D, Education.) To top it all off, they begin the book with a treatment of our cognitive failings, distinguishing between our automatic and reflective processing systems (what's not to love!), leading right into their arguments for how to help the automatic majority overcome their cognitive frailty without infringing the reflective minority's ability to choose.So what is choice architecture? Well, are you choosing out of ten choices, or 100? Are you automatically enrolled in one choice or another if you don't make an active decision? How is that default set? How is information presented to you to about the available choices? All of these questions speak to choice architecture -- in other words, the arrangement and organization of choices -- which has a nasty habit of leading individuals to choices that they themselves would not find optimal (see don't be bob bias, the mind and morality).Furthermore, ""choice architecture, both good and bad, is pervasive and unavoidable."" This point is essential to Thaler and Sunstein's argument if you are a libertarian. Ignoring choice architecture won't make it go away, it will only make it more likely that the choices favored by choice architecture are more likely to be poor. For instance, you can make the default option for new employees enrolled at 5% in a 401(k) with an option to opt-out, or you can make the default option to not be enrolled (as is often the case). If you stick with the current default, many who would otherwise enjoy being enrolled will not do so because of the choice architecture. Thaler and Sunstein recommend acknowledging the importance of choice architecture and deliberately deciding on its design.Thaler and Sunstein aren't interested in helping individuals pick out their dry cleaners; as the authors note, if a dry cleaner performs poorly, it is fairly easy for individuals to make a better decision the next team.Rather, ""people are most likely to need nudges for decision that are difficult, complex, and infrequent, and when they have poor feedback and few opportunities for learning.""Individuals are primed to make poor choices for Medicare Part D, Mortgages, and retirement investments. Thaler and Sunstein don't advocate for eliminating choices because of these problems. On the contrary, their final chapter points to the infamous ""third way"" -- separate from both the command-and-control left and the single-minded 'choice' monkeys of the libertarian right.There needn't be a war between 'no choice' and 'unlimited choice.' Thaler and Sunstein spend around 250 pages explaining that this is indeed a false choice. Like myself, they side with the libertarians when it comes to the importance of choice, and side with the left when it comes to the failure of 'choice' to solve all problems. Choice is important. Coercion isn't necessary. Focus on the choice architecture.Oh, and I have to add. As someone who has long supported responding to the gay marriage debate by taking government out of the marriage business (perhaps keeping a civil union or partnership business) and leaving it to independent churches, I was very happy to see Thaler and Sunstein put forth such an argument in Nudge.Whether you are on the left or right, worth a read!

I frown on pop psychology and rate Nudge higher, and b. I'm trying not to generalise.What I'm trying to say is Nudge fits into the same category as other insightful books such as Gladwell's Blink, or the recent Redirect[[ASIN:0316010669 Blink: The Power of Thinking Without Thinking]][[ASIN:0316051888 Redirect: The Surprising New Science of Psychological Change]]Beginning with a non-partisan disclaimer Nudge explores the concept of choice architecture: essentially controlling the environment in which people make choices to encourage well-being without directly controlling peoples choice.Like most insightful type books, Nudge occasionally errs from actually discussing Nudge's and becoming the author's expression of 'how things should be in the world' but is an enjoyable and balanced read nonetheless.Highlights include The author's discussion of the affects of medical liability insurance, and the privatisation of marriage, but issues from environmentalism and eating peanuts at a party are also included.Much recommended for anyone wanting to think about politics and interventions a little differently."
11,014311526X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7118702-loy-machedo,1,"Loy Machedo’s Book Review – Nudge by Richard H. Thaler and Cass R. SunsteinI love reading book. Books on Thought-Provoking, Critical-Thinking, Cognitive Science, Business, Biographies, Self-Improvement and so on. But the most important characteristic I admire and love about a book, is its ability to make something simple and understandable. Nudge is one book that fails to qualify the last criteria. I presumed that this book was in relation to how we think, how the mind works and connect that to either the economy or money - More like Steven D. Levitt’s Freaknomics or Malcolm Gladwell’s The Tipping Point or the Outliners. However, this book turned out to be a blue-print that most probably only someone from United States would relate to – as most of the content in between was all about 401K’s, Taxes and other stuff that I don’t find appealing at all. Now, these are what I felt the authors tried to do:1)	Cover a lot of ground without being deep.2)	Cherry Picked popular points of Psychology and Influence which have been covered by other authors and streamline them into this book (the smiley face technique, public statement on losing weight, the paradox of choice, peoples inability to explain why they do what they do etc.)3)	And then bring in taxes, organ donation, medical insurance plans (that was never ending), privatizing marriages, political decisions, social security and its benefits, libertarian paternalism – and well the list goes on. By the time I reached the book half way, from loving the book, I began hating the book. I honestly could not bear to read it. And then I struggled to complete it. Predominately, it was the Political theories they had in place that totally put me off. I mean why can’t you stick to either a) Politics or b) How the Mind works? Personally, I feel the authors tried to replicate and combine a style of what Freakonomics (Dubner and Levitt), Predictably Irrational (Dan Ariely), Influence (Robert Cialdini) and Tipping Point (Malcolm Gladwell) all have done and ended up messing up a good book. Overall SummaryA confusing book that miscommunicates to the read what the book is about. The Authors tried to be everything to everyone and ended up being nothing to no one. In my opinion, I feel there are two books here and the Authors need to divide these two books, make them two separate titles and sell them to two different audience groups.

12,014311526X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3897817-morgan-blackledge,5,"It’s the first day of 2019, and I’m writing an addendum to the first review I wrote of this book in 2013 (see below). Although this is a tedious read. In retrospect, this book, as well as Khanaman’s Thinking Fast and Slow remain profoundly influential on my work as a therapist. So, I feel obliged to upgrade this from a 4 to 5 star review (with an asterisk)The important takeaway of the book is that the environment (home, work, school, the DMV etc.) has a WAY bigger effect on our behavior than we commonly understand. Sometimes it’s easier to modify the environment, than to modify the person. Additionally, we should be crafting our environments to elicit the types of behaviors we would like to emit. I always say, it’s easier to choose not to eat chocolate chip cookies if there aren’t any in the house, and you have plenty of good healthy food to eat. That sounds banal in that context, but when applied to other issues from organ donation, to saving for retirement, to recovery from addiction, the point is somewhat less obvi. So without further ado. Here’s the original 2013 review: I finally finished this fascinating (yet oddly boring) book! It took a while -it sat on my currently reading list for around 3 months before I finally caved to the guilt and finished the damn thing- but finish it I did. Here's some reflections.....Traditional economic theory assumes that consumers are rational and self interested agents that make decisions based on the facts. The findings of experimental behavioral economics paint a very different picture. For example; If given a choice between a hamburger that is 10% lean or 90% fat, traditional economic theory predicts that consumers (being rational) will be indifferent because both products are in fact identical. But behavioral economics observes that real people nearly invariably prefer one to the other. The authors of Nudge (economist Richard Thaler and legal scholar Cass Sunstein posit that human decision making is divided between two cognitive systems; the ""Reflective System"" and the ""Automatic System"". The Reflective System is deliberate and accurate but is slower to become involved in the decision process. The Automatic System is fast but inaccurate due to the fact that it operates primarily on the basses of reflexive, innate cognitive biases and heuristics which work well on average, but fail in certain predictable ways. Thaler and Sunstein build their central argument upon the deceptively simple observation that; the way in which choices are presented effects the choices that people make. Thaler and Sunstein refer to people that design menus of choices as ""choice architects"" e.g. mortgage brokers, advertisers, web designers etc. Nudges are little design tweaks in the choosing environment that correct for those cognitive biases that reliably lead modern humans to make bad decisions. Thaler and Sunstein advocate an approach to choice architecture, which they refer to as libertarian paternalism, that ""nudges"" consumers to make good choices without unnecessarily limiting their individual freedom. For example, people who wish to become organ donors ""opt in"" to the organ donation program. Libertarian paternalism advocates making organ donation the default, unless people opt out, thereby raising life saving organ donation rates, while still allowing individuals who object to opt out if they wish. I have to say that there is something very attractive to me about this approach. It utilizes the powerful techniques of design, public relations and advertising, combined with the insights of psychology and other social sciences, to create choosing environments that result in (lazy) people (like me) making good (or at least better) choices. I love the fact that you're still free to be a dick, but you have to work for it. There's something so right about that!===As previously mentioned, I’m upgrading my review from 4 stars (2013) to five stars with an asterisk because it’s a bit of a snore (2019) because of the enduring impact the book has had on my life and work. ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️* Live=Learn!!!!!!"
13,014311526X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3415454-jeremy-kauffman,4,"This is not a well-written book. The writing is prosaic. The pacing is meh. You will almost certainly have no trouble putting it down. It is, however, a book almost everyone should read - especially politicians, technocrats, and others in positions of public policy.Sunstein and Thaler argue that dramatic changes in human behavior can be effected through sensible changes in ""choice architecture"". Choice architecture is the orchestration of options. It can range from how choices are presented (make the broccoli easy to reach and in sight, but put the double fudge cake on the bottom shelf), to default options (make retirement plans opt-out, rather than opt-in), to a wide variety of other ""nudges"".Nudge presents a copious amounts of data from psychology and behavioral economics. It supplements these with examples of successful and unsuccessful choice architecture. Only the most obstinate and orthodox could read this book and not come away convinced that subtle, inexpensive reforms are capable of achieving dramatic, positive changes.Perhaps the most exciting thing about Nudge is that the reforms it proffers are bipartisan. Give people more information about the choices they make? Set defaults that are the best for everyone? Give people feedback about how efficient and effective their decisions are? The only people who can be against these ideas are those with a vested interests in an ignorant or otherwise misled populace.The only question I'm left asking is: why aren't more of these changes happening?"
14,014311526X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/56398216-pap-l-rinc,2,"Even though it has a very valuable core idea, it was a very difficult read for multiple reasons.It's way too verbose and way too American.I was expecting universal personality nudges, not american health industry changes that politicians should do, or 401k changes that Americans should consider, or the Boston system for choosing schools, or how you should allocate your stocks and bonds.And all these in separate, excruciatingly long and detailed chapters, outlining history and unrelated details, that don't apply to the rest of the world.Or maybe they do, because the authors did mention other countries as good (Sweden, Finland, Netherlands) or bad (Romania, my home country) examples. However, they were rather used as contrast between countries; what I wanted was contrast between people/behaviors.The good part can probably be summed up in a few simple sentences:* most big problems have relatively small weak spots* find the weak spot and only attack that, not the whole monster* if you focus on that, big changes are possibleThe book could have come up with more real-life examples for this point."
15,014311526X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7743315-jeanne,4,"Change is hard, yet there are things that can make it easier – or more difficult. I don't buy potato chips, as I can't just eat just one and a quart of ice cream sitting quietly in my freezer is not quiet and, instead, seems to scream my name.There are also things that we can do at the institutional or governmental level to facilitate good decision-making. Absence of intentional influence is not the same as no influence.Nudge: Improving Decisions about Health, Wealth, and Happiness was written by Richard Thaler, who won the Nobel Prize in Economics, and Cass Sunstein, an attorney and director of Harvard's Program on Behavioral Economics and Public Policy. Both come from the school of thought, behavioral economics, which believes that we are not Econs (rational beings slavishly following economic principles), but Humans. We Humans are often misled by cognitive and perceptual biases, overconfident about our abilities (most of us believe ourselves above average), and loss averse in irrational ways. Fundamentally, we are not Computers, but irrational beings.We are also beings faced with making many very difficult decisions: choosing health insurance plans, saving energy (and the planet), eating in health-promoting ways, investing wisely, and choosing a home mortgage are among the choices discussed in Nudge. Thaler and Sunstein describe themselves as libertarian paternalists. They want to preserve choice and the freedom to choose (libertarian), while also believing ""it is legitimate for choice architects to try to influence people’s behavior in order to make their lives longer, healthier, and better"" (p. 5). Nudges are helpful, but Thaler and Sunstein believe we should be allowed to ignore nudges.Better governance requires less in the way of government coercion and constraint, and more in the way of freedom to choose. If incentives and nudges replace requirements and bans, government will be both smaller and more modest. So, to be clear: we are not for bigger government, just for better governance. (p. 14)Here are places where a nudge might be useful. Rather than making me make my retirement choice at random – should I contribute more to stocks or mutual funds? – why not recommend an option based on my age at hire, the number of years I expect to work, and the degree of risk I believe acceptable? When my employer annually asks me what charities I would like to automatically donate to, why not repopulate these fields with last year's choices (my employer leaves these blank)? I could still change my charities or amounts donated. Why not tell my parents which prescription drug plan would be best for them based on their current medications, expected future health, and willingness to accept risk? Why not tell college students that they tend to overestimate the amount that other students drink, thus drinking more themselves?Although I was curious about the various kinds of nudges that Thaler and Sunstein would prescribe, I was also interested in their descriptions of politics, especially as I have been confused and dismayed by our present administration and why they attracted any votes. I haven't found Jonathon Haidt's books on political values terribly convincing or helpful. Thaler and Sunstein helped:Democratic Party has shown a great deal of enthusiasm for rigid national requirements and for command-and-control regulation. Having identified serious problems in the private market, Democrats have often insisted on firm mandates, typically eliminating or at least reducing freedom of choice. Republicans have responded that such mandates are often uninformed or counterproductive—and that in light of the sheer diversity of Americans, one size cannot possibly fit all. (pp. 255-256)Of course, Thaler and Sunstein are right, but also wrong. Democrats put limits on pollution; increase taxes to support education, the arts, and anti-poverty programs; and support gun control and affirmative action. Although Republicans want no part of the above – at least as Democrats frame solutions – Republicans focus on other types of control, more social as opposed to environmental (e.g., abortion, feminist issues, stem cell research, three strikes prison terms).In other words, Thaler and Sunstein's delineation doesn't really hold up.In sum, though, Nudge was clear, interesting, and helpful. Time well used."
16,014311526X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1586355-chad-warner,5,"This book opened my eyes to how humans make decisions, and how easily they can be influenced by their peers and by the way choices are presented to them. Through engaging research and entertaining anecdotes, it shows how to “architect” choices to nudge people towards certain decisions. The authors call this “libertarian paternalism”, because it uses incentives to motivate desired behavior rather than using command and control measures like laws and bans. I highly recommend this book for its practical insight into behavioral psychology and behavioral economics.In an ideal world, people would have the time, knowledge, and motivation to make the perfect choices. In reality, humans are irrational, emotional, ignorant, apathetic, or downright lazy, so simply providing as many choices as possible rarely works. Libertarian paternalism strikes a balance between freedom of choice and incentivizing behavior.I read this book because it was listed in .net Magazine’s The top 25 books for web designers and developers. I picked up a few ideas to use when creating websites for my web design business, OptimWise: use incentives to nudge users in certain directions, provide good default options, and gracefully handle user errors.The authors explain that humans have “automatic” and “reactive” systems; the automatic system is the subconscious, emotional “gut instinct”, while the reactive system is the intellectual conscious. Nudges help the reactive system overpower the automatic system.The authors use libertarian paternalism to advocate specific policies for public and private institutions, dealing with topics in personal finance (saving, retirement, debt, mortgages), health care, education, and politics. They also address the ethical issues of choice architecture.I love personal finance, so I especially liked seeing how nudges can lead to better retirement saving and investing. The authors show how something as simple as automatic enrollment in retirement plans results in a significant increase in participation.I liked the RECAP (Record, Evaluate, and Compare Alternative Prices) concept, which says vendors and service providers should give consumers a statement of the costs associated with different hypothetical patterns of service usage to help them make informed choices about things like electricity and gas consumption.I liked the authors’ idea that people should be able to waive the right to sue for medical malpractice, in exchange for lower medical costs. I’m not sure how I feel about their proposal to privatize marriage; they say this would give religious organizations the freedom to set rules about homosexuality, divorce, etc., while allowing the government to honor civil unions with benefits.6 principles of good choice architecture• iNcentives: motivate behavior with incentives• Understand mappings: show the outcomes that will result from the choices• Defaults: provide default options• Give feedback: show people the effect their choices are having• Expect error: make choices foolproof• Structure complex choices: present complex choices in easily understood waysMiscellaneous notes• The more you ask for, the more you get.• People hate losses twice as much as they like gains.• People like to do what they believe most people think is right. They also like to do what most people actually do."

I know I need help sometimes to get going on a story or making it to the gym. Nudge, by Richard Thaler and Cass Sunstein (of the University of Chicago) wrote the book as a manifesto to “improve decisions about health, wealth, and happiness.” Seeking to foster what they call a new movement of “libertarian paternalism,” the idea of the book melds individual freedom with the promotion by government of socially optimal decisions, so that the citizen and the society both benefit.If this sounds a bit different from the University of Chicago’s reputation as a libertarian, free-market school, the authors have no trouble admitting their lone-wolf status in the Economics department. According to them, because the people are only “nudged” into making better choices, their personal liberty (a paramount concern for economists) is preserved. The authors apply the Nudge model to a host of complex and seemingly intractable issues like Social Security, prescription drug coverage, and preserving the environment. For each issue, an alternative solution is explored and the reader is giving a glimpse of what life would be like if only we could be nudged into doing the right thing.For example, how to get American workers to save more for retirement? Forget the intricate discussions on how people understand their disposable income or how America’s retirement system allocates costs to take care of the elderly; Nudge world simply makes retirement savings automatic, and forces people to opt out of the plans. Presumably, those too lazy to save (note the assumption) now would be too lazy to opt-out under the Nudge system.The authors also show how people can use the Nudge model in their own lives. My personal favorite is their advocacy of the website stickk.com. It allows people to effectively nudge themselves. Say you want to lose 10 pounds and you think it will take a month to do so. Well, you go to stickk, sign-up for free, and set up your nudge. To motivate yourself, you offer to pay a friend of yours $10 week every week that you don’t hit your weight loss goal. After setting up a profile and putting $40 in your Stickk account, you weigh in once a week. If you make your goal, you get $10. If not, your friend gets a nice gift. Naturally, there are many permutations of this nudge. The key is making the nudge hurt enough so you feel beholden to it.A quick read, the book offers some new and innovative ways at looking at public policy problems. Take this as your nudge to check it out from your library. "

Thaler and Sunstein invite us to experience a new world like a Harry Potter Movie. Instead of Magic, Here he guides us with ""Choice Architecture"" pattern, which can help us to decide better and proceed smarter. I can say it's a proactive book. I like Parts like Money, Freedom among I love Author's intelligent case studies and explanations of ""Save More Tomorrow, Choice Architecture, Saving the planet etc"". When he talks about Dozen Nudges, I love Automatic Tax Return, Quit Smoking without a patch, give more tomorrow, The Civility Check etc. Though I felt few concepts are all duplicated & explaining on and on and on, still I would recommend this book to all. To be genuine, I read this book twice. REALLY it's an interesting book to read, to link with our day to day life and to avoid our blunders in life at some extent. But, we know still it's unavoidable. We can try ;)"
19,014311526X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/56007-siah,4,"This is an excellent book if you go into it with a little bit of an open mind. It will challenge many of your fundamental beliefs and principles. And while it might have not changed my core beliefs about supporting quality public education and gay marriage, it still provided a very solid argument to understand the opposing views. I believe everyone will find something on which to be challenged and at times offended. That will apply more so to the liberals than the conservatives. There were a few sections that I found not only disagreeable but quite honestly repulsive and wrong. There is in particular one section. In that, the authors propose an idea for engineering a society that can both allow gay marriage but also allow for a literal interpretation of religious texts. Their solution is to not call the union a marriage anymore. They argue that on every legal document such union should be referred to as a civil union. If you believe in equality for all people, you will on principle disagree with this section. But it shouldn’t stop you from enjoying the rest of the material. The two authors introduce a few interesting concepts. A “nudge” is a small behavior trigger that encourages humans to make a more correct decision. A nudge can be as simple as placing a fly sticker in a urinal so men aim for that to reduce spill. The authors also talk about humans vs econs. An econ is the perfect human if humans could always make rational choices. A human on the other hand, is irrational, arrogant, forgetful and in most cases uninformed. But the human in their view is manipulable. So they argue that a nudge can guide a human to make the rational choice. To make this idea palatable to the conservatives, they introduce the concept of libertarian paternalism. Which they argue means allowing for freedom of choice and personal rights while nudging the uninformed, the non econ, the human, to the right direction. A nudge can be as simple as placing that fly sticker in the urinal, or selecting a good default plan for people’s retirement accounts. But a nudge can also be as grandiose as not allowing people to enter a marriage without a prenuptial agreement. Depending on where you are on the “Free to Choose” scale your blood might be boiling at this point but again keep an open mind and continue reading the book. You will be challenged but you will learn too. The book is dense and you need a lot of will power and mental stamina to get through it. Each section has at least one anecdote to surprise you, perhaps we can call them “huh inspiring”. And this book is full of huh inspiring sections. That for me was very enjoyable. As for the format, the book is what you would expect when an economist and a lawyer collaborate. It is long, detailed and at times reads like a rental lease agreement. What I am saying is that this can be like a textbook but stay strong and positive. The book eases you into the theory of nudging. It starts by providing interesting examples of nudges in everyday life. These chapters might be very applicable for those who design products or architect a service. The middle sections is solely dedicated to personal finance. There is a lot to learn there for every adult. The final section is mostly about applying the nudge theory to a larger society. This part was in fact the most memorable part for me and the most unsettling. That said, I found all of the presented arguments to be very well crafted and thought through. In fact, as a thought exercise I tried to come up with better proposal but at the end I almost always ended up agreeing with what they presented. Richard Thaler is a Noble laureate and a former adviser to Barak Obama but he has also worked in republican think tanks so what you get here reads more like a policy mandate than a book but it should not stop you from enjoying the ocean of ideas in there.

20,014311526X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1677868-steven-peterson,4,"An interesting work. . . . It speaks of how conditions can be changed and perhaps improved by ""nudging"" people. Rather than ""beating up"" on people, subtly nudge them. Fascinating reading and very provocative. Is nudging good? Or manipulative?The authors, Richard Thaler and Cass Sunstein, faculty at the University of Chicago, define a “nudge” as (Page 6): “. . .is any aspect of the choice architecture that alters people’s behavior in a predictable way without forbidding any options or significantly changing their economic incentives.” Indeed, they define their perspective as “libertarian paternalism.” They believe in freedom but also wish to use “nudges” to induce people to improve their health, and live longer and happier.One simple example? Has any male ever used a urinal with a fly painted onto it? This simple nudge reduces “spillage” by 40% as males involuntarily try to hit the “target.” In the process, there is a benefit, less smelliness and messiness in the restroom.The book applies the nudge argument to investments, health, school choice, organ donation, the environment, marriage, and so on. In each case, they try to show how nudges and libertarian paternalism can improve the quality of life of individuals as well as providing social benefits.Questions do arise, as the authors themselves admit. Is this a manipulative approach? Do we subtly manipulate people into doing things that they might not voluntarily wish to do? Thaler and Sunstein address these issues. Each reader will have to determine how well they succeed. A provocative and fascinating work, well worth reading."
21,014311526X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/73915421-q-t-pi,4,"So basically we all need to reprogram our brain with little nudges because humans are inherently irrational creatures. I can buy it. Thaler goes on to explain throughout the text that a majority of the time our brain is operating in an autopilot mode. Our conscious thought is reserved for decisions we need to focus on, and can't always handle the stress of making decisions when it matters.We are burdened with too much or too little information, which leaves us feeling lost or overwhelmed and we need nudges to help push us into the right direction until rational behavior becomes our instinct. Most of his examples revolve around re-establishing our defaults. For example when it comes to employer matched retirement accounts, companies should make the default the maximum amount because it's objectively what's best for their employees in the long run, and if the employee would prefer to not have the max amount they can opt out/or scale back to something else.Same with health insurance. Rather than overwhelming people with options, Thaler suggested offering a default of 80% coverage for general expenses and building out from there based on any further needs a person might have. Another less expensive default was leaving fruit out instead of sugary snacks. Ultimately, we have to make doing the right and the healthier thing easier, because we have a tendency to fall back on what's familiar or choose immediate gratification over long-term success. "

And again, if you’re anything like most Americans, chances are you and your resolution parted ways sometime around Valentine’s Day. Take heart: you’re not alone, and it’s not that you actually want to spend more hours watching sitcom reruns—you just need a nudge.Most humans are remarkably bad at making choices in their own best interest. We make predictable and systematic mistakes in reasoning, and we let them guide our choices. We rely too much on gut reactions and not enough on conscious thought. We use rules of thumb to make guesses when we don’t have much to base them on. We are overly influenced by events that are recent or close to us. We are reluctant to make choices that others can make for us. And we are unfailingly, unrealistically optimistic about outcomes.It’s no big deal if we pick the wrong tie or breakfast cereal, but there are major consequences when thinking errors influence how much energy we use, how we interact with our neighbors, whether we vote, how we take care of our health, and what we want for our communities. Richard Thaler and Cass Sunstein, two University of Chicago economists, believe that we can vastly improve the quality of decision-making by understanding where people typically go wrong and by using “nudges” to help people make choices that are truly in their best interest.In Nudge: Improving Decisions About Health, Wealth, and Happiness (Yale University Press, 2008), Thaler and Sunstein suggest that “people make good choices in contexts where they have experience, good information, and prompt feedback—say, choosing among ice cream flavors.” Conversely, people make bad choices when they don’t have much experience and when feedback and consequences are delayed or indiscernible. Unfortunately, decisions in our personal lives and in our communities often fall into the latter category. Most people can’t picture how a big box store zoning decision will change the way their neighborhood looks or feels, or how expanding a 2-lane road into a 4-lane one might impact their lives in 20 years. When faced with complex decisions like those, most citizens accept the default option: vote with their guts or don’t vote at all.Thaler and Sunstein’s solution to our shortcomings in logic is to help people to make smarter decisions without forcing their choices. Nudge is directed toward “choice architects”—those people who have “the responsibility for organizing the context in which people make decisions.” Choice architecture is at play in everything from the design of election ballots to placement of stop signs, structuring of payroll and benefits options to setting up chairs for a community meeting. By consciously designing how information and options are presented, we can encourage people to make the decisions they would rationally make if they had complete information and perfect reasoning abilities.According to Thaler and Sunstein, a nudge “alters people’s behavior in a predictable way without forbidding any options” or drastically changing their incentives (i.e. through payments or fees). Putting fruit at eye level in a cafeteria counts as a nudge; banning junk food does not. Telling people what they’d save through energy conservation is a nudge; paying them to conserve is not.The book is full of nudges from various fields—economics, healthcare, education, environment—nearly all of which have lessons for improving citizen engagement and community decisions. A few key nudges can be easily applied to communities and planning: * Priming. Small reminders and features of our surroundings can have massive effects. One study found that it’s possible to increase the probability of voting by 25% simply by asking registered voters the day before an election whether or not they plan to vote. Perceptions and decisions can be influenced by things as simple as refreshments: people served hot coffee at a meeting have been shown to cooperate better than those served iced coffee. * Norms. Most people are influenced by peers, but are more likely to change if they are reminded of an accepted norm than a problem behavior. Colleges have found that it’s easier to reduce binge-drinking by highlighting that a majority of students does not drink excessively than by focusing on the problematic minority that does. A town could more effectively increase voter turnout by publicizing the fact that 60% of residents do vote, but we more often hear about the 40% that do not. * Feedback. It’s hard to make a decision when you don’t know how you measure up to your neighbors. A California utility company gave customers feedback by printing neighborhood comparisons on energy bills, along with a “smiley face” for bills with relatively low energy usage and a frown for those with high usage. The simple nudge was enough to ensure that high usage went down, without driving low usage up. * Risk-aversion and framing. People are naturally risk-averse, so they are more responsive to the possibility of losing money than gaining the same amount. People are more likely to take action if they are told it will cost $350 if they don’t conserve energy, than if they are told they will save $350 if they do conserve. A community could expect a similar response when framing a ballot measure about municipal cost-cutting. * Self-control. Most of us struggle with motivation and self-control, but there are ways to help people with commitments and consequences. Several new websites help individuals set a goal (losing 10 pounds, attending three public meetings, saving $1,000) and back it by putting up money or agreeing to another consequence. If the individual succeeds, he gets his money back. If he fails, it goes to charity or—even better—to an opposing political party or archrival baseball team.Nudges aren’t foolproof, and detractors have plenty to say as well. Some see a fine line between nudging and an Orwellian world of pressing, cajoling, shoving and intimidating. Others argue that evil nudgers can co-opt nudges for their own sinister purposes. Still others claim that people should have the right to make their own decisions—even when they’re flat out wrong. Thaler and Sunstein address most of those objections through “libertarian paternalism,” a paradigm that emphasizes using nudges to make people’s lives better while still ensuring that people are not forced into choices. Regardless of one’s philosophy, Thaler and Sunstein point out that intentional and unintentional nudges are pervasive and inevitable. You’ve been nudged before and you’ll be nudged again, so you might as well keep on nudging, and try to do so in a positive direction.There are plenty of ways for citizens and communities to do just that. Challenge yourself and your neighbors to commit to public participation, and put up some money to prove it. Publicly reward people who participate and contribute to the community. And next time you’re organizing a contentious meeting, be sure the coffee is hot.Read more reviews by the Orton Family Foundation in our Scenarios e-journal at http://www.orton.org/resources/public....-Rebecca Sanborn Stone"
23,014311526X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3843117-ensiform,4,"The authors, both economists at University of Chicago, advocate what they call “paternal libertarianism” in order to improve an equal footing for all in the areas of health care, marriage, taxes, and so on, without impinging on freedom any more than absolutely necessary. They argue, reasonably, that everyone with a stake in an issue or a semblance of power is, whether they like it or not, a change architect – that even not interfering and allowing totally laissez-faire markets to evolve is still doing something (“If you choose not to decide, you still have made a choice,” as Neil Peart says) – so governments and free markets should do their nudging in a positive and helpful way. For example, making a simple and high-returning investment the default option on a retirement package the default is a nudge that helps those who would be otherwise lost in a sea of legal and economic mumbo-jumbo if the default were “find your own damn retirement package.”The authors write in a pleasing, non-preachy, conversational style, and make their points clearly, requiring no economic understanding to follow their ideas, many of which are more or less common sense (and thus will never be implemented by our government) while others are intriguing possibilities, such as Save More Tomorrow, which ties savings plan deposits to future raises. Although I enjoyed reading the book, for me it was basically preaching to the converted, without the necessary punch behind the ideas to ever convince any Republican big-government corporate-nanny-state lover. Actually I was expecting it to be more focused on personal, psychological nudges of the kind the authors discuss at the beginning, the way perceptions can deceive, the way self-control strategies can be used to hack one’s own mind, and the values that humans give to losses and gains. When the book hit its political and social manifesto stride, I was slightly disappointed, but the authors’ chummy style and practical ideas kept me interested. "

Melancholy students who have used up their vital forces in their studies, and the old in whom these forces are in any case declining, are therefore advised to avoid as far as possible plants, herbs, animals, stones, and the like belonging to Saturn, and to use and surround themselves with plants, herbs, animals, stones, people, belonging to the more fortunate, cheerful, and life-giving planets, of which the chief are Sol, Jupiter, and Venus. . . .

It is a ‘choice architecture’ which alters people’s behavior in a predictable way without restricting any options. A nudge must be slight and easy to implement. •	‘Choice architect’ is setting the context in which people make decisions.•	Small changes and context can lead to big changes in people’s actions and behavior.•	People tend to be overly optimistic and over estimate their abilities most of the time.•	Framing a question and default options are very powerful tools which deciding.•	Never underestimate inertia and the effect that default options can have on people’s decision-making.•	People often use rules of thumb to make faster and easier decisions.•	People tend to be happier with their decisions when they have fewer options.•	People pay less attention than most people think. People therefore tend to conform to what they think people expect, not what is really true.•	We are heavily influenced by others even if they don’t mean to do so. •	People tend to follow what the crowd is doing.•	Certain subtle cues affect the way we behave in most situations. •	The cases where there is a delay between an action and its benefits are more vulnerable to nudges than where immediate gratification is available.•	One learns the best when he is getting a clear and immediate feedback."

I liked the first part, where the authors discussed choice architecture generally. However, they then went on to discuss many choice architecture issues in a manner I found confusing. Two examples seem appropriate to consider. The authors seem to find fault with the way student loans are done. They seem to criticize schools for selecting a few loan providers to recommend, because there is bribery to become one of the ones selected. The authors then criticize another plan (I think Medicare) for not recommending certain of the available plans, because people have too much choice. So it seems to me that any system may suffer from one of these problems. Or someone who is deemed an ""outside expert"" could advise, but I'm not sure how to prevent the bribery problem there either. The authors seem to indicate that it's best if companies force people to participate in some form of retirement plan ""for their own good"" but the authors do not seem to recognize that enrolling people and automatically matching their contribution also imposes costs on the employer. I don't know why people don't enroll in programs that give them free money, but at what point do we make people the masters of their own destiny. I think they and I differ in our views on this. It seems that other people don't have this difficulty with this book, so maybe it's just me. Your mileage may vary."

There was a little bit about ""choice architecture"" in the beginning, but nothing that extended further than common sense. They then left discussion of choice architecture to focus on what the authors' thought should be the solution to problems like losing weight, medicare/health plans, marriage equality (same sex marriage) and retirement accounts (to focus on a few).And then there was lots of discussion about how they are libertarian paternalists, which really stuck in my craw. It basically came down to: how they would try to push (""nudge"") people into choosing what is ""best."" Best being completely subjective at the discretion of the authors, of course. It's easy to just swallow that their brand of pushing is good using innocuous ideas like saving for retirement ""best"" (which can easily be decided by ""most amount of money gained by retirement""), but the idea that a couple of smug guys deciding what is ""best"" in a variety of any social issues just annoyed the crap out of me."

38,014311526X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1363537-yevgeniy-brikman,3,"A book with some interesting ideas in it, but who is it for? Who is the target audience? It covers topics from weight loss to retirement planning to privatizing marriage to government policy on health care, so it feels a bit unfocused. Moreover, the book repeats a lot of the information about cognitive biases from ""Thinking Fast and Slow"" and ""Predictably Irrational,"" but not nearly as effectively as those two books. If you can get past all of that, there are a few valuable takeaways: * Libertarian paternalism: the author's preferred political stance is that you should always give people the freedom to choose (libertarian), but that it is acceptable for the choice architect to try to exert influence towards the choices that will help people be happier and healthier (paternalism). In other words, it's OK for the person laying out the choices to nudge people towards ""good"" decisions, but ultimately, if someone wants to pick something ""bad,"" they should always have the freedom to do so.* Choice architecture: when you give people a list of choices, how you present those choices has a major impact on what people ultimately decide. Example #1: in Germany, where organ donation uses an opt-in system (default = you are not a donor), only 12% of citizens give consent; in Austria, where organ donation uses an opt-out system (default = you are a donor), 99% of citizens give consent. Example #2: if a doctor says, ""90 out of 100 patients who have this surgery are still alive and well 5 years later,"" you might think that this is a pretty good survival rate; but if the same doctor says, ""10 out of 100 patients who have this surgery don't survive past the 5 year mark,"" you might have a very different reaction, even though it's the same information. * Choice architect: if you are the person who is presenting the list of choices (the ""choice architect""), you can't avoid choice architecture. You have to present the list of choices in _some_ manner—taking into account what information is visible, what defaults you pick, and many other factors—so the argument in the book is that you should make this decision consciously and following the idea of libertarian paternalism (i.e., you can nudge people towards good choices, but always make all choices available).* Some interesting examples of nudges:- People are heavily influenced by what other people are doing. If you want to encourage someone to do X, tell them about all the other people who are doing X. E.g., tell them about all the other people buying your product, or all the other people already voting for a certain candidate (e.g., John Kerry may have won later states in the 2004 primary simply because he won a few states early on).- Near measurement effect. Asking people about how they plan to act makes them more likely to act that way in the future. For example, if you ask people ""will you be voting tomorrow?"", and that person says yes, they are more likely to actually vote the next day than if you had never asked.- There is a lot of value in merely disclosing the relevant information. For example, credit card companies should be required to send you a summary at the end of the quarter or year that shows you a clear breakdown of your purchases and payments, including, most importantly, where most of your payments went (e.g., how much you paid in fees and interest). This would be incredibly valuable in nudging people towards better spending habits; it would also make it easier to compare different credit card companies, as you could more clearly see what sorts of fees and interest they would've had against the same set of purchases. The same sort of information disclosure would be valuable with mortgage payments (how much did you spend during the year; how much off that went to interest and fees; how would that compare to other mortgage options). Disclosure for companies and products is also very valuable. For example, the energy star label, had a powerful effect on the entire appliance and electronics industry, as companies freely started to try to improve enough to earn that label (though they still had the choice not too, as per libertarian paternalism). Similarly, companies that handle toxic chemicals should be required to publicly disclose what chemicals they have and in what quantities; customers would take notice, and this would exert positive pressure to reduce the use of these chemicals (again, with no legal requirement to force them to stop).- Cooling off period: certain risky activities should have a required cooling off period. This is especially useful for rare activities that involve intense emotions. For example, it makes sense for divorce to have a cooling off period to ensure that couples who get in a nasty fight have some time to think things over (""sleep on it"") before short-term emotions lead them to a snap decision they'll regret in the long term. This is a nice example of libertarian paternalism, as the choice is always still there (e.g., to get a divorce), but you present it in such a way to nudge people towards better choices.* A few other interesting, random ideas from the book:- Privatize marriage. The government should not be involved in marriage, as with marriage, it's impossible to allow for both (a) freedom of religion and (b) equality. Instead, marriage should be treated as any other business arrangement. Two people are free to sign a contract together, similar to a business partnership, and that may confer a small number of legal or tax implications. Marriage itself should be handled solely by private institutions, and they should be allowed to impose whatever rules they please for that.- Slippery slope counter-argument: one common criticism of libertarian paternalism is the ""slipper slope argument"" that says that it's too easy to go from nudges to hard requirements. The book argues against this as follows: first, does the basic proposal behind libertarian paternalism have merit? If not, then the proposal should be fixed. But if the proposal does have merit, then instead of avoiding the concrete benefits of the proposal due to the fear of some hypothetical slippery slope, let’s instead find ways to put sand on that slope and make it less slippery. - The publicity principal: governments and companies should never adopt policies that they wouldn't want to defend publicly.- Self control: the book talks a lot about how much people struggle with self control, such as with trying to eat less, get up on time, or better manage your money. It argues for the value of self control tools that nudge you towards healthier habits. For example, eating from a smaller plate can help in eating less; alarm clocks help you get up on time; maintaining mental accounts and budgets (e.g., christmas savings account with almost no interest). Many of these tools are inherently inefficient (e.g., your money doesn't care what ""account"" it's in and it would be more efficient to have it all in an account that maximizes returns), but we're willing to accept these inefficiencies to help us have control over our lives. Discussions of cognitive biases, choice architecture, and the lack of self control always make me wonder, do we really have free will or not? "
39,014311526X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/13206524-john,4,"My rating may be biased by the fact that I have already read ‘Misbehaving’ by Richard Thaler already, which I feel is superior to ‘Nudge’. This is not to say that there are not many redeeming qualities to this book. It also applies to a broader range of topics, and is organized in a evolutionary way. The initial part of the book delves into the psychological idea of a “nudge”. These can be used for positive, and unfortunately, for negative devices. Of course, the authors show how intervention and nudges through creative strategies can lead people pass inaction.A great deal of the benefits derived from this book can be found in the initial phases which show how people make decisions. And, unfortunately how people do not make decisions, and through their inaction suffer greatly. As a financial professional, I can take exception to some of the financial strategies as perhaps a bit too simplistic, but to a certain degree they are spot on. The areas of social change that are discussed in the book can be seen as a bit controversial. It doesn’t seem that there is a political ax to grind, but nonetheless, there is some more radical ideas perhaps. All in all it was an enjoyable, light read that certainly provides insight into the subtleties of decision-making, human nature, and day to day psychological obstacles that society faces. "
40,014311526X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/41901229-gary-moreau,4,"I admit to buying this book after Richard Thaler received the 2017 Nobel Prize in Economics for his work in “understanding the psychology of economics.” And to be fair, this book was published in 2008, so I’m sure Mr. Thaler and Mr. Sunstein both have a large body of work that post-dates it.The book is well written and the authors are methodical in both laying out their case and pointing out its potential flaws. It doesn’t compromise the book in any way, but I did find it a bit odd that they refer to themselves throughout the book in the third person. When I first came across it I had to recheck the cover to make sure they weren’t referring to someone else, but it’s a minor point of style. I was enthused by the idea of mixing sciences; in this case psychology and economics. As the authors note, economists have historically worked with a proxy of the average person that is fully informed, completely rational, and lives in a vacuum. That’s not where the people who actually make, spend, and invest money live and that gap between what the authors term Econs and Humans has historically compromised a lot of otherwise sound economic theory.The ideas in the book are built around what the authors call libertarian paternalism. Over-simplified, it’s paternalism with choice, in which the paternalism is achieved by nudging the choices in ways that are effective, but otherwise cheap in cost, modest in sacrifice, and easy to avoid. It’s a kind of win-win solution in which one win is slightly favored by human decency or universal standards of justice.We are constantly nudged without always being conscious of the nudging. When you stand in front of a retail display deciding which shampoo to buy you may have no idea how deliberately that display has been constructed by the retailer and the manufacturers. Tremendous amounts of thought and research are behind it. It’s established fact that positioning drives sales, often more than the variations in products and prices themselves.Most of the nudges that Professors Thaler and Sunstein introduce are less invasive and more transparent than the commercial nudges we are already subject to. How to get people to save more for retirement? How to get more organ donors? How to combat obesity and encourage people to live healthier life styles? In all cases, there is ample evidence that this is what people themselves want. They are impeded in their efforts, however, by the realities of human psychology. Things like the “status quo bias”, “pluralistic ignorance”, and “loss aversion” are all existing nudges common to the human psyche. Fitting in, going along with the crowd, and irrational optimism are as natural as the sunrise.Thaler and Sunstein just want to use these commonplace and natural biases to nudge people toward decisions that they probably want to make but frequently don’t, for reasons having little to do with the value of the intention. The idea makes a lot of sense and I found myself in general agreement most of the way. I admit to having some difficulties with the context at times, however. For example, in their discussion relating to retirement savings, one chapter is titled, “Naïve Investing”, and the authors suggest ways in which savers could be enticed into more astute strategies by way of theoretically painless nudges. There is, however, an inevitable bias underlying the nudge itself. In this case it is the conventional wisdom that equities outperform fixed income investments over a long period of time. This is true in the aggregate and over a long period of time, of course, but not universally true when considering the investment needs and horizon of a single investor.My point is not to argue that bias, however, which they, in fact, acknowledge. My point is merely that the nudge itself introduces its own contextual bias, creating, in effect, a multi-level bias that the “choice architects,” in the vernacular of nudging, must be cognizant of if the nudging is to realize the original objective of positive paternalistic influence.The authors don’t ignore this incremental bias, mind you. On a related note, they cite the example of an Enron employee who lost his entire life savings in company stock, making a sound and appropriate argument in favor of further limiting 401k and defined benefit plan investments in company stock. They’re right, of course, although in this case I think an outright ban is ethically warranted.The “nudge” is, more or less, an aggressive form of default planning that recognizes the weaknesses in human behavior, particularly our seemingly instinctive inability to understand probability theory. (As Peter Hollins points out, in a sample of 23 people the chances of two of them sharing a birthday is 50-50.)In the closing chapters of the book the authors acknowledge the potential criticisms that will be leveled at libertarian paternalism from both the right and left extremes of the political spectrum. Their defense is a strong one but there is an implicit admission that said defense relies on the duality of paternalism and libertarianism. I agree with their assessment that the combined term is not an oxymoron, but one without the other will render the concept less defensible. And that’s where the execution, as they fully acknowledge, could compromise the intent. Or as the old adage goes, the only difference between theory and practice is the practice.When all is said and done I think that what the authors are really advocating is simpler than it reads—moderation, compromise, and common sense. “With respect to government, we hope that the general approach might serve as a viable middle ground in our unnecessarily polarized society.” Nudge on. "
41,014311526X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1318278-allisonperkel,5,"Nudge was not what I expected. I was looking for something about marketing, personal impulse, and more on how the brain can fool you. However I got something much more compelling: Nudge. Here our two authors take a general theory; choice architecture, and present it in a very simple, easy to understand package. At times the writing is humorous (other times their jokes fall pretty flat) but the meanings were never lost. Quite simply, with a little bit of retooling, we could have a potentially huge impact on how our society works (within certain realms). This is powerful and heady stuff indeed. And not being a fan of the Chicago School of Economics, I personally was blown away by the simple fact that I agreed with these two professors so very much. At the 50,000 foot view, a nudge is a simple change that gently pushes the odds of someone doing, or not doing something, in the direction that the choice architect wants. A great example, not from this book, is placing items a store wants to move on the isle end caps. A better example, from this book, is having an opt-in organ donor policy in order to get more people to become donors and thus save more lives. Sometimes the authors really hit home run after home run for example when they talk about the benefits of cap and trade and on increasing taxes on polluters. Bonus, they are all for complete transparency (yay!). Even better, they give examples of how complete transparency has helped in the past! This all pushes the reader toward seeing their point of view on the subject. However other parts lost a little of the choice architecture luster. One chapter that I believe is brilliant was a stretch for choice architecture - and that was the chapter on same sex marriage. They argue that the states should get rid of marriage, create simpler, civil unions for all and let religious groups (or scuba groups) marry whomever they want. Now I'm all for this - government should not be in the business of marriage and everyone, gay, straight, etc should be able to have a civil union - a legally binding contract together, if they so chose. With all that goes with it (taxes, the right to visit each other in the hospital, etc). however this was a stretch for the main topics of the book. Still it was great to see a rational argument for giving everyone the same rights. As someone wise once said, everyone should have the right to marry the person they want to annoy (in a loving way) for the rest of their life!Past that, the book also gave me some food for thought on school programs (so called vouchers) and the medicare drug option program (and how we could make it better). The latter is actually something that I'm starting to look at as my mom is trying to figure out what to do. She's a former pharmacist so if she's having trouble, you know the design is pretty bad! The simple proposals in Nudge would make life a ton easier. Simply import your current drug regime and get a breakdown on which plan best fits your needs. How much easier could you ask for? Total transparency with an easy mechanism to make things work. Overall this was a great, quick read that left me wanting to read a little more deeply on this topic. This book, by design, only skims the surface. That's both its blessing and its failure. There were too many topics covered, briefly, and not enough meat at times. This left a few of the ideas feeling half formed; which I think is a disservice to the authors. I don't agree with all their ideas but their presentation was fair, well thought out and articulated from the position of wanting to help everyone - especially those who don't know what their best interests are (and we all fit into that category sometimes). An excellent read."
42,014311526X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3084169-ali,3,"I enjoyed the book especially the earlier parts where the authors talk about design architecture (or something similar) and examples related to it. The later part where they enter into a justification of their libertarianism it becomes too ideological for my taste. The book is unnecessarily long as well. The chapter on credit card (for example) was devoid of any additional insight and merely repetitive. There are parts which are actually awful, especially the one on health care, where they try to ignore/hide the dysfunctionality of the system and present trivial fixtures."
43,014311526X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10578555-sindy-li,4,"This is a great book! It's one of those books that applies the idea of System 1 (automative/intuitive) and System 2 (reflective/""reasoning"") from psychology, and in this particular case it's applied to ""choice architecture""--the design of frameworks/structures that affect people's choices over pretty much anything (another good example of this type of book is Jonathan Heidt's ""The Happiness Hypothesis"" which applies the System 1 and System 2 idea to help us understand and promote individual flourishing--a great book as well). The description of System 1 and System 2 is not the nicest possible (""Thinking Fast and Slow"" is the most beautiful I've seen), but the jewel lies in the application part. Sunstein and Thaler show us how much choice architecture matters in our life, how our ""irrational""/intuitive System 1 leads us to make bad choices, and how well-designed choice environments can help us avoid bad choices and improve our lives. There seems to be a lot of inefficiencies lying around the world to be corrected by simply good choice architecture!--but of course there will be a lot of obstacles for making such changes, and many people aren't even aware of the problems. (in particular, pressing issues like Social Security and healthcare in the US, and environmental protection anywhere in the world) The authors also supplied good responses to potential criticisms. I think a really meaningful thing would be to make people--experts, politicians as well as the public--more informed of the importance of choice architecture, so it will be part of our language in the discussion of policies, and there will be pressure towards better choice designs as well as more monitoring over the governments' choice architecture. This book should be highly recommended to any ""choice architect"", especially all current and future politicians!(However, I don't quite agree with the authors on their approach to marriage. I think it is beneficial for the state to offer contracts to help people implement self-control, if they voluntarily enter into such contracts. Perhaps a better way than the current regime is to offer different contracts with a good default option.)Thank you Sunstein and Thaler for this engaging, informative and thought-provoking book!(by the way, read this book and the many instances of human ""irrationality"" will make anyone give up libertarianism!)"
44,014311526X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/19356945-john-gurney,5,"Richard Thaler, father of behavioral economics, and his University of Chicago colleague, law professor Cass Sunstein, wrote this influential work in 2008. Their admirable goal was to align real human behavior with societal goals by ""nudging"" people in the right direction, given the many heuristic failings identified by behavioral economic research. Thaler and Sunstein dubbed their school of thought ""libertarian paternalism"". At its best, nudging is a low cost, completely non-coercive means to guide citizens to commonly accepted ends. To their credit, Thaler and Sunstein devote considerable space to the limitations of their approach, its risks in nefarious hands, and the common complaints against nudging. Low hanging policy fruit was modifying governmental policy to allow ""opt out"" 401(k) savings plans rather than just ""opt in"". Behavioral economic research shows the sad results of human habits with so many failing to participate in retirement plans, even forfeiting significant free match money. Many people fail to complete the paperwork, even though they rationally would like to. A nudge approach is to switch the plan to ""opt out"" where the default is automatic enrollment and the participant must exert effort to drop out. The actual real world results of ""opt out"" retirement plans have been nothing short of amazing. Technically, it is libertarian in that no one is required to participate -anyone can drop out at any time. A similar program is the ""save more tomorrow"" scheme now fairly common in 401(k)s.The devil can be in the details on expanded ""nudge"" plans, but this path-breaking book has already led to the application of behavioral economics in policies in the United States and the United Kingdom. The authors believe there are many market-based nudge policies, at trivial low cost to governments, that both Democrats and Republicans can agree upon. Whether you agree or not, this is a fascinating and important book. It is written in lively, amusing prose."
45,014311526X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7693283-terry-pearce,3,"This is aging a little but is still useful. It has a lot of good ideas about and support for nudges, and much of their argument around why nudges work and the idea that we should use nudges is well-put. The two biggest flaws are:1) They should focus less on the what and more on the how. Their ideas on what constitutes good policy towards which people should be nudged are much less well-backed than than evidence on how nudges work; much of it is little more than personal opinion.2) With Libertarian Paternalism they make the standard mistake of advocating for a half-way point between two polarised sets of opinions as a logical compromise. Libertarianism, at least as advocated across much of the US, is nothing less than pulling up the ladder behind those who benefited first and leaving the poorest to fend for themselves. In particular, the authors are far too reliant on markets in some solutions. Markets for healthcare and education don't work. Regulated markets in their place can do great things, but 'choice' in education and healthcare has been proven again and again to be a pointless waste of money.Nevertheless, if you're looking for ideas about how to nudge, you'll get them here; you'll just have to wade through a lot to get there."
46,014311526X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/19007827-arron-kallenberg,4,"I read Nudge because Daniel Kahneman talked about it in his book ""Thinking, Fast and Slow,"" which was excellent. Nudge is good, although it is not nearly as dense (or rich) as Kahneman's book. However, it is still thematically similar. Furthermore, Nudge focuses more on the practical application of many psychological theories (including those pioneered by Kahneman) and less on the and inter-workings of the theories themselves. Where Kahneman is painstakingly conveying the results of many decades of scientific study with an admirable stoic neutrality, Nudge has much more of a political agenda, admittedly and blatantly advocating society and government's adoption and use of ""libertarian paternalism."" That being said, Nudge makes a great case for the ideas it presents, and can be admired for firmly planting the ""libertarian paternalism"" flag in the ground. It is also interesting to note that Cass Sunstein (one of Nudge's two authors) worked in the Obama administration as the Administrator of the White House Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs, presumably attempting to implement policies that would ""nudge"" Americans on a large scale while he was there."

The book essentially starts with a debate on what Libertarian Paternalism is and whether it is just to manipulate people's choices like that. Once we move past that, the next question that comes is that how we help people to make good decisions about health, wealth and happiness. Here is where the magic begins. You would be surprised to know the ways in which you have been nudged already. Not that you were forced, but nudged, and only into ways that are good for you, even though you didn't realize this at that time. It is an enlightening book into how we can ensure that people are well informed and they take the right decision. Not just for those into marketing but also for those into policy formulation and governance, this book is a delightful read. Now, are you convinced already or shall I nudge you some more?"
48,014311526X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3065149-dave-emmett,4,"This was surprising political for a book on psychology and design, but I can understand why they took that route. I enjoyed how specifically the defined the idea of nudging (people are oriented towards a specific choice, but they are still given the freedom to choose other options) and the idea that all choices nudge people towards something - it often just isn't 'designed'.This book also introduced me to the new label of ""choice architect"" which sounds super cool. I'm going to describe myself as a Choice Architect sometime."
49,014311526X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/17262748-s-nileson,4,"The concept of the nudge, long explored by the social sciences yet never truly applied in scalable practical fashion, is ingenious, but you don't need to write an entire book based on it. I would, however, recommend this to basically everyone I meet, should the opportunity arise."
50,014311526X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3606187-hieu,4,A good book. It doesn't deep-dive into theory as much as Thinking Fast and Slow but it provides ample example of real-life applications.

53,014311526X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/59739-shaun,5,"Suppose that you were in charge of a school district and you were given the responsibility of making the students healthier. Thus, you have a few options: 1. Take away all of the candy and soda from the vending machines. 2. Serve the desserts in the lunch line first instead of last. 3. Make the students eat in the cafeteria instead of an off-campus period during lunch hour. 4. Close the vending machines down during the lunch hour. 5. Make a separate dessert line from the regular lunch line.Now with these options, let’s say these have been the respective responses: 1. From option 1, the students complain and no one is happy. 2. From option 2, kids eat the dessert first, which went against your plan. 3. From option 3, some students complain, but it may force others to prepare a lunch at home, which might upset some already busy parents and the already stressed students. 4. From option 4, the students may complain because those are the peak hours of getting food. Plus, the school might lose some money because no one is buying food from these vending machines. 5. From option 5, there may be some inconvenience, but surprisingly, the kids get healthier.Now this isn’t just some thought experiment. You really do these five options in five different schools and collect the data and you discover that option 5 is the most practical choice without losing a huge benefit. Thus, you “nudged” the kids into eating healthy. But why the word “nudge”? The authors claim that they are for a new term that goes with nudging: libertarian paternalism. We often think that just maximizing choices is the best option. However, the more choices one has, it just makes things more confusing and it could make things worse. Thus, there should be a choice architecture where you’re nudged toward a certain route.Notice that you’re not forcing the kids to not eat dessert in option 5. The students can still eat dessert if they wish. There is no separate cost, it still comes with the meal. But perhaps the students don’t want to get into a second line for some reason. And this makes the students healthier. Thus, the choice is still open (hence the libertarian portion), but you have nudged them into not getting that dessert (hence the paternalism portion). Basically, this is what the book is about. It’s about building up a choice apparatus to nudge the people around you into the optimal choice even though there are other choices around. You can think of it like putting candy at the cash register instead of fresh fruit. By putting candy there, you have a choice of getting that candy or not, but the store is nudging you into getting that candy.Now that we’ve got the concept: let’s apply this to finances, schools, health, and marriages.FinancesWhen it comes to saving money for retirement, stocks, school loans, social security, etc. there are many options on what to do. Unfortunately, most people just pick the default option (which is basically don’t do anything). The authors recommend that the default option should be something else. For example, when it comes to 401(k) plans, you have to fill out a form just to get that started. But what if you automatically get the plan, and if you don’t want the plan, all you have to do is put a check mark next to the question “Check here if you don’t the company retirement plan” or something like that on your application form? It gives advice on employers and businesses to nudge people to a certain choice. It doesn’t really apply to me because I work in the public sector, but surely this advice would be beneficial to governmental jobs and the government should use this.With stocks, never invest all of your paycheck into the company that you work for. Enron is an example of that going wrong. Don’t put all of your eggs in one basket in other words. However, you should put the same amount of eggs into different baskets.HealthAt this point, I think you’re getting the idea: if you give people too many choices, they have no idea how to begin because there’s no guide on what to choose. Thus, you must give them some nudges and design a choice architecture to make them have good choices.The authors begin with Medicare. President Bush proposed Plan D which literally gave seniors over 100 plans. That’s a lot! Even the experts in these fields were confused on the differing plans. Thus, many seniors didn’t sign up and they got the default plan, which was basically one assigned at random. The authors propose that the default shouldn’t be chosen at random, but an intellectual assessment so that the plan works best for each person. They give other ideas too but I won’t go into details here.With organ donations, they get into some controversy here. The default has always been thus: You’re not an organ donor unless you specify that you want to be one. The authors suggest to change the default: You are an organ donor unless you specify that you don’t want to be one. They’ve done studies and organ donations increased about 80%. This would save lives.In terms of environmental concerns, they think the cap-and-trade is good in principle, but it goes against the idea of libertarian principles. Thus, the bring up the whole idea of taxes. For taxes, it’s an incentive to not do a certain activity. They suggest to put a tax on gas. This will create an incentive consumers not to use gas that much or else buy a hybrid. At the same time, this will create an incentive to automobile makers to make more fuel-efficient cars.They also suggest to create a Toxic Release Inventory which means that companies must report to the government what hazardous chemicals they are using. This is released online. With this, each company gets a grade but you still choose in buying those products. For example, there are grades with meat: Grade A choice cut steak, or Grade A. The former is better, but you can still choose to buy the latter if you want. The same should be done with companies that produce pollution: give them grades. With cars, the authors suggest putting a sticker on each car to show how economic the mpg that vehicle is. Thus, you can see clearly how fuel efficient the car is, but you can still choose to buy a Hummer if you want. There were other creative nudges as well that you should check out.FreedomWe start off with education. The authors are for vouchers, but with a revised stipulation. They suggest that the parents puts their children on a list of the schools of their choice. With this, it requires them to research the many schools around their area. Also, the law could possibly be changed so that one cannot graduate from high school unless one submits an application to a college, even a community college. An experiment was done in Texas. The enrollment (and not just the application process) of a community college went up 45% in one year. That’s pretty impressive.With health care, they have a simple, yet interesting rule that I’m still thinking about: you should have the option to waive your right to sue. The reason why health care is so expensive is because most of the premiums are going toward malpractice suits. But if you waive your right to sue, then your insurance will be much cheaper. Now this doesn’t have to be all-or-nothing deal. If you’re going to get a major operation, you’d probably want to pay the full premium. If you going to just get your cheek swabbed, you’d probably want to waive your right to sue. Thus, insurance would be much cheaper.When it comes to marriage, it should be privatized. Thus, if you want to get married, you must follow the rules of the religion or institution. If you want the legal benefits, then you must go to the courthouse and get that figured out. It doesn’t matter if you’re gay or not. Thus, marriage can be private, and the legal benefits are public. On a side note, I have to say that this is a good solution. Think about this: how would you feel about the government getting involved in your baptism, your temple recommend, your Catechism, or your Bar Mitzvah? You don’t like it huh? So why do you like the government getting involved in something as personal and private as a marriage? That doesn’t make any sense. Therefore, the government should get out of marriages altogether. They shouldn’t be in the business of handing out marriage licenses. Only private institutions should do that.In the end, the authors conclude with some objections and their replies to them. I thought the objections were very weak.If anyone knows me, I can’t stand economics. So if I like a book about economics, that’s really saying something. This book was great. It really trains your thinking into “we must change the default position for the better” perspective. Overall, it won’t affect me. However, I believe everyone in government and business should read this. More than that, it should be required reading in political science, business, and economics classes in college. I can’t recommend this enough. It’s a great, and fast read. Plus the authors provide some humorous anecdotes as well. Hopefully, this will take on instead of holding onto the tired ideologies of liberalism or conservativism.You can check out their website and possibly offer some nudges of your own to the authors. Their blog also offers updated nudges on how to improve society. Behavioral economics is awesome!UPDATE: In their paperback expanded edition, they add another chapter of nudges that could be implemented are have already been implemented. I’ll add some that really captured my eye: * Limos for drunks. Drunk driving is a problem. That’s why a city in Michigan has a company where the drunk can rent a limo for $20. It’s fairly cheaper than a taxi (sometimes) and it makes you look classy. They tried this and drunk driving went down 34%. * Showing calories in Chain Restaurants. New York made it a law where chain restaurants had to show how much calories their food items were on the menu. Thus, you can still choose to eat the food, but you’re nudged into not eating it. * Recycling. A company in CA has made people in a certain neighborhood aware of their recycling habits. When you receive the bill, it shows how much you’re recycling compared to everyone else in the neighborhood. It turns out that the reason you recycle is because everyone else does too. * Putting a sticker in a urinal. Men usually don’t aim when they pee and so they make many messes, which causes more clean up, which means more usage of hazardous chemicals, etc. By putting a sticker inside the urinal, the men have something to aim at and it makes the clean-up much easier. They’ve tried this in a lot of countries and the results are amazing: the cleanup is less in ALL of those countries.What can I say? Nudging is awesome. It has seriously influenced my way of thinking."
54,014311526X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/17705936-frank-calberg,4,"What I learned reading the book:Who are we?- Page 33: Unrealistic optimism characterizes most people in most social categories.- Page 33: People do not like to lose. Losing / losing something makes you twice as miserable as winning / gaining something makes you happy.- Page 34 - 35 and 87: People have a status quo bias, i.e. a tendency to stick with their current situation. One of the causes of the status quo bias is lack of attention. Example: Many people do not change the screen saver default time on their computers. They stay with the standard setting / the status quo. Note that not all defaults are selected to make people's lives easier or better.Ideas / designs that help people make better healthcare decisions:- Page 26: A good way to help increase people's confidence is to remind them of a similar situation in which everything worked out well.- Page 64: Most of us are affected by eating habits of people, we eat with. So if you want to lose weight, eat with a thin person.- Page 100: Healthcare is an example of an industry that has incentive conflicts. The patient receives healthcare services that are chosen by physicians, paid for by insurance companies with pharmaceutical companies, equipment manufacturers and others taking a piece of the action.- Page 179: Under the organ donation regime ""routine removal"", the state owns the right to body parts of people, who are dead, and can remove their organs without asking anyone's permission.- Page 180: In Austria, where people have to opt out to not donate their own organs, 99% will donate their organs. In Germany, where people have to opt in to donate their organs, 12% will donate their organs.- Pages 233-234: To achieve a goal and make change happen, commit yourself to 1 specific action. Example: When you want to buy cigarettes, instead put the money into a savings account.- Page 237-238: When you want to send an angry message to someone, keep the message until the next day. The trick: When you have calmed down, you will change the words in the message or perhaps not even want to send it. You may even focus instead on learning from the situation.- Page 263: Curious cafeteria managers and students tested a trayless policy over 2 days. When trays were not offered, food and beverage waste dropped between 30% and 50%.Design that helps people make better financial decisions:- Page 65: People's investment decisions are often influenced by investment decisions of their friends.- Page 71: When people are asked what they intend to do, they become more likely to act in accordance with their answers. For example, if you ask people before a vote whether they intend to vote, you can increase the probability of their voting by 25%.- Page 81: The extended warranty is an insurance product that insurance companies need to take out of their product list. It should not exist. Why? The price is often much higher than the probability that the product will break in the particular time period.- Page 97, 117 and 158: The more choices you give people, the more help you need to provide. Good choice architecture provides structure. This is important because as choices increase, people use simplifying strategies. Example: In a paint store, organize all blue colour paints together to make it easier for people to choose.- Pages 125 and 129: In general, diversification is a great idea. For example, workers would, in general, be better of with a diversified mutual fund than with company stock. A dollar in company stock is worth less than half the value of a dollar in a mutual fund.- Page 188: Raising the tax on gasoline will eventually help people, who drive a vehicle, to use / buy more fuel efficient cars, drive less, or both.- Page 195: What if a way could be found to ensure that people see, each day, how much energy they have used?- Page 266: When airlines switch to clear seat pockets, people may forget less things on planes.Design that helps people make better education decisions:- Page 77: Learning is most likely, if people get immediate, clear feedback after each try.- Page 201: To improve education, give parents vouchers so they can choose to send their kids to any school they want.- Page 204: To help parents choose schools for their kids, post lists of average test scores on the Internet."
55,014311526X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/19022843-rita-viegas,3,"This book brings up, in fact, an interesting point - how ""choice architecture, both good and bad, is pervasive and unavoidable and it greatly affects our decisions"". To think about how small arrangement changes, as setting a default option, can change and influence the behavior of masses, makes us wonder how much of our decisions are truly our own and how much more couldn't we do for a better world and better decisions. But it rises also the question, how much entitled are we to ""help"" others make ""better"" decisions, even if we (think that we) know that on their own the majority would likely choose a worse option? But then again, who can really be sure of what better is? (No matter the amount of scientific background). Should people be fully allowed to try and make their own mistakes, or wouldn't some more help to make the better decision be appretiated?Still, I felt the book focused too much on the US use case, US laws and processes, which made me lose interest in some points. Also, although the main argument was definitely interesting, it was too much approached from a state/corporation point of view and I believe the book would benefit (at least for my personal interest) from incorporating some more practical use cases for the common person more related to day to day interactions. Nevertheless, a quite interesting topic to think and challenge."
56,014311526X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/875812-madhuri,3,"It started out well as it tried to build upon the system 1 and 2 idea from Daniel Kahneman and made it more palatable for an average reader. However, it drones on about too many similar examples of choice architecture and is frankly a drag. The end is interesting again with its Long list of Nudge examples, so perhaps I am ending with a slightly more generous rating. A glaring gap in the entire narrative is any exploration of why nudges fail to well, nudge, people and when they become a nagging paternalism which people dislike.As someone who has tried many nudge based apps to chose the life my “econ” recommends, I cannot ignore the fact that nudges work only for first three days, sometimes not even that long. Immédiately after, I fall back into my homosapien patterns of behaviour. I would have liked to understand why that happens. Overall, a bit shallow exploration of a very interesting topic."
57,014311526X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/76382821-sean-paterson,3,"Nudge introduces the idea of Liberal Paternalism, the idea that while free choice is good, there is no harm in nudging people towards decisions that may be beneficial to them. Core concepts:- Defaults are powerful - think about the last time you signed up for a free trial, it's likely after a month you also got signed up for a paid subscription service. The default made the decision for you, hence defaults should be well considered.- Status quo bias is strong - linking to the previous point, once an option has been set it builds inertia making it hard to change.- People favour today over tomorrow - if presented with the option to increase your pension contribution the majority will not increase it, they want the money now. If presented with the option to pay more tomorrow, tomorrow being the next time an event occurs e.g. payrise, promotion many more people sign up.- Mandated disclosure can be a strong nudge - a law was passed in the US in the wake of Chernobyl for nuclear plant operators to disclose the quantities of the hazardous material they store/produce. The intention was to provide relevant agencies e.g. environment agency, local fire service information should their be a disaster. An unintented consequence of the law was that now nuclear plants were benchmarking themselves against each other, creating a contest of it, no-one wanted to be the worst polluter. A similar idea could be applied to greenhouse gas emissions."

Definitely a recommended read for people into psychology and economy. The main downside is that half of the book is for US readers. In Estonia we already nudge people with easy tax collection and returns - Thaler even enumerates some countries with nudge-like programs, but no Estonia nowhere. That is just bad research, mister Nobel-laureate!"
59,014311526X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4720039-nathan,4,"This book has been on my list for years, but I'm glad I finally read it. It definitely has pieces that are dated, but it's a worthwhile read. I enjoyed the concept of ""libertarian paternalism"" which the author's define as choosing a default that ""tries to influence choices in a way that will make choosers better off, as judged by themselves."" Essentially, it's Milton Friedman's ideas behind free-to-choose."
